PHOTO: AFP A total of 34 artificial intelligence startups were acquired in the first quarter of this year, more than twice the amount of activity in the year-ago quarter, according to the research firm CB Insights. Tech giants seeking to reinforce their leads in artificial intelligence or make up for lost ground have been the most aggressive buyers. Alphabet Inc’s Google has acquired 11 AI startups since 2012, the most of any firm, followed by Apple Inc, Facebook Inc and Intel Corp, respectively, according to CB Insights. The companies declined to comment on their acquisition strategies. A spokesman for Apple did confirm the company’s recent purchase of Lattice Data, a startup that specializes in working with unstructured data. The first quarter also saw one of the largest deals to date as Ford Motor Co invested $1 billion in Argo AI, founded by former executives on self-driving teams at Google and Uber Technologies Inc. The next revolution: artificial intelligence Startups are looking to go deep on applications of artificial intelligence to specific fields, such as health and retail, industry observers say, rather than compete directly with established companies. “What you will see is very big players will build platform services, and startup communities will migrate more to applied intelligent apps,” said Matt McIlwain, managing director of Madrona Venture Group. Healthcare startup Forward, for example, is using artificial intelligence to crunch data that can inform doctors’ recommendations. “For people who really want to focus on core AI problems, it makes a lot of sense to be in bigger companies,” said Forward Chief Executive Officer Adrian Aoun, who previously worked at Google. “But for folks who really want to prove a new field, a new area, it makes more sense to be separate.” Artificial intelligence companies that do remain independent field a steady stream of suitors: Matthew Zeiler, chief executive of Clarifai, which specializes in image and video recognition, said he has been approached about a dozen times by prospective acquirers since starting the company in late 2013. Toyota to use Nvidia’s AI technology for self-driving cars Clarifai’s pitch to customers such as consumer goods company Unilever Plc and hotel search firm Trivago is bolstered by its narrow focus on artificial intelligence. “(Google) literally competes with almost every company on the planet,” Zeiler said. “Are you going to trust them with being your partner for AI?” Tech giants have been locked in a bidding war for academics specializing in artificial intelligence. Startups rarely have the capital to compete, but a company with a specialized mission can win over recruits, said Vic Gundotra, chief executive of AliveCor, which makes an AI-driven portable heart monitor. “They say, ‘I want to come here and work on a project that might save my mother’s life,’” Gundotra said.

PhoneDog Android And Me TodaysiPhone NEW Call T-Mobile at (855) 668-8976 TmoNews Unofficial T-Mobile Blog, News, Videos, Articles and more Navigation Home Submit News 700MHz LTE map Upcoming Phones HOT TOPICS: Samsung Galaxy Note 7 LG V20 Google Pixel Extended Range LTE Android 7.0 Nougat You are here: Home > T-Mobile offers to pay for Verizon switchers’ phones, two-lines-for-one deal also coming T-Mobile offers to pay for Verizon switchers’ phones, two-lines-for-one deal also coming May 24, 2017 Alex Wagner 92 Comments Yesterday T-Mobile CEO John Legere teased that T-Mo had multiple announcements coming up, and today a couple of them have been made. Starting May 31st, T-Mobile will kick off its #GetOutoftheRed promotion to help Verizon customers switch to T-Mo. Verizon customers in good standing with their carrier can get their iPhone or Google Pixel paid off by T-Mobile when they switch to T-Mobile and sign up for T-Mobile One, and they can keep their existing device. The phones that qualify for this promotion include the iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, Google Pixel, and Google Pixel XL. T-Mobile says that these devices were selected because “phones need certain software to be globally compatible, and some phones don’t yet have that software.” Magenta does say that it’s working with unspecified device makers to make more phones compatible with this promotion. Additionally, Verizon customers switching to T-Mobile must add T-Mo’s Premium Device Protection Plus insurance plan to their device to qualify. This insurance plan costs $15 per month and includes protection against loss, theft, and accidental damage, McAfee ID Protection, McAfee Content Protection, and other features. T-Mobile says that it’ll pay Verizon customers that take advantage of this promotion with a digital prepaid MasterCard card that typically arrives within 15 days. While this #GetOutoftheRed promotion is focused on Verizon customers (because VZW phones are unlocked), T-Mobile is doing something for AT&T and Sprint subscribers, too. Starting on May 31st, AT&T and Sprint customers can switch to T-Mobile and get their existing device paid off when they buy a new phone from T-Mobile on EIP. And unlike Carrier Freedom, those customers won’t be forced to trade in their existing device. Finally, T-Mobile says that starting tomorrow, May 25th, T-Mobile One customers with at least two voice lines can get two additional lines of service for the price of one. The cost of the second line will be offset by a bill credit.

(J²) Right… I’d found that the system doesn’t consistently apply these. TylerCameron Yeah their billng process it’s horrible Steve_NYC So true. I actually considered moving to the T-Mobile One Plan even though it would have cost me more money, just to get away from the insanity of their bill credit process. I finally got things straightened out, but I am sure it will be a problem in the future. It’s gotten to the point that I think it’s deliberate. Mike I had a free line from November that I had to call in every month. to get credit. They finally fixed it to be automatic this month. best part I got extra bill credits for months since last November and my bill is now negative so I didn’t have to make a payment this month. Al William So in order to get the free line, you need to have at least a total of 4 voice lines? Corey Jalette You need to have 2 voice lines to get this promo, which you get 2 lines for the price of 1. So in total you end up woth 4 lines, 1st 2 have to be voice, the 2 you’re adding could be whatever you want. So if you’re on the 2/100 plan right now if you add 2 tablets it would be 120 a month (20 per tablet but 1 is free) or if you add 2 voice lines it would be 140 (40 for adding a 3rd line then 4th is free) Al William Thanks for the clarification! So minimum 2 voice lines and the other 2 could be voice or data. I just wish they get rid of these bill credits. Sometimes it’s such a nightmare. Corey Jalette It can be yes but that’s how pretty much everything is done. Just like they had a free line deal in march it’s listed on my account as a free line on us but I still get the charge on my bill, but it’s auto credited. The only time it wasn’t was the first month because I added it before the end of the billing cycle. Cost $49 but they also credited my account manually that one time. Haven’t had an issue since. AWasserberg7 This article mentions Magenta. What *is* Magenta? Is that some cute term of affection for T-Mobile? kev2684 Are you serious? It’s their brand color. VZW = Red AT&T = Blue T-Mobile = Magenta Sprint = Yellow Nobody Special Cricket (umm, green) lol Genecio MetroPCS= Purple Black&Orange= Boost The Waz Just confirmed by T-Force that if you have a 2 for 100 plus a “this ones on us promo” giving you total 3 lines, you will lose your free line if you take advantage of the promotion of 2 for 1 tomorrow. They stated that they have to move you to a different Tmobile One plan….makes no sense since there is only 1 plan…… Corey Jalette This is ONLY if you’re adding a voice line people. If you’re adding tablet/smartwatch/mobile Internet plans that doesn’t affect your phone plan promo of 2/100. Corey Jalette Add 2 tablets with unlimited data on your plan for $20/month. They frequently have a free tablet promo with qualifying data plan. Snatch those up and you’re golden. The Waz Yes this will affect both. IF you have the 2 for 100 and the “this one is on us” free line….you will lose both promotions…confirmed with t force and John directly. Andrew Singleton the reason is that you’re on a 2-line promotional plan paying $20 less than everyone else, and you’ve added a line. since you’re unable to add another line on that plan, you are forced to switch to a 3+ line plan, and that will cause activation-related discounts to drop. Corey below is correct, because internet lines (tablet, watch, syncup drive) are their own rate plan and don’t affect your voice configuration. J Gerard Yeah! Let’s switch to T-MOBILE because we want to not be able to make phone calls half the time, and not have a signal to look something up when we actually need it. Oh yeah, and to not be able to upload pictures of something fun that we’re doing until we’re at home connected to WiFi later that night or the next day. Before any of you “magenta” fans TRIES to defend them… I’ve been a Verizon customer for about 12 years except for 6 months last year, when I switched because of crappy TMobile’s cheap prices and convincing (misleading) advertising. It was HORRIBLE. I used to get pissed and call them to ask why I could never get a signal. After 6 months, I finally admitted to myself that it was a ridiculous mistake and switched back to The Red! NEVER any issues with Verizon’s service. Never. “Magenta” is only good at talking a big game. If anyone’s thinking about switching to T-Mobile, DON’T DO IT. They are the worst. Go to any other carrier. Doesn’t have to be Verizon. kev2684 It’s all about location, location, location. Just because your area is bad, doesn’t mean everybody will have the same problem as you. J Gerard … EXCEPT that I live in a city. Oh, and Verizon’s coverage is flawless here. I happen to also know (through friends) that AT&T and Sprint are good here, too. Oh, but it’s all about location, location, location. Weak argument. T-Mobile just sucks! There’s a reason it’s so CHEAP! Austin8480 … OK JGerard. Next time, PLEASE use all capital letters to truly get YOUR point across. What I find PATHETIC is that you are a die hard Verizon turd in a TMobile blog. Oh wait, I meant Verizon TURD. Forgot to emphasize that. NOBODY in this room gives a flying —- about your opinion because you slummed it for 6 months and went to Magenta and it was as big of a mistake as…well, I will let you figure it out. J Gerard You were so busy typing a 3rd grade level post that you forgot to make a point. Here’s one for you: T-Mobile is inferior to almost all other carriers. Austin8480 If T-Mobile is so inferior, why are you even giving this blog the time of day. Are you upset that no kids want to hop in your van and eat your chocolate, so you are going to take out your frustrations on the inferior wireless network? thepanttherlady *Tip* Starbursts don’t melt :D theseanteam The hate is strong in this one. Those six months must have really scarred you or something. When you say almost all other carriers, which ones are you referring to? There are only four major carriers after all. And actually, that argument about location is a pretty strong one. T-Mobile’s network is the fastest in many locations, but can be really poor (or even non-existent) in others. The same can be said about everyone–including Verizon. Every carrier has their strong and weak areas. For someone to deny such would have to either be 1) ignorant 2) biased beyond belief or 3) troll. yankeesusa Yea, it still amazes me that people complain about coverage and then lump everyone else in america as having the same coverage, like we all live in the same area. Oh well. People never learn. I’m just happy tmobile works for me and that my data speeds are the highest iv’e ever had. At my house i’m getting close to 100megs almost every time. But hey i guess that’s not good enough for some. thepanttherlady I moved to Crestline a couple of weeks ago. No service. :'( kev2684 I had to google where that is lol :D Yeah it’s rural Ohio but I suppose Band 12 is coming? I’ve seen sightings on Band 12 in Jacksonville, FL lately as well as other parts of the country it’s currently not available. They’re probably working on it at the moment. thepanttherlady Sorry, I should have been more specific. It’s Crestline, CA. I made the same mistake when I called a county office but only Googled Crestline. Guy was really confused as they don’t have my address there. Took me a minute to figure out he was in Ohio. LOL kev2684 You’re literally live in a mountain! Views must be spectacular! thepanttherlady Some of them really are. :) Zacamandapio Verizon here we gooooooo. By the way, we went to Lake Gregory. :) thepanttherlady I’m literally 7 minutes from there. Went there 2 weekends ago to check it out. Water level is a little on the low side. Met a couple that same night that said they’d drained it for some reason and cited “water politics” because I guess the locals aren’t happy about it. Drove up from the Hesperia side this past Saturday and got to see Lake Silverwood. Will have to check it out this summer. Nice drive but hated seeing so many dead trees. :( ETA: I had to get Frontier (Verizon) internet so I could actually use my cell phone. What really sucks is: 1. I literally just got a hotspot through T-Mobile a month ago when they were offering another free line. It’s unusable. 2. I now HAVE to buy phones that have WiFi calling. Blah! thepanttherlady From the day we moved in 5/7: http://imgur.com/UQHsBZF http://imgur.com/t9Z64Q3 http://imgur.com/tm7ReiU And the lake :) http://imgur.com/1YUxwV9 http://imgur.com/tnGMcoq http://imgur.com/zhY16YK http://imgur.com/eaXr58H http://imgur.com/JO9BHJW Sharti24 Who will you be switching to? thepanttherlady I’m not switching. Yet anyway. I lose service 1/2 way up (or down) the mountain so I’ll probably have to get a very cheap pre-paid service/phone for emergencies in case I break down. Not all turnouts have a call box. I still work in Orange County and T-Mobile works fine most places I go. If it starts to be a problem then I’ll have to consider my options. Sharti24 Have tmobile send you a range extender. Not the one you plug into the internet but the one that has two boxes that boosts signal Berzerker Yeah, if you live in Bumblefuck, Montana, don’t switch. Greg Piller Shoot, I just signed up in Montana for TMO. Guess I’m “bumblefucked” lol. I have traveled to every state and been in EVERY U.S. major city multiple times living in every timezone and 11 states. My goodness you have a warped idea of “crap state”. Montana is paradise partner. You have to be from either NYC or California with that f’ed up mentality. He is right & not just in “crap” places but a lot of places like Chicago, IL where I was born and raised. Verizon & AT&T ARE better, Considerably better now in most places but TMO is gaining on them quickly & may reach parity in a few years. When THAT happens if TMO is still competitive, one would have to be a lunatic to stay with AT&T or Verizon. Berzerker …lol. I never said Montana was a “crap state.” It’s the easiest thing to think of when you think of wilderness where you won’t have service for miles. I could have picked a bunch of states, but Montana has, IIRC, the smallest habitation of humans to state ratio, behind Alaska of course. Easy target. Greg Piller To me 4 lines for $120 with TMO is enough of a savings to ditch AT&T. Verizon & AT&T and some of their customers can be arrogant & I think John Legere is one helluva CEO. I can pick up a burner sim with AT&T’s Cricket when I travel a bit and use it until TMO improves in Montana & then it’s sianara to ATT. Happy to be back with TMO. I was formerly a customer since the Voicestream days but when I moved west couldn’t keep them. Their coverage improvement in Montana & the nation as a whole with him at the helm has been nothing short of INCREDIBLE. I hope if the Sprint deal happens Legere is retained as CEO. mreveryphone Hummm… I travel the country for my job and I rarely have issues with T-Mobile… Is it perfect?? No… But no carrier is.. Verizon worked out for you, that’s great. T-Mobile works for millions, that’s also great. But this butt hurt rant is ridiculous and pure comedy! J Gerard “butt hurt rant” is kind of a dumb way to describe what I’m saying. But, I’ll consider the source, eh? Do you know ANYONE who thinks that T is better than V? Nope. So, the difference between us is that I choose to have a better service and I’m willing to pay a little more for it. You are cheap, and you’re willing to have an inferior service because it’s cheaper. That’s it. You know Verizon is better than T-Mobile Francisco Peña Anyone switching carriers should NEVER just switch without taking advantage of the initial return period. I was with VZW for yrs myself. Loved it, with my UDP that was grandfathered. Even went through one wave of price hikes to stay. Then the wife wanted a non-feature phone, and the price hike for her would have boosted out then $108 monthly payment, to $160 once we got a basic data plan, her line access fee (joke) and a new phone. So I looked into TMo. I purposely bought a phone the yr before that worked with Tmo and VZW (moto X DE) and signed up for one line of TMo, switched my Moto to Tmo and reactivated an older LTE phone I had back on VZW. Then I went around for a week doing speed tests everywhere I went. Stuck in traffic? speed test. Both side by side on the seat. Mall? yup, side by side in my hands. Work? yup. Home? yup. I hated VZW at work because my Moto could never get a signal inside the building, which caused my battery to die quickly each day. TMo? got a strong signal. Home, both were weak, but about the same. Driveway? same. So after 10 days, I went in to TMo and switched. Got 2 new phones (had a deal on G4s then) and was spending $140 for 2 lines/10GB each (was the $100/2L/10GB deal) with those phones. Has it been perfect? no. Has it been enough to switch back? no. After some finagling, got a $70 plan with 6GB each for 2 lines. Then have gotten a free line on top of that.. so now I pay $130 for 3 lines, with 6GB each (two don’t come close, mine has Stash so I’m good) and 2 new G6 phones. So for the price, its awesome. Can I deal with some poor service on the outskirts of town? sure. Oh, that Moto X? got it on the 3rd line… theseanteam I don’t think anyone has ever claimed that T-Mobile has better coverage than Verizon, but the point is it has the same quality of coverage in many places. Where I live, T-Mobile has equal coverage and faster speeds. It might not be like that for you, as everyone’s experience will vary. I’m sure if others suffered with bad service, they would switch carriers as well. But your superiority complex is just silly. mreveryphone I know plenty of people that think T-Mobile is better than VW… And I know people that think the opposite, it depends where you live. The service was inferior for you but not for me by any means… I appreciate the cheap name calling, I’ll be cheap all day if it means saving money but getting better service FOR ME… I’ve had service in buildings where others on VW had 0, I’ve smoked people on VW in data speeds tests so I’ll be cheap all day long!! Lol Vazaha There’s an unwritten agreement when you join T-Mobile that you will refrain from living in or going to crappy places. If you live in a decent place T-Mobile is fine. If T-Mobile sucks in your area, you know why :). Vazaha But seriously, I’m always envious of ATT and V when I go to crap places. tranceformer978 Why are you going to crap places? Melissa Cardenas Well what the hell are you doing on this website then? This is a T-Mobile forum obviously most people on here have T-Mobile and they Happy with it so they ain’t gonna listen to you . T-Mobile did not work in my old house so i had Verizon. Now in my new house Verizon don’t work at all and i had to get T-Mobile again because T-Mobile works here fine , So no carrier is perfect. It all depends on location!! J Gerard I get tech news alerts on my phone and things like this come up sometimes and I click on them. I believe that’s allowed! Apparently, what’s not allowed here is proper grammar and punctuation. I almost had to have your post translated in order to read it, but I figured it out eventually. Where did you go to school? Melissa Cardenas What ever im in a hurry and didn’t have time to spell check .But seriously don’t change the subject i don’t get why people like you come talk trash on a T-Mobile forum. ?? Makes no sense haha . And what ever im PRETTY sure you understood fine what i wrote in my first comment. Bull that you almost had to get it translated. Omar Boyer Melisa hes just being an idiot haha i understood perfectly well your first post. And i see they gave u some thumbs up on that first post so others also understood you no need to translate it . Ignore this lowlife with nothing to do. If he wants to stop making an Azz out of himself he should just block the notifications he gets from here. Melissa Cardenas i have better things to worry about ;) omar. And like you said he should just turn off notifications from here then. Eric Harlow Don’t give J Gerard the satisfaction in getting a reaction out of you and allow him to control the situation don’t dumb down to his level Eric Harlow Get off Melissa Cardenas butt about grammar here. This is a forum! Not a college message board or an college English Composition course. T-mobile has improved drastically within the last 3 years. T-mobile works for me out here in San Diego and in my future home in Missoula, Montana. I have mental disabilities that I got serving in The US Navy for twenty years and I dislike your comments towards Melissa Cardenas. This is a T-mobile fan website to discuss peacefully about T-mobile, so get your BIG RED DUMB AND DUMBER ASS OUT OF HERE. Andrew Addison You just made my night with that bomb diggity comment towards that boozo the snow clown filled with stuffy nose, trying to come off as English weirdo professor correcting people on their grammar fool there Bro. Is this guy here serious right now? He had no reason to talk down to someone like that and also talk down on the finest company/carrier, advising everyone to stay away from the best carrier/company which that one being T-Mobile-MetroPCS. We will forever be way Better in USA than any other carrier would have been. Eric Harlow OOH REALLY!!! HOW AWESOME!! Glad I made your night! Haze1nut English is a 3rd language for me, behind French and Portuguese. Correct my grammar for me, will you. It obviously makes you feel superior. Ascertion You think everyone that switches to T-Mobile can’t “Make calls half of the time”? You’re out of your mind! Tony Chen agreed, t mobile has gained millions of customers each quarter. if the drop calls were so bad why would t mobile gain 100% of new customers agaIN? another blockbuster quarter by t mobile. moonoverparma Funny, I’ve never had a problem. Nobody Special Several years ago i had a verizon phone (when the iphone’s came out they were the only one that were selling them with unlimited data at that time) and i had T-Mobile flip phone that i was using to make international calls. I have to admit, Verizon was more reliable than T-Mobile during my cell phone usage. I chose T-mobile over Verizon because of many reasons…. but it was never due to their coverage, because their coverage was horrible… but since then their coverage has improved. But i switched primarily due to the inexpensive international calls. That was a deal breaker for me, i was content with the terrible coverage with anticipation that they would improve their service. and with Verizon i was paying around $89 dollars for unlimited data and text and 450 minutes of voice calls. my tmobile line (from what i can remember) was around $78 dollars for unlimited talk and text and data. But fastforward to today, I have 5 Unlimited Everything (data/text/voice) lines with unlimited international calling (mobile+landlines) and international text for a low cost of $110 plus taxes and fees. Believe me i checked, Verizon or AT&T have nothing in comparison to what i have with T-Mobile. And i am not bashing you or Verizon at all, Verizon does have a more reliable coverage area but in the end i sided with T-Mobile over Verizon. If Verizon ever came up with incredible deals like T-Mobile has been doing almost every month i wouldnt turn down a great opportunity. RECAP: Verizon “Better Coverage” T-Mobile “Better Prices” It all boils down to what are you comfortable with. Im comfortable with crappy coverage. And My T-Mobile calls do drop often, but what i do is (i press redial) GOTCHA :) Gust OK so here’s the deal. In the morning when you wake up if you have T-Mobile you have to get up take a shower have breakfast shave go outside of your house in other to make a phone call. If you have AT&T or Verizon in the morning when you wake up you can reach for your cell phone and make a phone call. It is that simple. But you know what I have T-Mobile because over one year it saves me about $200 as compared to AT&T or Verizon. So I put up with the crap! Timothy Poplaski T-Mobile supports WiFi calling. You don’t have home WiFi? DM725 How do you not have wifi calling enabled? Maybe you need to buy a phone from the last 2 years… (My Motorola Nexus 6 Supported Wifi Calling….) Phone Guy All lies. So funny, yet sad. yankeesusa LOL, not everyone lives where you live and have bad coverage with tmobile. 4 years ago i would have never used tmobile, now i no longer have sprint and got rid of my verizon line because tmobile is great for me where i live and work. I just recently drove across florida,georgia,nc and tennesse and had no issues. I was able to test it side by side with an att phone and the whole time both phones had coverage except up in the smokies near newfound gap where no one has signal. Don’t lump everyone in the same pile just because it doesn’t work for you. DM725 LoL, where the hell do you live? eanfoso The only one after verizon is at&t because we know that sprint and us cellular sucks more than t mobile Andrew Singleton T-Mobile has the lowest churn rate (people trying it and leaving) of all carriers. Could you please explain why? J Gerard Ha! Oh, I promise you I don’t feel like an idiot surrounded by people who work themselves up into a breathless rant trying to defend a crappy service. gmo8492 Crappy for who exactly, churn has gone down to record lows and T-Mobile has over 73 million subs, so if it doesn’t work out you can switch. Brad C It’s not for everyone, but has worked damn well for me for 12yrs.. I *actually* tried Verizon a few months ago, and came back after two weeks after awful LTE performance JG You’re cracking me up reading your comments! I have TMo and put up with their spotty coverage because I’m paying less per month staying with them. I can admit that. There is alot I enjoy about TMo, but dropped calls and dead zones IS a reality. I have a band 12 phone in metro PHX. Not sure why others feel the need to berail someone who doesn’t agree with them just for argument’s sake. Timothy Poplaski Because you aren’t saying, “Bad coverage in PHX”, you’re saying “Bad coverage”. I can drive for at least an hour in any direction and have solid coverage. It all depends on where you live, and you’re phone. Even phones with band 12 won’t all have the same results because some phones get better reception than others. So, I won’t even argue about coverage in PHX. Never been there, likely never will, so it just doesn’t matter to me. My excellent coverage probably doesn’t matter to you. It’s all about where you use your phone. navi harriram Dude you could of tested the network out on a $10 weekly plan or $3 daily. You don’t buy cell phone service every day so do the work. The sales rep just wants a commission check so they’ll say anything to get you to switch. That’s why I don’t work for wireless companies anymore. Too much bull to deal with yankeesusa Not everyone is defending a company that may or may not work depending on where you live. But many people actually do research and pick a company that specifically works for your needs depending on your area. I had verizon and sprint before tmobile and i have never ever gotten the speeds i get now not to mention i have great coverage ‘WHERE I LIVE”, YOU SEE, that’s the important thing, i researched and made sure it worked for me. I don’t just blindly select a company just because their commercial says so. Screamin That’s strange because T-Mobile has been #1 in customer service AND satisfaction for well over 2 years now… and yes, that includes coverage. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) I am thinking about switching to Verizon due to poor coverage. In San Diego area I get one to bars. I moved from Minnesota and T-mobile coverage in MN is excellent there with all bars. In San Diego it’s very poor in some areas. When iPhone 8 is release I am switching to Verizon. I love T-mobile plans but coverage in my area is poor. Sharti24 Agreed. On base (32nd street) forget about tmobile coverage. sprint excels on 32nd. go over to corando island its even worse! just throw your phone over board. no tmobile coverage on the air base at all. im using an iphone 6s Band 12 which is deployed in SD yankeesusa I agree, if in your area tmobile is not good and is affecting productivity or just not letting you use your phone to its fullest your’e better off changing. I have great coverage where I live and work and when i travel over 99% of the time i have no issues. But i got my wife on cricket which is att so for the times where tmobile may not get signal i have the att towers just in case. I’m on an old grandfathered single line plan that allows work discount so i’m keeping as long as i can. Screamin Sometimes it’s not always the cell coverage causing the issue, but the phone itself, especially if it’s an older device that supports fewer cell bands. With T-Mobile’s latest acquirement of spectrum you can expect a huge improvement in cell signal, both in range and structure penetration, within the year. Of course you can switch if you want, but they’re only going to get better. They’ve more than doubled the coverage in the past 2 years and have just as much coverage as Verizon with a network that’s actually futureproof unlike the other guys. DM725 Agreed, I know people that don’t realize they are using a phone without band 12, that doesn’t have wifi calling or Volte support, and has an extremely weak antenna. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) My phone is iPhone 7 and not an old device: Andrew Singleton if you hold an iphone 7 next to a galaxy s8, the s8 will have more bars every time. that’s due to a more powerful signal on galaxies and the fact that bars don’t mean anything with low-frequency spectrum. Patel Nisha You couldn’t pay me to use a iPhone . And why would I switch Verizon to T-unmobile. So I can have a sub par data connection with hardly any coverage…. Andrew Why are you on TmoNews, then? Andrew Addison Lol I was just thinking the exact same thing. Lol DM725 I’m sorry you live in a place that T-Mobile doesn’t prioritize. Here in NY, we have no such issues. Andrew Singleton the offer is also good for pixels, and you don’t know anything about the network. in 1 year, verizon will wish it had t-mobile’s network.

Editorial Director at Mobile Nations, analyst at iMore, video and podcast host, you can follow him @reneritchie on Snapchat, Instagram, and Twitter. Google has Tensor cores. Could Apple soon have AI cores of its own? Apple is already driving mobile silicon in a way few if any other companies have been able to keep up with. Now, a new report claims Apple will be using its considerable chipset chops to accelerate artificial intelligence as well. Mark Gurman, writing for Bloomberg: Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way the company's devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence -- such as facial recognition and speech recognition. If true, this should surprise no one. Arguably, Apple's biggest advantage in computing right now is that the company custom crafts the complete stack, from atom to bit to pixel. That includes an ever-increasing amount of custom silicon. A few years ago, Apple offloaded motion tracking from its main A-series system-on-a-chip to an M-series sensor fusion hub. A few years later, it added onboard natural language parsing to the M-series to enable "Hey, Siri!" in as power-efficient a way as possible. The latest A-series, A10 Fusion, combines two high-efficiency cores with two high-performance cores to try to eek out as much battery life as possible while pushing pixels and bits as fast as possible. Anything that makes sense to offload to increase efficiency and performance, you can bet Apple is working on offloading. Including and especially AI, since it's such a hot topic these days. While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice recognition, competitors have since been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon's Echo and Google's Home digital assistants. This part reads oddly to me. Nothing against Mark, but it's a particularly bad narrative pervasive across U.S. media. Google Home is a single product. Echo is a growing line of similar, home-based products. Apple has pushed Siri from iPhone to and through iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, Mac, CarPlay, HomeKit, and accessories like AirPods. Apple has also expanded Siri across dozens of languages, including Chinese, Hebrew, and Arabic, as well as dozens of regions. It's fair to say no other vendor has yet been as aggressive as Apple in deploying virtual assistants across product lines or to customers around the world. "Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI," said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst and co-founder of venture capital firm Loup Ventures. "At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence." This also reads oddly to me. Almost everything Apple does already requires AI. AI is going to be everywhere in computing the same way math is everywhere. There's nothing unique about special projects like augmented reality or cars. Machine learning, computer vision, and related technologies are already powering everything from battery efficiency to photo tagging, sequential inference to computational photography. Just because Google made its sound like they invented AI on the I/O 2016 stage, and it's now parroted alongside AR and VR the way mobile/social/local was a decade ago, doesn't mean companies like Apple (and Google) haven't been working on it for years. What's interesting isn't that the big tech giants are working on it; it's how they will use it to solve real problems in the information and computer space and, in Apple's case, how it will solve those problems while protecting our security and privacy at the same time. Reader comments Like Tensor for humans: Apple reportedly working on AI cores 8 Comments View All Comments Log In to Comment Register Sort by Date Sort by Rating coffeemike "Google Home is a single product. Echo is growing line of similar, home based products. Apple has pushed Siri from iPhone to and through iPad, Apple Watch, Apple TV, Mac, CarPlay, HomeKit, and accessories like AirPods." ... except that Google's Assistant is available across mobile devices (Android, iOS), within Chrome I believe, not just through the Home product. And Alexa is present and capable on the Echo products as well as through the Alexa app, the Amazon app, the Fire stick, presumably the Fire TV, and so on. It's a valid comparison, correct? And - pardon my ignorance - is Siri present in Airpods independent of the phone? 0 7 hours ago Reply bhatech Yeah smh at google home is a single product. Hello !!! google now, assistant, voice recognition is everywhere. 0 5 hours ago Reply cuttheredwire The AirPods have a tap for Siri feature. Viticci mentioned he uses them for Siri in his latest podcast. "While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice recognition, competitors have since been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon's Echo and Google's Home digital assistants." Rene's point is that the media forgets that Siri is in so many places. Apple has been aggressively implementing Siri, but you would never know it by news coverage. He does *not* claim that Google is less aggressive or in fewer places in any way at all. 0 2 hours ago Reply bhatech News coverage is about how Siri sucks, no one complains that's not in many places. They complain because it's bad compared to competition. 0 2 hours ago Reply bhatech "This part reads oddly to me. Nothing against Mark, but it's a particularly bad narrative pervasive across U.S. media." Nothing against Rene, but it's just pro apple narrative from you, Gruber and few others on everything Apple does. At least Mark is honest even though he loves Apple products. Pretty much everyone is right Siri lacks and is just dumb compared to google. And, yeah Google does it many languages as well if that's your defense for whatever little Siri can do. On the positive side, I'm excited to see what Apple comes up and see how it can compete with Google given it has no other option other than pushing privacy story and how it can do everything on device. They would love to be like google but given the lack of their ability we have to see how well they can do this AI stuff on device and keeping privacy in mind. "Just because Google made its sound like they invented AI on the I/O 2016 stage, and it's now parroted alongside AR and VR the way mobile/social/local was a decade ago, doesn't mean companies like Apple (and Google) haven't been working on it for years." Really? You are so hurt on this? Even on MacBreak weekly you brought this up. This is what Apple does for pretty much everything in their keynote. Every feature they talk as if they invented it even though it's on competitor's device for years. 0 5 hours ago Reply cuttheredwire They all try to make it sound like they invented it. Heck, people have forgotten there were smart phones before 2007. There were, but far fewer people had them. As for the narrative, I am seeing a lot of criticism on the media praising the Echo and viewing the Apple Watch as a flop. Yet I've read on multiple places that the watch sells more in volume and for a profit while the Echo is sold for a loss and fewer are sold. Numbers are not released, so I'm going to dig for the articles (but I believe Above Avalon was one of them). What is interesting is the way the Echo has caught the attention of the media. It's different and it is functional. There is plenty to write about since it is so open (too open for my tastes). The hardware is getting refreshed at a good pace too. As for Siri, yep, it needs work. Actually, it needs a way for me to tell it that, no, it did not understand me. That's really all I want… that and to have more fluid conversations. 0 2 hours ago Reply themacbuddha How Apple approaches the digital assistant is predicated on these factors: Security/Privacy, Ubiquity, and Extensibility. Security/Privacy---Data storage and manipulation is best served on the local device when it can be and only stored and manipulated on the cloud if it can be done so at the deepest level. For a photo to be synced to and manipulated in the iCloud and for Apple to do so having excluded their ability to hold any encryption key protecting it is a very, very, very tall order. There is a reason they hired Jonathan Zdziarski. The call to crop and apply a filter needs to happen on all devices AND the cloud without compromising privacy. Keeping customer data encrypted at these levels on their servers is not in Google's best interest or even their wheelhouse. Google doesn't talk the security game. Therefor they keep themselves open to running fast and loose with your data. That means ample blood in the water for any number of bad players to go after. The trope of Google User Data Anonymization is prime for failure. Not a matter of "if" but "when". The continued treatment of end user devices as dumb terminals and the shoving of ever more data and processing power to the cloud leads to laziness on the OEM's part. We've seen this battle before. One can only assume that Samsung is not simply glomming Viv to things but actually following through on the promise of Android as a true open source solution. Don't Hold Your Breathe. Reports that Apple is creating custom silicon for managing digital dossiers should not surprise anyone. Nor should the fact that they are telling Qualcomm to take a hike now be a surprise. That they added Intel as a supplier for cellular modems is quite telling - they are going to make their own modems too. 0 25 sec ago Reply themacbuddha Ubiquity---Though it might seem obvious to most the scale of this can not be understated. The "Internet of Things" is akin to the "World Wide Web" in my mind. Tremendous promise turns into absolute morass of pain. To put some perspective to something that was mentioned in an earlier post regarding the Amazon Echo line: There is plenty of talk about how wonderful Tesla is doing. Yet the Apple Watch has generated more unit sales then Echo and more revenue then Tesla. Apple Watch is primed to leap forward this fall. This is not to belabor those companies' successes but to illustrate that the reach of Apple products and there for Siri (or whatever the overall solution is deemed to be called) exemplifies how far it can go. Apple Watch can be viewed as an accessory to iPhone. And what of any Siri Speaker (hate that name) product. What of a newer wifi system that integrates and amplifies Siri and HomeKit. What of CarPlay and other integrated auto systems. Project Titan is aptly named but probably a **** lot closer than most think to producing fruit. Extensibility---Echo has both language support and security working against it. Amazon is predominately US company. However one must appreciate that it is Walmart and their ilk that Amazon is truly competing against. Don't undersell that. Google's bread and butter on the other hand is in advertising. And they will ride that pony straight in to the ground. Their forte is on the server. Their greatest success found almost exclusively within a web browser. Again...Advertising and the World Wide Web! When combined, the most hated concept in existence. They will have a difficult time assailing that wall. I foresee a lot of WTF results that is far worse the bane of Siri now. And where might Apple fit in this? Yes, yes, yes! Fluid conversation is nice but natural language is better suited. In fact it is absolutely imperative. And never mind about just simple language support. What about muddled accents and mixed languages - Spanglish anyone? Recognize the extent third party support for Siri introduces a set of complexities far, far, far beyond the chicken scratch/Graffiti approach of Google Assistant and Alexa, and is dependant on Apple growing domains instead of leaving businesses to grab at the lowest hanging fruit. Make no mistake it is not about competing against Android/Amazon/Google/Advertising/BuynLarge. It's about creating a platform for communication and commerce that doesn't bank on the gullibility of the end user. It's all my data; what I buy, who I buy it from, what I do with it? Whose to say that a viable solution positively requires that I give up that control. Just remember....the road less travelled.

Migraine World Summit’s Tools (Web): A Comprehensive List of Migraine-Fighters The Migraine World Summit is a gathering of some of the world’s leading experts on this disease. It’s a good idea to sign up for this anyway, but what’s cooler is that attendees made a list of tools to fight migraines. The list is divided into sections that target specific parts of the migraine experience, like battling an acute migraine attack or preventing migraines altogether, or factors like sleep, vision, hydration, and so on. You’ll find apps, books, exercises, advice, and a whole lot of other useful tips here. Remember, these are all advised by people who have been suffering from migraines themselves. These are tips you might not see otherwise. For example, some clinical studies have found that the right dose of ginger can abort a migraine, so you might want to eat ginger sweets and candies. 3. Palouse Mindfulness (Web): Free Course for Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Researchers have found that a particular type of meditation can help some migraine sufferers. The study also found that all migraine sufferers can safely practice this meditation exercise with no adverse effects. It’s called Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction (MBSR). We’ve previously featured mindful meditation apps to improve your life 6 Mindful Meditation Apps That Will Improve Your Life 6 Mindful Meditation Apps That Will Improve Your Life Living a more mindful live through meditation can have amazing positive effects. Give it a try with these apps. Read More , but MBSR is slightly different. Dave Potter, a certified MBSR instructor, created an eight-week course that anyone can take for free. You’ll find videos, practice sheets, yoga demonstrations, research material, and more. The extensive FAQ section should answer any queries you might have. Potter advises that taking an MBSR course in person would be better, but this is still a good alternative. 4. Binaural Beats Therapy (Web, Android, iOS): The Right Sounds for Migraines A few studies have suggested that migraine sufferers should listen to binaural beats therapy (BBT). You’ll need headphones for this one. BBT plays two tones, one in each ear. The tones are similar, but at different frequencies. When your brain hears these two “similar but different” tones, it forms a third, imaginary tone of its own. This is called a binaural beat. BBT puts the mind in a relaxed state and helps in meditation too. We’ve featured a few binaural beats apps for Android 5 Apps To Tune Your Brain With Binaural Beats [Android] 5 Apps To Tune Your Brain With Binaural Beats [Android] Being heavily interested in areas of fringe science and technology, I am always intrigued and fascinated by any claims of technology affecting biology, or the other way around.

It isn’t completely surprising that Google might create an investing practice around AI, particularly given Google CEO Sundar Pichai’s recent pronouncement that Google is becoming “AI first” rather than “mobile first.” Indeed, AI was the running thread throughout the recent Google I/O developers conference, where the company introduced new tensor processing unit (TPU) chips that promise to more quickly train and run AI models for researchers and businesses; it also announced (among many other things) that its Google Assistant, the company’s virtual personal assistant that’s available on devices like the Google Home and Pixel phone, will soon grow more conversational. Also potentially playing into this new development: Google’s recent acquisition of Kaggle, a platform that hosts data science and machine learning competitions. According to Axios, Patterson and company will reportedly be co-investing with GV when it makes sense to do so. Check sizes, it says, will range from $1 million and $10 million to start, though it isn’t yet clear how much Google plans to commit to the program, yearly or otherwise.

[Update: Now $75 Off] Deal Alert: Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:20pm PDTMay 26, 2017 2 Plus 1 on G+ 27 Share on Facebook 38 Share on Twitter Total Shares67 Deals News Pixel Update 1: 2017/05/26 2:32pm PDT It looks like the price has dropped another $25, making this a $75 savings in total. For a device that hasn't seen much in the way of price drops or It's no secret that Google has had some serious supply issues with its flagship Pixel phone. That goes for pretty much any combination of size, color, or storage. Rumors even began to surface alleging that Google had stopped production of the devices altogether. That wasn't the case, but nonetheless, you will still struggle to actually find the Pixel if you wish to buy it. A 32GB Pixel (international version) on eBay for $50 off the list price could be the answer to that problem. This is the entry level 5" Pixel, with 32GB of storage in the color Very Silver - and it's available for $599. That's $50 less than the $649 Google is still charging for it. Beware though, this is the international version of the device. So if you live in the US you'll have to check the bands to see if it works on your network. This version won't play nice with Verizon or Sprint, so if you're on either of those carriers you can rule this out. If you live outside the US then this is definitely for you. Shipping appears to be free in the US, but here in the UK, it's $18.99. That still works out a bargain for me, especially if you account for the exchange rate. You'll have to do the sums from where you are to see if the deal is as good for you. It's worth mentioning that getting your warranty honored might be tough with this type of purchase, so bear that in mind. It's hard to say how many of these they have, other than a "limited quantity," so you'll have to be quick if you want to get your hands on arguably the best Android phone of 2016. Update 1: 2017/05/26 2:32pm PDT It looks like the price has dropped another $25, making this a $75 savings in total. For a device that hasn't seen much in the way of price drops or sales since launch, $75 off isn't bad. Anyone interested in a Pixel that uses a network compatible with this international model should give it a serious think.

These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

Max Johnson "blacklisted" Middlefinger Even at $99 its not worth the bugs. It doesnt matter how 'high end' a device is, if it doesn't work properly, its worthless. jonzey231 $50 is worth a guarantee that Google will honor the warranty....trust me...I wish I would've gotten my 6P direct. Andy What do you mean? jonzey231 If you don't buy the phone from Google, they won't help you. They send you to the manufacturer. I was forced to go to Huawei for my 6P and it was a little over 3 weeks before I got it back....and the problem is still there. Spend the extra $50 and buy it through Google so you're guaranteed to get support through their CS channels. You'll be glad you did in 6 months when something inevitably goes wrong. IMHO get the OnePlus 3T. Costs less but has better overall specs aside from the camera which is still pretty good in its own right. My brother has one and my roommate just got his last week and they both have no intention of going back to a major brand ever again. YaKillaCJ Same happened when I got the OnePlus One. It changed the way I (and many others) view a "budget" device from an unknown brand. needa I felt the same way after using an OPO for nearly three years. Got me an XL in mint condition for $450. Google edition even. Still had 3520 mAh in the batt too. Would have bought the black 3T had they been in stock. Took me three days to hunt down this deal. Andy Got my wife the pixel. Runs great. Just had the microphone problem. Google swapped without question. Wife seems to think it takes horrible selfies. Rod Weird, as it's cameras are regarded among the best currently. Random! @andy maybe you should let her know that the camera isn't the problem... It's actually her face. If you do warn her about this, I promise to visit you at the hospital. Andy Thanks for the tip. Master Yates Agreed with you regarding the 3T. Lets see if the excellent updates and support evaporate when the One Plus 5 is released? That's the real test. IcerC Except in this case Google is the Manufacturer, that might change things. ddevito #Fail Andy S8 release response? AdMoc Does not ship to Poland as fck always -_- Random! Look for some service like Shipito. I believe they have an EU warehouse. Shakil Shaikh $60 shipping? kristin ANY Pixel made by google is compatible with any provider. It doesnt matter if its international or not. This writer is an odiot. Scott Scrivens https://www.techwalls.com/google-pixel-pixel-xl-model-number-differences/ Kevin Davis "Odiot", lmao. 😂 Oh, and you're wrong, too. kristin I called google about this. It would be up your phone company provider whether it worked or not. So it may not work with att or tmobile either. kristin This may or may not work on any provider. Its up to the provider. You want a pixel? Go to swappa.com and get one used in mint condition for much cheaper. Ive gotten a few phones from them since ive been on project fi and had no issues. Ill never buy a new phone again. Random! $50 off? How cute... If they get to $300 off ($350 final price) within a month, I might even convince myself it's worth to stare at those bezels everyday. Other than that (impossible) scenario, I'd rather get the 3T, Axon 7, or even the LG G5. iKon The most overrated smartphone of 2016. Only the camera is decent. Ugly ass design, overpriced and dull with no features compared to competition nirmitlamed Google is so off track in figuring out what customers wants and competing against the other monstrous companies. I would very much like to hear how many Pixels Google sold in the last year since they told us they sold more than they expected.

New Level 4 Local Guides for Google Maps will no longer receive free 100GB of Drive storage Richard Gao Follow View All Posts 2017/03/03 7:30pm PDTMar 3, 2017 66 Plus 1 on G+ 120 Share on Facebook 71 Share on Twitter Total Shares257 Google News Local Guides is a program by Google Maps in which you "help others explore the world and get great benefits in return" (Google's words, not mine). Well, it looks like those great benefits are about to become merely average benefits, as Google is completely ditching free Drive storage for new Level 4 Local Guides, who currently get 100GB for one year. This removal of free Drive storage as a reward follows a similar event from back in July of 2016, when the promo for new Level 4 Guides was slashed from 1TB for two years to 100GB for one year. When that happened, we assumed that Google Maps was having too many people reach Level 4 too quickly; the same thing is probably applicable here. Here's Google's explanation: As our global community of Local Guides continues to grow, we occasionally make changes to our program. We look forward to offering our most active and consistently-contributing Local Guides more features and perks throughout the year. Not all hope is lost, though; if you're a Local Guide, you'll still receive your free 100GB if you reach Level 4 prior to March 17th at 11pm EST. As someone who's recently gotten into this whole thing, I'm probably going to be adding to my current 63 points (Level 3) quite rapidly in the span of the next two weeks.

Just reached Level 4 last week! :) mchalakov I still have my 1TB for one more year Steven Kelby Me too, but then what do we do? Forced to buy a pixel phone I guess. Or pay $125 per year. Ramon Or delete shit..Storage with expired dates shouldn't be a thing. Steven Kelby Yeah it's a trap. What a scam. JG $125 for a year doesn't sound all that bad... Though your a little high... If you buy a whole year, it's only $99.99 ($9.99/month if you pay per month). Though I really don't need a whole terabyte (right now I'm only using 1.09GBs of my 1TB+19GB)... I may go for the $19.99/year for 100GBs though... Steven Kelby I'm in Australia so it costs more here, that's AUD. I guess it's not too bad but a hard drive is much cheaper. Just need to have it networked off site at a friends house in case the house burns down! Vlad What if there's an earthquake and both your houses fall down? Steven Kelby Hopefully I'll get squashed too so it won't matter. Checkmate. Vlad That's... actually the answer I wanted. mchalakov You are not forced to do anything...your files will not be deleted even when the promo runs out. I'm pretty sure you didn't fill the full 1TB.Also you knew before that the this is a timed promotion. I really don't get the drama around here... Steven Kelby I did fill the full 1tb already, music, pics and video from my phones and cameras. It's good that it won't get deleted, I didn't know that. Đức Thành AFAIK your data won't get deleted when the extra storage expires, but in order to upload new files you'll have to either delete files to free up space or buy new space, which can be quite inconvenient at times. Kevin Brown I do too. Thanks for reminding me. I have unlimited storage through Crash Plan for my home network. I'll download my photos from Drive and upload them to Crash Plan from one of my on-site data servers. I'll write a script to pull down the photos, and let Crash Plan do its thing view every 15 minute back up. Google doesn't stick with ANYTHING, it's like an elementary school Jr Achievement "business." Never count on anything coming from Google to last. mchalakov Why ..a lot of Google services are running and lasting and still last :D Nothing is unlimited. I really doubt that you do need more than 1TB for your photos. For me on the other side - I'm working as a photographer...and I do shoot in RAW. I'm on my 2nd full TB at home :D Besides when the 1TB promo is over next year all the files will still be accessible ,you just can't upload more. Kevin Brown Tell me one service that Google's put out in the past ten years that's still running. Other than search and AdWords.. I will download because Google cannot be trusted to keep those photos. They are not customer focused one whit. I also shoot in RAW with my camera, and I too upload to my home network, which is backed up to Crash Plan. I also have a second backup to a former employer. The Google bit is just phone photos that are spur of the moment. 1639GB used as of today. That includes things like work documents, Titanium Pro backups on top of my photos.

Howard Stern ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Snuck right in since I got level 4 just last month Kevin Davis Damn, almost to level 4, I guess I'd better pick up the pace for the next couple of weeks, as the author mentioned. KingS I'm so glad I reached level last year shortly before they got rid of the 1TB offer. David Hyman Me too! Not that I am anywhere near my 1TB limit, it's nice to have Đức Thành How long does the 1 TB last? Fiorta Just claimed mine two days ago... Just in time it appears Ash The person who works so much to reach level 4, Google should give them atleast 50 GB free for life Samarth I second that! Vratislav Jindra I third that. SimonPieman Works so much by posting shit reviews consisting of "ok" for places they have never been to.. Google would have been better going for quality over quantity. Ash You are right. But not all are like this. I am at level 2 in 4 years and all my reviews are original and detailed plus i upload photos as well. It might take my another 1-2 years to reach level 4 Drakenoid I wrote detailed reviews in a rush last year when 1tb promotion was announced as being removed and got to level 4 and got the promotion but I was downgraded to level 3 for some reason, despite none of my reviews being basic. So it doesn't matter. You can try to do what I did, maybe you'll get this promotion. Ozl I reached level 4 by mostly uploading pictures mchalakov This is a risk of any service using user submitted content. They do review the reviews. kerma frog sound like you did it as well faggot Sushil Singh I have reached level 4 in 2 years and review and add photos only places i personally visit. Đức Thành If someone manages to reach level 4 in less than 4 months, they probably deserve better than 50 GB, but I'd still take what I can get. Too bad it won't even be an option. AOSPrevails I made lv4 a year ago, back when the reward was 1TB, it got so popular that Google had to nerf it to 100GB and now this. exadeci It was planned all along, they just want free workers so they attract you with advantages and make you "special" with event in their HQ but at the end of the day you work harder and for cheaper (even taking in account the advantages and events) than minimum wage workers and now that they got an army of Local Guides they don't need to offer you anything more than a "badge" Leonardo Baez I need 120pts to reach level 5, what would I get? Tizio Caio An applause Đức Thành A notification from Google that says "Congratulations on reaching Level 5 as a Local Guide!" JP How can you reach level 4 quickly? I'm at 3. Morten Ulv The quickest is probably to do quick reviews of places you've been or answer questions about places you've been. You only get one point per business if I remember correctly, so answering one question per place is enough if you really want to power through. R Gerald Saul You get one point per business, but you get a point for a review, a point for a picture, a point for updating detailed information, etc. Nicholas Conrad Airports and malls my friend. Vlad I modified the schedule of all McDonald's in my country with McDrives. They all have non-stop schedule, so I just took the list from their website and changed all of it on Google Maps. For some reason, I got dropped back to level 2 or 3 after a day, but I already redeemed my 1 TB. Drakenoid They do that, even I got dropped to level 3 (it may have been 2 but it's been an year and am on level 3 now at least) abc I've heard that being a loser with a lot of free time is very helpful. Jason Farrell Same here, but I've only reviewed stuff for fun over the years, instead of spamming crappy "OK" reviews for every little dinky place I've been to like some people do. I've got 111 of the 200 points needed to level up to lvl4, but since I'm already paying $20/yr for the 100GB there's not much point. Drakenoid Write as many detailed reviews as you can for the places you've been to, and redeem it as soon as you get to level 4. JG You can get up to 5 points per location: 1. If it's not yet on Maps, add it 2. If any information (hours, website, phone etc) is incorrect out missing, submit corrections 3. Answer some super yes/no questions 4. Write a review 5. Submit a photo You get 1 point for each, regardless if you submit multiple photos or answer multiple questions. But more never hurts. Spend a weekend walking around your local downtown, mall, and anywhere else there are a lot of businesses. If nothing else, snap a picture of each. If you know the place, answer questions about it. If you really know it, leave a review. That'll get you at least one, if not 3 points per location. Đức Thành Though these are not things I don't already have a good idea about, they're very nice and detailed tips regardless. Saved for future references, thanks. Nate Somsen I just might plug my blog, I wrote like two weeks ago, with helpful ideas on how to get those points... http://www.natesomsen.com/blog/your-guide-to-google-local-guides/ exadeci >Level 4 Guides was slashed from 1TB for two years to 100GB for one year. 100 GB for a year costs you $24, trying to get level 4 will consume you more time than it's value. 1TB for 2 years was $240 Marcell Lévai I have 148 points, so I need around 50 to get to level 4. Well, I guess I'll start taking photos everywhere. I am a paying Google Drive customer, but also a student, so not needing to pay for 100 gigs of Drive storage for a year would be nice. :P Ramon Yawn. Like..Why give storage only to take it away. So I fill half of that extra 100 GB. After it expires then what? "You're out of space, please delete. Spare me the stress. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ The old promos for Moto X for free 1 yr. storage said anything on the drive would stay there, but you couldn't add anything when the year expired. Zorak✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵉᵛᶦˡ And that "anything" includes email attachments, found out the hard way. Vlad No, that includes not being able to receive emails. It's on their FAQ... Zorak✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵉᵛᶦˡ Not sure if you're trying to confirm or contradict, but since you initiated your statement with a negative I'll assume it's the latter so allow me to offer this anecdotal evidence, when my free storage period ran out I kept receiving notifications telling me to delete contents to be able to receive emails. But if in fact you're trying to confirm you should read PixelXLellence's comment and my reply again. Hint: I referenced to the "anything" on the later part of the sentence. Vlad Oops, sorry. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ +1 for the Zorak avatar https://espngrantland.files.wordpress.com/2015/10/space-ghost.jpg?w=805 Zorak✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵉᵛᶦˡ Heh, thanks.

I'm way more evil now and the politically correct bunch finds me unequivocally detestable. https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b2/Space_Ghost_Coast_to_Coast.png P.S. It's all in the eyes. Morten Ulv If you already pay for it, you save like 20 bucks that year. Oh joy. :P Jesús Cuenca Once i got $20 from google to use on cabify, that was nice :v Impulse_Vigil Dang, I'm at 52 pts, time to get contributing. Đức Thành You can make it. I believe in you. Miku is Best Vocaloid I need to hurry the fuck up, I'm level 3. Đức Thành Same, been contributing since January. How long have you been a Local Guide? Miku is Best Vocaloid Since September, I wasn't very active the last few months. Đức Thành How many points have you got? I had 87 points yesterday, and today I'm at 112. Wanna bet on who will level up first? :D Morten Ulv Oh right. I got level 4 back in november, but wanted to wait to redeeming it. Missed the part about expiration after 30 days. Oh well, not like I really need it anyway, seeing as photos are free and it expires after a year. JPLoureiro I contribute for fun and don't expect much in return except for some geeky stats and badges, though some credit for Google play would be nice as well. Đức Thành Same but this news still makes me upset for some reason. I wasn't even aware of the rewards before this (I was vaguely aware that there were awards for Local Guides but that's it, and I'm not even doing this for the rewards). I wonder what this phenomenon is called. Rok Tur! Another job illuminated by technology the critic LOL Same, I like to give fair reviews etc, and I always read other reviews when I go to places. Google credits or some T-shirts would be nice for every level up Chips N I wasn't aware of the program. I knew I got "points" or gained levels for it, but I thought it was just "pointless" fun, no pun intended. It would always ask me nonstop about places I've driven past or places I go in to for a quick five minutes and then leave (just browsing, etc.) If they gave even a penny for each review (in credit), I'd be a tad more tempted to put some thought into leaving a review, for places I've actually been to, of course. Trent I hit level 5 a while back and just recently passed 5,000 points. I hope and think that the reason for these scale backs is to give people like me more incentive to go for the new tiers when they're announced. Đức Thành Well fuck me, 2017 has been a quite effortful yet unrewarding year so far. Not counting many other things mostly unrelated, I've begun actively contributing to Google Maps for the last three months, and while I've added several places, made edits, posted hundreds of photos (reached over 15.000 views just a few days ago) and written quality reviews and yet this is all I got from Google: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b1f85b49be32e63f852423898894791d3b68700553c85aa1791d8352a68cbe1b.png It's just not a very fair system. And now I have to add "getting 87 more Local Guide points in the next 2 weeks" to the list of things to do, if I want to get a reward. Life just doesn't let you catch a break, as it would seem. Maxr1998 Yeah, I also think that's very unfair.. I'm living in the countryside, so it took ages for to reach lvl 3, now I won't even get storage anymore once I finally reach lvl 4. Oh, btw, 87 to 200 is an additional 113 points.. Đức Thành I feel for you man. My problem is mostly a technical one, as I find the whole process of sharing photos to Google Maps from Google Photos to be quite cumbersome (my Nexus 5 has 2-3 GB to store new photos and I back up and delete local photos every 1-2 days or so, so when I get into the mood of actually contributing to Google Maps every few days, I would have to dive into Photos, find photos of places I took few days prior and download them, then upload to Maps; and while this doesn't sound like that much of a problem it becomes a problem for me as I take a *shit load* of photos everyday). 113 points? Well shit, I guess that means more work for me, then. Shon G. I just uploaded about 20 pictures directly from Photos. Đức Thành The problem is I also want to do a review when I add photos, or at least get credited for it, but the way Maps currently implements it, if you add photos directly from Photos via Maps's suggestions it does neither and your contributions stay anonymous. Which is kinda pointless to me. Drakenoid Maps should show your photos from Google photos backup in the app itself, so try that out. Đức Thành I am well aware, what I am complaining about is Maps's current implementation of it. Đức Thành Dunno if you're interested, but I'm here to report on the progress and this is what I managed in the span of one day (going out has been costly and time-consuming and I'm wondering if this is really worth it): https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6b084860808db2c74a19d67429f11e554a5f1b88fc19f5c0b3d9f9e1c6b308b8.png So um, let's see, 88 points to go? This is getting increasingly harder than I thought. But at the same time if you view this as a game it could be quite a fun challenge. By the way, how many points have you got? I think there are a few things you can do to earn points even if you live in the countryside, like visiting monuments and adding new landmarks and whatnot. Just a suggestion. Maxr1998 Great work! I was at 104 15 minutes ago, but you reminded me to open GMaps and now I'm at 111. I might be able to get to 200 until March 17 if I push myself hard enough, but it still sucks to have to hurry so much. Also, since the promotion is only valid one year, it doesn't help me much since I have 100 GB since March 2018 anyway, because of my HTC phone from last year. Would have loved to be able to continue with a fresh year of 100 GB next year, by then finishing my Local guide lvl, but now I will probably have to pay then (I actually need the 100GB for my photos). Maxr1998 So a little update from my side, I hope that you managed to reach lvl 4, I didn't. I got to around 145, 55 more points just wasn't possible (and I still didn't reach it, currently 152). In the end I didn't even bother anymore, I'll probably just buy a subscription next year when my HTC Promotion ends, as I would have had to do anyway, so no real loss for me tbh.. Đức Thành Sorry for the late reply (thanks to crappy ISPs in my country I have had to use a VPN service every time I want to read any disqus comments and I am just too busy to bother nowadays), but here's some update from me as well. I did actually manage to reach Lv 4 more than a day before the deadline, and I still get emails from Google Maps team notifying me about how many views my photos get (more than 100.000 views the last time I checked), but I never did receive any news about the storage reward. I almost went to post a complaint on Local Guides community, but in the end I decided it wasn't worth it. So here's the funny thing: I was very active in contributing to Google Maps before, and I never really cared about getting the reward and certainly wasn't even aware that there was a reward system before I read this news about Google reducing the reward. But after this whole thing I completely stopped posting anything thanks to a lack of motivation. I think the reward system kinda ruined this hobby for me and turned it into some labor work; and thanks to how badly Google manages the reward system's actual execution, it turned into unrewarded work in the end. Now I don't even bother thinking about this as it leaves a bad taste, and it's ironic that I used to make really good photo posts and reviews before this happened, and it used to be fun. So I guess your not making it is actually a fortune thing, haha. KingS Yeah i feel ya. I got a photo with over 3 million views and it only counts as 1 point, like a photo with only 20 views. Anyways, Id recommend taking a lot of photos when youre out and about, because Google Maps will suggest you add them and they each doing as a point. Also, andere questions about businesses you've been to and keep your reviews short, but detailed. Đức Thành I already do that, maybe much more than I can possibly be expected of, simply because I like to do things properly and thoroughly, but thanks! I will keep it up. Michael D. Local guides are improving Google Maps for free, something that would otherwise would cost lots of money, and this is how Google is thanking us? I'm already a level 4 guide but seeing that there are no real benefits for all the work I've done and the data I've been submitting, I will stop doing so. I've been doing this just for fun, but in reality I've been helping them acquire costly data. Well, that's about what does it. henleyb I do it just to help others and overall hopefully ensure companies improve their services etc. The extra benefits are nice but feel a little shallow with it being for just the year. Especially since if you use it blindly you're then going to have to move all your data before it expires or start paying. Why not give 20GB for life or something, that would be a nice gesture for Google to acknowledge that while we are helping others we're also helping their company too. Either way, I find Google maps incredibly helpful for a vast range of reasons so I'm happy to contribute to 'pay back' and hopefully make it better for everyone without any rewards. Đức Thành Same, I'm a little disappointed in Google tbh but the reason I will keep contributing regardless is going to be because of the community. I was a nerd (still am) who didn't know the street names inside a 1 km diameter around my own area just a year ago, but thanks to people's contributions to Maps I can go out with much more confidence now and I am getting to know way more streets and new interesting places (even helped me with several jobs in the outskirt of my hometown), so being able to contribute back to the community can be seen as a reward in itself. Still disappointed in Google, though. Oh well. LOL Google has been a bunch of cheap little motherfuсkers lately Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez Totally agreed with you, Im level 4, but lately Im losing my inspiration for contributing. Cakefish I'm currently Level 3. It's like an addictive minigame. A clever way of crowdsourcing information. Corey Munns I reached level 4 back in December but still haven't gotten my 100gb. Emily My 100 GB only lasted 4 months anyway. When it prematurely ended, I went round and round with help desk people. In the end Drive people said they couldn't help me because it was a Local Guides thing, and Local Guides people said they couldn't help because it was a Drive thing. x.Ramin What about your data? Does it get deleted too? Đức Thành Carl Sagan Dammit Google, I probably should add this "Drive vs. Local Guides rewards contradiction thing" to the "list of things to resolve when I become the head of Google one day," if that issue still hasn't been resolved by then. (Typing this with a straight face because I'm completely and totally serious.) Light I was working on it. Reviewing everywhere I went and all. Well then, I'll just stop and continue on Tripadvisor. No reward, no help building the platform. At least Tripadvisor is mainstream, so I contribute to something people actually use for reviews at least. Đức Thành TripAdvisor is even worse when it comes to the process of making contributions though. Really inconvenient and effortful, and not as many people get to reap the benefits from your reviews either. Chronos90 Do I have to do something to get this reward? I was close to Level 4 and added another review which took me to Level. Didn't got any notice yet LOL I'm almost level 6 bitchеs Margaritas Ante Porcos People are as greedy as orthodox priests. All good deeds need to be paid, otherwise no reviews. eep2378 Good thing I'm level 4 already...😀 Ailín Ó’S I still have the 1TB of free storage but I'm not sure how I feel about this. On one hand it will help limit people reviewing places they've never been to with a "cool" or "good" or whatever just to get the points but on the other it no longer incentivises people to genuinely contribute to the app and make it better. belac77 I wonder if they'll replace it with another perk? mchalakov Whoa...chill everybody. Even though we as Local Guides are helping Google ,we are also helping each other. Especially in some areas which you don't have any information. The moment you started doing this you knew there is going to be nothing in return or if there is anything it's a limited promotion. So if you want 100GB buy it it's $2 /month. kerma frog how bout no? Maleko Wow... I did a lot to get to Level 4 to redeem that free storage, and I did it with decent photos and decent reviews etc... Firstly it's pointless to have the storage expire, especially when Google don't offer 500GB in their storage tariff. Now to remove the incentive totally... dick move. GarethSargeant 100 reviews since yesterday. Sticking with places I've been to though. My name is…. And thats why they dont offer GB any more. Nate Somsen You'd think that Google would have some kind of algorithm to detect an unnatural increase in contributions in such a short amount of time... Đức Thành Why though? Regardless of the frequency of new photos and reviews, it's the accuracy and quality that matters, right? Some people like to take lots of photos of places but don't contribute right away every time, and when they do it in their spare time just have to batch-process a bunch of new places, I think it should be fair game. Ohid Khan https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6d2b4544c67bb885685a2487b72f82a4d31c0735e832702b911d6210b1a3a29c.jpg Wendy’s Angels Does she come from a pedophile family? She's another like chelsea handler, with her old slutty self, creaming over Obama. Doby Gillis Your dementia is kicking in. WTF does that have to do with the article? Dirge No worries, I got the 1TB free for 2 years back in July. TheScienceEnthusiast1130 LMFAO Google = $$$ SB Level 5 - 167 photos - over a million views. Geoff Johnson Glad I got in when it was 1TB, which is good through March 2018. Андрей Бельский And what if i have been of 4th level (long ago) and will reach 5th level. will I get this 100gb storage as promotion? Biggles Remember when the Google motto was "don't be evil"? We've done a pile of work for Google for free. It'd cost them a lot of money to either buy the data if they could buy it somewhere, or cost them a lot of money to hire people to do data entry. Either way, it saved them forking out. And it improved their search and maps tremendously, so that it strengthened their grip of the market and they make yet more money. The cost to them was drive space, and probably so little in financial terms that they'd struggle to actual calculate it. People are upset less because of the cost of Drive storage, less because the perks changed, but more because Google made out they cared about their users and having a community of local guides. And it turns out that they don't care. Anthony I'm happy I hit level 4 back when it was 1tb. I didnt know it went down. Anthony https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/18c73e40001f06e7055d333e9d4ad4b7ac0a0c1db1e2b065f1971cce06ae3d02.png Omega192 ITT a bunch of entitled whiners. Oh, you've "done a pile of work for Google for free"? They've been providing many if not most of their services to you for free, Maps included. If you really cba to contribute to Maps unless you're given something in return, then go right ahead and stop contributing. No one is forcing you to continue. Wouldn't be surprised if this was brought on by people leaving low effort reviews just to get to the point they were rewarded. God forbid Google take steps to lessen that rather than just shell out unlimited rewards at a loss. chimichanga I've reached level 4 a few days ago but still haven't seen an increase in Google Drive space. How long does this usually take? Was thinking it would be more or less imminent. chimichanga all good, have actually received it now Vladislav Shumkin so the bonus drive space just arrives later automatically? or you need to apply somewhere to redeem? chimichanga yes, an email to activate the free storage arrived around 3 days after I reached level 4 Anthony C Russano III I was lucky enough to secure the FREE 1TB before they pulled it. I am so stoked on that one. hehehe Follow Android Police 1.49M 471k 144k 116k Latest Deals 35 [Update: Now $75 Off] Deal Alert: Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay 2017/05/26 2:20pm PDTMay 26, 2017 6 [Deal Alert] Start off your holiday weekend with 21 temporarily free and 42 on-sale apps 2017/05/26 11:02am PDTMay 26, 2017 7 [Deal Alert] Score an Asus ZenFone Zoom with a free ZenPower 10,500mAh portable battery for $180 from B&H ($170 off) 2017/05/25 8:14pm PDTMay 25, 2017 17 [Bonus Round] Get your hands on another 25 temporarily free and 56 on-sale apps 2017/05/25 1:12pm PDTMay 25, 2017 2 [UK Deal Alert] Grab a Moto Z for just £299 (£200 off) from John Lewis 2017/05/25 8:36am PDTMay 25, 2017 Latest Poll Do you use a screen protector on your phone?

Pre-order: Surface Laptop | NEW Surface Pro All in on AI Is Microsoft following Google's lead on AI? By Jason Ward Friday, May 26, 2017 at 12:00 pm EDT 35 Comments Jason L Ward is a columnist at Windows Central. He provides unique big picture analysis of the complex world of Microsoft. Jason takes the small clues and gives you an insightful big picture perspective through storytelling that you won't find anywhere else. Seriously, this dude thinks outside the box. Follow him on Twitter at @JLTechWord. He's doing the "write" thing! "Mobile first, cloud first" has been Microsoft's CEO Satya Nadella's guiding mantra for the company since 2014. Things have recently changed, however. Nadella often says mobility is not about a single device but rather the mobility of a user's experiences across many devices supported by an intelligent cloud. Google's CEO Sundar Pichai said in an interview just before Google I/O 2016 that he's "on a journey from mobile to AI." The interview further expounded: "Pichai is also focused on shifting Google's journey from 'mobile-first to AI-first.'" Coincidentally, during his keynote at Build 2017, Nadella shared that Microsoft too is moving from a mobile-first, cloud-first vision to one that places AI at the forefront. So is Microsoft following Google? The future of the PC is a family of devices connected by an intelligent cloud Shift from mobile first, cloud first? Nadella stated the following during his Build 2017 keynote: We're moving from what is today's mobile-first, cloud-first world to a new world that is going to be made of an intelligent cloud and an intelligent edge. [The] user experience is getting distributed across devices. It's no longer just mobile first ... it's not about one device, an app model for one device. The user experience itself is going to span all of your devices ...Your personal digital assistant by definition is going to be available on all your devices. [As] you move between devices it's going to be there helping you gets tasks done. Nadella during his Build 2017 keynote. Oddly, it seems that Nadella is defining mobile first as being centered around one device and a single app model, rather than how he historically defined it. Furthermore, his shift toward an intelligent cloud and intelligent edge vision now adopts the "mobility-of-experiences" definition he historically applied to his mobile-first, cloud-first vision. He further explained this platform shift has an AI focus that benefits from investments in the "edge of the cloud." Serverless computing allows for pieces of logic to exist outside of the bounds of a virtual machine (VM) making that logic mobile. Existing on the "edge of the cloud" where hundreds of gigabytes of data can be processed for tasks such as those associated with an autonomous or connected car, computational power moves to the cloud's edge. Nadella explained that AI in such an environment is more distributed. Clearly, Microsoft's "mobility-of-experiences" vision remains unchanged, though it resides beneath an AI-first umbrella. Furthermore, investments in AI have been a decades-long strategy for Microsoft. Given these facts, one must wonder if Nadella's public setting of a new pole star from mobile first, cloud first to an AI-focused guidance is a reactive measure to Google's clear dedication to and observable success in the same. Google's all about AI Like Microsoft, Google invested in first-party hardware but for different reasons. Microsoft's hardware strategy positions a growing family of Windows 10 devices as an actual and aspirational medium for the Universal Windows Platform (UWP). Google's hardware strategy provides a platform for its AI vision. Both Microsoft and Google are invested in hardware, though for different reasons Google's earlier AI, Google's Now, was founded on the popular industry-leading Google search engine. Its ability to serve and anticipate a range of Android and iPhone users' needs made it a leading personal assistant. Unlike its rivals, Apple's Siri and Microsoft's Cortana, however, it lacked attributes that made it personal. With Google Assistant, which is described as a user's personal Google, the Mountain View company has attempted to reframe the powerful search engine as every individual's personal Google. Ok, Google Assistant Google Assistant is more personal than its predecessor and gets to know users over time. During Google I/O 2016, the Google Home smart speaker, the Pixel smartphones, and Google's new messenger Allo were all introduced as platforms for the Assistant. Truth be told, Google Assistant is as much a defensive move as it is an offensive move for Google. In an app- and AI-dominated world, "search" is no longer just a destination we go to; it's integrated into our apps and digital assistants. Google confronts this challenge to its core (ad revenue) business by making search personal and marketing Assistant as an evolution of the familiar Google search engine. Google wants users to know its AI has the advantage of being based on the world's leading search engine. Rishi Chandra, vice president of product management for Google's living room devices, said: "There is no better engine of answering any question that you have. We fundamentally believe that." Microsoft may fear that this is true given the number two position of Bing and consumers' general lack of awareness of Cortana. Google's AI push This year, Google expanded its AI vision by adding Google Assistant to smartwatches, Android TV, cars and the iPhone (joining Siri and Cortana). The company also expanded the Assistant's ability through Google Home and Chromecast. Visual responses from Google Home can now appear on the TV. Google I/O 2017. Google Lens, the company's AI-driven camera app, allows users to point their phones' cameras at people, places and things to glean information about them based on Google's extensive knowledge graph. Like Microsoft and the 2016 private preview release and recent general release of the Cortana SDK, Google has released the Assistant SDK. Third parties can now integrate Assistant into their hardware as Cortana was incorporated into the Harman Kardon speaker. Microsoft, Cortana and AI In 2014, while the tech world was focused on health platforms, wearables and the rumored bigger iPhones, Microsoft was fine-tuning its AI vision. Cortana was about to make its debut on Windows Phone. Beyond a mere voice assistant, it was obvious then Cortana had potential as an intelligent UI for transient computing across Windows devices. AI, bots and canvases: An evolving view of Microsoft's AI vison In early 2014, few foresaw Microsoft's embrace of the iPhone and Android, however, though by July 2015 it was evident. Nor did I see, then, Cortana as a singular artificial intelligent UI for users' experiences across Windows, iOS and Android bound together by the Microsoft graph, as demonstrated at Build 2017. Former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer gave a forward-looking description of the unifying effects of Microsoft's graph in 2013. His statements are specific to Windows devices but foreshadow Microsoft's Windows-as-a-hub, binding users' cross-platform experiences: The experience we will deliver across all our devices centers on the idea of better connecting people with the things they care about most ... files, documents, photos, videos, notes, websites, snippets, digital history, schedules, tasks, and mail and other messages, combined with real-time information from our devices and services. It is more than what we think of as the shell today, and no current label really fits where we are headed. The shell will support the experiences layer and broker information among our services to bring them together on our devices in ways that will enable richer and deeper app experiences. Microsoft's graph as a unifier of all platforms and experiences is a vital part of the company's AI and platform vision. As a single underlying "super platform," Microsoft's graph enables Cortana to become the UI for experiences for all platforms. This approach to AI in conjunction with Cortana's democratization via the SDK makes Microsoft's strategy a worthy contender to Google's well-positioned Assistant. Are Microsoft's AI efforts following Google's? Microsoft began investments in machine learning, natural language processing, and deep neural networks long before Google became an AI-first company. Ballmer and Gates pave way for Nadella's AI vision In the following video, Microsoft Research's Eric Horvitz talks about the company's investments in AI: During Build 2016, Microsoft introduced Conversation as a Canvas and the Bots Framework. Nadella also described Cortana as a meta-app that would interface with bots. Apps such as Skype, WhatsApp, Line, Slack and others were described as canvases for conversations that would connect with bots and AI, and human language was then identified as the UI. This year's integration of iOS and Android into the Microsoft graph and Cortana's positioning as its UI is the progression of an AI vision at Microsoft that had early roots in Microsoft Bob. So, no, Microsoft is not following Google's AI efforts. I believe, however, that Nadella's statement shifting Microsoft from a mobile-first, cloud-first motto is a deliberate public acknowledgment of his awareness of how important and competitive AI has become and will be. Considering Microsoft's already considerable investments in and previously communicated plans for AI, I believe Microsoft wanted the industry and competitors to know that, like Google, Redmond is all about AI. Reader comments Is Microsoft following Google's lead on AI? 35 Comments View All Comments Log In to Comment Register Sort by Date Sort by Rating Jason Ward Thanks for reading folks!!! Obviously Microsoft has decades worth of investments in AI and is not following Google's very respectable advancements in the area. What I found interesting as I watched Satya Nadella's Build 2017 keynote, however, was his very clear and deliberate departure from the mantra we Windows phone fans know all too well, "Mobile-first, Cloud-first", to an intelligence-driven (AI-driven) guidance. It immediately reminded me of Google's CEO Sundar Pichai's departure from a mobile-first, to an AI-first focus that he articulated a year ago. Clearly, Microsoft has had investments in AI for years, but only now is it placing the emphasis on AI as it's guidance as Google did last year. What do you think? Is Microsoft trying to make sure the industry and competitors know that it's AI strategy is a priority by placing it as the public guidance for the company, rather than Mobile-first, cloud-first philosophy (which Nadella articulates is still part of the company's strategy by the way)? The industry is increasingly AI-driven from IoT, mixed reality, Surveillance Tech and more. Public perception is a part of industry rival battles just technology advancement's and products. I think it was was for MS to "update" it's guiding philosophy to an AI-driven one to match it's investments and the industry's direction. Google's jump on this a year earlier of course, gives it the perception as being more forward-thinking here. What do you think? Was Microsoft being reactive here? Were they to slow to focus thier public message and philosophy with an alignment with it's AI investments allowing Google to position more aggressively as more forward thinking in regards to an AI-driven focus. LET'S TALK! 2 15 hours ago Reply salazka AI  is very much Cloud First.  And of course, no, MS is not following Google's  "lead"  however Google is the most populist brand of all, and as such it has better success in marketing terms. More recognizeable. Beating someone in GO, is different than running an entire city with an AI heart, (IBM does that without a making much fuss about it,) or leading in image and voice recognition etc. etc. as Microsoft does. Cortana is not AI, not by a longshot, but it should be empowered by AI if Microsoft wants Cortana to thrive and their hidden deeply undergound marvels to come to the surface.  Last but not least, for AI to work, it needs a lot of data, data that is acquired by users as they go about their daily usage scenarios. And while google  has a "carte blanche" there, Microsoft is constantly a victim of endless ridiculous press bourne witchhunts. Microsoft continues to have a press problem, more conspicuous than before, but still there. Perhaps, unlike google they can't offer much to the various tech websites?  0 8 hours ago Reply Drael646464 Machine learning programs are incredibly narrow. Because of this, various assistants will gain leads in specialised areas. Apple, MS and googles assistants will becomes "better at different things". MS seems to be focusing on natural language interactions. Googe appears to be focusing on expanding search functionality. Apple may also be heading into search IMO - they have invested in dark data AI AND partnered with IBM, to gain use of watson. I think google is smart to be AI first right now, because someone like apple could beat them at their own game with an AI that actually catergorizes content rather than uses markers. MS on on the other hand, like apple, and sony have the potential for AR/VR markets - because they have more powerful hardware under their platforms.  This is another reason why google has to be AI first - phones will not be a profit core of VR/AR. Googles best chance of future proofing itself is the IoT.  0 2 hours ago Reply Sin Ogaris Cortana isn't even close to AI, it's a search engine with a few responses, it doesn't learn at, it just does what it's been programmed to do. 8 12 hours ago Reply techiez and it doesnt yet work everywhr 6 12 hours ago Reply Whodaboss In general I would agree.  But on my phone Cortana tells me before I leave home or work if the traffic is good or bad and how long it will take me to get there.  So in that sense it has learned how to provide information.  Sure I guess it is somewhat programmed to do that but still it's intuitive to provide feedback even when I'm not directly asking for it.  I still contend the Kinect could have been the precursor to all of this had Microsoft stayed focus on it long enough.  Oh well. 1 11 hours ago Reply real0395 There is no actual AI anywhere at least on the consumer level. The point is to start working on developing that. 0 10 hours ago Reply Drael646464 Of course, no assistants are primarily machine learning yet. Machine learning is very narrow, and nobody could build an entire natural language platform from one yet.  0 1 hour ago Reply techiez running out of ideas for editorials? 0 12 hours ago Reply Jason Ward Actually AI's a pretty big deal😉 Great topic to delve into! 2 12 hours ago Reply techiez Oh I know abt AI, but this article lacks depth, u start with saying Did MS copy google and end up saying it didnt, what was the point? 0 11 hours ago Reply Jason Ward Actually, the conclusion was "no" they aren't following Google in regard to thier AI efforts, but may have been reactive to Google's year old shift to an AI first guidance, in their public shift to an AI-first rather than Mobile-first motto this year. The article points to a shift some may not have known occurred in Nadella's guiding principal from the well known mobile-first cloud-first motto to an AI-focused one. It then frames that in a slightly broader context including one of Microsoft's main competitors (though there are others) who competes on the broadest range of similar services than any of MS other rivals: cloud, productivity, AI, hardware etc. (Other rivals compete with MS on less fronts.) Also, not all readers here, as MS fans, watch the competition as closely as others, so by providing the context of Googles AI foundations, progress and hardware strategy that is AI focused (whereas Microsoft's is UWP focused) readers can see where MS sits in relation to Google. This provokes critical thinking to see MS in relation to the broader picture rather than in a microcosm. Pointing then to Microsoft's long AI, machine learning, deep neural network history brings a history to the forefront that may be being overshadowed by Google's very public and consumer recognized AI efforts with Google Home, Assistant, ect. Some folks because Google's AI efforts are very consumer facing on the large Android platform may not realize the investments Microsoft has made and is making in AI. This article provides that information and perhaps let's some who think MS is following Google's AI strategy know, (because of thier consumer facing progress), that "No" MS is not following Google. You point out that I open with a question "is MS following Google and close with the response "No" they are not." And you then present that that partial conclusion (you missed the fuller answer as I pointed out at the beginning of this reply) as if a "No" somehow takes away from what is communicated. Would it have been better if, the answer were, "Yes, they are following Google?"🤔 1 10 hours ago Reply techiez Neither yes MS is following Google nor No MS is not following google is correct. There was no need to start with a sensational headline. A simple headline that says AI - Ms and competition n than an article that explores what MS n Google are doing should have been enough. It almost seems like the attempt was to pit ms fans n not so ms fans against each other for debates n gain some traffic 0 2 hours ago Reply Donny James Dang dude he just schooled you.

I'd like to see what you make of that, Jason.  Othwerwise, great read as always.  Thank you for your insights. 0 11 hours ago Reply Xeongui Is Microsoft following Google's lead on AI? Microsoft doesn't follow, if they can't buy it, they misappropriate it for their own use, and what they don't understand, they tend to destroy, it's human and Microsoft nature. -3 11 hours ago Reply luisvase In other words, Microsoft is realizing that there's a new thing emerging around the corner and, unlike the smartphone market, it wants to make sure it does not miss the boat again like it did 0 10 hours ago Reply CrazyQwert However I think that will be hard, since they are missing just that: Smartphones. The devices we bring along every day. That we interact most often with. Integration can only go so far if they do not own the platform and currently google is the one who does own it and so they will have a major advantage and give microsoft a hard time. They can only hope that the next big device-trend that will emerge from smartphones will be one, where their positon is stronger. Otherwise they will loose this battle pretty badly imo. 1 3 hours ago Reply Lukas Taves I don't think they are following, they are certainly not an year late, Build 2016 was all about Inteligent cloud, Bots and AI for Ms as well, and that's been a trend ever since the Mobile First, Cloud First days. It's just an industry wide push towards unleashing all the processing power available at the could towards making our lifes easier, and something all the big cloud providers are doing. 0 10 hours ago Reply Rodrigo Badran Kalil Na minha opinoão a Microsoft está no caminho certo.

Right near the article you answer the question. "So, no, Microsoft is not following Google's AI efforts." However, this smacks of yellow journalism. 0 7 hours ago Reply ScubaDog It's really this simple (in idea, not necessarily execution): Microsoft needs to develop Cortana into what Jarvis is to Tony Stark.  Maybe not with that personality, but the ubiquitousness and the ability to be proactive as well as reactive.  Cortana still is best on the Windows phones.  But, as I've said many, many times, Cortana is NOT omnipresent.  She is multi-present.  She is a completely separate entity on ever single device you have her on. Which is why I will NOT waste my money on that stupid Harman-Kardon speaker. Yet another piece of hardware battling with my other hardware to hear, understand and react to my commands.  Microsoft's approach to AI will begin to mature when Cortana recognizes ME, absolutely uniquely, and does so as ONE entity regardless of how many devices are within earshot (or, eventually, visual range).  1 7 hours ago Reply gchand05 Security however is a concern. The thought is that the more an AI knows about me, the more useful it is but at the cost of my personal security. I think Apple has a slight ACE up their sleave here. They state that security is its utmost importance. Consumers hear this and think that Siri is the the best AI even though it lacks features compared to Google and Microsoft. This could be damaging to microsofts efforts. How will they manage this narrative when to the consumer they are getting hit by malware/infections (ie. Wannacry) regularly and Apple keeps saying they are the most secure. 0 2 hours ago Reply unmorphed Considering that Build was before I/O and comparing the keynote speeches by each CEO, I'd say it's just the opposite with Nadella delivering a clearer more eloquent vision than his counterpart. I'm not alone in this opinion, I've read multiple articles stating the same thing. 0 6 hours ago Reply Jason Ward Hi unmorphed actually I was comparing Googles Sunadar Pichai's statement from a 2016 interview (and the AI focus of I/O 2016 later in the piece) to Nadella's keynote statements this year, 2017. Excerpt from beginning of article: "Google's CEO Sundar Pichai said in an interview just before Google I/O *2016* that he's "on a journey from mobile to AI." The interview further expounded: "Pichai is also focused on shifting Google's journey from '*mobile-first to AI-first.'"* Thanks for jumping in!🙂 The advantage Google has is their consumer success. Google Now and Assistant have more mindshare than Cortana which from a consumers perspective makes it appear Googles ahead. Computer and cloud i intelligence is far deeper than assistants' as we know and Microsoft's platform position with integrating intelligence in products, Services etc is "invisible" to many consumers. Thanks again! 0 5 hours ago Reply Drael646464 I think there might be more money here in enterprise. Farmers, manufacturers, labourers can all use IoT in a way that improves business. For the average person, turning the lights on when you get home, or playing your favourite tune when you get into the bath would be nice, but its more of a luxury, and as such, not as worth the expenditure. By contrast enterprise would spend millions, billions, for the right AI/IoT products.  That's not to say consumers won't use AI or IoT products, just that I doubt they'll have rapid product adoption, or be wildly profitable for quite some time yet. Makers would have to prove some functional or entertainment value. ATM its mostly gimmicky. I think google knows its in trouble. A large company like apple could take dark data (the internet), catergorize it into tags, and use those tags to match topic questions via AI (interestingly apple recently brought the former, and partnered into the later via IBM).   A purely content based search would beat a marker based one hands down. Perhaps thats a machine learning product that would be very hard to create, given its broader and more complex than most such applications, but if anyone ever makes one, and they have mindshare like apple does, they could kill googles core business virtually overnight.  0 1 hour ago Reply Drael646464 Just as interestingly Apple also hired a project manager for a "search engine capable of supporting hundreds of millions of users", or at least placed an ad for such, back in 2015. Google ought to be focusing less on hobbies like daydream, chromeOS and android - and instead watching their back. If apple makes a superior search based on AI, it could be very very bad for google.   0 1 hour ago Reply Drael646464 Also this -https://www.macrumors.com/2017/05/26/apple-neural-engine-ai-chip/   0 1 hour ago Reply vEEP pEEP Google is doing very cool things!  I like Google Lens. Cortana is no slouch either.  I don't think MS is following Google...they planned this... Good things to come from each company! 0 3 hours ago Reply Drael646464 The intelligent edge is a noticeable difference in strategy, having a cloud based logic system, that THEN can become local is interesting. I hope MS extends this to all their machine learning efforts - we really do not want cloud latencies for every machine learning based task. Yes its handy, if your machine (like a phone) doesn't have the juice, but if your machine does - why should we suffer the delays?  0 1 hour ago Reply johnh3 We will see. But I think Google and Amazon got a strong start with voice speakers. I am afraid that Cortana will meet the same faith as Windows Phone/Mobile, out to late to compete. Microsoft in general are early in to ideas but very slow to act. Look at Android, Audi and Volvo will built in that system in the car. So Google is much in to IoT, machin learning stuff.  But who know, maybe Nadella will pull it of. Time will tell. 0 1 sec ago Reply 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2016 Mobile Nations • Terms and Conditions • Privacy Policy • Careers: Writer | Dev • Licensing • External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

This is a symbol that you use to calibrate your headset, so that Google Cardboard virtual reality apps and YouTube movies show up as best as possible. Google, unfortunately, was not my friend — apparently, this particular QR code had not yet been uploaded by anyone. But I’m not someone who’s just willing to sit around and wait for other people to do the work. Especially when I can get a blog post out of it. And there’s a QR Code Generator that Google has created for folks to use. Of course, this generator is designed to be used by the manufacturers themselves, but it turned out that it wasn’t too difficult for a mere human to do it, either. Getting started with the Viewer Profile Generator. I loaded up the official website on my computer, then picked up my smartphone — a Samsung Galaxy S6, pulled up a QR code reader app, and scanned the QR code. Or you could also type in the URL provided. It opened up a tool on my smartphone that is synched with the form on my computer screen. The phone loaded the tool and asked me for the “pixels per inch” value of my device. I Googled “samsung galaxy s6 pixels per inch” and got 577. Easy enough. It asked me to touch the screen to switch to full-screen view, then I got a bunch of lines on the screen. Viewer calibration screen. Now, back to the website on my computer. I skipped the part about adding my company name and device name, since I’m not the actual manufacturer — and I still have hopes that the manufacturer themselves will come through and create an official code.   Google’s Viewer Profile Generator for Google Cardboard-compatible headsets. So, first, it asked me for the primary button type. This headset doesn’t have any buttons — but it does allow me to touch the screen. That’s probably as good as having a touch-style button on the headset itself, so I selected “touch.” Then it asked me for the screen-to-lens distance. I’m supposed to use calipers to measure this. Measuring the distance between the viewer’s lenses and the smartphone screen. (Image courtesy Google.) I don’t own a pair of calipers, but I do have measuring tape. I got 55 millimeters. Then they had me measure the distance from the center of one lens to the center of the other. That came out to 65 millimeters. My lenses were adjustable, so, per their instructions, I set them at the middle setting for this measurement. Then they asked me how the phone is aligned. Some headsets — like the FireFly — have the phone positioned so that it’s centered in all directions. As you can see with this particular set, however, the phone is just dropped in and sits at the bottom of the two clips. So I chose “bottom” for the vertical alignment. Then they had me measure the distance from the bottom of the tray — in my case, the bottom of those clips — to the center of the lenses. That came out to 40 millimeters in this particular case. Now comes the tricky part — the distortion coefficients. This is what adjusts for the curvature of the lenses. Here is where the magic happens. Since the online form is synched to the tool running on the smartphone, you can adjust the coefficients — using the little up and down arrows — and see the immediate effect on the phone. I adjusted the k1 value up and down and a value of 0.15 seemed to work the best. Then I did the same for k2, and got 0.22. That was it. I clicked the “Generate Profile” button and got my QR code: Baofeng Small Mojing QR Code qr_viewer_profile I added this code to my QR Codes page, for anyone else to use. I’m going to follow the same process and create QR codes for other headsets in my collection that don’t have official QR codes released yet. Do you have a headset that you created a QR code for?

Follow me on Twitter @MariaKorolov. White Bunny Thanks Maria! This was quite helpful. gnico Hi Maria, will one be added soon for the Autonomous Teleport VR Headset? I’m unable to find a QR Code for it anywhere. I received it from Indigogo a few days ago and I feel as though its not calibrated for the apps I have. Maria Korolov A reader just asked for a QR Code for the Teleport 3D camera and headset: https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/teleport-save-share-your-best-memories-via-vr#/ I don’t have one, but I see that in the comments, someone has already asked for one. I’ll keep an eye out, and if they post one, I’ll add it to my list (http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/faq/vr-headset-qr-codes/). Maria Korolov The manufacturer got back to me, and I’ve added it to my QR Codes page. And here it is as well: alberto please help me, i m tryng to generate qr code for model zte nubia z7 and i cant:( i dont understand why… on line exist for mini version, that s not same. please help me. Maria Korolov The ZTE Nubia Z7 is a phone, not a headset. A viewer QR code is based on the viewer — how its lenses are configured, mostly. The same QR Code is then used on any smartphone. What headset do you have? Raul B. Thanks for the QR, Maria! I also have a couple of Baofeng Small Mojing, but black and purple instead of pink. I’ve tried your QR on them, but it doesn’t work as expected (maybe mine are from a different batch). I’ve generated QRs adapted to my headsets for two positions of the lenses: “centered” position (62mm) and “near” position (57mm). Maybe you want to add them to your QR collection as alternative QRs for this headset… Maria Korolov Could also be because I have weird eyes! This is why I haven’t been making as many QR codes as I could be — I have a different prescription on each eye. Thanks for the QR Codes! Maria Korolov A reader sent me this image, that may be useful for people calibrating their Cardboard-compatible viewers, which you can download here: http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/download/vr-test-image-file/ It’s a 3D image, so I can’t just attach it here. You’ll also need a special app to display it, MPO Viewer for Cardboard: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dmitrybrant.android.cardboardmpo&hl=en Nicolas Eshraghi I have the fiit vr headset and i have made so many profiles and looked all over the internet but no qr codes work for me please help! Maria Korolov What problems are you getting when you use the FiiT QR Code from our QR Codes page? http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/faq/vr-headset-qr-codes/ Are you able to successfully recognize the QR Code with your Google Cardboard app and switch viewers? Do you have a particular kind of distortion of the image? Nicolas Eshraghi I still have double vision when I use it Maria Korolov Double vision can also be caused by the smartphone not being perfectly centered in the viewer. One thing you can try is moving the smartphone to the right or left a little bit, while looking through the viewer, and seeing if that helps the double vision issue. Another reason is that your eyes could be farther apart or closer together than the headset makers planned for. on the FiiT, you should be able to move the lenses closer or farther apart — does that help? Another possibility is that there’s something about the combination of you, your smartphone, the viewer, and the QR Code that just doesn’t work. Can you try the headset using someone else’s smartphone? Can you have someone else try the viewer? And do all the FiiT QR codes cause the same double-vision effect for you? Here are the QR Codes again. Alvin Hey, can you help me to generate the qr code for gruu vr kit? Thanks Maria Korolov This one here? http://www.unomax.com/gruuvr It’s just a rebranded Ritech Riem II.

I get double vision on my Tiger headset as well and googled for a Profile and got to your post. DanCJ This is the best I managed. To get rid of the double vision in some apps I had to lie to the generator about the distance between the lenses, but it seems to work okay. I printed it out and sellotape it to the inside of my goggles for easy access. Maria Korolov Thanks! I just added it to my QR codes page: http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/faq/vr-headset-qr-codes/ Eduardo Guzmán Do you have the qr code for xiaomi vr??? I dnt find in every internet! Thanks!!

Maria Korolov That was weird. Here is the QR codes page again: http://www.hypergridbusiness.com/faq/vr-headset-qr-codes/ Gil I’m not very tech savvy but I don’t understand what to do with these QR codes… I have a Samsung S7 and a Gear VR… I used it already without any kind of QR code. Also, I may be getting a Fiit VR 2S to use with non-Oculus VR Apps. How do you use the QR code and how will it affect how the phone works with the Gear VR? Can I go back and forth or do I need to do something with the QR code each time I change headsets? Thanks in advance… Maria Korolov The Gear VR is a separate thing, and talks to the phone via a wired connection. It is totally completely separate from the Google Cardboard ecosystem — uses different apps, different standards, different app store, different sensors, everything. A standard Google Cardboard-type viewer doesn’t have any built-in electronics and can’t talk to the phone, so it can’t tell the phone how the lenses are set up, etc… So the QR Code tells the phone how to adjust the picture so that it looks right in your headset.

Now that’s changing as multiple assistants proliferate to multiple phones. It sounds like an epidemic case of multiple-personality disorder but it’s actually a step toward a future in which the artificially intelligent entities will take over our gadgets and make them more powerful and easier to use. Google Assistant, the unimaginatively named software that pops up on Android phones when you say “OK Google”, is now available for iPhones. You can’t ask it to take a selfie or perform some other tasks — Apple keeps that functionality for its own Siri — but you are free to enjoy its superior speech-recognition technology. With some technical skill, you can also run Google Assistant on Windows systems alongside the native digital assistant, Cortana (which, in turn, has been available on Android and iOS for a while). Since millions of people are using Alexa, the helpful voice inside the Echo speaker, smartphone maker HTC’s new flagship phone, the U11, responds to both “OK Google” and “Alexa!”. Samsung’s Galaxy S8, for its part, includes both Google Assistant and the Korean company’s own Bixby. In other words, the digital assistants are getting untethered from makers and even operating systems. Soon, they will supersede them: The assistant becomes the primary interface, and the user doesn’t really care about what’s under the hood unless he or she is a determined geek. But that shift is predicated on improvements to voice interaction technology that have eluded developers so far. Whatever the makers of these systems claim about their voice recognition technology, it’s highly imperfect — there are lots of funny examples on Reddit’s r/SiriFail. So Google is adding keyboard input support to Assistant, and camera support will also come soon, the company announced at its developer conference. That means we’ll be able to train the phone’s camera on a flower or a building, and it’ll tell us what it is, or translate text from a foreign language without a special app. The idea is that the digital assistant will do all the work for the user. If you want to post to Facebook, for example, you won’t need to open the app — the assistant will give you a window to do it; if you’re trying to figure out if the restaurant in front of you is worth entering, you won’t need to google it or bring up the Yelp app, just train the camera on the sign and the assistant will give you all the relevant information. The benefits for the user are obvious. Eventually, it may become unnecessary to install apps on a phone — the assistant will just pull the necessary data from various services in the cloud. Digital assistant developers, for their part, can point users toward their own services, something vitally important for Google and Amazon but also helpful for Microsoft and Apple. Sure, that will probably prompt antitrust complaints, but regulators are taking years to consider such cases even with more easy-to-understand technology. In 2010, the European Commission started its investigation of how Google allegedly prioritises its own shopping comparison service in search results; the case is still dragging on. By the time it’s over, new technology will be in place that may take watchdogs another decade to parse, and since the assistants are powered by artificial intelligence, developers will have a new defence: These algorithms have a life of their own, and it won’t always be possible to completely control their choices. Now, people hardly ever use the digital assistants on desktop and laptop computers, very often on home speakers and not that frequently on phones. Talking to a gadget when you’re not driving a car remains a turn-off for many people (and for me, definitely). Only 18 per cent of smartphone users call up the assistants daily. The speakers, however, will be niche products for a long time. Not everyone can think of a use for them. Phones, however, are ubiquitous — and suddenly the whole market is up for grabs for the company that develops the perfect digital assistant and makes it the interface of choice. That’s why Samsung, for example, believes it can get in the game — and why Amazon is already in it. The mission is far from trivial. Artificial intelligence needs training to get better, and that means more interactions with humans. Companies need to entice customers to use highly imperfect products. That takes a lot of hype and some quick improvement, otherwise disappointed phone users will drift away. Google and Amazon appear to be the most determined developers at this point, but there’s still time (not that much) for Apple and Microsoft to catch up. In the end, getting the digital assistants to take over our gadgets is a collaborative effort between developers, users and machine-learning algorithms. It’s not quite clear yet if a complete takeover is even possible; that depends on whether the algorithms ever get as good at giving us what we want as we are at getting it manually (an increasingly relative term). But given the enormous resources being invested into this play, it’s likely to bring about change in the way we use our communication devices even if it doesn’t succeed 100 per cent.

Google is now offering four free months of Google Play Music for new subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:17pm PDTMay 26, 2017 43 Plus 1 on G+ 312 Share on Facebook 65 Share on Twitter Total Shares420 Google News Right now it looks like Google is running a special offer for Google Play Music. New subscribers that sign up here can get four free months of service instead of the usual three. No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it. It could save you an extra $10. Again, this particular offer is only for new subscribers. I've been a fan of Play Music for a long time, though the device removal limit does get in the way when you switch between devices and ROMs as often as I do. Being able to mix your own library with those of a service also comes in handy. That way I can continue to support artists I am passionate about, without eschewing the larger selection of a subscription offering for the purposes of content discovery, all while being able to fill the gaps in that library. There are a lot of different music services out there, but if you're interested combining your curated library with music available via a subscription, then your options are limited. Spotify does allow you to play back locally stored files, which is convenient, but it isn't quite the same. Amazon also allows you to upload your music for playback via Amazon Music, and with Amazon Prime membership, you get a small library of streaming music to go along with that. For $10 a month ($8 for Prime members) you can access their full library as well. But, Google Play Music has a great interface and plugs nicely into all the other Google services we love. Maybe with this new offer, it's time you gave Google Play Music a chance? After all, even if it doesn't end up working out, you still got four free months of music out of the deal.

Carson Saldanha Wait, wdym 3 different countries? Did you share it with others or something? Ailín Ó’S I live in Ireland, so that's my main account. I have a secondary account based in England as part of a mail forwarder service I use, and my bf is Greek so I had him check the code on his account :) Carson Saldanha Oh wow! Carson Saldanha Hey, since I know it worked for you, are you able to use YouTube Red along with this Play Music free trial? Because my YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled for me. Ailín Ó’S No, unfortunately not as I live in the EU and YouTube Red is only available in USA. Carson Saldanha Weird, I'm in the US though. Ailín Ó’S Ooh that is odd. Sign out of the app then sign back in maybe? Carson Saldanha No luck :( I'm in contact with Google support atm Hopefully they can sort this out Mike Worth it alone for Youtube Red MisterAlex Sweet, I wasn't sure if that was included. Thanks. Should mention that in the main blog post. Ben Still no student membership >:( Ailín Ó’S Spotify is a great alternative @€$£5/month. Ben I know that's what I use just because it's half the price. Ailín Ó’S In Ireland Vodafone have a partnership with Spotify whereby it costs €5 standard instead of €10 regardless of if you're a student or not, they even bundle it with some of their plans. Vodafone do the same in some other countries they operate in (not all). Maybe see if any network in your country has a partnership like that? Worth a shot! Ben Oh yeah I'm on EE in the UK and I've got Apple Music for free for 6 months but like iTunes is a massive stinking turd. Ailín Ó’S I'd rather go back to the days of getting music via Bluetooth from friends than use crApple Music 😂😂 Rahul Krishna In india, we have play music for 1.4 usd/month Julian Coronado That's actually what's keeping me away from Play Music. I've used my free months and I loved the Youtube Red too. But as a student, Spotify for $5 / month is too great to pass up on. Cakefish Spotify ftw ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ I don't think this is a new offer, got this a while back. In fact my 4 months is expiring next week. Prefer Spotify over it. Song selection a tad bit weaker, and for foreign songs it tries to translate the song names to English and makes it hard to look up. folkrav I like it, it's way cheaper than Spotify for me - my mother, my sister, my wife and myself each pay 30$ a year and we're set - but Jesus do I hate the clients. I don't like the website's interface, I hate the Android app. But yeah, I'll deal with it cause it's cheap, I guess. Carson Saldanha Got it! Yay! Jim I wish I could somehow get it on my Amazon Echo hahaha. I guess if I had paid for a Google Home it would be worth trying out. Forget vega #getEVGA Why google play music isn't available in my country ? Ailín Ó’S Try Apple Music? They seem to be just about everywhere. Bartek Juszczak My GPM radio's are so good these days I love that Google is so into AI. Whether It's just "I'm being lucky" or radio from a specific song, band or album they very rarely disappoint me these days. I just make sure to thumbs up if it plays a song I particularly love. I am a student and could go cheaper with spotify but the AI generated playlists have me locked in. If it's £5 cheaper but I'm not gonna enjoy it nearly as much then it's not really a good deal. AndTheWorldMayNeverKnow I used the 3 or 4 months free trial during the holidays then bought the family plan for $14.99 a month. 4 people in my family us it and it works great, the app could use some tweaks but it's really good overall. paev If you listen to main stream music it doesn't really matter what service to use. However, if you like something unusual, weird or other languages then Google is a way to go. I found bands on Google music that Spotify displayed as not found. Google also have new synth bands that Spotify doesn't. I'm for Google too. Daniel I discovered that GPM is kinda like a music label. I once went to a section of Google play explaining how indie artists can use GPM like a music label as long as they own all their rights. Ryne Hager Ultraista (among others) keeps me using Google Play Music as well as Spotify. Carson Saldanha Does anyone else who activated the Play Music trial have YouTube Red working as well? My YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled while my Play Music is. Michael Carr I spotted a similar offer a couple of months ago, and I took it after a day or two's thought. Just last week, I moved directly into a family plan. PewPewYoureDead It's hard to recommend Google Play Music until they revamp the UI. Margaritas Ante Porcos Google Music is the only choice in some markets, like Russia, where no Spotify or Pandora are available. There are too many shortcomings in Google Music and Google never shows interest in making services better than below average. I really wonder why Google refuses to become the best at anything. Real magic here. Pixel syndrome all the way. Yet Google Music is on my phone and I use it because there's no choice whatsoever. SupahNin10doh Stupid Dorito logo... Raymond Berger Huh, I just subscribed to the trial but you youtube red hasn't kicked in yet. Any idea how long it takes? h20ray Google Play Music is currently available in select territories and for select account types.

Suggested Sharing is going live in Google Photos for some users Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/25 5:30pm PDTMay 25, 2017 38 Plus 1 on G+ 108 Share on Facebook 70 Share on Twitter Total Shares216 Applications Google News Google Photos is ground zero for the company's crazy machine learning technology. At Google I/O 2017, a number of new features were announced for Photos, including suggested sharing based on who's in a certain photo. But for that to work, Google needs to figure out who is who, and now the Photos web app is asking users to identify what they look like. Upon visiting photos.google.com, you may be welcomed by the above screen. Google already uses machine learning wizardry to match faces to people, so all you have to do is select which face is yours. Once you do that, you'll be able to search for "me" in the Photos search to find pictures of yourself. According to a recent teardown, this option should appear at some point in the Photos app as well, but it didn't for me. Presumably, this will be far more useful once the other features announced at Google I/O show up. Let us know in the comments if you have received the pop-up.

I got the pop up just the other day. I can search for "me" in addition to others such as my daughter's name. John Doe I did but for some reason it shows a photo of me from over 6 years ago even though I have plenty of recent photos LoL Corbin Davenport Yep, my picture was an awful photo of me from several years ago. John Doe I was able to change it by going to people then clicking on the picture and even when you choose a picture with a lot of people in it figures out which one is you and zooms in...creepy bozzykid It doesn't matter what photo you choose of yourself. The rest are all linked to you anyways. This isn't replacing your profile pic. John Doe No but some photos it has not figured out its me or at least when I click on me it doesn't show all the pictures of me but it is good enough to find pictures of me when I was a child which is crazy because I changed a lot. Stakoman Is this US only? would be great if you guys made a "how to enable face recognition google photos" post Suicide_Note Use a US VPN to start using the face recognition. Once you get things setup, you can stop using the VPN, though face recognition should still work. rndusrnm479461 You can use a VPN (get tunnelbear cause it's free) for Android, then clear cache, open photos and enable grouping of faces in the settings. Then you can disable VPN. I did this about a year ago and I've had it ever since without any problem both on Android and on the web. bozzykid I believe it uses one of the firsts photos you have stored. It has already linked the rest to you anyways. Régis Knechtel Not always, apparently, cause it used a recent photo for me. I think it's random. Brendapdaniels Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Defenestratus No. Régis Knechtel "his option should appear at some point in the Photos app as well" It asked to chose my face me today in the android app, while I was setting up a new phone. jcopernicus I accidentally closed the prompt...how to I get it back? Corbin Davenport On the web, go to Settings -> Group similar faces, and there should be an option to pick your face. Yatin No, I'm from India Drakenoid Yes, I'm also from India. Naga Sridhar I am from India too, but are you in India? myssi Pop-up recieved, I'm from Pakistan. Tomáš Petrík And I guess we will be left out in the EU, again :/ Indefinite Implosion I'm in NL and got it a few days ago? A day or two after the announcement maybe (crunch time, so days are a blur). I didn't tip because it doesn't do anything right now so hardly seems worthy of a post. roberto.elena Do you already have "group similar faces" activated? If yes, then you will get this update. Tomáš Petrík No, it is disabled for accounts registered in the EU due to some stupid privacy ruling of the EU. roberto.elena I know, but you can activate it using a VPN (or at least that was possible when they launched Google Photos). Once it's activated, you don't need the VPN anymore, and you get all updates related to face recognition features. Nelson Not correct. I'm in Europe and by using Opera VPN plus Google Photos cache clear the feature appeared Suicide_Note Use a US VPN and you can join the party. Tomáš Petrík It's not about VPN this time. Accounts registered in the EU have facial recognition disabled due to some stupid privacy ruling of the EU. Jens Törnblad That's why you activate the feature with a VPN. Suicide_Note Ah, okay. I wasn't aware of that. Definitely sucks. rndusrnm479461 Get tunnelbear for Android. Choose a US vpn. Clear Google Photos cache -> open it -> enable grouping of faces in the settings. You only have to do this once. I did it a year ago and it has worked ever since on all my devices. Tomáš Petrík It's not about VPN this time, though. Accounts registered in the EU have facial recognition disabled due to some stupid privacy ruling of the EU. rndusrnm479461 Really? I registered mine in EU in ~2008 and activated face grouping in early 2016 without problems. henleyb I got it a day or two ago. Was an old photo but searching for 'me' did bring up correct photos for me so that's something. Looking forward to the sharing stuff next. :) Suicide_Note Haven't seen this popup yet, but on a related note, photo books have gone live for me in the Photos app. Fresh360 My coworker purchased an iPhone 7+ yesterday and I was setting up her apps and when I installed Photos this option actually popped up. I immediately went to my S7 to see did I have it and nothing. Joao Letelier Ummm... I have been able to search for "me" since last year on the photos app on my phone. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6ec05347bcd3f095b697a97df58508cf28a8d34b7fc289baa308796bc81cf2b3.jpg Deeco Skynet. slowly, but surely...

Photo / Getty Images Apple got an early start in artificial intelligence with the 2011 introduction of Siri, a tool that lets users operate their smartphones with voice commands. Now the electronics giant is bringing artificial intelligence to chips. Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way the company's devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence -- such as facial recognition and speech recognition, said the person, who requested anonymity discussing a product that hasn't been made public. Apple declined to comment. Engineers at Apple are racing to catch their peers at Amazon.com and Alphabet in the booming field of artificial intelligence. While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice-recognition, competitors have since been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon's Echo and Google's Home digital assistants. An AI-enabled processor would help Cupertino, California-based Apple integrate more advanced capabilities into devices, particularly cars that drive themselves and gadgets that run augmented reality, the technology that superimposes graphics and other information onto a person's view of the world. "Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI," said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst and co-founder of venture capital firm Loup Ventures. "At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence." Improved Performance Continued below. Related Content Juha Saarinen: Is there a future for streaming music services? Fran O'Sullivan: Joyce vision falls short on key elements Half of lowest earners miss out on Budget perks Apple devices currently handle complex artificial intelligence processes with two different chips: the main processor and the graphics chip. The new chip would let Apple offload those tasks onto a dedicated module designed specifically for demanding artificial intelligence processing, allowing Apple to improve battery performance. Should Apple bring the chip out of testing and development, it would follow other semiconductor makers that have already introduced dedicated AI chips. Qualcomm Inc's latest Snapdragon chip for smartphones has a module for handling artificial intelligence tasks, while Google announced its first chip, called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), in 2016. That chip worked in Google's data centers to power search results and image-recognition. At its I/O conference this year, Google announced a new version that will be available to clients of its cloud business. Nvidia also sells a similar chip to cloud customers. The Apple AI chip is designed to make significant improvements to Apple's hardware over time, and the company plans to eventually integrate the chip into many of its devices, including the iPhone and iPad, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. Apple has tested prototypes of future iPhones with the chip, adding that it's unclear if the component will be ready this year. Apple's operating systems and software features would integrate with devices that include the chip. For example, Apple has considered offloading facial recognition in the photos application, some parts of speech recognition, and the iPhone's predictive keyboard to the chip, the person said. Apple also plans to offer developer access to the chip so third-party apps can also offload artificial intelligence-related tasks, the person said. Developer Conference Apple may choose to discuss some of its latest advancements in AI at its annual developer's conference in June. At the same conference, Apple plans to introduce iOS 11, its new operating system for iPhones and iPads, with an updated user-interface, people with knowledge of the matter said last month. The company is also said to discuss updated laptops with faster chips from Intel. An AI chip would join a growing list of processors that Apple has created in-house. The company began designing its own main processors for the iPhone and iPad in 2010 with the A4 chip. It has since released dedicated processors to power the Apple Watch, the motion sensors across its products, the wireless components inside of its AirPods, and the fingerprint scanner in the MacBook Pro. The company has also tested a chip to run the low-power mode on Mac laptops. In 2015, Bloomberg reported that Apple's culture of secrecy stymied the iPhone maker's ability to attract top AI research talent. Since then, Apple has acquired multiple companies with deep ties to artificial intelligence, has begun publishing papers related to AI research, has joined a key research group and has made hires from the field. In October 2016, Apple hired Russ Salakhutdinov from Carnegie Mellon University as its director of AI research.

A source familiar with Google’s plans says the new program will focus on early-stage startups. Where the new investment seems to differ most from Google’s existing investing groups is that it’s led by engineers, not venture capitalists. Google VP of engineering Anna Patterson, whose focus as an executive is AI, is in charge of the effort, according to Axios. One thing we don’t know about the new program is how strategic its focus is. Will Google be looking to partner with or acquire portfolio companies, or will investing be more focused on returns? Here are a few startups that reflect areas in which Google may be interested in investing: Imagen This New York-based startup has reportedly raised $15 million to apply AI to analysis of medical images for earlier disease detection. That sounds like something up the alley of Google, which has a lot of interest in computer vision, and Google parent company Alphabet at large, which counts two health care subsidiaries in its ranks. Imagen also has a former Googler as VP of engineering, according to LinkedIn. Diffbot Here’s another one in the computer vision area. Diffbot extracts information from websites, which sounds a bit like the “copyless paste” feature expected in the new version of Android, Android O. The company has raised $10 million, according to AngelList. Anodot Anodot automates the detection of outliers in large datasets. This could be a useful for enterprise companies crunching data in the the cloud. Anodot has raised $12.5 million in funding.

What I do love about Apple is its support for third-party keyboards. You can ditch the generic offering and download enough keyboards for every conceivable customisation option you want. Image credit: John Moore/Getty Keep in mind you don't have to commit. Don't be afraid to install more than one keyboard! If I'm looking for some particular animated image I'll use GIPHY Keys more than Gboard, but during normal texting hours or when typing in a note-taking app like Bear, swipe-friendly keyboards are my tool of choice. Gboard (Android, iOS) Google's keyboard (available for iOS and Android) is packed with just enough features to be useful but not too many to be cumbersome or unwieldy. It's been my keyboard of choice since its debut, thanks to its simple search integration: In true Google fashion, you can search from the keyboard itself and send links as well as descriptive cards to recipients. Its responsive swipe functionality is great for popping in and out, while other keyboards I've tried in the past were somewhat sluggish in acknowledging my swiping as spelling. You can pull images and GIFs from Gboard to send or save (though the results sometimes differ between its desktop and Gboard searches). Sure, you can type on it like a traditional keyboard, but Gboard also features glide typing — swiping your finger across letters to spell words — just like Swype and Swiftkey, and it learns from your history to improve its predictive search and text suggestion without transmitting personal data to the company. If you're on a bigger phone, the combination of glide typing and a one-handed typing setting on Gboard is a godsend, and makes texting easier and less stressful on your weak human form. Like talking to your phone? Gboard supports text dictation just like Apple's keyboard. Gboard for Android packs in a few more extra features than its iOS counterpart, including language auto-detection complete with autocorrect and suggested text, as well as live translation. Word Flow (iOS) Unfortunately Word Flow is not yet in the Australian store, but we figured it still deserved a shout out for its unique design. Made by a team in Microsoft's experimental Garage division, Word Flow's easy one-handed use lets me knock some text off even while straphanging. Its standout feature is its curved keyboard mode: The keyboard sits in the corner of your screen and makes it easy for your thumb to reach every letter. You can even glide type while it's curved, and see its suggested text (though the curvature reduces the selection choice list). The built-in web search powered by Bing lets you copy and paste images and GIFs, too. If you're suffering from thumb trouble during your typing sessions or just want to be able to reach your keys without two hands, then this is definitely a keyboard to test. 60 Keyboard Shortcuts For Popular Office Apps (Infographic) Of course, you may not need all 60 of these, but knowing them will make you flexible, fast, and ready to work with whatever tool you're presented with, whether it's a Windows PC, a Mac, an Excel spreadsheet, or a Powerpoint slideshow. Plus, there are extras in here for Gmail and Chrome to boot. Read more Swiftkey (Android, iOS) With SwiftKey, Microsoft now has two different keyboards in Apple's app store. Swiftkey just got a much-needed redesign and with it a more minimal, functional look. It's also more responsive than before, registering swipes quickly enough. It supports swipe typing like Gboard and Word Flow, and custom themes in case you want to add colours to your keycaps. Hooking Swiftkey up to your Facebook or Google account gives it access to your data (it's encrypted before leaving your device, and Swiftkey doesn't have your login information) that it uses to personalise your autocorrect functionality as well as predictive text suggestions. It will even show you how it's adjusting your typing style and how much time you're saving by not tapping away at letters. It also has a few tricks up its sleeve if you're looking to expand your language options — a recent update boosted support to over 100 languages. GIPHY Keys (iOS) I like GIFs. You like GIFs. We all like GIFs. Why not use a GIF-friendly keyboard? In terms of typing, you won't find anything revolutionary here. You'll be tapping away just like before. Giphy Keys isn't as full-featured as Gboard, nor does it feature glide typing functionality like Swype. It's cute, though — and it blows the competition out of the water in terms of GIF search functionality. Giphy is the gold standard of GIF integration across the web, especially since it lets you access the Betaworks company's repository of both pop culture and original GIF content through its slew of categories — or you can search them yourself from the keyboard.

[Update: Now $75 Off] Deal Alert: Pixel 32GB (international version) is $50 off on eBay Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:20pm PDTMay 26, 2017 2 Plus 1 on G+ 27 Share on Facebook 38 Share on Twitter Total Shares67 Deals News Pixel Update 1: 2017/05/26 2:32pm PDT It looks like the price has dropped another $25, making this a $75 savings in total. For a device that hasn't seen much in the way of price drops or It's no secret that Google has had some serious supply issues with its flagship Pixel phone. That goes for pretty much any combination of size, color, or storage. Rumors even began to surface alleging that Google had stopped production of the devices altogether. That wasn't the case, but nonetheless, you will still struggle to actually find the Pixel if you wish to buy it. A 32GB Pixel (international version) on eBay for $50 off the list price could be the answer to that problem. This is the entry level 5" Pixel, with 32GB of storage in the color Very Silver - and it's available for $599. That's $50 less than the $649 Google is still charging for it. Beware though, this is the international version of the device. So if you live in the US you'll have to check the bands to see if it works on your network. This version won't play nice with Verizon or Sprint, so if you're on either of those carriers you can rule this out. If you live outside the US then this is definitely for you. Shipping appears to be free in the US, but here in the UK, it's $18.99. That still works out a bargain for me, especially if you account for the exchange rate. You'll have to do the sums from where you are to see if the deal is as good for you. It's worth mentioning that getting your warranty honored might be tough with this type of purchase, so bear that in mind. It's hard to say how many of these they have, other than a "limited quantity," so you'll have to be quick if you want to get your hands on arguably the best Android phone of 2016. Update 1: 2017/05/26 2:32pm PDT It looks like the price has dropped another $25, making this a $75 savings in total. For a device that hasn't seen much in the way of price drops or sales since launch, $75 off isn't bad. Anyone interested in a Pixel that uses a network compatible with this international model should give it a serious think.

Then I'll get one. shamatuu that will never happen james fuston Looks like we found the one guy still using a Fire Phone. Middlefinger As a back up phone yeah, its not reliable enough to be a daily driver. Its problems seem to be a mixture of hardware bugs, and Googles poor software QC. me me "bargain" JL "buggy" Gladysrcrosby Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job. Even everyone not used to this, can make $89/per h easily and the earnings can go even higher over time... This is how i started !so184c: ➽➽ ➽➽;➽➽ http://GoogleFinancialCashJobs474MarketConsultantGetPaid$97/Hour... ★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫★★★✫::::::!so184c:....,.... abc "bezel" Master Yates After handling a S8, OMG those Bezels. Max Johnson "blacklisted" Middlefinger Even at $99 its not worth the bugs. It doesnt matter how 'high end' a device is, if it doesn't work properly, its worthless. jonzey231 $50 is worth a guarantee that Google will honor the warranty....trust me...I wish I would've gotten my 6P direct. Andy What do you mean? jonzey231 If you don't buy the phone from Google, they won't help you. They send you to the manufacturer. I was forced to go to Huawei for my 6P and it was a little over 3 weeks before I got it back....and the problem is still there. Spend the extra $50 and buy it through Google so you're guaranteed to get support through their CS channels. You'll be glad you did in 6 months when something inevitably goes wrong. IMHO get the OnePlus 3T. Costs less but has better overall specs aside from the camera which is still pretty good in its own right. My brother has one and my roommate just got his last week and they both have no intention of going back to a major brand ever again. YaKillaCJ Same happened when I got the OnePlus One. It changed the way I (and many others) view a "budget" device from an unknown brand. needa I felt the same way after using an OPO for nearly three years. Got me an XL in mint condition for $450. Google edition even. Still had 3520 mAh in the batt too. Would have bought the black 3T had they been in stock. Took me three days to hunt down this deal. Andy Got my wife the pixel. Runs great. Just had the microphone problem. Google swapped without question. Wife seems to think it takes horrible selfies. Rod Weird, as it's cameras are regarded among the best currently. Random! @andy maybe you should let her know that the camera isn't the problem... It's actually her face. If you do warn her about this, I promise to visit you at the hospital. Andy Thanks for the tip. Master Yates Agreed with you regarding the 3T. Lets see if the excellent updates and support evaporate when the One Plus 5 is released? That's the real test. IcerC Except in this case Google is the Manufacturer, that might change things. ddevito #Fail Andy S8 release response? AdMoc Does not ship to Poland as fck always -_- Random! Look for some service like Shipito. I believe they have an EU warehouse. Shakil Shaikh $60 shipping? kristin ANY Pixel made by google is compatible with any provider. It doesnt matter if its international or not. This writer is an odiot. Scott Scrivens https://www.techwalls.com/google-pixel-pixel-xl-model-number-differences/ Kevin Davis "Odiot", lmao. 😂 Oh, and you're wrong, too. kristin I called google about this. It would be up your phone company provider whether it worked or not. So it may not work with att or tmobile either. kristin This may or may not work on any provider. Its up to the provider. You want a pixel? Go to swappa.com and get one used in mint condition for much cheaper. Ive gotten a few phones from them since ive been on project fi and had no issues. Ill never buy a new phone again. Random! $50 off? How cute... If they get to $300 off ($350 final price) within a month, I might even convince myself it's worth to stare at those bezels everyday. Other than that (impossible) scenario, I'd rather get the 3T, Axon 7, or even the LG G5. iKon The most overrated smartphone of 2016. Only the camera is decent. Ugly ass design, overpriced and dull with no features compared to competition nirmitlamed Google is so off track in figuring out what customers wants and competing against the other monstrous companies. I would very much like to hear how many Pixels Google sold in the last year since they told us they sold more than they expected.

Google is working on a solution to the problem. By Martin Pratt 27 May 2017 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share by email Google updates its Android smartphone operating system every year. Android O is on the horizon, but has your phone even updated to Android N? It takes too long to get updates to Android smartphones and finally Google has a plan to fix that. Google’s answer to the update roadblock is Project Treble, which completely retools the Android architecture making it easier for device manufacturers to update their phones. Just 7.1% of the two billion active Android devices are running Android N, while around 360 million devices are still using Android K, which released in 2013. Project Treble is unlikely to be of any use to anyone still using KitKat, but the changes to the underlying Android architecture could help future phones from HTC, Samsung and LG stay up to date. The chart below shows how the vast majority of Android phone users are on out of date versions. Best Buy smartphones – the best reviewed phones on the market. How does Project Treble work? To understand how Project Treble works it’s good to know why it needs to exist. Manufacturers such as Samsung, LG and HTC use Android in everything from their budget handsets to their flagship ranges. When Google announces a new version of Android the manufacturers begin the long process of adapting it to work with their phones. First off, they need to determine which phones can handle the new OS. The latest phones shouldn’t have any problems, but older, less powerful models may have difficulty running the new features. Our own testing has discovered phones that get worse after an OS update, so slapping a new version of Android onto a manufacturers entire range isn’t a good idea. The sheer amount of time it takes to adapt a new OS to a phone means adding it to older phones just isn’t worth the hassle. Phone manufacturers like to add their own special flavour to the stock Android OS. Samsung has TouchWiz, HTC has Sense, but whichever brand you go for there will be some kind of overlay. It takes time to get these extra features working with new versions of Android. Once the manufacturers have adapted their overlays to work with the new OS there is a period of testing to ensure that there are no problems. Providers like Vodafone and EE run their own tests too, which causes further delays. When the update is finally ready it will be released in selected countries. The staggered push of the update is a final test to see whether the new OS is working. By releasing it to countries with a smaller number of users, the manufacturers and networks can identify any last minute problems before they unleash it onto the millions of smartphones in the UK and America. Being a country of smartphone users we’re too risky for the first wave, but conversely we are a priority once the manufacturers are confident their phones behave themselves after the update. Project Treble aims to cut down how long it takes to roll out updates by separating the Android operating system from the ‘Vendor interface’. This interface handles the mundane, but important, low-level software and drivers. Previously it would be up to device manufacturers to adapt the vendor interface, a laborious process of code rewriting. Project Treble removes this lengthy process, which leaves the manufacturers free to work on the other aspects of the upgrade. We should get quicker updates and manufacturers may be keen on bringing the new software to older handsets in the future now the method is streamlined. When can we expect speedier updates? Here’s the catch to all this good news, only the Google Pixel is compatible with Project Treble, which means the Samsung Galaxy S8, LG G6 and HTC U11 will have the same update woes they’ve always had – bad news if you were looking to upgrade to a shiny new Android handset in 2017. Despite the current crop of state-of-the-art handsets not being compatible, Project Treble is still a step in the right direction to eradicating one of Android most significant issues.

ROS LBoard 1 US lobby claim: Rafizi dares Najib to file police report FMT Reporters Read More FMT BAHASA FMT BORNEO+ FMT VIDEO CONTRIBUTE NEWS HOME NATION OPINION WORLD LEISURE SPORTS BUSINESS ADVERTISE WITH US Technology, the way forward for businesses Nora Jaswa | May 27, 2017 Google Malaysia advises companies to use technology to the fullest to carve out a niche for themselves in the industry. KUALA LUMPUR: Businesses, especially start-ups, should embrace technology in their everyday operations, says Google Malaysia. Communications head Zeffri Yusof said this would help them leverage on opportunities and assist in managing operations. “Technological software, for example, can help smoothen the gathering of data for a company, and this data can be analysed more accurately to give companies an edge in the market,” he said. Zeffri said a company could be a strong industry player when investments in technology were prioritised. “Take Google Maps, for example. We use layers of data using a global information system, or GIS, to create accurate coordinates and give more information about a place,” he said. He added that using data to create visualisations would give a company a wider overview of its operations and expedite decision-making. It will also eventually optimise a company’s operational cost, he said. Google Malaysia emerged first in a recent survey by JobStreet.com of the top 10 companies Malaysians aspire to work for. The survey involved 10,241 Malaysian employees across all position levels. According to the survey, Malaysians prioritise career development opportunities, citing this as the main reason they would want to work with top companies. Using its technology, Google gathers online data on its candidates to determine the best fit. “With the data, Google Malaysia has derived our own formula to find the best candidate and refine our search,” Zeffri said. The US-based tech giant is not the only company that uses technology as its main enabler. Recently, UEM Edgenta, a company providing asset management services to clients around the world, said it has plans for greater use of technology to streamline its three core offerings. Managing director and CEO Azmir Merican said UEM Edgenta would use technology enablers, develop smart solutions and make full use of the company’s centralised monitoring facility (CnC) to gain efficiency across its operations. “This is to reduce redundancies and operational expenditure and further showcase our business expertise in end-to-end services to our current and potential customers,” he said.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Get Android O features on any Android phone right now with this free launcher Jacob Siegal @JacobSiegal May 26th, 2017 at 9:01 PM Share Tweet We’re likely still a few months out from the release of Android 8.0, but we got a glimpse at some of its most interesting new features and additions at Google I/O earlier this month. One of the features that Google showed off during the event was called Notification Dots, which are small dots that appear on apps when you have a notification. You won’t be able to try notification dots until Android O rolls out later this year, but you can add an unofficial version of the feature to your phone right now. Don't Miss: New report reaffirms the iPhone 8’s most exciting new feature This week, the first beta for Nova Launcher 5.2 arrived on Google Play. Along with some minor fixes and performances improvements, the latest update adds customizable notification dots to the launcher. You can decide where on the app icon they will appear and how large they will be. And just like the real dots, Nova Launcher’s notification dots will match the color scheme of the app icon they appear on. It’s not an exact replica of the notification dots that will appear on Android O, but if you want to take a trial run of the new feature, this might be the best way to do so, other than downloading the Android O beta. Unfortunately, the Android beta is only available on certain phones, while Nova is universal. If you want to try out the latest version of the Nova Launcher, just opt in on Google Play and wait for the update to arrive on your phone or manually download the 5.2 beta from APKMirror.

Tech Culture by Lynn La May 26, 2017 1:20 PM PDT @lynnlaaa Sergey Brin in 2015. James Martin/CNET Sergey Brin is aiming high. The Google co-founder and current president of Alphabet Inc., is allegedly building the world's biggest airship, according to The Guardian. The craft is supposedly being built in a giant NASA hangar and will measure nearly 650 feet long (or 200 meters). It's estimated to cost around $100 to $150 million dollars. "Sergey is pretty innovative and forward looking," said airship designer Igor Pasternak in an interview with the Guardian. "Trucks are only as good as your roads, trains can only go where you have rails, and planes need airports. Airships can deliver from point A to point Z without stopping anywhere in between." Pasternak worked on the project in its early stages. The airship will deliver food and supplies to remote areas that need humanitarian aid, while at the same time provide luxury air travel to Brin's family and close friends.

Security by Alfred Ng May 26, 2017 2:35 PM PDT @alfredwkng Enlarge Image Thirty-one tech companies are pushing Congress to change the NSA's mass surveillance. PAUL J. RICHARDS/AFP/Getty Images Silicon Valley's giants are tired of US spies standing on their shoulders to see further. In a letter dated Friday and signed by 31 tech companies, including Google, Amazon, Facebook and Microsoft, the firms are asking Congress to make reforms to Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. That's the section that allows the National Security Agency to gather web data of citizens outside of the US -- and in some cases, against Americans. Section 702 was first revealed by whistleblower Edward Snowden in bombshell leaks surrounding the NSA's mass surveillance program. The snooping combed through everything a person did digitally, putting tech companies at odds with the government for years. The section is set to expire by December 31 unless Congress decides to renew the program. Silicon Valley leaders hope the politicians on Capitol Hill choose to change Section 702, instead of renewing it. In the letter (PDF), they offered five recommendations for internet surveillance reform, including greater transparency on how many Americans are swept up in the snooping, narrowing the scope to prevent innocent people from being spied on, and greater oversight on the program. "We are writing to express our support for reforms to Section 702 that would maintain its utility to the U.S intelligence community while increasing the program's privacy protections and transparency," the group wrote. Since 2013, Google has wanted to disclose what data they're legally required to hand over to the government, which the feds prohibit. Apple has faced battles of its own, with the San Bernardino terrorist's locked iPhone and the FBI's order to crack it open. In just the second half of 2016, national security orders for Apple doubled to 6,000 requests since the first half of the year. Apple was not among the 31 tech companies who wrote to House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, a Virginia Republican, on Friday, even while the debate on privacy vs. national security rages on. Apple did not respond to requests for comment on Friday. In March, the Internet Infrastructure Coalition wrote a letter to the Judiciary Committee warning that Section 702 could have "grave economic consequences" if it were not reformed. It's still unclear how many Americans were swept up by the wide-reaching surveillance, but Section 702 is estimated to be behind a quarter of the NSA's snooping in 2014.

Claims that ABC News siphons readers away from Fairfax publications are unfounded. AAP Image/Joel Carrett Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Fairfax CEO Greg Hywood has been busy. His company’s announcement on 3 May 2017 that Fairfax would sack 125 of its newsroom staff led to Sydney Morning Herald and The Age journalists going on strike, at the worst possible time in the Australian political calendar. Meanwhile, media reports highlighted Hywood’s annual pay of over A$7 million – which at a median reported salary for journalists of just over A$51,000 would comfortably pay for the most of the staff laid off in Hywood’s announcement. This is not to say that Hywood does not deserve a CEO-level salary, of course. But in light of the criticism of the job losses at Fairfax, his defence of executive pay levels was tin-eared, to say the least: We pride ourselves on providing above-market salaries… We need good people to work at this business. You don’t fix the issues confronting the media business by doing the same thing again and again, and expecting a different result. Yet here we are again, with more journalists sacked, and no clear indication of how this is going to make Fairfax’s news outlets more attractive. Faced with such questioning from the Senate inquiry into public interest journalism, Hywood resorted to a familiar trope for commercial media executives – blame market distortion by the public broadcaster: The ABC is creating additional pressure on commercial media by aggressively competing for the same audience that commercial media rely on by providing online content for free, undermining our ability to create a sustainable model. However, this seems to be fundamentally ignorant of the fact that for years now, the ABC has done what few commercial news outlets have been prepared to do: promote the news stories published by its competitors. Promoting the work of others The ABC has long partnered with Microsoft’s Bing search engine to include a block of links to related content from elsewhere on the web alongside its own stories. This recognises audiences’ interest in seeing multiple independent angles on the same story. Sadly, commercial outlets like the Sydney Morning Herald (SMH) still lack this basic feature and link only to (often virtually identical) stories on their sister sites, such as The Age. Related links in a recent ABC News article - including to Fairfax property Australian Financial Review. Screenshot by Axel Bruns Rather than siphoning eyeballs from its commercial competitors, could ABC News be a driver of traffic to them, then? Traffic data from Hitwise, which tracks Australian users’ web browsing patterns, can provide an answer to this question. First, let us put these sites in perspective. In order to compare like with like, we’ll use the numbers for ABC News here, rather than visits to the main ABC site with its multitude of non-news content. Hitwise data report that the SMH consistently attracts a much larger volume of visits than ABC News. In March 2017, for instance, its 38.2 million total visits constitute about a quarter more than ABC News’ 29.9 million. The Age receives around 27.5 million total visits over the same period. Neither can compete with undisputed market leader news.com.au, with 72.8 million total visits that month. Put together, visits to these two Fairfax properties are already more than twice as large as those to ABC News, then – if the ABC is undermining Fairfax’s market position, it’s not making a very good job of it. Traffic patterns But this is not a zero-sum game, of course. Visitors to ABC News, aided by its helpful links to external content, may well find themselves heading to the Fairfax outlets for more information. Even in the absence of outbound links from Fairfax, the same might be true in reverse, too. Here, the upstream websites recorded by Hitwise – that is, the sites visited just before coming to the SMH or ABC News – tell an interesting story. The SMH receives the vast plurality of its inbound reader traffic from Google sites: some 38.9% of its traffic enter via Google Australia, Google (international), Google News Australia, or Gmail. Another 7.8% arrive via Facebook or Twitter. Similar patterns hold for other sites: in March, The Age receives 28.2% of its traffic from Google sites, and 9.2% from Facebook or Twitter. For ABC News, those percentages are 26.9% and 7.9%, respectively. news.com.au gets 32.2% of its traffic from Google sites, and 7.9% from social media. ABC News’ outbound links are necessarily a much smaller factor than the connections provided by these internet giants, but should not be ignored. In March, 2.1% of the SMH’s traffic began with readers coming in from ABC sites. For The Age, the percentage is even greater: 2.9% of its traffic originated from ABC sites. But the ABC does not play favourites amongst the commercial sites: 2.2% of news.com.au traffic arrived from here. Such public service is hardly reciprocated, however: only 0.9% of ABC News’ already lower volume of traffic originated from the two Fairfax sites. Empty corporate rhetoric There are deeper traffic patterns that the Hitwise data cannot reveal. What we see here are only the sites visited immediately before – not pages opened independently in another user session, or arrived at through a more circuitous route. And yes, as quality news publications ABC News and the two Fairfax sites do operate in the same market segment, of course. But Hywood’s, and other media executives’, statements continue to assume that online audiences make a conscious binary choice between one outlet and another, and that public service media therefore distort the market. This fails to understand how serendipitous our news discovery has become in an age of search and social recommendations. It also fails to recognise that serious news followers – the core audience for these sites – will often read multiple stories on the same events, from multiple outlets. Not least perhaps because they know that understaffed newsrooms now regularly struggle to cover major issues in sufficient detail. The traffic patterns we have seen here, at any rate, reveal that audiences lost to ABC News should be the least of Greg Hywood’s worries. The major Fairfax sites consistently outperform the ABC in terms of reader traffic, and the public broadcaster is even a net source of visits to the SMH and The Age. Similarly, when Hywood calls for “a level playing field which allows local media to take the necessary steps to compete with Google and Facebook”, he fails to recognise that these platforms are the single greatest source of traffic to Fairfax’s sites. Fairfax, and other news sites, are not competing with Google and Facebook: for better or worse, they fundamentally rely on them for visibility and visitors. Media businesses that cannot adjust to this fact are doomed to struggle. Data on Australian Internet users’ news browsing patterns are provided courtesy of Hitwise.

 Google had an incredible reason for not giving gender pay data to the government: It's too expensive Julie Bort May 26, 2017, 9:08 PM 3,815 facebook linkedin twitter email print Alphabet CEO Larry PageBy Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Google officials were in federal court on Friday to defend its pay practices, pushing back against government allegations that it underpays its women employees. But if the tech giant hoped to prove its fairness to the world, it didn't exactly win many fans with one of its major lines of reasoning. According to a report by The Guardian's Sam Levin, Google's budget-minded lawyers argued in court that the government was being unreasonable in demanding that Google collect and turn over internal compensation data. Why?  The money. Complying with a request by the US Department of Labor  would be too expensive and too logistically difficult, Google's lawyers reportedly argued.  The job would apparently require 500 hours of work and cost $100,000. Note that Google is the world's No.1 internet search engine, with $92 billion in cash and short-term securities on the balance sheet of its parent company, Alphabet.  And given that Alphabet made $6.8 billion in profit before taxes in just the first quarter of 2017, according to Google Finance, the DoL attorney at Friday's court hearing couldn't resist a snarky response, saying "Google would be able to absorb the cost as easy as a dry kitchen sponge could absorb a single drop of water," Levin reports. The US Department of Labor (DoL) has previously accused Google of “systemic compensation disparities." The DoL has filed a lawsuit to compel Google to turn over its internal compensation data. Because Google is a federal contractor, it is required by law to submit employment data to the government as part of routine compliance procedures to prove it is not violating equal employment laws, the DoL says. Occupational segregation Google has consistently denied the accusations that it underpays women and it even tweeted in April that it "closed the gender pay gap globally" meaning it pays women and men equally for equal work worldwide, it says. Its HR site also released a guide that instructs others how they can do the same, including the step called "run a pay analysis." Presumably, this means that Google already has loads of salary data in a form that allows it to be analyzed, at least internally. After the suit went public, job hunting site Glassdoor released its own analysis of Google's pay based on the self-reported salaries submitted by employees. For what it's worth, Glassdoor sided with Google, finding no evidence that Google underpays for equal work. However, Glassdoor also found that women overall at Google are still paid 16% less than the men. That's because, of the women who work at Google, fewer of them have roles within the highest paying jobs at Google. It's a situation called "occupational segregation," and it's a common reason why women earn less than men across the economy, not just at Google, Glassdoor's Chief Economist, Dr. Andrew Chamberlain told Business Insider. In any case, folks on Twitter are not buying the argument that Google can't afford to dig up the salary data that the government is requesting. Women: So, wage data... Google: Sorry... *gold bar falls out of pants* we just don't *lights crate of $100 bills on fire* have the $$$. — Copy McPasty, Writer (@KashannKilson) May 26, 2017     Get the latest Google stock price here.

Patently Apple Home Archives Contact Us Subscribe Twitter Facebook Patently Mobile « The Case about the Downing of an Air Egypt Flight related to Apple Devices is still ongoing with Apple not Involved | Main May 26, 2017 Apple's advances in AI Continue to Surface at a Record Pace as news of a 'Neural Engine' Chip now Emerges   Even though Apple was the first major tech company to adopt a digital assistant for use in their smartphone natively, progress on this front seemed to be at a snails pace. Then out of nowhere Amazon shocked the market with a smarter digital assistant on a home device called Echo. Google Home rapidly followed and their latest upgrade will offer free phone calls within the U.S. and Canada and deeper connectivity to Android. Now Microsoft, Harman Kardon and many tech companies are jumping on the bandwagon with new smart home digital assistant based devices aimed to land on the market this fall.   Even Samsung has technically jumped into the market with Bixby in the last month on their Galaxy S8 that they promise will be integrated into future devices and appliances as part of their IoT roadmap. In fact a new design patent that surfaced on May 16 shows us that they have an advanced Echo-like device with a full flexible display on the drawing board that could run Android as their patent figures suggest below.   We noted in a report back on May 11 that the AI Wars were almost reaching Fever Pitch levels. Almost ever week if not every day there's an AI story surfacing. On May 14 Apple aquired their third major AI company in three years. On the same day we posted a patent report titled "Apple has designed a new Siri Architecture allowing Two Digital Assistants to Communicate with Each Other." Last month we posted a patent report tiled "Apple Patent Reveals a Visual System to Assist Siri in Future Devices to understand Gestures, Activities, & More"   At the top of this month we posted a report titled "Inventec Lands First Order for Apple's Echo-Like Home Device with Siri." Although it's a supply chain rumor, Apple fans hope that this could be a big moment at Apple's WWDC in June. Some believe it will launch this fall. Yet what matters is that Apple brings a new Siri based device into the home to support their Smart Home project and to keep the competition at bay.   Google is crafting the argument that they are the one's to beat in AI without question. Patently Apple covered Google's vision in two reports titled "The Vision of Artificial Intelligence According to the Gospel of Google" and "The Google Manifesto: The Arrival of the AI Revolution."   Apple supplier TSMC sees some of the sand beginning to shift into new directions. Co-CEO Mark Liu.Mobile let if be known last month that while smartphones will still drive the market for them in the short term, that new and innovative features for smartphones and other mobile devices including virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), context-aware computation, and artificial intelligence (AI) and deep machine learning require support of more powerful computing technology." Translation: new chips are on their roadmap to power new technologies and features like VR/AR and AI.   The hint of new advanced chips coming to market gave way this afternoon to a new report by Bloomberg claiming that "Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way the company's devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence -- such as facial recognition and speech recognition." So now the chip will have a name.   The timing of this latest leak about the Apple Neural Engine may have been timed perfectly to start cranking up their developers and fans for the WWDC keynote on June fifth.   The news of advances to Siri in the works have been mounting so fiercely in the last few months that it's now time for Team Apple to knock one out of the park and set their developers on fire for the next phase of Apple AI.   On the flip-side, it's always best to not get over-hyped about anything Apple until it actually unfolds. We know positive things are in the works and they'll roll out whenever Apple is ready to unleash them. But I have to admit, I'm definitely pumped-up for next month's event – are you?   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

Google is now offering four free months of Google Play Music for new subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:17pm PDTMay 26, 2017 43 Plus 1 on G+ 312 Share on Facebook 65 Share on Twitter Total Shares420 Google News Right now it looks like Google is running a special offer for Google Play Music. New subscribers that sign up here can get four free months of service instead of the usual three. No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it. It could save you an extra $10. Again, this particular offer is only for new subscribers. I've been a fan of Play Music for a long time, though the device removal limit does get in the way when you switch between devices and ROMs as often as I do. Being able to mix your own library with those of a service also comes in handy. That way I can continue to support artists I am passionate about, without eschewing the larger selection of a subscription offering for the purposes of content discovery, all while being able to fill the gaps in that library. There are a lot of different music services out there, but if you're interested combining your curated library with music available via a subscription, then your options are limited. Spotify does allow you to play back locally stored files, which is convenient, but it isn't quite the same. Amazon also allows you to upload your music for playback via Amazon Music, and with Amazon Prime membership, you get a small library of streaming music to go along with that. For $10 a month ($8 for Prime members) you can access their full library as well. But, Google Play Music has a great interface and plugs nicely into all the other Google services we love. Maybe with this new offer, it's time you gave Google Play Music a chance? After all, even if it doesn't end up working out, you still got four free months of music out of the deal.

Carson Saldanha Wait, wdym 3 different countries? Did you share it with others or something? Ailín Ó’S I live in Ireland, so that's my main account. I have a secondary account based in England as part of a mail forwarder service I use, and my bf is Greek so I had him check the code on his account :) Carson Saldanha Oh wow! Carson Saldanha Hey, since I know it worked for you, are you able to use YouTube Red along with this Play Music free trial? Because my YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled for me. Ailín Ó’S No, unfortunately not as I live in the EU and YouTube Red is only available in USA. Carson Saldanha Weird, I'm in the US though. Ailín Ó’S Ooh that is odd. Sign out of the app then sign back in maybe? Carson Saldanha No luck :( I'm in contact with Google support atm Hopefully they can sort this out Mike Worth it alone for Youtube Red MisterAlex Sweet, I wasn't sure if that was included. Thanks. Should mention that in the main blog post. Ben Still no student membership >:( Ailín Ó’S Spotify is a great alternative @€$£5/month. Ben I know that's what I use just because it's half the price. Ailín Ó’S In Ireland Vodafone have a partnership with Spotify whereby it costs €5 standard instead of €10 regardless of if you're a student or not, they even bundle it with some of their plans. Vodafone do the same in some other countries they operate in (not all). Maybe see if any network in your country has a partnership like that? Worth a shot! Ben Oh yeah I'm on EE in the UK and I've got Apple Music for free for 6 months but like iTunes is a massive stinking turd. Ailín Ó’S I'd rather go back to the days of getting music via Bluetooth from friends than use crApple Music 😂😂 Rahul Krishna In india, we have play music for 1.4 usd/month Julian Coronado That's actually what's keeping me away from Play Music. I've used my free months and I loved the Youtube Red too. But as a student, Spotify for $5 / month is too great to pass up on. Cakefish Spotify ftw ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ I don't think this is a new offer, got this a while back. In fact my 4 months is expiring next week. Prefer Spotify over it. Song selection a tad bit weaker, and for foreign songs it tries to translate the song names to English and makes it hard to look up. folkrav I like it, it's way cheaper than Spotify for me - my mother, my sister, my wife and myself each pay 30$ a year and we're set - but Jesus do I hate the clients. I don't like the website's interface, I hate the Android app. But yeah, I'll deal with it cause it's cheap, I guess. Carson Saldanha Got it! Yay! Jim I wish I could somehow get it on my Amazon Echo hahaha. I guess if I had paid for a Google Home it would be worth trying out. Forget vega #getEVGA Why google play music isn't available in my country ? Ailín Ó’S Try Apple Music? They seem to be just about everywhere. Bartek Juszczak My GPM radio's are so good these days I love that Google is so into AI. Whether It's just "I'm being lucky" or radio from a specific song, band or album they very rarely disappoint me these days. I just make sure to thumbs up if it plays a song I particularly love. I am a student and could go cheaper with spotify but the AI generated playlists have me locked in. If it's £5 cheaper but I'm not gonna enjoy it nearly as much then it's not really a good deal. AndTheWorldMayNeverKnow I used the 3 or 4 months free trial during the holidays then bought the family plan for $14.99 a month. 4 people in my family us it and it works great, the app could use some tweaks but it's really good overall. paev If you listen to main stream music it doesn't really matter what service to use. However, if you like something unusual, weird or other languages then Google is a way to go. I found bands on Google music that Spotify displayed as not found.

Margaritas Ante Porcos Google Music is the only choice in some markets, like Russia, where no Spotify or Pandora are available. There are too many shortcomings in Google Music and Google never shows interest in making services better than below average. I really wonder why Google refuses to become the best at anything. Real magic here. Pixel syndrome all the way. Yet Google Music is on my phone and I use it because there's no choice whatsoever. SupahNin10doh Stupid Dorito logo...

Reuters/Eric Gaillard Google announced a new system that can track credit card purchases made offline. The tech giant can already track online shopping and declared it will launch a tool designed to track how much money people spend in merchants’ brick-and-mortar stores. The combined ad clicks of individuals who are logged into Google services will be matched to perform the analysis. Ponemon Institute privacy research firm chairman Larry Ponemon said aggregated data can be translated to data that can identify users. Google’s senior vice president of ads and commerce Sridhar Ramaswamy assured that “incredibly smart people” were consulted in creating the system, which he described it as “secure and privacy safe.” The internet company said it has access to at around 70 percent of US credit and debit card sales via its partnerships with some companies that monitor data. It is unclear how much access Google has to Australians’ credit card details. It clarified it would not be able to examine the specific items that people are purchasing or how much a specific individual spends. But what Google can do is it can alert merchants automatically when their digital ads convert into sales at a brick-and-mortar store. Previously, an advertiser may conclude that the ad is a waste of money when people clicked on it, but does not buy anything online. Therefore, the program can possibly influence merchants to further their digital marketing budgets. Ponemon recognised that Google has good intentions but pointed companies and governments in the future might not. Miro Copic, a marketing professor at San Diego State University, also expressed concern of the new tracking device’s safety, saying the kinds of data that Google collects might be targeted by hackers. “The privacy implications of this are pretty massive, so Google needs to tread very carefully,” news.com.au quoted Copic  as saying.  Meanwhile, Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center, told The Washington Post that what he found fascinating was that while companies become ever more intrusive as far as data collection is concerned, they also become more “secretive.” Google already has the ability to determine what their users like through the searches they make as well as the videos they watch. Online advertisements are targeted to those interests. The new program carries tracking into offline stores, with the company explaining that its computers largely depend on login information like email addresses in order to spot people clicking on ads.

Resold Pixel phones originally purchased from Project Fi are having their IMEIs blacklisted Richard Gao Follow View All Posts 2017/05/25 5:30am PDTMay 25, 2017 57 Plus 1 on G+ 141 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares256 Google News Pixel Pixel XL Project Fi Back in November, when the Pixel was slowly beginning to ship to customers, there were numerous reports of people getting their Google accounts banned for purchasing Pixel and Pixel XL devices with the intent to resell them. It turns out that this issue hasn't exactly been laid to rest, as it seems that Pixel phones purchased from Project Fi for this purpose are now getting blacklisted via their IMEI numbers. As an overview, people originally bought Pixels from both the Google Store and Project Fi to sell them to a New Hampshire-based reseller. Why New Hampshire, you may ask? There's no sales tax. Both parties here were supposed to make a profit, but Google ended up banning a ton of accounts for a violation of their terms of service.. Considering how important Google is in our lives (Gmail, Google Photos, YouTube, Play Store, etc.), a lot of people were obviously not happy. In the end, Google did restore many of these accounts, but it was obviously enough for a good scare. However, it seems that Google still hasn't completely forgiven people for violating their ToS. Kyle Bennett, the editor-in-chief and founder of the HardOCP website, had his Pixel XL's IMEI blacklisted just yesterday. IMEIs are typically blacklisted by carriers when phones are lost or stolen, but that's clearly not what happened here. Calling T-Mobile didn't do anything, as their staff told him that they could not reverse the blacklisting. His communication with Swappa support was more interesting, though; here's what they told him: "Sorry to hear of the complaints. We have seen a great number of Pixel devices becoming blacklisted the past two days. We are still trying to figure out why this has happened to so many devices. We are working to find out the cause of this widespread issue. It would be best for both of you to keep on top of Google and pressing them for an explanation. In one other case, I saw this morning Google agreed to send the buyer a replacement device so that might be an option to look into. Seller please work with the buyer and Google to see if they can get to the bottom of it." Kyle then contacted Google support, with the first representative claiming that he had simply received a spam message. When he showed a second rep how his IMEI had indeed been blacklisted via Swappa's ESN/IMEI checker (useful tool if you're buying a phone, by the way), he was told that his Pixel XL hadn't been reported as stolen, but that it had been originally purchased through Project Fi. Kyle was also once again told that his phone hadn't really been blacklisted, but a quick rescan of his IMEI in Swappa proved otherwise. His case was escalated to Project Fi's support team, but the customer service rep refused to give him a reference number and told him that he'd receive it via email. After contacting a third representative, Kyle was informed that his phone had indeed been blacklisted, but that Google wasn't responsible for doing so. This lends further credence to the Project Fi explanation, as it's the carrier and not the manufacturer that has the ability to blacklist devices. The situation is still ongoing, but that's all we know for now; we'll update with more information as we get it.

Okay. NeverrKnowsBest You can sell a Project Fi phone. You just buy them in bulk and try to make a profit off Project Fi. Stupid that the customer is being punished for this, though. Green Dog Is it clear that this is one of the phones that was bought in bulk from that retailer? From my reading, it was just a resold phone. I mean obviously, it's not happening to all phones, but the fact that it's still happening is a concern. NeverrKnowsBest The IMEIs are being linked to one particular reseller in New Hampshire. celestre Do you have more information than is present in the article on this? NeverrKnowsBest I'm just going off what the article said. I would love to read more, but I highly doubt they are just flipping the switch on every resold Project Fi phone. That just isn't very plausible, at least to my knowledge. datkidpatrick you misunderstood the article... they referenced a time where a bulk reseller's phones were black listed... but now it is happening to a bunch of random sellers that decided to sell the phone... Richard Gao The bulk reseller's phones weren't blacklisted at that time. It is entirely possible that these are the same phones. datkidpatrick i purchased mine straight from project fi... sold it 3 months ago and the seller told me the other day it was blacklisted... and yes my mistake.. the bulk resellers email's were blocked or something like that... Cael Did you pay off the phone before you sold it? datkidpatrick yes i did... Corey Kinard So they're punishing someone that fully paid for a device from you, who fully owned the device? They're legally allowed to just fully break something they've already sold and have no right to? This is worse than when carriers wouldn't unlock phones... datkidpatrick im still giving google the benefit of doubt that it was a mistake... they just need to fix it PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ You'll easily win in small claims court if you have to refund and take the phone back. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ What kind of financing plan did you have? They were first sold in Oct. 22 2016 and this is only May 2017. I seem to remember 24 month financing or 12 month financing. You paid your phone off three months ago and already had sold it on Swappa for some time? datkidpatrick ya youre allowed to pay it off early... PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Maybe that's what caused the error at Fi in blacklisting by accident. datkidpatrick ya that doesn't make any sense... but it got fixed this morning by google... NeverrKnowsBest I see that now. Thanks for the clarification. In any case, there has to be something in common with these blacklisted phones, I don't think Google/Project Fi would blacklist all second hand phones, I don't think that's very plausible. Corey Kinard Do you really need to think straight when you are in competition for largest company in the world? They probably got algorithms looking for shit and those algorithms mess up. 4Ui812 That's pretty shitty Google. David Bowline Is it really? What's shitty is the people buying in bulk just to make an easy buck and therefore screwing people over. Swappa needs to go after these people. jonzey231 Yeah but if I bought a Pixel LAST YEAR and wanted to sell it no in preparation for the next Pixel or the OP5, for example, my customer may get screwed even though it was just an innocent buy and resell. Max Uh? That's not what happened here... so far this situation seems to be the result of a reseller elaborate plan to evade tax and sell the scarce phone for a bigger profit. This wasn't an individual reselling his/her own phone. jonzey231 Uh? I know that it was originally caused by the douche bags in NJ, but now it's affecting regular people. 4Ui812 That's called capitalism. No one is forcing you to buy it. What Google needs to do is fix all the reported issues with that shitty phone. As for the limited supply of said phone , again that's Google's fault (hell , I wouldn't be surprised if Google intentionally limted the supply ... That's a play out of nintys handbook) Duder12 I have a pixel. There is nothing wrong with my phone. I love it. SirCanealot But I have a Pixel and it is broken. Surely this is not possible to exist in reality? :O :O :O A Person It may suck, but who is to decide how my money is spent? kbbl Caveat emptor. SeanPR11 Or.... don't buy your phone from a New Jersey Douchebag. If people don't buy from them, they will stop doing this bullshit. It sucks that regular people are caught in the middle (which happens all too often). It seems Swappa should have known these phones were out there (given the business they are in) and flagged them with the IMEI checker. Alex Excuse them for doing whatever they like with a product they purchased. Pfff SeanPR11 Amen. Ryan from GroupTweet Yes, its shitty. If anything Google should go after the reseller, not the innocent legitimate customers that bought the devices and who are now punished because their phones are blacklisted. Alexander Z Great Swappa can't GO after anyone. Maybe suspend/revoke their account but that's it. My trusted seller hasn't been any help at all with the blacklisted pixel I bought. It's so messed up!! T4rd Saw the site/forum owner of a site I frequent get hit with this on his Pixel this week too. Crazy how the Pixel is being plagued with all sorts of extraneous issues. They can't stay in stock, forcing people to buy second hand, then they get black listed because of some weird policy Google has with Project Fi phones. Max Well being out of stock has nothing strange coming from a Google phone, that's been their main issue for a few years now (Nexus), and it happens even to Apple on launch but the difference is that they're a lot better ramping up production afterwards. This blacklisting is really weird, but so far it seems to be potentially related to a shady reseller so we'll have to wait and see if we get more clarification soon. Geoff Johnson As someone from New Hampshire, it's weird to see my state in an AP article, since nothing interesting ever happens here lol. This sucks though because buyers who bought their Pixel 2nd hand months ago now suddenly might get it blacklisted? J.J. Holy f. That is terrible. So random guy buys a second hand pixel (because Google was out of stock) later gets blacklisted by Google/fi. Gets no help from Google. Never buys a Google phone again. Real smart. Green Dog This on top of the seeming shaky quality of the phones may force me to an iPhone. J.J. I feel ya there but, i just can't do the iPhone thing. Loving this s8+ right now. Duder12 When consumers say this its just sad. Why when you have a difficult time with one android manufacturer immediately think its all Androids and switch to the iPhone? This is how Apple gets tons of customers. Everyone that had a bad time with Samsung just assumed their only other option was iPhone bc MARKETING. Green Dog Because I don't want to have to deal with OS updates through the carrier or a limited phone in terms of LTE bands, as is common for Android phones? People like other phones and I've played with some of them, but I like the Pixel/Nexus lines. But this does give me pause. blenderboy Well, the only offering that competes with iPhone in the world of android is the pixel phone. Samsung displays(hardware in general) are great but software experience can't be compared with iPhone or pixel. It is just sad that they can't keep up with Apple or Google. Google is trying really hard to reach there. I am still using Android because of the platforms openness. Duder12 Fair enough but you know what I mean. You are an exception but A LOT of consumers act this way. Honestly I bought my Pixel through the Google Store last fall and its been solid. I love it. Google needs to sort out the second hand market but these are growing pains. Hardware is still new to them bc the nexus line had help from the OEMs. Now they dont. marcusmarcus2 His comment does not address all Androids. He is only speaking of this one phone. It could be he was between using phones by Google and iPhones and he choose to go with Google's phone. Now with this situation, he decided to go to his second choice. I'm not defending switching to an iPhone over another manufacturer, just pointing out his statement you criticized did not say what you thought it was saying and you were the one to actually apply his statement to all Androids. Just playing the devil's advocate here Alex Because when you pay 7-8-900€ (the price of an iPhone) on an Android phone you expect it to be flawless. And that's normal! However, in real life, regardless if you pay 300 or 800€, Android remains Android, with its notoriously inconsistent battery life, inexplicable wakelocks, unfixed bugs (don't get me stored on the "low priority" bugs with thousands of stars), 2 year updates, etc, etc. tekfr33kn That seems a little dramatic considering that iPhones are far from flawless. You also pay that amount for your average laptop and they aren't flawless. It seems you, or someone else, is holding Android phones to an unrealistic standard. Alex Please don't compare a laptop with an Android phone. It makes absolutely no sense. Isn't it rather that manufacturers (Google being the first of them) increase the prices each year to hallucinating levels with little to no innovation or improvement in user experience. Take the S8 line. Beautiful phones, remarkable design, but a fraction of the cost you pay goes to that crap Bixby that nobody wants tekfr33kn I'll agree with you that Google is artificially raising the price far beyond what it should be but that's basic capitalism and market forces. If the market doesn't want those kinds of prices or can't support it, it won't sell. The issue is that people are actually willing to pay that. iPhones are the primary example. There's about $400 - $500 worth of stuff put in a phone that goes for $800 - $1000 and they still sell like hotcakes. I also agree with you about the S8's and Bixby but again, the market says that the S8 is a hot seller and so Samsung isn't about to change that trend. That kind of makes your argument moot. As for comparing a smartphone to a laptop - if you can't see the comparisons, it's either willful ignorance or you just don't know a thing about electronic devices (specifically smartphones or laptops). In either case, I can't help you with that. The fact is that they share more in common that differences. It's one of the many reasons that development strategies (hardware and software) often translate quite well between them. xyz Uhm, because the phone in question is the overpriced Google phone that is intended to compete with the iPhone and which Google fanboys insist is the greatest Android phone of all time. psychic99 It costs about the same to make a Pixel XL as it does an iphone 7, so why would you expect Google to make less margin than Apple? I will say their ecosystem and support SUCKs compared to Apple, so yeah it should be hundred less because the lifecycle experience of a Pixel will be much worse than Apple and the fact that they artificially end support after 2 years is atrocious. I have 4+ year old Nexus that operate just fine on custom ROMs. And BTW I don't think it is worth it either and happily keep my Nexus 6p for less than 50% the cost. I can't rationalize the price they are asking. Google's support is not consistent. Either they will go over the top to help, or tell you go away you are screwed, There is nothing in the middle, and until you engage them you have no idea if you are going to get help or the hand. Yet another reason they should be hundreds less. Merrill Sampson Just FYI, Google announced at IO a few days ago that they're extending the support cycle on the Pixel from 2 year to 5. marcusmarcus2 Do you have a source for that? https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705?hl=en#nexus_devices Android Version updates: October 2018 Security updates: October 2019 Duder12 Dont forget that apple blocked iPhones that had their fingerprint sensor replaced. Also, dont forget Apple is trying to get a bill banned that will allow consumers to have 3rd parties fix phones. PS: My Pixel is fucking awesome. NexusKoolaid "Dont forget that apple blocked iPhones that had their fingerprint sensor replaced." And this in and of itself was a good thing. With the sensor and the CPU being paired, the sudden appearance of a new sensor having a new signature was deemed to be a security breach. I'm not standing up for Apple here, just calling a spade a spade. And I don't know what information Apple could have shared with 3rd party repair houses (if they were inclined to play nice with them) without compromising security. "PS: My Pixel is fucking awesome." I wish I had one. But they were so hard to get hold of for so long that at this point I'll hang on to my 6P until the Pixel2 is out. psychic99 On Android if you reinstall the O/S or make major modifications they simply invalidate the fingerprint then you have to enter the password manually as a failback. Then you can enrol your fingerprint again. In fact every few days you have to manually enter your pin on N to get into the phone. Sounds like a reasonable method, rather than locking the phone forever. Apple went one step farther. You should go watch youtube... Apple is on a mission to make 3rd party repair a thing of the past. They even specifically make it hard to repair. They want control of the supply chain and dispose of equipment as fast as possible. NexusKoolaid On your first point, there is little control over hardware used to support the platform, so core design decisions are prone to fall back to a software solution. Apple on the other hand has tight control of their hardware and have the option for hardware based solutions, whatever the motivation might be, such as better security or to maintain control of their platform (probably a mix on the two). On your second point, I've read the headlines and seen videos on Youtube (like Louis Rossman). Yeah - their crusade against 3rd party repair sickens me to no small degree. Not just because it would prevent me from seeking out more economical and timely repair of my phone (if I had an iPhone), but because this type of precedent could trickle down to other things I might want to tinker with. Jay Hate to say it but that is the risk people run when you don't buy your devices brand new. J.J. True. But they exasperate said risk artificially for the perceived end goal.... More Profit. The truth is they are doing the exact opposite. This news definitely makes me pause on buying a pixel at all. The Second hand market is real and if i have a bad experience do to Google on a second hand device i will probably not buy new from them when i have the funds. james fuston If you (or the person who sells you a phone) violates the terms of service, you're gonna have a bad time regardless of manufacturer. blenderboy Real question to ask, did Apple ever had similar issue with many devices? hunter2 Probably not since Apple realizes that the perceived strong resale value is a determining factor for many people. Even people who may have never sold a product second hand gain some comfort from the knowledge that they could potentially recoup a lot of their costs if they ever needed to sell. ericshmerick Do the TOS say you can never ever resell the device? Serious question. ekana_stone No the TOS is that you resell as soon as you bought it, so like if you bought from fi cuz it's cheaper and the resold it a little under asking. It's only those phones that were black listed ericshmerick What defines "as soon as?" 5 minutes after purchase? 1 week? 2.8 months? 3 years? marcusmarcus2 Do we have confirmation that it is only those phones that were black listed? Could they have inadvertently black listed other phones from fi? EarlyMon The TOS say that commercial resale is not allowed and lots of them were resold by a private company in a scheme that tried to avoid sales tax. Santos Chavez It actually does say that isn't allowed, hence why they initially banned several accounts the first time. It was a breach of their TOS, and it still is. It's likely Project Fi saw these phones as stolen and blacklisted them. james fuston "You may only purchase Devices for your personal use. You may not commercially resell any Device, but you may give the Device as a gift." So if you purchase the device and resell it in New (unopened) condition, yeah. Fi could also pretty easily make the case that if you purchased the phone and turned around to sell it before the expiry of the original installment plan that you had purchased it with the intention of reselling. MisterAlex That's still not a commercial sale. If I go to the store, buy a Nintendo Switch, and immediately list it as a brand new Switch on Craigslist, I'm not a commercial seller. I'm still an individual selling something that's fully within my "first sale" rights to sell. james fuston Yeah, that's true if you're reading the second, and only the second, sentence there. The first one pretty clearly states "You may only purchase Devices for your personal use" MisterAlex If you think that reselling a personally owned item goes beyond the bounds of personal use, you're kidding yourself (and so is anyone who thinks that line of thinking would hold water, legally speaking). First Sale is a very broad consumer protection, my friend. Once you buy something of your own, you can do whatever you want with it, including sell it. (Edit: in the States, anyway.) james fuston Yep! Totally fine for you to sell it. Also totally fine for Google to deactivate your phone when you've done something you agreed not to do at the time of purchase. It's then legally on you to prove that they overstepped. MisterAlex You're clearly not parsing what I'm posting. Selling privately owned property is within the bounds of "personal use." james fuston Seeing as Google specifically included a clause about gifting, I'd venture to say they disagree with you. MisterAlex That's fine. Sony also disagreed that it had done anything wrong by removing Other OS. james fuston Cool! So we agree that whether or not you believe Google's terms of service to be legal, it's entirely on the customer to take action after being penalized for a violation of said terms of service. MisterAlex It's always up to the wronged party to seek litigation against a wrongdoer. james fuston In that case, I have no idea why you started commenting on legality when I was discussing terms of service violations. Rather, I would have no idea why if this weren't the comment section. MisterAlex A TOS is not a legally binding agreement. You defended enforcement of a TOS when that enforcement went contrary to law. That's why I brought up the comparison to Sony's PS3 lawsuit (which it lost). james fuston I'm not discussing whether terms of service are legally binding. I'm discussing whether or not the action being described (selling the phone) violates the ToS. It does. MisterAlex And my counter was to point out that putting something in a TOS doesn't make it hunky-dory. In fact, it's quite possible for a TOS to violate law. As I've illustrated. bekifft This is where America is so great. Even if the TOS is unenforceable by law, it is technologically enforceable, obviously. So they do it anyway, and now the onus is on you the little guy to get the multinational corporation to knock it off. Vape John most likely carrier issues the blacklisting... so project fi is the culprit psychic99 More profit? The sell them $150 below market rates. That is not free. I don't know what is actually going on but I would suspect that the original owner did something wrong or unethical. To be honest Google's systems are weird. I ported out my nexus5x and it took them almost 3 months to Bill me for the remainder. So maybe the original person cancelled their card, played games with DPP, activated it for one day and did it again. And again. xyz Fortunately, you can just buy an iPhone and get top notch support. hunter2 So the answer is to buy everything new and toss the old device in the landfill? Kind of sad to see how people just roll over and let over-reaching companies basically decimate the second hand market so they can increase their profits. Jay Never said that and you know it. I said this is the risk you take.. It's as simple as that. trixnkix637 That's the risk you take for not buying from reputable sources. Buying used has risks. Sucks he found out the hard way. jb0nez But the article says it's not Google, it's the carrier who blacklisted. Whatever that means... hunter2 That makes no sense. The carrier technically blocks that IMEI on their network, but only after another carrier submits it to the blacklist. It would be like if you SWATTED somebody and then said "it was the police who came to your house with guns not me". pfmiller On top of that this seems like an abuse of the blacklisting system. The system is intended to discourage theft, not as a means for companies to get revenge on their customers. psychic99 That's not true. Companies have been blacklisting devices for years if tos wasn't met. I have bought 3 phones through fi and they are heavily discounted. Google doesn't do that for free they expect you to activate them on fi for more than one day. Also if you are buying a phone from an individual and not a dealer you are taking a risk straight up. I have had friend have their phones blacklisted when they have bought phones from people and then they turned around and reported them as stolen. Swappa is a marketplace not a arbitrator. They are facilitating a sale. You guys need to know the difference. PayPal is your friend. hunter2 That's dumb. The whole point of cancellation fees is to re-coup the cost of subsidies if you break the contract. By going a different route, the only people who are getting punished are the people buying these phones. psychic99 Lots of people don't pay them and I have seen numerous accounts where friends have bought phones and have told me they got a "deal of a lifetime" to find their devices blacklisted and guess what they were people who never paid off their termination fees or have sold them then reported them stolen. And as an individual you need to take responsibility, if you purchase anything through a private transaction you should ask for poof of sale, do they own it, have it put in writing, etc. That way if the seller does something illegal then you have a remedy. This doesn't derisk anything tho. This is good education for people, to know where responsibility lies and the risks of buying from an individual versus an established dealer. In the case of Swappa, you should buy via Paypal, so there is a remedy. You can chargeback your loss if this happens within 6 months (I have done this will unethical sellers), so they are not being punished they are being inconvenienced. But that is the RISK you take buying from an individual. hunter2 I know you want to see Google as the good guy here, but within these comments there are accounts from people who bought outright, and months later sold their Pixel's and now months after that sale are being contacted by the seller about the device being blacklisted. bekifft I think you're missing his point. It's not about Google being the good or bad guy, it's that buying something third party is inherently risky and he's right, you should ask for a chain of evidence that proves the device is legit. Maybe I'm also just tired of people claiming they can find things so cheap online, when most of it is scams like this, and just devalues the whole market. hunter2 You need to look through these comments. There are people here who bought their phones directly from Fi and after switching carriers their fully paid off phones have been blacklisted. They were the original owners and these phones were never sold. There are also people here who bought phones, used them for months, and sold them after they were fully paid off. These people are saying that the proper they sold the phones to are now coming back and telling them they're blacklisted. bekifft In that case that is indeed disturbing. I am a Fi subscriber though I bought my phone direct from the Google store. Sounds like someone made a big mistake on the back end. Lance Biddle I bought my phone from Project Fi, and it has become blacklisted after changing to another carrier. Google is definitely the bad guy right now IMO pfmiller Just because other companies have been doing it, doesn't mean that it's not an abuse of the system. It's clearly not what the blacklisting system was intended for. Lance Biddle How about when you buy the phone from Project Fi, decide to switch carriers and the phone you outright own becomes black listed. I cannot connect to the Verizon service I'm paying for. And Verizon cannot do anything about. And Google/Project Fi isn't. I've wasted way too much time on the phone trying to get this resolved. They have told me it could be 2-5+ days to get it fixed. WTF!! Never Google again. Never. J.J. I'm sorry. That sucks hard. ProductFRED Considering the original seller probably isn't going to pay people back, all Google did was fuck over a bunch of legitimate customers. iPhone reselling is also a big issue, especially on new releases, but you don't see Apple doing this. J.J. Agree 💯. Most of these customers involved (who probably have had hardware and software issues already on top​ of this) will never buy a pixel again! Cassidy James Blaede Just for the record, the majority of Pixel users likely never have hardware or software issues. I, my mom, and a couple of my friends have Pixels and haven't had any issues. You probably hear about issues on Reddit a lot because the only reason to visit the Pixel subreddit is to complain. 🙃 Jordan L no issues here too. J.J. Not a redditer lol, but many other sites show the issues(as low as they may be) and if you were on the fence about spending that kind of money, these stories alone may sway many Duder12 Yep. Just like iphone touch disease and early shutdowns. Tr3ple Never had those issues. xyz That's true. I personally don't know anyone who has been murdered. Therefore, no one gets murdered. Cassidy James Blaede I'd wager that the majority of people don't get murdered. 😉 Written Description My Pixel XL has performed flawlessly since its purchase and it's my first Android phone after using every iPhone from the first generation on. Google's AI is better, its cloud storage is infinitely better, and I don't see going back to Apple anytime soon. J.J. I'm glad you have not had issues.... Others however have Duder12 Not me. Corey Kinard 3rd Np. Duder12 Mines been great... atl3630 great here too. Cael Apple is not a "carrier". ProductFRED Neither is Google. They just use other carriers' networks. Either way, that isn't justification for what they're doing. Unless they plan on replacing everyone's Pixel (which looks like a hard no), they fucked over a lot of legitimate customers. I buy my devices off of swappa most of the time. Tell me how I would get this fixed if neither the seller nor Google want to take responsibility. marcusmarcus2 Google is an MVNO. Per https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-mvno-cell-phone-carrier-578673 "An MVNO is a cell phone carrier (such as a prepaid wireless carrier) that typically does not have its own network infrastructure and licensed radio spectrum" Apple is not even an MVNO carrier. drksilenc fi is a carrier... JD With Fi Google is a Carrier. Mitch Gray This just happened to my fiance's phone. I bought it on swappa for her birthday months ago because Google store didn't have any in stock and this morning it is blacklisted. I'm so furious. I have had every Google phone since the Galaxy Nexus and because of this policy I will never buy another phone of theirs. She is now stranded without a phone and has no way of using it for work at the busiest time of the year for her (she is a teacher and it's graduation week). Who do I contact about this? We shouldn't be punished because someone gamed the system. J.J. I feel so bad for you. I hope you get it resolved. This is an atrocity! J.J. Should definitely hassle fi/Google and let them know if they don't resolve you will never buy and tell everyone you know not to buy and so on jibust No, stop don't tell them that, they might not withstand the shock of loosing them. /S T4rd I would contact the seller of the phone and/or Swappa if they're the service you went through. If they're no help somehow, then contact Paypal if that's how you paid for it. Google isn't going to unblacklist the phone regardless of what you say to them. It's virtually impossible for a phone to be unblacklisted once it has happened, so you're going to have to just get a refund and buy another phone. A Person Good luck with that. I am hesitant to ever buy again from Swappa.. and I used to love, love, love them. I purchased a device that was blatantly not as described. I then contacted Swappa and they instructed me that it is now between me and the seller. So I contacted the seller via the sale page and was basically told: "ummmm, nah". datkidpatrick at that point you could have went thru paypal and filed a claim... T4rd That's why you buy from reputable sellers. The few minor issues I've had on there were resolved quickly. atl3630 yes, same here. To date I've never had a swappa problem that didn't get resolved and the people have been very helpful. Don't blame swappa for shitty sellers. Buy from reputable sellers (like me). yankeesusa Swappa only helps communicating. To resolve any issues you must file a PayPal claim. datkidpatrick contact the seller and see if they can contact project fi/google... King_Android Ijs, BBB is an extremely powerful tool in order to get your voice heard from Corporate asap...... Stephen Hicks If the phone is under warranty still, file an RMA claim and state the bluetooth isn't working correctly on the device and that you've already tried factory resetting the phone as well as reconnected all the bluetooth devices with no improvement. Might work? njn There is no warranty for second hand phones. JRock I purchased a bootlooping 6P off eBay for cheap, erasing/flashing firmware had same result, RMA'd to Huawei and they promptly sent me a brand new one. Mark Depending on the credit card you used to buy the phone, you might have an extended warranty that might cover this. atl3630 You can get your money back. Contact the seller through swappa and tell them the issue. They will likely tell you it's been to long, I don't care, etc. If so, then file a PayPal claim. You have six months PayPal protection. Document that the phone no longer works and send it back to the seller with tracking. Then PayPal will refund you money, no matter what the seller says. M3D1T8R But doing this will just end up screwing over the seller. PayPal will simply take the money from their account and refund it to the buyer. So that's not fair to the seller either. PayPal's "seller protection" is a fraud. And their customer service is a total joke. They should be boycotted. atl3630 How does that screw over the seller? The seller screwed himself when he sold the phone. His beef is with ProjectFi, not the buyer. Frankly the buyer shouldn't have to deal with this crap since buyers have no way to determine the history of a phone. The seller sold a phone that stopped working. That's on them. M3D1T8R Because, obviously, the seller doesn't necessarily know the history and every previous owner of every phone. What if it's a phone someone bought previously used. They used it for a while just fine, and resold it. Then this IMEI block thing happened. atl3630 Yeah, that would suck. But still, it's not the buyer's fault. If something happens and somebody gets cheated out of $500+ then you better bet people are going to exercise whatever option they can to recover their money. PayPal protection would do that for them in the first 6 months. ericshmerick So anyone who sells a phone is on the hook for its functionality until the end of time? GTFO of here with that. It's ridiculous and you know it. atl3630 Six months, moron. PayPal protection is 6 months. Like it or not, facts. Stop being a little bitch. Roh_Mish What if the seller had bought directly from google. AP mentioned about the trains but there doesn't appear to to be a link between this and that fraud. Also there are many cases where buyer on PayPal will request a reverse and never return the product, screwing over the seller. And PayPal won't do anything about this. vn33 That really sucks .. .especially to someone near and dear to you. I would be beyond furious! Hope everything works out!! Duder12 Swappa will cover you here. You are fine. Get the ball rolling. Anwar Imraan Lucas To me it seems that the original buyer had reported his credit card lost or stolen and is disputing charges on his card which in terms maybe blacklisting those devices as stolen.. blindexecutioner You do Google the service of endless beta testing their software on a way overpriced phone and they blacklist you. Nice. Lawrence Good, that is what you get for buying the Bezel XL ericshmerick OH YOUUUU!!1 theadamsegal Yet another reason I will not buy a Google device again. Tiberian For the record: Kyle Bennett is the owner and founder of HardOCP, not just a simple writer for the site. ;) Richard Gao Did not know that. Thanks! datkidpatrick this happened by to me as well... i sold my pixel 3 months ago and the buyer just informed me it was blacklisted... i had no clue project fi was doing this and legit thought the buyer was trying to scam me... i contacted project fi support and was advised it was escalated to be removed from the blacklist... i paid off the phone before i sold it... this is definitely a mistake by google/project fi... they should be correcting this soon... Jordan L Can a carrier just randomly blacklist IMEIs?! I guess so. I was reading this thread thinking 'well, people probably just bought a stolen Pixel unknowingly' but your case proves this wrong. Navneet Suresh Shitty move Google ! :/ Jay If this happened to me, I'd just return the phone to the seller, get refunded, and make them have to deal with this. Swappa made a huge fucking deal about refunding buyers after the Note7 debacle and it should be the same thing here. freshprince_87 I hope that Kyle guy reads your comment. This may help him Jay Honestly, Swappa needs to be pushing this harder. I sold my Note7 last year and despite the fact that the buyer could have gone and gotten the refund from T-Mobile themselves, they chose to take Swappa up on their suggestion of getting the refund from me. (Add to this that Swappa said if I didn't agree to the refund, they'd "suggest" the buyer take the issue up with PayPal as the device was not sold as advertised. Seriously..) datkidpatrick it isn't the sellers fault... and its something that can be fixed... Jay I fail to see how this isn't the seller's fault for trying to game the system and make a profit. This sure as hell isn't Google's fault.. so who do you want to blame then? The unsuspecting buyers? datkidpatrick it is googles fault... the point they referred to in november is completely separate from the issue happening now... the issue happening now is many pixel phones that were sold and originated from fi is getting blacklisted... i sold my pixel after paying it of legit and it just got blacklisted... now please tell me how i tried to game the system... Jay For all I know, you could be one of those shady scalpers too who tried to make a profit by gaming the system. The burden of fixing this issue should still lie on the sellers. If someone wants their money back, they have every right to make you do the legwork of figuring out how you'll make your money back. datkidpatrick I contacted project fi for the buyer and it is escalated... again the point is it wasn't my fault... marcusmarcus2 If you are just trying to sell 1 phone that you got and paid for without trying to "game the system" it is not your fault, but it is your responsibility as the seller to try and resolve the issue, which it sounds like you are doing. Who's fault is it? Hard to tell until Google releases a comment about why this is happening. Did they block these by mistake? Then it is Googles fault. Are they doing it to block the bulk buyers that were "gaming the system" and just went over board and blocked some extra phones that were not part of those that gamed the system? Then it would be the fault of Google and those that gamed the system that caused Google to make the choice. hunter2 I wouldn't say it's his responsibility. He's selling a device. If the maker of that device decides to flip a kill switch in 18 months and disable every device out there then why blame him. Google is flipping a kill switch an all kinds of devices (just below there is a comment from a guy who bought and paid for his phone, then later switched carriers and had his originally bought phone killed). Trying to blame middle men here is crazy. marcusmarcus2 I'm not blaming the seller. Please re-read. I said the fault is with Google if they are the ones that decided to black list them. It is the sellers responsibility to try figure out why a device they sold is blacklisted. If they did nothing wrong, then they should be able to get it unblacklisted by working with Google. From the looks of some of the comments on here, it looks like the buyer would not be able to get the device of the black list but the seller should be able to. Again, I'm not blaming the middle man. There is a difference between fault and responsibility. Fault sounds like it is fully on Google. Responsibility goes across everyone though with some having more responsibility. Buyer has some responsibility to report the issue to the seller instead of just reporting it to paypal. Seller has more responsibility than the seller because they would be the one who would be able to work with Google/fi to get it off the black list. Google/fi would have even more responsibility to explain why devices are being blacklisted and getting devices off the black list if they should not be on there. Max As a somewhat frequent seller/buyer on Swappa and Ebay I can say that this is definitely the sellers responsibility to fix the problem or promptly accept a return for a refund otherwise this isn't so different from a bait and switch situation. datkidpatrick how is it a bait and switch if i paid off a phone legit and decided to sell it after... 3 months later it gets blacklisted... this is a mistake by google and its their responsibility to fix... Max If you paid off the phone legit and didn't do anything shady then it wouldn't have been blacklisted and if it was you, as the original buyer, are the one with more authority to contact Google, not the second hand buyer, therefore it's your responsibility to fix it. The buyer with a blacklisted phone has zero reasons to believe that you were truthful in your description even if you were. datkidpatrick well i did contact project fi for the buyer and it is escalated... Max Then you're doing the right thing (taking responsibility) and hopefully this gets resolved quickly by Fi! Although I don't know if they can just un-blacklist a phone? Hopefully they can. ericshmerick If I buy a product from a retail store and 92 days later it has an issue, guess what they will tell me when I show up barking for a refund? Yeah, pound sand kid. That's what they will say. So why do Swappa sellers suddenly have the responsibility to refund forever ala Costco? I get people are pissy at the situation, but the seller isn't responsible for Google's shadyness here. Max We're not talking about "an issue" here because that's what warranties are for, we're talking about a phone reported as lost/stolen after being sold this could potentially mean a fraudster that didn't fully pay the phone or a thief that sold a stolen phone, I doubt any serious retailer would do that... By the way that's what buyer protections are for, Paypal has six months of protection and credit card providers can be very flexible if you explain your case well and you're in the right. If a retailer pull something like this they would never win a chargeback. Max We're not talking about "an issue" here because that's what warranties are for, we're talking about a phone reported as lost/stolen after being sold this could potentially mean a fraudster that didn't fully pay the phone or a thief that sold a stolen phone, I doubt any serious retailer would do that...

If a retailer pull something like this they would never win a charge back and the manufacturer and distributor would never be involved in the original transaction or charge back, it would be up to the retailer to go after the manufacturer or distributor. ericshmerick But nothing shady or illegal is going on here. If I and the original buyer and I use it on project fi for two months, then decide to sell it. How does that suddenly implicate me as being some sort of shady criminal? I would simply be selling a legally purchased piece of hardware that was paid in full. Max Can you please elaborate how the buyer knows that you sold "a legally purchased piece of hardware that was paid in full" if he has a blacklisted phone reported as lost/stolen in the hands? Good luck convincing the buyer, Paypal and a Bank that you're in the right in such a situation... Luxferro If they sold you shady (stolen or not legal) products you'd be dealing with them. tnt These are not devices being bought from an official retailer. There's no need to question the history of a device bought from Costco. Swappa (and Ebay and Craigslist for that matter) are not the same type of market. It's the seller's responsibility to know the history (as much as possible anyway) of the devices they're selling. freshprince_87 I guess it's safer to buy a Verizon Google Pixel instead if you intend on reselling it later. So the future buyer isn't screwed by Google. That is such a ridiculous policy drksilenc have to have a line with verizon to do that though. Wendell Brown Apparently not, this dude says his WERE Verizon phones that were locked.... https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/6d2yse/2_of_my_3_google_pixel_phones_blacklisted_on_the/ Me Google is just shooting themselves in the foot at this point with the Pixel Yan Qin I just sold my Pixel XL and switch to Galaxy S8, I do think I was out of my mind that I actually bought Pixel at full price. Jordan L anyone resell a project fi phone NOT through Swappa and have it blacklisted? maybe ProjectFi blacklisted only Swappa phones(still a strange move if it was on purpose) Jagermeister 2 of my 3 Pixel phones showed up blacklisted 2 days ago. I made a reddit post yesterday of my issue. I though it was part of an insurance fraud scam. https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/6d2yse/2_of_my_3_google_pixel_phones_blacklisted_on_the/ I had originally though our phones were from Verizon not Google Fi. We were happy Pixel customers that are now considering purchasing different phones because Google can report as stolen whenever they feel a Google Fi device was not transferred to a new owner per their TOS. How can any user purchasing a pre-owned or "new" Google Pixel be sure that it isn't a Google Fi device and won't be blacklisted in the future? Max Johnson Note to self, don't buy second hand Google devices. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Note to everyone: Don't buy first hand Google devices. Max Why? Mine works perfectly fine and so far it's the best phone I've ever owned. Dana Yeah, it's fine as long as you don't get it from Project Fi because you can't sell it if you want to upgrade to a new device. Max LOL, what? I simply bought it directly from store.google.com, no issues here and I can provide proof. This is something related to phones sold through Fi. hunter2 Congrats, scroll up one comment and you'll find a guy who's phone is blacklisted despite him being the original owner and being fully paid off. To answer your question of "Why", it's because not everyone is as comfortable gambling with their money as you are. Max 1) It was blacklisted by the carrier, not the manufacturer. 2) It was blacklisted after it was resold, sucks but as far as we know it doesn't affect the original seller, there's a difference there. 3) We don't know yet why this really happened. 4) Even with all of the above, I don't see how it fits in a "Don't buy first hand Google devices." statement. Maybe if you tell me "Don't deal with Project Fi service" I could somewhat agree. hunter2 http://disq.us/p/1iz7ts3 Sorry, should have permalinked the comment since the order is moving per votes. That guy was the original owner and claims to have been paid off. Moved to Verizon at some point and had the device he originally bough directly from Google blacklisted. Max Well that negates my point 2 and sucks even more. But still the blame here points 100% to Project Fi and not the phone itself nor Google as the manufacturer of the phone. Something really strange is happening with Project Fi devices and hopefully they will find out soon if it's an error, incompetence, sabotage or maybe even hacking. hunter2 I guess it depends on how willing you are to absolve the parent company of things a specific branch is doing. It would be like saying "don't blame MS, it's the IE team who makes the browser" during the IE6 days. Max Legally is evident that the responsibility is on Google but if you think that the group in charge of designing and manufacturing the Pixel has any minimal clue about what happens inside the group of the MVNO Project Fi then you're frankly clueless about how such a huge company works. By the way IE and Edge sucks but Visual Studio rocks and I'm liking more Windows 10 recently but I guess I should avoid using everything Microsoft because IE really sucks, right? hunter2 If a decisions like these can be made without going far enough up the chain of command that you're dealing with some higher ups, then I don't really want to know how this company runs. It's enough to tell me that I can't really trust them because you can't really depend on a company keeping in line with their corporate ideals when individual units can work with this much impunity. Avoiding/disliking MS was never about IE sucking. It was about IE being openly hostile and damaging to the web. This complaint was obviously projected at Microsoft themselves since no one believed that the IE team was working in a bubble. I don't know how old you are so maybe you weren't around when all this was going on. It's not about disliking a company because one or some of their many products are inferior. It's about disliking them because they employ user hostile tactics and you don't feel like you can support that (or at the very least want to punish them in the tiny way you can by voting with your wallet). Max So you already got an official response from Google about this? Can you share it? Because so far I have only read guesses about what is happening and nothing official yet. I'm old enough to have used MS-DOS 5 & 6 as well as Windows 3.1. That doesn't change the fact that saying "don't buy anything from a company" based on one division issues is just silly. If Google officially says that all of this was planned then maybe you could have a point, until then you're just stretching facts to prove a weak point. hunter2 I don't need to fill in the facts. I'm saying either way it's bad. The facts are that this happened. Additional facts about why it happened are irrelevant Max Well, if you're happy thinking like that be my guest, I guess some people is unable to see the colors and think the world is black and white. hunter2 For people whom this isn't a mundane thought experiment but are actually in a position where they need to buy a new device (not everyone is able to be without their phone until Google ultimately resolves this); the shades of gray in this scenario don't change their circumstances. The facts are that they have a phone that was remotely disabled. I'm assuming your shades of gray are the how's and why's of that? How is that of any consequence to these people? Steve_Jobroni Shut up, troll. DanSan got em! Matt This will be great for their resale value. ericshmerick Swappa comments: I GEEVE U $200 BUY NOW FINAL OFFERS!! JD Wooooo! Go Pixel, I'm definately not going near any Google hardware with a 1000ft pole now.I may use my 1001ft pole. In Many states, and at least in Canada this is not legal, you can't blacklist a phone for ToS violation. There's a very narrow list of reasons for a device to be blacklisted. Cuong This is a really shitty move from Google. At least sent a notification few days in advance and offer a way to appeal. What if a person was in an emergency situation? Imagine the lawsuit for that, Google. Why customers have to suffer because Google can't control their resellers? ericshmerick 911 always works. segag Thats Fuck all! Snowsky Mountain This may seriously make me rethink my use of Google hardware (especially phones). Stevie Do no evil Google. Do no evil. My Dixie Wrecked Yeah, they got rid of that mandate years ago. Seriously. Look it up. mxwp lol, yeah it was pretty funny. but i give Big G props for being somewhat honest about that. "hmm, we're huge now and so just cannot help to do some evil" Corey Kinard Just looked​ it up. Looks like it's still in place for Google. Alphabet's is different l though. It's "do the right thing." Sruly J Bought an unlocked Pixel yesterday for $334. Before I send it in to get checked and fixed by Google, I really should check the IMEI (normally I'd have the IMEI first, but the seller didn't give it to me). Michael D’Ambrosio "Someone with an answer." That'll get you far with Tech support. Smh vn33 Does the blacklisted phone works out of US, say in Canada? I assume yes, if it's the carriers that are doing the blacklisting. that said, it would really dampen my desire for a phone from Google. Stevie I am crossing my fingers that they don't come after my Nexus 6. Already bought and activated. There's no going back right? speedy1979 So to clarify google is randomly blacklisting any google pixel that is resold. I actually considered buying a ProjectFi device sometime ago; so glad I didn't go through with it. Kris Crowley I have fi service. When you buy a phone through fi you got a discount or a phone that you can't get through the Google store if you want. There is a disclaimer that if you buy it and never activate it that you will be charged additional Monies within 30 days. Now without knowing isn't possible that A the phone was bought at a discount and B the additional fee was levied but never paid? trixnkix637 Know the risks of buying used people. Do your homework. Asking where the seller bought the phone originally could've prevented all of this. Can't blame Google because someone tried to game the system both ways. marcusmarcus2 Know the risks of not using commas, people. You should never buy people, whether they are used or new. Rony Hmmm, is there a difference between a new and a used person. I've scoured the forums and haven't got a clear answer. marcusmarcus2 You would have to ask them before you buy them. They usually know when they've been used. But again, you should not buy any people. Def Ref But if you try to rent people, you start hearing words like "solicitation" and that's no fun. marcusmarcus2 Don't rent them either. While we are at it. Do not borrow, loan or steal people. Def Ref Is enticement allowed in your no fun world? Asking for a friend. marcusmarcus2 I don't see a problem with enticement as long as that enticement does not lead to stealing people. "No fun world"? You mean my world where I think people should not be viewed or treated as items/property? If yes, then yeah, I guess it is a no fun world. Def Ref Lighten up, Francis. marcusmarcus2 Lighten up, Francis? https://38.media.tumblr.com/39ef7347a58e308e67a5bd01cd124431/tumblr_nsld6lafvE1qh124lo1_500.gif Def Ref https://youtu.be/0OnpkDWbeJs That the title is misspelled AND mispunctuated is bonus. trixnkix637 Didn't NY and NV allow for the renting of people or is that wishful thinking? Asking for a friend. Rod This was so good, I had to sign into Disqus to upvote. trixnkix637 Buying people has been around for ages. Can't just stop now because of commas. marcusmarcus2 Buying used has been around for ages. trixnkix637 And so has it's risks. ericshmerick Wow I feel bad for the Swappa sellers who are getting PayPal charge backs right about now. Alexander Z Great This was the response I received. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/948da6656e25823e8dc529c4571fbc2d347f5e820ee9b7c91844d48c9745a112.png DanSan owner of the device ≠ person who purchased. way to go google. InnocentEd News flash this could happen with any phone from any manufacturer on any network that is resold used. I've had it happen with 2 iPhones and Apple could have cared less. You buy used, you take the risk. It's amazing how even credited tech journalists assume devices on Swappa are always going to be 100% safe. If Project Fi were not allowed to be resold via T&S then it's no diff than blacklisting a resold stolen phone...they had every right. Bewear This is why we can't have nice things. Rony Honestly this makes total sense. Its technically stealing the phone if you buy it for a discounted price and you dont activate it and sell it again. I think they made the right move. raffr It's not "technically" stealing. If you purchase a product at the price requested, you did not steal it. IF, big IF, in your purchase agreement it states you cannot resell the phone without activating it first, then google has a case. Serge Cebrian if you are paying for the service ... you are still paying for it even if you keep your older phone or a better phone if you want to unless you stop paying then its stealing ... but not if you keep the service// marcusmarcus2 They could have blacklisted these phones for that reason. But they could have also been overzealous when blacklisting devices and blacklisted numerous other devices that people did not do that with. It may have been the right move to block those that did do that, but if they inadvertently blocked additional devices, then hopefully they make the right move and unblock those devices that should not have been blocked. newtonfb Not new. Wife got a 5x on swappa. Phone was originally on FI but never taken off the account. We tried to activate it on FI but they did we couldn't until the owner released the phone? It worked fine on any other carrier. Had to get a new 5x Lance Biddle I paid off my pixel through project fi. I recently switched to Verizon. Yesterday Verizon notified me that my phone had been reported as stolen! When I awoke this morning my service had been disabled by Verizon. The support from Project Fi has been abysmal. What do I do to fix this? Corey Kinard Go to Reddit. Get ready for talks with the Better Business Bureau. Keep contacting Fi, keep screenshotting all the correspondences, you get all the buyers info in order to prove you are the original device owner. You don't fix this, you didn't cause it to break. Google fixes this. Everyone affected just has to light a fire under their ass. tnt Keep pushing / escalating with Project Fi. Ryan from GroupTweet I bought a Pixel from Tradeport USA (NH based company, shit!) about 3 months ago. The phone is on T-mobile right now and still currently working (fingers crossed). From my interpretation this appears only to be affecting Pixels bought through Google Fi - and perhaps not ones bought via Google Play store unlocked? Is that correct? Is there anyway I can check to see if my pixel was in fact sold via Google FI vs Google Play? Really hoping I don't wake up to a bricked phone in the next couple mornings... Sruly J You could contact Google, provide them with the IMEI, and they could let you know if it was bought through Google Play. Ryan from GroupTweet Thanks - but don't want to risk tipping them off that my phone should be on the blacklist :( Sruly J But wouldn't they know anyways if it should be blacklisted? I mean, how else would they have blacklisted so many phones this week? lauriedesautels So I have the Pixel and was planning on selling it via Swappa after my credits end from another phone. They ended up giving me a brand new Pixel XL but their service has become horrible where I live. So please correct me if I am wrong but if the Pixel is paid off and I switch carriers/ my Pixel is a paperweight? (I don't plan on using the phone on another carrier after 3 mo). ericshmerick According to this place, you can never sell it. You must carry it with you to your grave. Robert Montoya I have a Pixel that is currently blacklisted as of 5/23/2017 I bought it from Swappa... Google says they will lift the ban in 24 to 48 hours... That was 24 hours ago.. Phone still Blacklisted Wendell Brown I must have missed where it was shown that these deactivated phones were on Project Fi. As best I can tell, the only link to Fi is from an OLD article about the guy reselling phones several months ago. Is there any proof that this is in any way Fi related? MadJoe I have to say, if Google ever blacklisted my phone in a misguided sour-grapes attempt to punish the person who sold it to me, and without compensating me for it I would be rather angry. It would also be the absolute last Google product I ever purchased. As it is, this story has me glad I don't own anything more than a $25 Chromecast that I never use. I was seriously considering the Pixel 2 as my next phone, but not any more. If they were going to be such babies about the phones being resold, they should have vetted their buyers a little better. Corey Kinard It doesn't look like they were making any money off of you in the first place... Second-hand buyers/ bargain hunters rarely go out and pre-order $800 phones. Maybe you're different. They're definitely fucking up, but considering how little the pixel one sold and how much money they make I'm not sure they'll care about this any which way the wind blows. Same way Apple can just outright tell their customers to go fuck themselves over certain problems. MadJoe The problem is that too many people will ignore a company's unscrupulous behavior. If more of us would punished them by taking away access to our wallets, they'd think twice about trying to screw us. But people are lazy and lack commitment. So you're absolutely right, Google won't feel any hit by my deciding not to buy any more of their shit because a shit-ton of blind lemmings will gladly line up to jump off that spot on the cliff I chose not to use. And when a couple of them get screwed, they will cry "why isn't anyone else interested in helping me?" as the rest of the heard ignore them. On the bright side, the cycle will continue ad nauseum until I'm in a hole in the ground. Bruce Considering the ridiculous amount they are charging for the phones (Apple pricing without the Apple level support), this just about kills the resale value for a Pixel. Who the hell is going to buy a used phone for $500+ (because the original cost is so high) if their phones get blacklisted months later. And who the hell is going to buy the phones at the original price, when resale value will drop like a rock. And this doesn't even take into account all the BS that comes with the phone to begin with. 2 years of guaranteed OS updates. Hardware issues (Bluetooth, speakers, water resistance...) which don't get acknowledged amid finger pointing. Insufficient inventory even if they were open to replacements. The 128GB version (the 32GB is too little and the 64 GB doesn't exist) costs almost a $1000. The first time they tried this with the Nexus One, it didn't go well. This doesn't seem to be going much better. The Galaxy Nexus couldn't be upgraded because of drivers. The only real hits have been the Nexus 5 and the 6P. UniBroW *clutches iPhone 7 plus despite it's inferiority to android* Tj Hariharan Wait, do we actually KNOW that the phones that are blacklisted were originally purchased for reselling for profit? All i got from this article was that the phone was originally purchased from Project Fi.. RTNDO128 My phone was effected by this. I've been having issues with no T-Mobile service for the past couple of days on Project Fi. After reading this article, I used the Swappa IMEI checker and what do you know, my phone is reported "lost/stolen". I bought my Pixel on eBay at the beginning of January. Now I'm beyond their 30 day gaurentee. What an absolute clusterfuck. RTNDO128 My phone was effected by this. I've been having issues with no T-Mobile service for the past couple of days on Project Fi. After reading this article, I used the Swappa IMEI checker and what do you know, my phone is reported "lost/stolen". I bought my Pixel on eBay in the middle of February. Now I'm beyond their 30 day guarantee. What an absolute clusterfuck. Y2J You have 180 days in Paypal. RTNDO128 Thanks, I filed a claim with them. Hopefully this situation is covered. Max Did you contact first the seller? Otherwise it's a dick move to file a claim without first giving the seller the opportunity to see if he collaborates... RTNDO128 Thanks for your opinion. As stated, I'm beyond the 30 day eBay guarantee window. I created a "dispute" through the PayPal Resolution Center, which sends a message directly to the seller. PayPal is totally uninvolved with the dispute until I choose to escalate, which will only happen if I cannot get this resolved with the seller first. I just want to have our conversations documented in the event that the seller does not want to deal with this situation. Ken Kinda weird Google said that IMEI can't be blocked by manufacturer, I'm sure that's true. But what when manufacturer is also technically the carrier? Da_James Are you saying that "buying" a device in the USA doesn't mean you own it? Just SUE. Steve_Jobroni > as it's the carrier and not the manufacturer that has the ability to blacklist devices Do people not read the full article anymore? There seems to be a lot of Jabroni's blaming Google when it's the carrier that can only do the blacklisting. Sir_Brizz But that carrier is Project Fi, aka Google... Aleksandr Ivanov Change IMEI, problem solved! AbdulB1 lol Cassidy James Blaede I'd be interested in hearing how widespread this actually is, and a response from Google. My mom bought a Pixel from Swappa because Google was out of stock, and she's been loving it. I'd hate for her phone to become a brick because of this. Leonardo Baez I see a class action demand on the horizon? Đức Thành I'm a die-hard Google fan, but wow does Google need some fixing. justmy2pennies2012 There is one simple way Google can prevent the second hand market from making a profit. 1. Provide enough stock for all those who want to purchase the device! :) Bonus: Price the device accrodingly!! I gave up trying to buy one new from VZW and the Play Store. MisterAlex Did getting a Pixel phone through Fi require signing away your rights regarding "first sale?" And is that enforceable? RayNeverLearns You are Android Police. You might want to stay more up to date on this story and keep your readers updated, especially one that has a big impact on one of the purest Android flagships. http://www.techspot.com/news/69452-pixel-phones-project-fi-showing-up-blacklisted.html datkidpatrick happy to announce the phone i sold has been taken off the blacklist after communicating with project fi... so if you're affected by this contact google or more specifically project fi support... RayNeverLearns I believe Project Fi has done this for all affected Pixels. I didn't contact the person who sold it to me (Craigslist 7 months ago... wouldn't know where to even start) yet my phone was whitelisted earlier today. A little pain and it took almost 3 days, but a good resolution. datkidpatrick thats great... happy it's fixed...

Image Credit: Robbie Shade Google has reportedly launched a new program to support promising AI ventures. The initiative will provide services ranging from mentorship to workspace, according to Axios. The most promising startups or projects may receive co-investments from the new initiative and Google Ventures ranging from $1 million to $10 million. A Google spokesperson declined to comment. The new initiative could have something to do with Google’s recent acquisition of Kaggle, a data science startup that hosted competitions in which data scientists solve challenges provided by other companies. A series of new AI initiatives were recently announced at I/O, the annual Google developer conference, including the unveiling of a second-generation tensor processing unit for AI processing in the cloud and an invitation for mobile developers to use TensorFlow Lite. As part of its initiatives to democratize AI, Google also recently introduced the TensorFlow Research Cloud, a free AI computing service for top researchers and organizations like Harvard Medical School who are willing to share the results of their work in an open source environment.

Google is now offering four free months of Google Play Music for new subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:17pm PDTMay 26, 2017 43 Plus 1 on G+ 312 Share on Facebook 65 Share on Twitter Total Shares420 Google News Right now it looks like Google is running a special offer for Google Play Music. New subscribers that sign up here can get four free months of service instead of the usual three. No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it. It could save you an extra $10. Again, this particular offer is only for new subscribers. I've been a fan of Play Music for a long time, though the device removal limit does get in the way when you switch between devices and ROMs as often as I do. Being able to mix your own library with those of a service also comes in handy. That way I can continue to support artists I am passionate about, without eschewing the larger selection of a subscription offering for the purposes of content discovery, all while being able to fill the gaps in that library. There are a lot of different music services out there, but if you're interested combining your curated library with music available via a subscription, then your options are limited. Spotify does allow you to play back locally stored files, which is convenient, but it isn't quite the same. Amazon also allows you to upload your music for playback via Amazon Music, and with Amazon Prime membership, you get a small library of streaming music to go along with that. For $10 a month ($8 for Prime members) you can access their full library as well. But, Google Play Music has a great interface and plugs nicely into all the other Google services we love. Maybe with this new offer, it's time you gave Google Play Music a chance? After all, even if it doesn't end up working out, you still got four free months of music out of the deal.

Carson Saldanha Wait, wdym 3 different countries? Did you share it with others or something? Ailín Ó’S I live in Ireland, so that's my main account. I have a secondary account based in England as part of a mail forwarder service I use, and my bf is Greek so I had him check the code on his account :) Carson Saldanha Oh wow! Carson Saldanha Hey, since I know it worked for you, are you able to use YouTube Red along with this Play Music free trial? Because my YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled for me. Ailín Ó’S No, unfortunately not as I live in the EU and YouTube Red is only available in USA. Carson Saldanha Weird, I'm in the US though. Ailín Ó’S Ooh that is odd. Sign out of the app then sign back in maybe? Carson Saldanha No luck :( I'm in contact with Google support atm Hopefully they can sort this out Mike Worth it alone for Youtube Red MisterAlex Sweet, I wasn't sure if that was included. Thanks. Should mention that in the main blog post. Ben Still no student membership >:( Ailín Ó’S Spotify is a great alternative @€$£5/month. Ben I know that's what I use just because it's half the price. Ailín Ó’S In Ireland Vodafone have a partnership with Spotify whereby it costs €5 standard instead of €10 regardless of if you're a student or not, they even bundle it with some of their plans. Vodafone do the same in some other countries they operate in (not all). Maybe see if any network in your country has a partnership like that? Worth a shot! Ben Oh yeah I'm on EE in the UK and I've got Apple Music for free for 6 months but like iTunes is a massive stinking turd. Ailín Ó’S I'd rather go back to the days of getting music via Bluetooth from friends than use crApple Music 😂😂 Rahul Krishna In india, we have play music for 1.4 usd/month Julian Coronado That's actually what's keeping me away from Play Music. I've used my free months and I loved the Youtube Red too. But as a student, Spotify for $5 / month is too great to pass up on. Cakefish Spotify ftw ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ I don't think this is a new offer, got this a while back. In fact my 4 months is expiring next week. Prefer Spotify over it. Song selection a tad bit weaker, and for foreign songs it tries to translate the song names to English and makes it hard to look up. folkrav I like it, it's way cheaper than Spotify for me - my mother, my sister, my wife and myself each pay 30$ a year and we're set - but Jesus do I hate the clients. I don't like the website's interface, I hate the Android app. But yeah, I'll deal with it cause it's cheap, I guess. Carson Saldanha Got it! Yay! Jim I wish I could somehow get it on my Amazon Echo hahaha. I guess if I had paid for a Google Home it would be worth trying out. Forget vega #getEVGA Why google play music isn't available in my country ? Ailín Ó’S Try Apple Music? They seem to be just about everywhere. Bartek Juszczak My GPM radio's are so good these days I love that Google is so into AI. Whether It's just "I'm being lucky" or radio from a specific song, band or album they very rarely disappoint me these days. I just make sure to thumbs up if it plays a song I particularly love. I am a student and could go cheaper with spotify but the AI generated playlists have me locked in. If it's £5 cheaper but I'm not gonna enjoy it nearly as much then it's not really a good deal. AndTheWorldMayNeverKnow I used the 3 or 4 months free trial during the holidays then bought the family plan for $14.99 a month. 4 people in my family us it and it works great, the app could use some tweaks but it's really good overall. paev If you listen to main stream music it doesn't really matter what service to use. However, if you like something unusual, weird or other languages then Google is a way to go. I found bands on Google music that Spotify displayed as not found. Google also have new synth bands that Spotify doesn't. I'm for Google too. Daniel I discovered that GPM is kinda like a music label. I once went to a section of Google play explaining how indie artists can use GPM like a music label as long as they own all their rights. Ryne Hager Ultraista (among others) keeps me using Google Play Music as well as Spotify. Carson Saldanha Does anyone else who activated the Play Music trial have YouTube Red working as well? My YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled while my Play Music is. Michael Carr I spotted a similar offer a couple of months ago, and I took it after a day or two's thought. Just last week, I moved directly into a family plan. PewPewYoureDead It's hard to recommend Google Play Music until they revamp the UI. Margaritas Ante Porcos Google Music is the only choice in some markets, like Russia, where no Spotify or Pandora are available. There are too many shortcomings in Google Music and Google never shows interest in making services better than below average. I really wonder why Google refuses to become the best at anything. Real magic here. Pixel syndrome all the way. Yet Google Music is on my phone and I use it because there's no choice whatsoever. SupahNin10doh Stupid Dorito logo... Raymond Berger Huh, I just subscribed to the trial but you youtube red hasn't kicked in yet. Any idea how long it takes? h20ray Google Play Music is currently available in select territories and for select account types.

Suggested Sharing is going live in Google Photos for some users Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/25 5:30pm PDTMay 25, 2017 38 Plus 1 on G+ 108 Share on Facebook 70 Share on Twitter Total Shares216 Applications Google News Google Photos is ground zero for the company's crazy machine learning technology. At Google I/O 2017, a number of new features were announced for Photos, including suggested sharing based on who's in a certain photo. But for that to work, Google needs to figure out who is who, and now the Photos web app is asking users to identify what they look like. Upon visiting photos.google.com, you may be welcomed by the above screen. Google already uses machine learning wizardry to match faces to people, so all you have to do is select which face is yours. Once you do that, you'll be able to search for "me" in the Photos search to find pictures of yourself. According to a recent teardown, this option should appear at some point in the Photos app as well, but it didn't for me. Presumably, this will be far more useful once the other features announced at Google I/O show up. Let us know in the comments if you have received the pop-up.

I got the pop up just the other day. I can search for "me" in addition to others such as my daughter's name. John Doe I did but for some reason it shows a photo of me from over 6 years ago even though I have plenty of recent photos LoL Corbin Davenport Yep, my picture was an awful photo of me from several years ago. John Doe I was able to change it by going to people then clicking on the picture and even when you choose a picture with a lot of people in it figures out which one is you and zooms in...creepy bozzykid It doesn't matter what photo you choose of yourself. The rest are all linked to you anyways. This isn't replacing your profile pic. John Doe No but some photos it has not figured out its me or at least when I click on me it doesn't show all the pictures of me but it is good enough to find pictures of me when I was a child which is crazy because I changed a lot. Stakoman Is this US only? would be great if you guys made a "how to enable face recognition google photos" post Suicide_Note Use a US VPN to start using the face recognition. Once you get things setup, you can stop using the VPN, though face recognition should still work. rndusrnm479461 You can use a VPN (get tunnelbear cause it's free) for Android, then clear cache, open photos and enable grouping of faces in the settings. Then you can disable VPN. I did this about a year ago and I've had it ever since without any problem both on Android and on the web. bozzykid I believe it uses one of the firsts photos you have stored. It has already linked the rest to you anyways. Régis Knechtel Not always, apparently, cause it used a recent photo for me. I think it's random. Brendapdaniels Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Defenestratus No. Régis Knechtel "his option should appear at some point in the Photos app as well" It asked to chose my face me today in the android app, while I was setting up a new phone. jcopernicus I accidentally closed the prompt...how to I get it back? Corbin Davenport On the web, go to Settings -> Group similar faces, and there should be an option to pick your face. Yatin No, I'm from India Drakenoid Yes, I'm also from India. Naga Sridhar I am from India too, but are you in India? myssi Pop-up recieved, I'm from Pakistan. Tomáš Petrík And I guess we will be left out in the EU, again :/ Indefinite Implosion I'm in NL and got it a few days ago? A day or two after the announcement maybe (crunch time, so days are a blur). I didn't tip because it doesn't do anything right now so hardly seems worthy of a post. roberto.elena Do you already have "group similar faces" activated? If yes, then you will get this update. Tomáš Petrík No, it is disabled for accounts registered in the EU due to some stupid privacy ruling of the EU. roberto.elena I know, but you can activate it using a VPN (or at least that was possible when they launched Google Photos). Once it's activated, you don't need the VPN anymore, and you get all updates related to face recognition features. Nelson Not correct. I'm in Europe and by using Opera VPN plus Google Photos cache clear the feature appeared Suicide_Note Use a US VPN and you can join the party. Tomáš Petrík It's not about VPN this time. Accounts registered in the EU have facial recognition disabled due to some stupid privacy ruling of the EU. Jens Törnblad That's why you activate the feature with a VPN. Suicide_Note Ah, okay. I wasn't aware of that. Definitely sucks. rndusrnm479461 Get tunnelbear for Android. Choose a US vpn. Clear Google Photos cache -> open it -> enable grouping of faces in the settings. You only have to do this once. I did it a year ago and it has worked ever since on all my devices. Tomáš Petrík It's not about VPN this time, though. Accounts registered in the EU have facial recognition disabled due to some stupid privacy ruling of the EU. rndusrnm479461 Really? I registered mine in EU in ~2008 and activated face grouping in early 2016 without problems. henleyb I got it a day or two ago. Was an old photo but searching for 'me' did bring up correct photos for me so that's something. Looking forward to the sharing stuff next. :) Suicide_Note Haven't seen this popup yet, but on a related note, photo books have gone live for me in the Photos app. Fresh360 My coworker purchased an iPhone 7+ yesterday and I was setting up her apps and when I installed Photos this option actually popped up. I immediately went to my S7 to see did I have it and nothing. Joao Letelier Ummm...

The search engine titan announced it has launched a handy animation tool that essentially lets you turn tedious number charts into slightly more entertaining GIF illustrations. The so-called Data GIF Maker practically allows users to set their desired parameters and effortlessly transform them into data visuals. Google data editor Simon Rogers says the company built the app to make it easier for journalists to rely on data when telling stories; but virtually anyone can benefit from using the tool. While the Google team says it typically resorts to the GIF Maker for visualizing competing search interest, Rogers explains the tool leaves opportunities for much wider application – including representing “polling numbers, sales figures, movie ratings” and so on. Using the Data GIF Maker is fairly straightforward: Enter your data points Choose names for the points of comparison in question Select colors for each data entry Add explanatory text Click ‘Download as GIF’ to generate the images One thing Google unfortunately overlooked is the ability to select how the data displayed has changed over time, which means you will often have to add that additional information separately – in captions, for example. Still, hopefully this feature lands in future iterations of the app. Now go explore the Data GIF Maker here and convert those sleep-inducing statistics into beautifully animated illustrations. Just a little heads-up: The tool might take a few minutes more than you’d like to finish generating images – so be patient.

As you can see, the new tool enables you to create a GIF using any data points – Google suggests you can use Google Trends data, but the actual input is manual, so you can use any data you want. You fill in the relevant fields, select the colors for each point, enter in a title, then press ‘Launch Comparisons’ and you'll get a sample of your new GIF, like this. The GIF option provides you with an interesting way to present relevant data – you have to experiment with it a bit to get it exactly how you’d like (note the full title is cut off in the Twitter listing in my example), but it’s an interesting option, especially for those looking for new ways to highlight such insights. As you may have noticed, content creators love to add in Google Trends data to underpin their points - though it can sometimes lead to come misleading stats. Here’s an example (as highlighted by Danny Page in his excellent Medium post on the subject), when the Brexit vote was completed, and the subsequent confusion was in full swing, Google Trends published this tweet: "What is the EU?" is the second top UK question on the EU since the #EURefResults were officially announced pic.twitter.com/1q4VAX3qcm — GoogleTrends (@GoogleTrends) June 24, 2016 Which lead to this article in The Washington Post. But as Page points out, their definition of ‘frantic’ may not quite be accurate – when you put that increased search volume in context, matched against other trends, you can see that while the volume had increased, it wasn't getting massive attention. As such, it’s important to put the data in context – but when used well, Google Trends can provide some great visualizations and data accompaniments, which is what Google’s looking to help boost with their new data tool. GIFs can also help boost content engagement – on Twitter, for example, Tweets with GIFs generate 6X more engagement than basic text updates. It’s a small addition, sure, but an interesting one – an easy to use data visualization tools which you can use in your content.  Author Information Andrew Hutchinson @adhutchinson Sign up for the Social Media Today newsletter You'll get a daily email with the latest news, lessons, and insights on: Social Media Marketing Digital Strategy and more Yes, I'd like to receive Marketing Dive's daily newsletter as well.

Part of a series of new measurement tools introduced at Google Marketing Next, Google Attribution aims to help marketers determine what is driving consumers to make their online purchasing decisions. Google is at an "inflection point," noted Sridhar Ramaswamy, senior vice president of ads and commerce, when it comes to the use of technology to measure online marketing effectiveness. "What's exciting is that things that were really hard we're going to be able to make easy, because technology is doing the heavy lifting," he told conference attendees. Seconds Matter Page-loading time is an important factor in terms of how long advertisers have to hook a consumer online, Ramaswamy said. As load time increased from one to seven seconds, the probability of a consumer bouncing more than doubled, found a recent study that analyzed 900,000 mobile landing pages in more than 100 countries. That translates to conversions falling by up to 20 percent for every one second delay in page-load time. Most existing attribution measurement tools have three main shortcomings, according to Ramaswamy. First, they lose track of the customer journey when they move between tools; second, they are hard to set up; and third, they are not integrated with ad tools. Because of those shortcomings, marketers typically are stuck with using last-click attribution, which misses the impact of most marketing touchpoints. The new Google Attribution tool incorporates data from AdWords, Google Analytics and DoubleClick Search, which provides a more comprehensive picture of data from all marketing channels, according to Google. Google Attribution also makes it easy to switch over to data-driven attribution, which uses ads, keywords and campaigns that have the greatest impact on a company's goals, Google said. Using the data-driven attribution model typically requires a minimum set of data, which is 15,000 clicks, and at least 600 conversions within a 30-day period. Google will offer an enterprise version, Google Attribution 360, to meet the needs of larger advertisers, noted Bill Kee, group product manager at the company. Google Attribution currently is in beta and will roll out to additional customers over the next few months. Not Quite Ready Google Attribution is an "aspirational sell" for advertisers, particularly for small and medium-sized businesses, suggested Paul Teich, principal analyst at Tirias Research. "Google intends to make it free, so it will see a lot of uptake, but many users will have zero comparative experience to judge how much better they are doing with Attribution," he told the E-Commerce Times. The major benefit will be providing more-accessible feedback for designing online user experiences, Teich said, noting that it's not clear how artificial intelligence can make a contribution -- at least until Attribution has been able to analyze millions of Web pages. Google is ahead of the curve compared to other Internet companies, which are only average at measuring the efficacy of online marketing, observed Michael Jude, a program manager at Stratecast/Frost & Sullivan. "Machine learning does give it an edge in making sense of the relationship between key clicks and online purchases," he told the E-Commerce Times. "While simple algorithms can provide some insight, especially as applied to last click models, machine learning can understand such things as click back, where the last key click is not the purchase, but rather an artifact of comparison shopping," Jude explained. Data Points Google made several other announcements related to providing additional marketing data. It launched a new AdWords beta to let advertisers use fast-loading AMP pages as landing pages for search ads and to speed up ads across the Google Display Network. This follows Google's introduction about 18 months ago of the Accelerated Mobile Pages project to speed up the Web with faster browsing. Google also announced a new tool to bring in-market audiences to Search, in order to help advertisers reach users who are ready to buy their products. Using machine learning, the tool analyzes trillions of search queries and millions of websites to determine when searchers are close to making a buying decision on a product. The company unveiled plans to roll out store-sales measurement at the device and campaign levels, which will allow advertisers to measure in-store revenue and store visits delivered by search and shopping ads. If advertisers collect email information at the point of sale through loyalty programs, Google said, store transactions can be imported directly into Adwords by the advertiser or through a third-party data partner.

Google is now offering four free months of Google Play Music for new subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:17pm PDTMay 26, 2017 43 Plus 1 on G+ 312 Share on Facebook 65 Share on Twitter Total Shares420 Google News Right now it looks like Google is running a special offer for Google Play Music. New subscribers that sign up here can get four free months of service instead of the usual three. No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it. It could save you an extra $10. Again, this particular offer is only for new subscribers. I've been a fan of Play Music for a long time, though the device removal limit does get in the way when you switch between devices and ROMs as often as I do. Being able to mix your own library with those of a service also comes in handy. That way I can continue to support artists I am passionate about, without eschewing the larger selection of a subscription offering for the purposes of content discovery, all while being able to fill the gaps in that library. There are a lot of different music services out there, but if you're interested combining your curated library with music available via a subscription, then your options are limited. Spotify does allow you to play back locally stored files, which is convenient, but it isn't quite the same. Amazon also allows you to upload your music for playback via Amazon Music, and with Amazon Prime membership, you get a small library of streaming music to go along with that. For $10 a month ($8 for Prime members) you can access their full library as well. But, Google Play Music has a great interface and plugs nicely into all the other Google services we love. Maybe with this new offer, it's time you gave Google Play Music a chance? After all, even if it doesn't end up working out, you still got four free months of music out of the deal.

I have a secondary account based in England as part of a mail forwarder service I use, and my bf is Greek so I had him check the code on his account :) Carson Saldanha Oh wow! Carson Saldanha Hey, since I know it worked for you, are you able to use YouTube Red along with this Play Music free trial? Because my YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled for me. Ailín Ó’S No, unfortunately not as I live in the EU and YouTube Red is only available in USA. Carson Saldanha Weird, I'm in the US though. Ailín Ó’S Ooh that is odd. Sign out of the app then sign back in maybe? Carson Saldanha No luck :( I'm in contact with Google support atm Hopefully they can sort this out Mike Worth it alone for Youtube Red MisterAlex Sweet, I wasn't sure if that was included. Thanks. Should mention that in the main blog post. Ben Still no student membership >:( Ailín Ó’S Spotify is a great alternative @€$£5/month. Ben I know that's what I use just because it's half the price. Ailín Ó’S In Ireland Vodafone have a partnership with Spotify whereby it costs €5 standard instead of €10 regardless of if you're a student or not, they even bundle it with some of their plans. Vodafone do the same in some other countries they operate in (not all). Maybe see if any network in your country has a partnership like that? Worth a shot! Ben Oh yeah I'm on EE in the UK and I've got Apple Music for free for 6 months but like iTunes is a massive stinking turd. Ailín Ó’S I'd rather go back to the days of getting music via Bluetooth from friends than use crApple Music 😂😂 Rahul Krishna In india, we have play music for 1.4 usd/month Julian Coronado That's actually what's keeping me away from Play Music. I've used my free months and I loved the Youtube Red too. But as a student, Spotify for $5 / month is too great to pass up on. Cakefish Spotify ftw ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ I don't think this is a new offer, got this a while back. In fact my 4 months is expiring next week. Prefer Spotify over it. Song selection a tad bit weaker, and for foreign songs it tries to translate the song names to English and makes it hard to look up. folkrav I like it, it's way cheaper than Spotify for me - my mother, my sister, my wife and myself each pay 30$ a year and we're set - but Jesus do I hate the clients. I don't like the website's interface, I hate the Android app. But yeah, I'll deal with it cause it's cheap, I guess. Carson Saldanha Got it! Yay! Jim I wish I could somehow get it on my Amazon Echo hahaha. I guess if I had paid for a Google Home it would be worth trying out. Forget vega #getEVGA Why google play music isn't available in my country ? Ailín Ó’S Try Apple Music? They seem to be just about everywhere. Bartek Juszczak My GPM radio's are so good these days I love that Google is so into AI. Whether It's just "I'm being lucky" or radio from a specific song, band or album they very rarely disappoint me these days. I just make sure to thumbs up if it plays a song I particularly love. I am a student and could go cheaper with spotify but the AI generated playlists have me locked in. If it's £5 cheaper but I'm not gonna enjoy it nearly as much then it's not really a good deal. AndTheWorldMayNeverKnow I used the 3 or 4 months free trial during the holidays then bought the family plan for $14.99 a month. 4 people in my family us it and it works great, the app could use some tweaks but it's really good overall. paev If you listen to main stream music it doesn't really matter what service to use. However, if you like something unusual, weird or other languages then Google is a way to go. I found bands on Google music that Spotify displayed as not found. Google also have new synth bands that Spotify doesn't. I'm for Google too. Daniel I discovered that GPM is kinda like a music label. I once went to a section of Google play explaining how indie artists can use GPM like a music label as long as they own all their rights. Ryne Hager Ultraista (among others) keeps me using Google Play Music as well as Spotify. Carson Saldanha Does anyone else who activated the Play Music trial have YouTube Red working as well? My YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled while my Play Music is. Michael Carr I spotted a similar offer a couple of months ago, and I took it after a day or two's thought. Just last week, I moved directly into a family plan. PewPewYoureDead It's hard to recommend Google Play Music until they revamp the UI. Margaritas Ante Porcos Google Music is the only choice in some markets, like Russia, where no Spotify or Pandora are available. There are too many shortcomings in Google Music and Google never shows interest in making services better than below average. I really wonder why Google refuses to become the best at anything. Real magic here. Pixel syndrome all the way. Yet Google Music is on my phone and I use it because there's no choice whatsoever. SupahNin10doh Stupid Dorito logo... Raymond Berger Huh, I just subscribed to the trial but you youtube red hasn't kicked in yet. Any idea how long it takes? h20ray Google Play Music is currently available in select territories and for select account types.

Here are a few ways machine learning has improved Gboard Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/24 4:33pm PDTMay 24, 2017 36 Plus 1 on G+ 110 Share on Facebook 97 Share on Twitter Total Shares243 Applications Google Google has been improving Gboard with the same type of tools it uses for speech recognition: machine learning. The budding technology is rapidly becoming a ubiquitous method for improving results and performance. If a network can be trained to accurately accomplish something in a performant way, odds are you'll see it introduced to any product it can be applied to. Gboard and text-input as a whole are no different, and we are reaping the benefits of improved corrections and predictions every time we swipe out a low-accuracy message to a friend. But how do these improvements work? This is going to be a pretty technical post, and I'm going to do my best to simplify things to a level where everyone can enjoy the subject. All of this is based on a recent Google Research blog post. If you are really into machine learning and you already know what every term I might use means, the source link is probably the best place for you to learn about the cool new stuff in Gboard. If, however, you think you might want a few of the concepts or terms explained, then this article might be the place for you. Google's latest research blog post is all about one thing: Gboard. The authors talk about some of the new features that were shown off at I/O, like the transliteration tools for typing in a language you might only have a phonetic familiarity with. But the biggest things discussed in the article relate to how input is determined, and the models and math that determine which swipes equate to which words, and how to most accurately correct mistakes. The two solutions Google has found revolve around its neural spatial models for processing input, and finite-state transducers for state progression to accurately determine content. These sound like complex ideas, but their cleverness can be explained. Input Neural spatial models are just a fancy way of saying machine learning applied to any space. For instance, the physical Gboard keyboard layout itself. When we type, we sometimes type wrong. And when we swipe, we sometimes swipe wrong. I might have meant to drag over "P" for this word, but I only made it to O. That's where these neural spatial models come in handy. They are able to determine probabilities for which letters you meant to hit based on physical proximity of input, as well as predictive models based on trained corrections. Originally, Gboard used a Gaussian model, combed with a set of simple rules. That's a fancy way of saying it used physical proximity in a sort of bell-curve out from a given key, combined with a basic understanding of certain common errors. The developers have replaced the older Gaussian and rule-based model with an LSTM, or long short-term memory model, trained by a CTC, or connectionist temporal classification. Big somewhat scary acronyms, but they're actually pretty simple ideas. A long short-term memory is a particular kind of neural net ideal for use in applications of intermittent or unknown event/time latencies, and Google has previously used these for speech recognition, the Google Assistant, and Google Translate. A connectionist temporal classification is a specific method of training a neural network. After all, a neural network is nothing without data to derive weighted triggers and values from. In this case, it means segmenting data input to the network by time and allowing the network to retroactively refer to input, states, and output before and after the current set. To further simplify, it means referring to data at many stages of analysis from multiple periods of time, increasing the value of context in the network's training. To pull data for training, Google used data sets comprised of information collected when users opt-in to share snippets, and set reverted corrections and suggestions as negative signals, and accepted corrections or suggestions as positive. To help visualize how it might work, we have this image. In the above, the left represents individual data points from the word "could" as swiped on Gboard. The right is a normalized temporal data for the same swiped input. By being able to refer to the probable center of an input, in temporal context with inputs that came before and after, we can tell that the overall path means "Could" even if we might not have hit a couple of letters quite right. Google was further able to adapt some of its speech recognition tools and data and apply it to corrections and suggestions in Gboard, optimizing things over iterations with a heavy dose of Tensorflow to increase the speed of analysis and output and decrease the number of errors. All that is well and good, but Google can also leverage the rules of a language to enhance predictions. As a basic example, consider: If you tapped O-T instead of I-T, Gboard can look at its dictionary and determine that "OT" isn't something you are likely to input, but that the similar "IT" is a word. Furthermore, "I" is physically close to "O," so you probably meant "IT." Easy. Well, Google is able to do a similar but improved sort thing via what is called a finite-state transducer. Processing To vastly over-simplify, a finite-state transducer, in this case, means an order of operations for processing input. The operational flow above shows the various stages of potential input for the words "I," "I've," and "If." In this image input at each stage comes before the ":" (with ε representing nothing as either input or output), and potential outputs are shown after the ":" as they each become logical. So we start having input the letter "i." From the top path we can see, if there is no additional input, then "I" is the correct output. If an apostrophe or space follows, followed by the letter "v," then "I've" is the likely output. If the letter "f" follows, then "If" is the likely output. The final two flows at the bottom return to start. You can think of it as just a series of rules for input and output. Google is able to use these same tools at other scales. For instance, developers can create these logical chains for whole words and their contexts, combined with the spatial models above and statistical likelihoods for possible inputs. These tools also apply to the transliteration features that were shown off at I/O. By implementing those same workflows and networks towards phonetically spelled input, it can guess what characters or words in another language you might mean. For anyone that might speak a language, but not know how to spell it, that's pretty cool. Unfortunately, if you can't read the language, you aren't really in a position to know if what it's typing is right or wrong, but it's still a useful tool. Output Gboard and machine learning are both pretty fantastically interesting and complex subjects. I hope our simplification of the tools behind it has helped you understand a bit more behind how it all works. It's useful to have knowledge about how the things we use on a daily basis work, not just in an abstract sense for intellectual fulfillment, but to provide us with a base for troubleshooting when things might go wrong. Now when GBoard makes seemingly odd recommendations, you might have a small idea as to why.

It's also buggy and crashy as hell. I switched to SwiftKey and haven't looked back. elijahblake it is very, very, very, bad at predicting correct words.. I do miss swiftkey sometimes. I guess i'm just hanging in there hoping the gboard starts learning. Just today instead of "this" it put "thoe" Dennis Ulijn I accidentally typed htought and it corrected it to brought instead of thought... Like... Why?! dimm0k I've mentioned this before... prior to the change of name to Gboard when it was Google Keyboard, the prediction was actually decent! since the name change however I agree that the prediction has been pretty crappy! words that I've typed pretty often still get mistaken for some other random word that doesn't even work in the sentence I'm typing out! JD I'm not the only one the noticed. That since the GBoard change it's turned to shit. When it was Google Keyboard it was neck and neck with Swiftkey David Thoren That's interesting.. I've never really used the prediction to type with, I just swipe through without looking, so I can't really speak to that.. But I have never seen Gboard crash or even get unstable. KlausWillSeeYouNow Gboard is totally unstable on my LG V20. Maybe it's just something specific to my device – but only recent versions of Gboard have had this issue for me. I miss the days of Google Keyboard, a stable product that actually worked. gv Haven't had any stability problems with g'board; don't think it's even crashed once on my axon7. But then again, it doesn't work worth a damn either, so is that really such an accomplishment? KlausWillSeeYouNow Yeah. Amen. Sounds like you and I should have a beer sometime. We clearly feel the same about Gboard. gv You can apply all the fancy machine learning you want, doesn't change that gv is total shit at predicting swiped words... it's so bad that I've gone back to swype despite it being a resource hog and slow. My favorite thing is you'll swipe a word, and gv will take a guess and be really wrong. So you'll back over it, swipe it again and gv will guess the EXACT SAME WORD. So you'll back over it, swipe it again, and gv will now be so sure that it won't offer *any* alternative suggestions (even though the alternative suggestions were also wrong) the third time. Machine learning, my ass! Machine stupidity; if it wasn't the correct word the first or second time you can be damn sure it's not the correct word the third time! So then you type in the word you actually want, and next sentence you need the same word. Idiot gv then suggests the original word AGAIN when you swipe it. Machine learning, my ass! At least swype is smart enough to know that if you just used a word it didn't swype in correctly, next time you swype something close to that (even if you didn't permanently add it to the dictionary) that's likely the word you wanted! KlausWillSeeYouNow AMEN! PREACH! I second this. It's so annoying. You said it better than I ever could, pal. Whatever Gboard's doing, it isn't working. Carson Saldanha I'm even on the beta on my 2014 Nexus 6 and it's running just fine--no crashes or anything. blahmoomoo If they can one day figure out when I mean to say "if" or "of", I'll be happy. It feels like less of a problem recently, but it still happens sometimes... Lare2 The problem I have with Gboard is that when you write on two languages and forget to change the language, over the time, it will start suggesting words on the wrong language. Rod This. On the other hand, Swiftkey handles languages nicely. h4rr4r It does this to me constantly. What I hate is that enabling a language for this requires adding its keyboard. For languages with the same alphabet but different layout it is really annoying. big_al77 I love gboard. Best keyboard for a while now Miku is Best Vocaloid I started using it as soon as they added bilingual prediction. Ha hecho mi vida mucho más fácil.

Can't it understand that I'm writing in Italian, with also the Italian dictionary set up? Lare2 It's​ doing the same to me when typing in Spanish. Stu I've finally made the switch from fleksy to gboard. Not the smoothest transition but there are some pluses. I just wish that when I turned off auto capitalization it worked for everything and not just the first letter of a sentence. Wouldn't mind if it knew that punctuation went at the end of the last word, even if I put a space already (like with commas). Would also be nice if when I added words to the dictionary it knew better when to suggest them or auto add them. Even when I add shortcuts in the dictionary I still have to type very deliberately, add apostrophes myself, etc. My name is…. A far lesser keyboard to Swiftkey. Mike Each have their pros and cons, I personally prefer Gboard for it's speed but Swiftkey has more features going for it. KlausWillSeeYouNow There's nothing fast about having to correct nearly every word Gboard predicts or swipes wrong. It will change correctly typed words, like "got," to stuff that can neither be contextually nor structurally related, like "hey." It was just like torture. I wanted to love Gboard but couldn't :( Aaron I want to love Gboard still. Just couldn't keep using Swiftkey after after the MS buyout. KlausWillSeeYouNow Why? It's not like it has Outlook built in or anything. Prezes Dyrektor Because Microsoft spying on us is evil, and Google or Facebook for example are fair and righteous /s Aaron IDK. My ever growing disdain for Windows has expanded to all Microsoft products. It's not necessarily rational. Brandon Giesing I'm pretty sure they mean speed as in it doesn't lag your whole device like SwiftKey does. Yeah you do waste more time technically because correcting stuff non-stop but Gboard is definitely faster than SwiftKey when it comes to not lagging. KlausWillSeeYouNow I've had the exact opposite experience. Everything about SwiftKey is faster. Gboard is a lagfest. Dmitry Stepanushkin Sure some people will use swipe input, but I prefer tap, especially for English keyboard, it's much faster for me, and swipe feels unreliable. Mike I try to Swype all the time and it just feels like I'm wasting time versus just tapping. Christopher Bement Swiping is way faster for me. tlogank Gboard kills the battery on my S7 for some reason. I get more alerts about it eating my battery up than any other app. Wish that wasn't the case because it's my favorite keyboard, but I can't keep using it as is. Carson Saldanha Try setting the theme to black AMOLED. I know that shouldn't be the fix and probably won't fully fix it, but it'll for sure help a little and will only take a while until you get used to the look. tlogank I'm getting notices for it even when I'm not using it. It's like doing stuff in the background or something. Carson Saldanha Strange. Have you tried a reinstall? Christopher Bement What have you tried in an attempt to fix it? tlogank Not much besides uninstalling and reinstalling it. Doesn't seem to help for more than a day. Druter Gboard is one of the most inaccurate keyboards on the Play store right now. Sometimes it almost seems as if it's trying to make typing as full of errors as possible. I have taken to reading everything two or three times to catch the errors and it still manages to sneak some in there. I do not have confidence enough in Gboard to type even short sentences and hit send without proofreading. If this is machine learning, the machine needs to go back to school Captain_Invisible Yup! It is by far the worst correction I have ever experienced in a keyboard. I can press all the right letters for a word (that makes complete sense) just to have it "correct" to another word... Michael Oghia The spell check isn't as good as it used to be either. obk88 just used it for about a week its very intriguing...using gifs, doing quick search from the keyboard and also used the translation option...but typing is just more effortless on swfitkey. Prediction is better on swiftkey, no suggestions in chrome or other apps is really annoying & gliding isnt as smooth...google is going in the right direction but this app still needs work...for now im back on swfitkey but keeping an eye on gboard for sure gv gboard may have machine learning algorithms, but they suck out loud. The ONLY thing it has going for it is launch speed. Other than that, it's far slower because it mis-predicts what word I'm swiping nearly 85% of the time. Seriously, I was swiping a text the other day and it didn't swipe a correct word. Eventually wound up thumbing the message just so I could talk! tehboogieman One of my biggest issues with Gboard is the inconsistency of whole word delete when swipe typing. I recently discovered there is a swipe backspace feature that I haven't read about anywhere that partially makes up for it, but I wish they would make the experience more consistent. If AP hasn't mentioned it yet it might be post worthy. I like a lot of the other improvements that Gboard has over the previous Google/AOSP keyboard. I've noticed a lot of improvements in text correction that takes a little getting used to, where it actually corrects groups of words or phrases in some situations. Still annoyed that I can't sync with my other devices just because I have one GSuite account EH101 The GSuite thing pisses me off. And it's not even the 'main' account. Martin AP wrote about the "delete whole words by sliding from backspace" thing back when it was introduced a year ago, but then the keyboard was still called Google Keyboard. Ailín Ó’S SwiftKey will remain my goto however. Nathan J And yet, they still can't tell the difference between to and too, or insist I meant CSV when I trace type "can." Rod Great post! Amarus Kh I've been trying Gboard for four weeks now since I got a new phone, but I just can't get myself to like it. I find it annoying that it doesn't show suggestions in many types of input fields (e.g. my email address in user fields, chrome search/address bar, etc.), swiping is unreliable most of the time, predictions are rarely relevant and don't seem to have improved with use, and so on. I'm going back to Swype. Dave i use texpand for emails h4rr4r Can machine learning add the rest of the keys to the keyboard? xphyle Swiftkey for the Win. Samson In German no sign of improvement so far. F4LL0U7 That's really great, but they still haven't fixed the bug where you can't open the emoji gallery when using a physical bluetooth keyboard. ChrisHigs Most of the time i find it pretty good, but occasionally *is* it's frustrating. Sometimes it won't suggest the word I want when I am *doing* swiping directly over the letters of the word but suggests *stone* some other *weird* word. Like cos. No chips. No I want chips. Grr. Cos. No again. Cos cos cos cos cos cos. What I was trying to type was "chops" but it won't let me. Surrey Street Surrey Surrey Street Surrey. Why won't it recognise "suet". Flip, grr, flip, no, flop *send* seems another tricky *I've* one. I'm not going over the i but it suggests flip instead of flop half the time. This is all *speed* swiped on gboard and the asterisks are incorrect suggestions it made. bekifft Type them out, and drag the incorrect suggestions to the trash can. It should learn. The more you accept the incorrect corrections the more it will reinforce them. May want to clear all learned words and start over. ChrisHigs Thanks. I didn't know you could drag suggestions to delete them. I've just been playing with swiping some of those words again and making sure it's using the correct one and it's definitely behaving better. Like chop. I can now swipe chop and chip without it being confused. And flop. Flop flop flop. And flip. Yup. Handling them better now. Shame there's no way to manually type in a correction or see a longer list of words. bekifft You can't explicitly correct a particular word as far as I can tell, but if you remove the auto suggestion it is supposed to learn intelligently. I guess this is the future, we have to teach the machines like children and hope they grow up to be good. Martin Now if only Gboard could understand that when I type "har" ("have" in Swedish), I don't mean "här" or "hår" ("here" and "hair", respectively). Had I been using an English keyboard layout it would have been understandable, but with a Swedish layout Å and Ä are separate keys on the opposite side of the keyboard, meaning that I really, really didn't go anywhere near those letters. SwiftKey had the same problem, but fixed it many years ago. MHS I'm Danish, and with Swiftkey you can even change layout of the English keyboard to the same as Danish (or Swedish in your case). That way there's no language switching at all. Kevin I'd consider gboard among the worst for autocorrect. Example: I type "if I spell" googles three auto corrects from left to right is spell, spelling and spelled. When is "if I spelling" ever right? And why is that center? Swiftkey however, from left to right; spelled, spell, and spell it. All improved and in an order that makes the most sense. xyz And a Happy Holi to you too, machine. D.Smithee I like Gboard--I really do. But it's got too many niggling problems for me to leave Swiftkey. Like not putting a space after a comma or period. Like the keyboard itself being too small for my hands. Like the word sync feature being NOWHERE near as good as Swiftkey. But it's getting better with every iteration--so maybe one day...

 YOUR E-MAIL VERIFICATION CODE The Ministry of Finance has charged Google with a penalty of TL 300 million ($84 million) on the grounds that the company issued invoices for its advertising sales over Ireland and caused tax losses to Turkey. The Treasury Department's Tax Inspection Board reached a conclusion during routine audits into the world's largest search engine, Google. Tax inspectors found that despite the fact that Google has been conducting its online advertising activities from its Turkish office in Tekfen Plaza in Levent, Istanbul, the company issued the advertising sales bills for Turkish customers through Ireland and causing a huge tax loss to Turkey. U.S.-based multinational corporations such as Apple, Microsoft, Google and Twitter have allegedly carried out their commercial activities outside the U.S. through the companies they established in Ireland in order to evade taxes. The international press occasionally covers the situation, which has caused serious tension between the European Union (EU) and the U.S., especially now that the tax battles have escalated. It is known that these companies, which also operate in Turkey, have transferred their commercial income obtained from Turkey to Ireland, even though they have sales offices and serious commercial organizations in the country. After detecting that Google issued the invoices for its advertising sales over Ireland, tax inspectors reported that Google had an office as part of Article 5 of the Double Taxation Avoidance Agreement signed in 2011 between Ireland and Turkey. Google, which has been operating in Turkey since 2006 in the field of online advertising as its main activity, has also gained ad revenue through YouTube since 2014. In their 2015 review, inspectors proposed a corporate tax of approximately TL 300 million and VAT on behalf of Google for the periods of 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013. It was later learned that Google did not appeal to the Tax Court for penalties, and that it benefited from tax amnesty. Google paid the said penalties within the scope of the related law.

lifehacker Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root Video Skillet Two Cents Vitals Ditch Apple's Default Keyboard for One of These Alternatives Patrick Lucas AustinYesterday 6:00pm Filed to: iPhone Android Keyboards Utilities 19 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Image credit: John Moore/Getty In terms of functionality, Apple’s generic, preloaded keyboard has certainly improved, but even after adding its own App Store, complete with stickers and apps, it’s still a little bland. What I do love about Apple is its support for third-party keyboards. You can ditch the generic offering and download enough keyboards for every conceivable customization option you want. Keep in mind you don’t have to commit. Don’t be afraid to install more than one keyboard! If I’m looking for some particular animated image I’ll use GIPHY Keys more than Gboard, but during normal texting hours or when typing in a note-taking app like Bear, swipe-friendly keyboards are my tool of choice. Gboard (Android, iOS) Google’s keyboard (available for iOS and Android) is packed with just enough features to be useful but not too many to be cumbersome or unwieldy. It’s been my keyboard of choice since its debut, thanks to its simple search integration: In true Google fashion, you can search from the keyboard itself and send links as well as descriptive cards to recipients. Its responsive swipe functionality is great for popping in and out where other keyboards I’ve tried in the past were somewhat sluggish in acknowledging my swiping as spelling. Advertisement You can pull images and GIFs from Gboard to send or save (though the results sometimes differ between its desktop and Gboard searches). Sure, you can type on it like a traditional keyboard, but Gboard also features glide typing—swiping your finger across letters to spell words—just like Swype and Swiftkey, and it learns from your history to improve its predictive search and text suggestion without transmitting personal data to the company. If you’re on a bigger phone, the combination of glide typing and a one-handed typing setting on Gboard is a godsend, and makes texting easier and less stressful on your weak human form. Like talking to your phone? Gboard supports text dictation just like Apple’s keyboard. Gboard for Android packs in a few more extra features than its iOS counterpart, including language auto-detection complete with autocorrect and suggested text, as well as live translation. Word Flow (iOS) Made by a team in Microsoft’s experimental Garage division, Word Flow’s easy one-handed use lets me knock some text off even while straphanging. Its standout feature is its curved keyboard mode: the keyboard sits in the corner of your screen and makes it easy for your thumb to reach every letter. You can even glide type while it’s curved, and see its suggested text (though the curvature reduces the selection choice list). The built-in web search powered by Bing lets you copy and paste images and GIFs, too. If you’re suffering from thumb trouble during your typing sessions or just want to be able to reach your keys without two hands, then this is definitely a keyboard to test. 60 Essential Keyboard Shortcuts Every Office Worker Should Know Of course, you may not need all 60 of these, but knowing them will make you flexible, fast, and…Read more Swiftkey (Android, iOS) With SwiftKey, Microsoft now has two different keyboards in Apple’s app store. Swiftkey just got a much-needed redesign and with it a more minimal, functional look. It’s also more responsive than before, registering swipes quickly enough. It supports swipe typing like Gboard and Word Flow, and custom themes in case you want to add colors to your keycaps. Advertisement Sponsored Hooking Swiftkey up to your Facebook or Google account gives it access to your data (it’s encrypted before leaving your device, and Swiftkey doesn’t have your login information) that it uses to personalize your autocorrect functionality as well as predictive text suggestions. It will even show you how it’s adjusting your typing style and how much time you’re saving by not tapping away at letters. It’s got a few tricks up its sleeve if you’re looking to expand your language options—a recent update boosted support to over 100 languages. GIPHY Keys (iOS) I like GIFs. You like GIFs. We all like GIFs. Why not use a GIF-friendly keyboard? In terms of typing, you won’t find anything revolutionary here. You’ll be tapping away just like before. Giphy Keys isn’t as full-featured as Gboard, nor does it feature glide typing functionality like Swype. It’s cute, though—and it blows the competition out of the water in terms of GIF search functionality. Giphy is the gold standard of GIF integration across the web, especially since it lets you access the Betaworks company’s repository of both pop culture and original GIF content through its slew of categories—or you can search them yourself from the keyboard.

The app has received a couple of few exciting updates in the last few months. A new feature spotted by 9to5google is hitting the app in the coming months. This new feature called Archive, will let you remove those private images from the main Photo tab without getting rid of them from your library. Not everyone has seen the new Archive feature yet—and the last time I checked, it wasn’t there. However, the report went on to say that the Archive option is placed in the drawer above Trash. You can access Archive from the overflow menu of any picture—and of course, it comes with a tutorial popping up the first time you open it. 9to5google also reported that Archive will remain in albums and search results. Archive has already gone live on Android, with no date set for the web and iOS versions. However, the possibility of having the feature extended to the iOS and web version in the coming days is high—and probably won’t be long. Google Photos recently announced a major milestone—it now has 500 million active users—and that in itself is an achievement. It is indeed a great achievement when you consider the number of apps providing almost similar services these days. Of course, one has to take into account the fact that the name Google always rings a bell; but the fact that not every app from the Mountain View California-based company has been that successful. Along with announcing its 500 million milestone, Google also introduced three new features last week to make sharing and printing on the app easier and interesting. Everyone, and that includes you, will soon be able to order printed books of photos when using the app. You will also be able to share all photos automatically with a significant order, get automated suggestions about what to share based on clues. One of the features added is called Suggested Sharing, a new feature that will help you share and receive all those important photos—and yes, it saves you the stress of having to manually do it by yourself. This feature is based on Google’s machine learning technology—and will remind you to share, and automatically select the right photos, suggest who to send it to according to who is in the photos. Suggested Sharing is easy to use, simply tap the send button, and your friends and family will see all your photos. They will also get a reminder from the app to share their photos too. “Now all the photos of that birthday dinner or weekend trip are in one place, including—and especially—the photos you didn’t take,” said Anil Sabharwal, Vice President Google Photos.

Photograph: Lucy Nicholson/Reuters Google Accused of underpaying women, Google says it's too expensive to get wage data Officials said it was too financially burdensome and logistically challenging to hand over salary records that the government requested in discrimination case Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Sam Levin in San Francisco @SamTLevin email Friday 26 May 2017 17.49 EDT Google argued that it was too financially burdensome and logistically challenging to compile and hand over salary records that the government has requested, sparking a strong rebuke from the US Department of Labor (DoL), which has accused the Silicon Valley firm of underpaying women. Google accused of 'extreme' gender pay discrimination by US labor department Read more Google officials testified in federal court on Friday that it would have to spend up to 500 hours of work and $100,000 to comply with investigators’ ongoing demands for wage data that the DoL believes will help explain why the technology corporation appears to be systematically discriminating against women. Noting Google’s nearly $28bn annual income as one of the most profitable companies in the US, DoL attorney Ian Eliasoph scoffed at the company’s defense, saying, “Google would be able to absorb the cost as easy as a dry kitchen sponge could absorb a single drop of water.” The tense exchanges in a small San Francisco courtroom emerged in the final day of testimony in the most high-profile government trial to date surrounding the intensifying debate about the wage gap and gender discrimination in the tech industry. The DoL first publicly accused Google of “systemic compensation disparities” during a hearing in April, saying a preliminary inquiry had found that the Mountain View tech firm underpays women across positions. The current court battle stems from the DoL’s lawsuit filed against Google in January, accusing the company of violating federal laws by refusing to provide salary history and contact information of employees as part of a government audit. As a federal contractor, Google is required to comply with equal opportunity laws and allow investigators to review records. Labor officials have said they uncovered pay disparities in a 2015 snapshot of salaries and that investigators needed an earlier snapshot and compensation history of the employees to better understand the wage gap. The agency has also argued that it needs contact information of employees so it can conduct confidential interviews. Google would be able to absorb the cost as easy as a dry kitchen sponge could absorb a single drop of water DoL attorney Ian Eliasoph “This is obviously a very time-consuming and burdensome project,” said Lisa Barnett Sween, one of Google’s attorneys, claiming that the company has already worked 2,300 hours at a cost of nearly $500,000 to partially comply with the government’s demands, which she argued were broad and unconstitutional. “Our courts must act to check this abuse of power.” Google has vehemently denied the claims that it underpays women, claiming that it has closed its gender pay gap globally and that in the US it provides equal pay across races. Google has also argued that the DoL’s data request would violate the privacy of employees and fourth amendment rights against unreasonable search and seizure. In one revealing exchange, Frank Wagner, the company’s director of compensation, admitted in court that if women are paid less than men in the same positions, those salary disparities can persist even if the employees perform at the same level. Asked about a hypothetical, Wagner explained that if a female employee starts at a lower salary than a male colleague in the same job at Google, she may continue to make less even if they both excel in their first year and score the same on evaluations. Wagner claimed that eventually, their wages would likely be adjusted to match each other: “There would be convergence over time.” Eliasoph, the DoL attorney, said that it was outrageous for Google to argue that historical salary data was irrelevant to the government’s audit, considering it is widely understood that discriminatory wages lead to continued disparities as women advance in their careers. “This claim requires putting one’s head in the sand with respect to 30 years of law on pay discrimination.” Kristin Zmrhal, Google’s senior legal operations manager, also testified that the process of compiling data for the DoL has required engineers, lawyers and employees across departments to build new systems, conduct extensive quality reviews of files, redact documents and complete other complex tasks. “It became too burdensome,” she said, noting Google was forced to hire a third-party vendor to help. “The team was bogged down.” Eliasoph pointed out that Google has consistently earned millions in lucrative government contracts and has recently announced “with great public fanfare” that it invested $150m in diversity initiatives. “Google cannot claim ... that it now has no money to comply with a federal agency seeking to ensure compliance with equal opportunity laws on behalf of the public.” He also claimed that Google, with more than 21,000 employees, was trying to present itself as “too big to comply” and that the company should not be able to skirt anti-discrimination laws just because it is large and has a complex compensation model: “Google takes routine requests and makes them sound onerous by emphasizing the number of people involved.” Revealed: Google tried to block media coverage of gender discrimination case Read more Sween asserted that Google has complied with the “overwhelming majority” of the government’s demands, adding, “The agency has little if any regard for the fourth amendment rights of its contractors.” Earlier this month, the tech firm’s lawyers also unsuccessfully argued that the case should be dismissed altogether, claiming that a DoL official may have violated ethics rules by talking to the Guardian about the federal investigation. In that interview in April, regional solicitor Janet Herold said that the initial data suggested that “discrimination against women in Google is quite extreme, even in this industry”. Surveys have repeatedly found that women are often paid less than men for the same jobs across Silicon Valley. An account of sexual harassment at Uber earlier this year has also sparked a widespread debate about misogyny and misconduct in tech. Google is one of three powerful Silicon Valley firms to face DoL lawsuits related to discrimination claims over the last year.

Editorial impact: LinksDossiers – the Sponsor may execute its Editorial impact by suggesting two topics for LinksDossiers per section it sponsors and per year. These are subject to agreement with the editorial team. These LinksDossiers topics are approved if they are relevant to EU policy debates and taking the readers’ viewpoint.

Press releases – the name of a Sponsor will be mentioned in a background note about Sponsors.

[Marco Paköeningrat/Flickr] Languages: Français | Deutsch Comments Print The European Commission on Tuesday (2 May) unveiled a proposal that could significantly expand its powers to request access to sensitive corporate data as a way to enforce EU single market rules or to inform new pieces of legislation. Companies have voiced opposition to the proposal, arguing it would force them to disclose “sensitive” business information to EU authorities upon request. If the proposal goes through, firms which refuse to comply could be fined up to 1% of their turnover from the previous year, on top of a possible fine of up to 5% of daily turnover. The proposed Single Market Information Tool is part of a legislative package designed to improve the functioning of the EU’s single market. In “targeted” cases, when neither national authorities or the companies involved have voluntarily provided the information, the Commission would be able to request the data directly from the firms. Officials explained this would be needed only in a very limited number of cases, around 1% of the total. Asking Google for its algorithm One example is the use of unjustified geo-blocking practices by online services. Some of the information needed to regulate these services should be based “on detailed price and cost data which only service providers possess”, according to EU legislators. MEPs want to lift online geoblocking for Spotify and ebooks MEPs in the Internal Market Committee approved geoblocking rules that could open up access to music streaming sites and ebook sales across the EU, going beyond the European Commission’s proposal and setting up a fight with industry groups. Asked if valuable corporate secrets, like Google’s search algorithm, could also fall under the scope of the new information tool, an official confirmed that it could be the case “but seems highly implausible”. “Asking for Google’s search algorithm could theoretically fall under its scope, but seems highly implausible, an official explained.” The European Commission says it needs deeper inside knowledge of some industries in order to inform new EU laws. If legislation is based on incomplete information, it could potentially “harm” the industries concerned, it argues, saying that even a marginal improvement in the level of detail could have “enormous benefits” for an entire industry. In the case of geo-blocking, 1% of revenues of copyright-intensive industries adds up to more than €9 billion. Three-step approval Limits would be placed on the Commission’s new discretionary powers, along with a three-step approval process. When a company does not reply to a request, or when the response is unsatisfactory, Brussels could insist a second time that if there is no response, if the answer comes late or is unsatisfactory, it could then ask for sanctions. European Commission officials played down the risk of penalties, saying that the executive already has the authority to request information from companies directly in competition cases. The Commission has fined various companies in the past for failing to cooperate or providing misleading information on merger cases. Tetra Laval, a Swiss-Swedish carton packaging company, was fined €90,000 in 2004, and Deutsche BP €35,000 in 2002. No company has been sanctioned since merger rules were strengthened in 2004. However, the executive is investigating Facebook for providing misleading information on its buyout of WhatsApp. Facebook gave misleading information during WhatsApp buyout, Commission says The European Commission could fine Facebook up to €170 million after it accused the social media giant with providing misleading information during its acquisition of WhatsApp. The Commission expanded its powers to request information to state aid cases in 2013, on the back of revelations regarding the ‘sweetheart’ deals EU governments sometimes offer multinationals. But the executive has so far only used its new competences in state aid cases against Starbucks and Fiat. During preliminary discussions in Council working groups, member states asked for a say in the process. As a result, the draft proposal foresees that the executive would notify every request for information from companies. However, governments would have access to the information only if the process ends up in an infringement procedure before the European Court of Justice and only if the information is not confidential. Member states were also concerned that the proposal could be burdensome for the private sector. The European Commission argued that it would not use it indiscriminately. It will be a “very infrequent” tool, an official assured, saying small companies with less than ten employees or a turnover below €10 million will be excluded. The Commission also stressed that the information provided would be treated confidentially, applying the same practices used in competition cases. ‘Serious concerns’ But despite the executive’s guarantees, the private sector remained critical. “We have serious concerns,” said the Director General of BusinessEurope, Markus Beyrer. In a statement, the organisation said that the new information tool could lead to “unacceptable risks regarding highly sensitive business information,” without clear justification or explanation of how the European Commission intends to use it. BusinessEurope and Eurochambres, the umbrella organisation for small and medium-sized enterprises in Europe, agreed that this new instrument would represent an additional burden to companies. Eurochambres described the proposal as “misdirected”, saying member states are to blame for outstanding barriers in the single market, not companies. “The Commission is kidding itself if it thinks that a lack of commercial data is the root cause of single market malfunctions. It is member state administrations that regularly fall short in implementing requirements,” said Arnaldo Abruzzini, CEO of Eurochambres. Commission takes legal action against seven EU countries over VW scandal Seven countries have broken EU law for refusing to sanction Volkswagen after it used illegal software to manipulate its vehicles’ emissions tests. “The recent struggle for the Commission to get reliable data from car manufacturers about their emissions practices are a case in point. This could be a decisive tool to tilt the scale in favour of consumers and the companies who play by the rules,” said Monique Goyens, director general of the European Consumer Organisation (BEUC). Positions Elżbieta Bieńkowska, Commissioner for Internal Market, Industry, Entrepreneurship and SMEs,  said: "The new Single Market Information Tool will further contribute to the Commission's enforcement work, so that citizens' Single Market rights are duly respected and EU businesses face fewer barriers when scaling up and entering new markets." Background As part of the package to improve the functioning of the single market, the European Commission also presented a  proposal for a Single Digital Gateway. This portal will help people and companies to have easier access to information and online administrative procedures and assistance services. Any procedure currently available online for domestic users will be accessible to users from other Member States. A total of 13 key administrative procedures will have to be made available online, including requests for a birth certificate, to register a car, start a business or register for social security benefits.

This time, researchers say they have found a new class of Android exploits altogether, that they call Cloak and Dagger. The reason for the name is that the exploits operate silently in the background, without the user ever knowing about their existence. Discovered by researchers at the at the University of California Santa Barbara and the Georgia Institute of Technology, the Cloak and Dagger attacks user two sets of permissions on Android. The first is the System Alert Window, which is also known as 'draw on top', allowing apps to create overlays or draw on top of other apps and the Android interface. The second is Bind Accessibility Service, known as 'a11y', which allows uses the numerous accessibility services available on Android to help people with sight and other challenges. Using either or both of these permissions, a malicious app could make users fall for clickjacking. This is a concept where a malicious app shows users one interface, which actually masks another interface below. For example, users could be shown an innocuous questionnaire, but below it, app permissions could be being toggled instead without users' knowledge. Unsurprisingly, these two permissions allow all sorts of attacks to exploit users. "These attacks allow a malicious app to completely control the UI feedback loop and take over the device - without giving the user a chance to notice the malicious activity," the description of the Cloak and Dagger attacks reads on a dedicated website. Notably, these attacks even affect all the latest versions of Google's mobile platform, including Android 7.1.2 Nougat, and require merely two permissions. Alarmingly, the System Alert Window or 'draw on top' permission is not required to be explicitly granted by the user when an app is installed via Google Play. To make things worse, as we explained above, if an malicious app with the Draw on Top permission is installed, it could easily scam a user into granting it the Bind Accessibility Service permission. If you are concerned already, wait till you hear the worst part, these vulnerabilities have not been fixed till now. While these researchers first talked to Google around 9 months back and some vulnerabilities were fixed over months with updates, some of them are still present in the latest version of the platform as the tools involved in the exploit are also required by some applications, as pointed out in a report by Android Police. Overlays can always prove to be a security threat and this is why an overlay notification was added with Android Marshmallow as well. However, it was removed with Android Nougat, Android Police nots. The invisible Grid attack, which makes use of these vulnerabilities, can enable keystroke recording that can give away users password and other sensitive data to the hijackers as well. In a statement to Engadget, Google has responded to the Cloak and Dagger attacks, and said, "We've been in close touch with the researchers and, as always, we appreciate their efforts to help keep our users safer. We have updated Google Play Protect -- our security services on all Android devices with Google Play -- to detect and prevent the installation of these apps. Prior to this report, we had already built new security protections into Android O that will further strengthen our protection from these issues, moving forward." However, the researchers say that they were able to get malicious app approved from the store and that it is still available on Google Play. Thus, until Android O comes along, users don't have much they can do to avoid being trapped, beyond regular security practices. Install apps only from trusted sources, don't install random apps, and, keep a close watch on what permissions an app is asking for.

Click to Skip Ad Closing in... Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Apple is working on a ‘Neural Engine’ to improve AI in iOS devices Image Source: Apple Jacob Siegal @JacobSiegal May 26th, 2017 at 5:07 PM Share Tweet Apple is developing a processor dedicated to AI-related tasks, according to a new report from Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. Gurman’s source says that the chip is known internally as the ‘Apple Neural Engine,’ and that it will be used to improve the way that Apple’s myriad devices respond to requests that typically require human intelligence, including facial recognition and speech recognition. Don't Miss: New report reaffirms the iPhone 8’s most exciting new feature The report claims that Apple is in a rush to catch up with its competition at Amazon and Google when it comes to artificial intelligence. Although Siri was the first virtual assistant to reach the mainstream, it has since been surpassed by the like of Alexa and Google Assistant, both of which have become even more ubiquitous with the release of smart speakers like Amazon Echo and Google Home. An AI-enabled processor would help Cupertino, California-based Apple integrate more advanced capabilities into devices, particularly cars that drive themselves and gadgets that run augmented reality, the technology that superimposes graphics and other information onto a person’s view of the world. As it stands, Apple uses the main processor and the graphics chip to run virtually everything on its iOS devices, including AI processes. The Neural Engine would allow Apple to offload those processes onto a discreet module, freeing up the other chips and possibly improving battery life in the process. One source says that Apple will eventually implement the chip into its most popular devices, including the iPhone and iPad. The company has even begun testing new iPhone models with the Neural Engine, but it’s unclear if it will be ready in time for the launch of the iPhone 7s and iPhone 8 this fall. Depending on how far along the project is by next month, there’s a chance Apple will take some time at its annual WWDC conference to discuss it advancements in the AI field. The AI chip would join iOS 11 and and new MacBooks as the featured topics of discussion for the event, which starts on June 5th.

The campaign is named ‘browse against the machine’ and should change the domination of Google’s Chrome browser which currently holds a worldwide market share of about 60%. That is 4x times more than its second competitor, Firefox. Google’s domination of the browser market is making that its “influence on the internet economy and individuals is out of balance”, according to Mozilla’s Eric Petitt. He also argues that it provides Google more control over the web and way people use the web. The campaign ‘browse against the machine’ should change that. In the campaign Mozilla advertises 5 of Firefox’s biggest advantages, hoping it will make people switch from Chrome. The campaign underlines how Firefox uses less memory than Chrome, how Firefox provides users more control over your data and privacy, that Firefox is independent, that the browser isn’t developed by the largest advertising company in the world but instead by a, “non-profit organization whose mission is to preserve a healthy web in part by keeping corporate power in check”. “Some folks might interpret “browse against the machine” as a desperate cry, but it isn’t. Firefox grew in users last year and Mozilla is financially healthier now than it has ever been”, Petitt writes on the Mozilla website. “Mozilla has always put its independence ahead of maximizing profit. It is an imperfect world with Google’s search engine dominance, but we still remain the only independent alternative on the web today”, he concludes.

The G7 calls for communication service providers and social media companies to substantially increase their effort to address terrorist content. “We encourage the industry to act urgently in developing and sharing new technology and tools to improve the automatic detection of content promoting incitement to violence. And we commit to supporting industry efforts in this vein including the proposed industry-led forum for combating online extremism.” Donald Trump and Theresa May at the G7 summit in Sicily (Photo: Getty) The leaders also agreed to work harder to tackle pro-jihadi propaganda with their own pro-Western messages. The statement added: “We will support the promotion of alternative and positive narratives rooted in our common values. We will counter propaganda supporting terrorism.” Speaking afterwards, Mrs May said the commitment was a “significant” step forward. The PM said: “We will put our full weight behind the creation of this industry-led forum which will develop the technology and techniques that will be used to take material down. “I am very clear that we want this to be done more urgently and more rapidly than it is at the moment. It’s important that companies recognise their social responsibility. We need to work together to fight the evil of terrorism and no one can be in any doubt about what happened in Manchester of just how evil those terrorists are.” Theresa May has led the charge against online terror (Photo: Getty) Mrs May also revealed British jihadis fighting with Islamic State could be intercepted, arrested and jailed by security services in countries like Turkey as they try to return home. The PM urged fellow leaders to pool intelligence on homegrown jihadis with authorities in “third countries” they pass through while making their way back. Read More Jeremy Corbyn talks terror, Boris Johnson's 'monstrous' gaffe and manifesto maths: 5 things we learned on the election trail today The return of IS’s “foreign fighters” is one of the key threats faced by Western nations. It is feared the trickle of returning battle-hardened terrorists could soon become a flood as the terror group continues to lose ground in Iraq and Syria. Addressing leaders at a G7 session on counter-terrorism today, Mrs May said: “More of these fighters may try to return to their original country and pose a threat there. The G7 needs to share our expertise with countries foreign fighters travel through or fight in. We want to ensure those countries have the legal means to appropriately prosecute, extradite or deport.” British officials highlighted the case of London-born jihadi Aine Davis, arrested in Istanbul in 2015 after Turkish security tracked him on his way back from Syria. He was found guilty of being a senior member of a terrorist organisation and jailed for seven-and-a-half years. Mrs May told President Trump, President Macron and other leaders the case showed why intelligence on homegrown jihadis must be shared. The fight against ISIS has moved to the internet She said: “We need to securely share data on our foreign fighters, such as names and nationalities, so they can be spotted by different countries as they cross borders, and decisions made on whether they should be arrested.

When our allies find evidence, such as video or papers, of illegal activity involving foreign fighters, for example a Brit in a conflict zone, they should pass that to our authorities.” Twitter declined to comment directly but said during the reporting period of July 1, 2016 to December 31, 2016, a total of 376,890 accounts were suspended for violations related to the promotion of terrorism. The firm added: “We plan to share updates on our efforts to combat violent extremism by including them in this new section of our transparency report.” Video Loading Video Unavailable Click to play Tap to play The video will start in 8Cancel Play now Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Politics Newsletter Follow @MirrorPolitics Subscribe to our Politics newsletterEnter emailSubscribe More On Google G7 summit Theresa May Donald Trump Middle East Syria Syria conflict Terrorism News all Most Read Most Recent Michael FallonTory Michael Fallon slates 'Jeremy Corbyn quote' live on air - then realises they were Boris Johnson's words The Defence Secretary was left dumbfounded when presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy said to him: "Those are actually the words of Boris Johnson" Manchester Arena explosionManchester Arena bomber Salman Abedi 'was banned from mosque after accusing Imam of "talking b*****ks" in anti-ISIS sermon' British-born Abedi walked into the arena and detonated an IED on Monday night, killing 22 people, including children as young as eight RacismPortland train killings: Man 'shouted racist slurs at Muslim women' before cutting throats of passengers who tried to help He told terrified women to "get off the bus" because he "doesn't like Muslims" before triple stabbing rampage where he knifed people at random on packed commuter train CarsTwo children found dead 'after taking off and locking themselves in car in 35 degree heat' The 16-month-old boy and two-year-old girl were found "unresponsive" in the vehicle, police in Texas said Child neglectMum who left young children alone in house for TWO WEEKS breaks down in tears as she is jailed The mother returned to her home country to visit her own mum, leaving her kids - one as young as three-years-old - with NO adult supervision and NO hot water at the home in Liverpool Terrorism'I will make you proud mum': Daughter of Manchester terror attack victim posts heartbreaking tribute Lisa Lees, 47, died alongside friend Alison Howe, 45, as they waited to collect their teen daughters from the Arena RacismPortland train killings: Man 'shouted racist slurs at Muslim women' before cutting throats of passengers who tried to help He told terrified women to "get off the bus" because he "doesn't like Muslims" before triple stabbing rampage where he knifed people at random on packed commuter train Donald TrumpDonald Trump's son-in-law 'investigated over secret contacts with Russians' Jared Kushner - one of Trump's closest advisers - wanted a private back channel with Russia's ambassador, it is claimed Manchester Arena explosionPolice investigating Manchester bomb blast their way into home with 'controlled explosion' and make two more arrests Locals in Cheetham Hill, Manchester, were left terrified by a "massive bang" as terror cops swooped on the address Manchester Arena explosionManchester bomber 'used student loan and benefits to fund terror plot' Salman Abedi enrolled on a course at Salford University and was given at least £7,000 in taxpayer-funded loans Most Read Most Recent Michael FallonTory Michael Fallon slates 'Jeremy Corbyn quote' live on air - then realises they were Boris Johnson's words The Defence Secretary was left dumbfounded when presenter Krishnan Guru-Murthy said to him: "Those are actually the words of Boris Johnson" Ariana Grande'The victims will be in my heart for the rest of my life': Ariana Grande issues statement on Manchester terror attack 22 people were killed and more than 100 injured in suicide bomb attack in Manchester Liverpool FCLiverpool ready to break their club transfer record to land £50m-rated RB Leipzig midfielder Naby Keita The Reds are gearing up for the largest summer spending spree in their history ahead of their Champions League return Liverpool transfer newsLiverpool transfer news and rumours: Pierre-Emerick Aubameyang puts Jurgen Klopp on red alert as he eyes Dortmund exit PLUS: Liverpool are ready to smash their transfer record on midfield target Manchester Arena explosionManchester Arena bomber Salman Abedi 'was banned from mosque after accusing Imam of "talking b*****ks" in anti-ISIS sermon' British-born Abedi walked into the arena and detonated an IED on Monday night, killing 22 people, including children as young as eight EmmerdaleEmmerdale spoilers: Carly torn as she must choose between Marlon and Matt Three is most definitely a crowd, as Matt's romantic confession triggers trouble for Carly and Marlon...

Resold Pixel phones originally purchased from Project Fi are having their IMEIs blacklisted Richard Gao Follow View All Posts 2017/05/25 5:30am PDTMay 25, 2017 57 Plus 1 on G+ 141 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares256 Google News Pixel Pixel XL Project Fi Back in November, when the Pixel was slowly beginning to ship to customers, there were numerous reports of people getting their Google accounts banned for purchasing Pixel and Pixel XL devices with the intent to resell them. It turns out that this issue hasn't exactly been laid to rest, as it seems that Pixel phones purchased from Project Fi for this purpose are now getting blacklisted via their IMEI numbers. As an overview, people originally bought Pixels from both the Google Store and Project Fi to sell them to a New Hampshire-based reseller. Why New Hampshire, you may ask? There's no sales tax. Both parties here were supposed to make a profit, but Google ended up banning a ton of accounts for a violation of their terms of service.. Considering how important Google is in our lives (Gmail, Google Photos, YouTube, Play Store, etc.), a lot of people were obviously not happy. In the end, Google did restore many of these accounts, but it was obviously enough for a good scare. However, it seems that Google still hasn't completely forgiven people for violating their ToS. Kyle Bennett, the editor-in-chief and founder of the HardOCP website, had his Pixel XL's IMEI blacklisted just yesterday. IMEIs are typically blacklisted by carriers when phones are lost or stolen, but that's clearly not what happened here. Calling T-Mobile didn't do anything, as their staff told him that they could not reverse the blacklisting. His communication with Swappa support was more interesting, though; here's what they told him: "Sorry to hear of the complaints. We have seen a great number of Pixel devices becoming blacklisted the past two days. We are still trying to figure out why this has happened to so many devices. We are working to find out the cause of this widespread issue. It would be best for both of you to keep on top of Google and pressing them for an explanation. In one other case, I saw this morning Google agreed to send the buyer a replacement device so that might be an option to look into. Seller please work with the buyer and Google to see if they can get to the bottom of it." Kyle then contacted Google support, with the first representative claiming that he had simply received a spam message. When he showed a second rep how his IMEI had indeed been blacklisted via Swappa's ESN/IMEI checker (useful tool if you're buying a phone, by the way), he was told that his Pixel XL hadn't been reported as stolen, but that it had been originally purchased through Project Fi. Kyle was also once again told that his phone hadn't really been blacklisted, but a quick rescan of his IMEI in Swappa proved otherwise. His case was escalated to Project Fi's support team, but the customer service rep refused to give him a reference number and told him that he'd receive it via email. After contacting a third representative, Kyle was informed that his phone had indeed been blacklisted, but that Google wasn't responsible for doing so. This lends further credence to the Project Fi explanation, as it's the carrier and not the manufacturer that has the ability to blacklist devices. The situation is still ongoing, but that's all we know for now; we'll update with more information as we get it.

Okay. NeverrKnowsBest You can sell a Project Fi phone. You just buy them in bulk and try to make a profit off Project Fi. Stupid that the customer is being punished for this, though. Green Dog Is it clear that this is one of the phones that was bought in bulk from that retailer? From my reading, it was just a resold phone. I mean obviously, it's not happening to all phones, but the fact that it's still happening is a concern. NeverrKnowsBest The IMEIs are being linked to one particular reseller in New Hampshire. celestre Do you have more information than is present in the article on this? NeverrKnowsBest I'm just going off what the article said. I would love to read more, but I highly doubt they are just flipping the switch on every resold Project Fi phone. That just isn't very plausible, at least to my knowledge. datkidpatrick you misunderstood the article... they referenced a time where a bulk reseller's phones were black listed... but now it is happening to a bunch of random sellers that decided to sell the phone... Richard Gao The bulk reseller's phones weren't blacklisted at that time. It is entirely possible that these are the same phones. datkidpatrick i purchased mine straight from project fi... sold it 3 months ago and the seller told me the other day it was blacklisted... and yes my mistake.. the bulk resellers email's were blocked or something like that... Cael Did you pay off the phone before you sold it? datkidpatrick yes i did... Corey Kinard So they're punishing someone that fully paid for a device from you, who fully owned the device? They're legally allowed to just fully break something they've already sold and have no right to? This is worse than when carriers wouldn't unlock phones... datkidpatrick im still giving google the benefit of doubt that it was a mistake... they just need to fix it PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ You'll easily win in small claims court if you have to refund and take the phone back. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ What kind of financing plan did you have? They were first sold in Oct. 22 2016 and this is only May 2017. I seem to remember 24 month financing or 12 month financing. You paid your phone off three months ago and already had sold it on Swappa for some time? datkidpatrick ya youre allowed to pay it off early... PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Maybe that's what caused the error at Fi in blacklisting by accident. datkidpatrick ya that doesn't make any sense... but it got fixed this morning by google... NeverrKnowsBest I see that now. Thanks for the clarification. In any case, there has to be something in common with these blacklisted phones, I don't think Google/Project Fi would blacklist all second hand phones, I don't think that's very plausible. Corey Kinard Do you really need to think straight when you are in competition for largest company in the world? They probably got algorithms looking for shit and those algorithms mess up. 4Ui812 That's pretty shitty Google. David Bowline Is it really? What's shitty is the people buying in bulk just to make an easy buck and therefore screwing people over. Swappa needs to go after these people. jonzey231 Yeah but if I bought a Pixel LAST YEAR and wanted to sell it no in preparation for the next Pixel or the OP5, for example, my customer may get screwed even though it was just an innocent buy and resell. Max Uh? That's not what happened here... so far this situation seems to be the result of a reseller elaborate plan to evade tax and sell the scarce phone for a bigger profit. This wasn't an individual reselling his/her own phone. jonzey231 Uh? I know that it was originally caused by the douche bags in NJ, but now it's affecting regular people. 4Ui812 That's called capitalism. No one is forcing you to buy it. What Google needs to do is fix all the reported issues with that shitty phone. As for the limited supply of said phone , again that's Google's fault (hell , I wouldn't be surprised if Google intentionally limted the supply ... That's a play out of nintys handbook) Duder12 I have a pixel. There is nothing wrong with my phone. I love it. SirCanealot But I have a Pixel and it is broken. Surely this is not possible to exist in reality? :O :O :O A Person It may suck, but who is to decide how my money is spent? kbbl Caveat emptor. SeanPR11 Or.... don't buy your phone from a New Jersey Douchebag. If people don't buy from them, they will stop doing this bullshit. It sucks that regular people are caught in the middle (which happens all too often). It seems Swappa should have known these phones were out there (given the business they are in) and flagged them with the IMEI checker. Alex Excuse them for doing whatever they like with a product they purchased. Pfff SeanPR11 Amen. Ryan from GroupTweet Yes, its shitty. If anything Google should go after the reseller, not the innocent legitimate customers that bought the devices and who are now punished because their phones are blacklisted. Alexander Z Great Swappa can't GO after anyone. Maybe suspend/revoke their account but that's it. My trusted seller hasn't been any help at all with the blacklisted pixel I bought. It's so messed up!! T4rd Saw the site/forum owner of a site I frequent get hit with this on his Pixel this week too. Crazy how the Pixel is being plagued with all sorts of extraneous issues. They can't stay in stock, forcing people to buy second hand, then they get black listed because of some weird policy Google has with Project Fi phones. Max Well being out of stock has nothing strange coming from a Google phone, that's been their main issue for a few years now (Nexus), and it happens even to Apple on launch but the difference is that they're a lot better ramping up production afterwards. This blacklisting is really weird, but so far it seems to be potentially related to a shady reseller so we'll have to wait and see if we get more clarification soon. Geoff Johnson As someone from New Hampshire, it's weird to see my state in an AP article, since nothing interesting ever happens here lol. This sucks though because buyers who bought their Pixel 2nd hand months ago now suddenly might get it blacklisted? J.J. Holy f. That is terrible. So random guy buys a second hand pixel (because Google was out of stock) later gets blacklisted by Google/fi. Gets no help from Google. Never buys a Google phone again. Real smart. Green Dog This on top of the seeming shaky quality of the phones may force me to an iPhone. J.J. I feel ya there but, i just can't do the iPhone thing. Loving this s8+ right now. Duder12 When consumers say this its just sad. Why when you have a difficult time with one android manufacturer immediately think its all Androids and switch to the iPhone? This is how Apple gets tons of customers. Everyone that had a bad time with Samsung just assumed their only other option was iPhone bc MARKETING. Green Dog Because I don't want to have to deal with OS updates through the carrier or a limited phone in terms of LTE bands, as is common for Android phones? People like other phones and I've played with some of them, but I like the Pixel/Nexus lines. But this does give me pause. blenderboy Well, the only offering that competes with iPhone in the world of android is the pixel phone. Samsung displays(hardware in general) are great but software experience can't be compared with iPhone or pixel. It is just sad that they can't keep up with Apple or Google. Google is trying really hard to reach there. I am still using Android because of the platforms openness. Duder12 Fair enough but you know what I mean. You are an exception but A LOT of consumers act this way. Honestly I bought my Pixel through the Google Store last fall and its been solid. I love it. Google needs to sort out the second hand market but these are growing pains. Hardware is still new to them bc the nexus line had help from the OEMs. Now they dont. marcusmarcus2 His comment does not address all Androids. He is only speaking of this one phone. It could be he was between using phones by Google and iPhones and he choose to go with Google's phone. Now with this situation, he decided to go to his second choice. I'm not defending switching to an iPhone over another manufacturer, just pointing out his statement you criticized did not say what you thought it was saying and you were the one to actually apply his statement to all Androids. Just playing the devil's advocate here Alex Because when you pay 7-8-900€ (the price of an iPhone) on an Android phone you expect it to be flawless. And that's normal! However, in real life, regardless if you pay 300 or 800€, Android remains Android, with its notoriously inconsistent battery life, inexplicable wakelocks, unfixed bugs (don't get me stored on the "low priority" bugs with thousands of stars), 2 year updates, etc, etc. tekfr33kn That seems a little dramatic considering that iPhones are far from flawless. You also pay that amount for your average laptop and they aren't flawless. It seems you, or someone else, is holding Android phones to an unrealistic standard. Alex Please don't compare a laptop with an Android phone. It makes absolutely no sense. Isn't it rather that manufacturers (Google being the first of them) increase the prices each year to hallucinating levels with little to no innovation or improvement in user experience. Take the S8 line. Beautiful phones, remarkable design, but a fraction of the cost you pay goes to that crap Bixby that nobody wants tekfr33kn I'll agree with you that Google is artificially raising the price far beyond what it should be but that's basic capitalism and market forces. If the market doesn't want those kinds of prices or can't support it, it won't sell. The issue is that people are actually willing to pay that. iPhones are the primary example. There's about $400 - $500 worth of stuff put in a phone that goes for $800 - $1000 and they still sell like hotcakes. I also agree with you about the S8's and Bixby but again, the market says that the S8 is a hot seller and so Samsung isn't about to change that trend. That kind of makes your argument moot. As for comparing a smartphone to a laptop - if you can't see the comparisons, it's either willful ignorance or you just don't know a thing about electronic devices (specifically smartphones or laptops). In either case, I can't help you with that. The fact is that they share more in common that differences. It's one of the many reasons that development strategies (hardware and software) often translate quite well between them. xyz Uhm, because the phone in question is the overpriced Google phone that is intended to compete with the iPhone and which Google fanboys insist is the greatest Android phone of all time. psychic99 It costs about the same to make a Pixel XL as it does an iphone 7, so why would you expect Google to make less margin than Apple? I will say their ecosystem and support SUCKs compared to Apple, so yeah it should be hundred less because the lifecycle experience of a Pixel will be much worse than Apple and the fact that they artificially end support after 2 years is atrocious. I have 4+ year old Nexus that operate just fine on custom ROMs. And BTW I don't think it is worth it either and happily keep my Nexus 6p for less than 50% the cost. I can't rationalize the price they are asking. Google's support is not consistent. Either they will go over the top to help, or tell you go away you are screwed, There is nothing in the middle, and until you engage them you have no idea if you are going to get help or the hand. Yet another reason they should be hundreds less. Merrill Sampson Just FYI, Google announced at IO a few days ago that they're extending the support cycle on the Pixel from 2 year to 5. marcusmarcus2 Do you have a source for that? https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705?hl=en#nexus_devices Android Version updates: October 2018 Security updates: October 2019 Duder12 Dont forget that apple blocked iPhones that had their fingerprint sensor replaced. Also, dont forget Apple is trying to get a bill banned that will allow consumers to have 3rd parties fix phones. PS: My Pixel is fucking awesome. NexusKoolaid "Dont forget that apple blocked iPhones that had their fingerprint sensor replaced." And this in and of itself was a good thing. With the sensor and the CPU being paired, the sudden appearance of a new sensor having a new signature was deemed to be a security breach. I'm not standing up for Apple here, just calling a spade a spade. And I don't know what information Apple could have shared with 3rd party repair houses (if they were inclined to play nice with them) without compromising security. "PS: My Pixel is fucking awesome." I wish I had one. But they were so hard to get hold of for so long that at this point I'll hang on to my 6P until the Pixel2 is out. psychic99 On Android if you reinstall the O/S or make major modifications they simply invalidate the fingerprint then you have to enter the password manually as a failback. Then you can enrol your fingerprint again. In fact every few days you have to manually enter your pin on N to get into the phone. Sounds like a reasonable method, rather than locking the phone forever. Apple went one step farther. You should go watch youtube... Apple is on a mission to make 3rd party repair a thing of the past. They even specifically make it hard to repair. They want control of the supply chain and dispose of equipment as fast as possible. NexusKoolaid On your first point, there is little control over hardware used to support the platform, so core design decisions are prone to fall back to a software solution. Apple on the other hand has tight control of their hardware and have the option for hardware based solutions, whatever the motivation might be, such as better security or to maintain control of their platform (probably a mix on the two). On your second point, I've read the headlines and seen videos on Youtube (like Louis Rossman). Yeah - their crusade against 3rd party repair sickens me to no small degree. Not just because it would prevent me from seeking out more economical and timely repair of my phone (if I had an iPhone), but because this type of precedent could trickle down to other things I might want to tinker with. Jay Hate to say it but that is the risk people run when you don't buy your devices brand new. J.J. True. But they exasperate said risk artificially for the perceived end goal.... More Profit. The truth is they are doing the exact opposite. This news definitely makes me pause on buying a pixel at all. The Second hand market is real and if i have a bad experience do to Google on a second hand device i will probably not buy new from them when i have the funds. james fuston If you (or the person who sells you a phone) violates the terms of service, you're gonna have a bad time regardless of manufacturer. blenderboy Real question to ask, did Apple ever had similar issue with many devices? hunter2 Probably not since Apple realizes that the perceived strong resale value is a determining factor for many people. Even people who may have never sold a product second hand gain some comfort from the knowledge that they could potentially recoup a lot of their costs if they ever needed to sell. ericshmerick Do the TOS say you can never ever resell the device? Serious question. ekana_stone No the TOS is that you resell as soon as you bought it, so like if you bought from fi cuz it's cheaper and the resold it a little under asking. It's only those phones that were black listed ericshmerick What defines "as soon as?" 5 minutes after purchase? 1 week? 2.8 months? 3 years? marcusmarcus2 Do we have confirmation that it is only those phones that were black listed? Could they have inadvertently black listed other phones from fi? EarlyMon The TOS say that commercial resale is not allowed and lots of them were resold by a private company in a scheme that tried to avoid sales tax. Santos Chavez It actually does say that isn't allowed, hence why they initially banned several accounts the first time. It was a breach of their TOS, and it still is. It's likely Project Fi saw these phones as stolen and blacklisted them. james fuston "You may only purchase Devices for your personal use. You may not commercially resell any Device, but you may give the Device as a gift." So if you purchase the device and resell it in New (unopened) condition, yeah. Fi could also pretty easily make the case that if you purchased the phone and turned around to sell it before the expiry of the original installment plan that you had purchased it with the intention of reselling. MisterAlex That's still not a commercial sale. If I go to the store, buy a Nintendo Switch, and immediately list it as a brand new Switch on Craigslist, I'm not a commercial seller. I'm still an individual selling something that's fully within my "first sale" rights to sell. james fuston Yeah, that's true if you're reading the second, and only the second, sentence there. The first one pretty clearly states "You may only purchase Devices for your personal use" MisterAlex If you think that reselling a personally owned item goes beyond the bounds of personal use, you're kidding yourself (and so is anyone who thinks that line of thinking would hold water, legally speaking). First Sale is a very broad consumer protection, my friend. Once you buy something of your own, you can do whatever you want with it, including sell it. (Edit: in the States, anyway.) james fuston Yep! Totally fine for you to sell it. Also totally fine for Google to deactivate your phone when you've done something you agreed not to do at the time of purchase. It's then legally on you to prove that they overstepped. MisterAlex You're clearly not parsing what I'm posting. Selling privately owned property is within the bounds of "personal use." james fuston Seeing as Google specifically included a clause about gifting, I'd venture to say they disagree with you. MisterAlex That's fine. Sony also disagreed that it had done anything wrong by removing Other OS. james fuston Cool! So we agree that whether or not you believe Google's terms of service to be legal, it's entirely on the customer to take action after being penalized for a violation of said terms of service. MisterAlex It's always up to the wronged party to seek litigation against a wrongdoer. james fuston In that case, I have no idea why you started commenting on legality when I was discussing terms of service violations. Rather, I would have no idea why if this weren't the comment section. MisterAlex A TOS is not a legally binding agreement. You defended enforcement of a TOS when that enforcement went contrary to law. That's why I brought up the comparison to Sony's PS3 lawsuit (which it lost). james fuston I'm not discussing whether terms of service are legally binding. I'm discussing whether or not the action being described (selling the phone) violates the ToS. It does. MisterAlex And my counter was to point out that putting something in a TOS doesn't make it hunky-dory. In fact, it's quite possible for a TOS to violate law. As I've illustrated. bekifft This is where America is so great. Even if the TOS is unenforceable by law, it is technologically enforceable, obviously. So they do it anyway, and now the onus is on you the little guy to get the multinational corporation to knock it off. Vape John most likely carrier issues the blacklisting... so project fi is the culprit psychic99 More profit? The sell them $150 below market rates. That is not free. I don't know what is actually going on but I would suspect that the original owner did something wrong or unethical. To be honest Google's systems are weird. I ported out my nexus5x and it took them almost 3 months to Bill me for the remainder. So maybe the original person cancelled their card, played games with DPP, activated it for one day and did it again. And again. xyz Fortunately, you can just buy an iPhone and get top notch support. hunter2 So the answer is to buy everything new and toss the old device in the landfill? Kind of sad to see how people just roll over and let over-reaching companies basically decimate the second hand market so they can increase their profits. Jay Never said that and you know it. I said this is the risk you take.. It's as simple as that. trixnkix637 That's the risk you take for not buying from reputable sources. Buying used has risks. Sucks he found out the hard way. jb0nez But the article says it's not Google, it's the carrier who blacklisted. Whatever that means... hunter2 That makes no sense. The carrier technically blocks that IMEI on their network, but only after another carrier submits it to the blacklist. It would be like if you SWATTED somebody and then said "it was the police who came to your house with guns not me". pfmiller On top of that this seems like an abuse of the blacklisting system. The system is intended to discourage theft, not as a means for companies to get revenge on their customers. psychic99 That's not true. Companies have been blacklisting devices for years if tos wasn't met. I have bought 3 phones through fi and they are heavily discounted. Google doesn't do that for free they expect you to activate them on fi for more than one day. Also if you are buying a phone from an individual and not a dealer you are taking a risk straight up. I have had friend have their phones blacklisted when they have bought phones from people and then they turned around and reported them as stolen. Swappa is a marketplace not a arbitrator. They are facilitating a sale. You guys need to know the difference. PayPal is your friend. hunter2 That's dumb. The whole point of cancellation fees is to re-coup the cost of subsidies if you break the contract. By going a different route, the only people who are getting punished are the people buying these phones. psychic99 Lots of people don't pay them and I have seen numerous accounts where friends have bought phones and have told me they got a "deal of a lifetime" to find their devices blacklisted and guess what they were people who never paid off their termination fees or have sold them then reported them stolen. And as an individual you need to take responsibility, if you purchase anything through a private transaction you should ask for poof of sale, do they own it, have it put in writing, etc. That way if the seller does something illegal then you have a remedy. This doesn't derisk anything tho. This is good education for people, to know where responsibility lies and the risks of buying from an individual versus an established dealer. In the case of Swappa, you should buy via Paypal, so there is a remedy. You can chargeback your loss if this happens within 6 months (I have done this will unethical sellers), so they are not being punished they are being inconvenienced. But that is the RISK you take buying from an individual. hunter2 I know you want to see Google as the good guy here, but within these comments there are accounts from people who bought outright, and months later sold their Pixel's and now months after that sale are being contacted by the seller about the device being blacklisted. bekifft I think you're missing his point. It's not about Google being the good or bad guy, it's that buying something third party is inherently risky and he's right, you should ask for a chain of evidence that proves the device is legit. Maybe I'm also just tired of people claiming they can find things so cheap online, when most of it is scams like this, and just devalues the whole market. hunter2 You need to look through these comments. There are people here who bought their phones directly from Fi and after switching carriers their fully paid off phones have been blacklisted. They were the original owners and these phones were never sold. There are also people here who bought phones, used them for months, and sold them after they were fully paid off. These people are saying that the proper they sold the phones to are now coming back and telling them they're blacklisted. bekifft In that case that is indeed disturbing. I am a Fi subscriber though I bought my phone direct from the Google store. Sounds like someone made a big mistake on the back end. Lance Biddle I bought my phone from Project Fi, and it has become blacklisted after changing to another carrier. Google is definitely the bad guy right now IMO pfmiller Just because other companies have been doing it, doesn't mean that it's not an abuse of the system. It's clearly not what the blacklisting system was intended for. Lance Biddle How about when you buy the phone from Project Fi, decide to switch carriers and the phone you outright own becomes black listed. I cannot connect to the Verizon service I'm paying for. And Verizon cannot do anything about. And Google/Project Fi isn't. I've wasted way too much time on the phone trying to get this resolved. They have told me it could be 2-5+ days to get it fixed. WTF!! Never Google again. Never. J.J. I'm sorry. That sucks hard. ProductFRED Considering the original seller probably isn't going to pay people back, all Google did was fuck over a bunch of legitimate customers. iPhone reselling is also a big issue, especially on new releases, but you don't see Apple doing this. J.J. Agree 💯. Most of these customers involved (who probably have had hardware and software issues already on top​ of this) will never buy a pixel again! Cassidy James Blaede Just for the record, the majority of Pixel users likely never have hardware or software issues. I, my mom, and a couple of my friends have Pixels and haven't had any issues. You probably hear about issues on Reddit a lot because the only reason to visit the Pixel subreddit is to complain. 🙃 Jordan L no issues here too. J.J. Not a redditer lol, but many other sites show the issues(as low as they may be) and if you were on the fence about spending that kind of money, these stories alone may sway many Duder12 Yep. Just like iphone touch disease and early shutdowns. Tr3ple Never had those issues. xyz That's true. I personally don't know anyone who has been murdered. Therefore, no one gets murdered. Cassidy James Blaede I'd wager that the majority of people don't get murdered. 😉 Written Description My Pixel XL has performed flawlessly since its purchase and it's my first Android phone after using every iPhone from the first generation on. Google's AI is better, its cloud storage is infinitely better, and I don't see going back to Apple anytime soon. J.J. I'm glad you have not had issues.... Others however have Duder12 Not me. Corey Kinard 3rd Np. Duder12 Mines been great... atl3630 great here too. Cael Apple is not a "carrier". ProductFRED Neither is Google. They just use other carriers' networks. Either way, that isn't justification for what they're doing. Unless they plan on replacing everyone's Pixel (which looks like a hard no), they fucked over a lot of legitimate customers. I buy my devices off of swappa most of the time. Tell me how I would get this fixed if neither the seller nor Google want to take responsibility. marcusmarcus2 Google is an MVNO. Per https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-mvno-cell-phone-carrier-578673 "An MVNO is a cell phone carrier (such as a prepaid wireless carrier) that typically does not have its own network infrastructure and licensed radio spectrum" Apple is not even an MVNO carrier. drksilenc fi is a carrier... JD With Fi Google is a Carrier. Mitch Gray This just happened to my fiance's phone. I bought it on swappa for her birthday months ago because Google store didn't have any in stock and this morning it is blacklisted. I'm so furious. I have had every Google phone since the Galaxy Nexus and because of this policy I will never buy another phone of theirs. She is now stranded without a phone and has no way of using it for work at the busiest time of the year for her (she is a teacher and it's graduation week). Who do I contact about this? We shouldn't be punished because someone gamed the system. J.J. I feel so bad for you. I hope you get it resolved. This is an atrocity! J.J. Should definitely hassle fi/Google and let them know if they don't resolve you will never buy and tell everyone you know not to buy and so on jibust No, stop don't tell them that, they might not withstand the shock of loosing them. /S T4rd I would contact the seller of the phone and/or Swappa if they're the service you went through. If they're no help somehow, then contact Paypal if that's how you paid for it. Google isn't going to unblacklist the phone regardless of what you say to them. It's virtually impossible for a phone to be unblacklisted once it has happened, so you're going to have to just get a refund and buy another phone. A Person Good luck with that. I am hesitant to ever buy again from Swappa.. and I used to love, love, love them. I purchased a device that was blatantly not as described. I then contacted Swappa and they instructed me that it is now between me and the seller. So I contacted the seller via the sale page and was basically told: "ummmm, nah". datkidpatrick at that point you could have went thru paypal and filed a claim... T4rd That's why you buy from reputable sellers. The few minor issues I've had on there were resolved quickly. atl3630 yes, same here. To date I've never had a swappa problem that didn't get resolved and the people have been very helpful. Don't blame swappa for shitty sellers. Buy from reputable sellers (like me). yankeesusa Swappa only helps communicating. To resolve any issues you must file a PayPal claim. datkidpatrick contact the seller and see if they can contact project fi/google... King_Android Ijs, BBB is an extremely powerful tool in order to get your voice heard from Corporate asap...... Stephen Hicks If the phone is under warranty still, file an RMA claim and state the bluetooth isn't working correctly on the device and that you've already tried factory resetting the phone as well as reconnected all the bluetooth devices with no improvement. Might work? njn There is no warranty for second hand phones. JRock I purchased a bootlooping 6P off eBay for cheap, erasing/flashing firmware had same result, RMA'd to Huawei and they promptly sent me a brand new one. Mark Depending on the credit card you used to buy the phone, you might have an extended warranty that might cover this. atl3630 You can get your money back. Contact the seller through swappa and tell them the issue. They will likely tell you it's been to long, I don't care, etc. If so, then file a PayPal claim. You have six months PayPal protection. Document that the phone no longer works and send it back to the seller with tracking. Then PayPal will refund you money, no matter what the seller says. M3D1T8R But doing this will just end up screwing over the seller. PayPal will simply take the money from their account and refund it to the buyer. So that's not fair to the seller either. PayPal's "seller protection" is a fraud. And their customer service is a total joke. They should be boycotted. atl3630 How does that screw over the seller? The seller screwed himself when he sold the phone. His beef is with ProjectFi, not the buyer. Frankly the buyer shouldn't have to deal with this crap since buyers have no way to determine the history of a phone. The seller sold a phone that stopped working. That's on them. M3D1T8R Because, obviously, the seller doesn't necessarily know the history and every previous owner of every phone. What if it's a phone someone bought previously used. They used it for a while just fine, and resold it. Then this IMEI block thing happened. atl3630 Yeah, that would suck. But still, it's not the buyer's fault. If something happens and somebody gets cheated out of $500+ then you better bet people are going to exercise whatever option they can to recover their money. PayPal protection would do that for them in the first 6 months. ericshmerick So anyone who sells a phone is on the hook for its functionality until the end of time? GTFO of here with that. It's ridiculous and you know it. atl3630 Six months, moron. PayPal protection is 6 months. Like it or not, facts. Stop being a little bitch. Roh_Mish What if the seller had bought directly from google. AP mentioned about the trains but there doesn't appear to to be a link between this and that fraud. Also there are many cases where buyer on PayPal will request a reverse and never return the product, screwing over the seller. And PayPal won't do anything about this. vn33 That really sucks .. .especially to someone near and dear to you. I would be beyond furious! Hope everything works out!! Duder12 Swappa will cover you here. You are fine. Get the ball rolling. Anwar Imraan Lucas To me it seems that the original buyer had reported his credit card lost or stolen and is disputing charges on his card which in terms maybe blacklisting those devices as stolen.. blindexecutioner You do Google the service of endless beta testing their software on a way overpriced phone and they blacklist you. Nice. Lawrence Good, that is what you get for buying the Bezel XL ericshmerick OH YOUUUU!!1 theadamsegal Yet another reason I will not buy a Google device again. Tiberian For the record: Kyle Bennett is the owner and founder of HardOCP, not just a simple writer for the site. ;) Richard Gao Did not know that. Thanks! datkidpatrick this happened by to me as well... i sold my pixel 3 months ago and the buyer just informed me it was blacklisted... i had no clue project fi was doing this and legit thought the buyer was trying to scam me... i contacted project fi support and was advised it was escalated to be removed from the blacklist... i paid off the phone before i sold it... this is definitely a mistake by google/project fi... they should be correcting this soon... Jordan L Can a carrier just randomly blacklist IMEIs?! I guess so. I was reading this thread thinking 'well, people probably just bought a stolen Pixel unknowingly' but your case proves this wrong. Navneet Suresh Shitty move Google ! :/ Jay If this happened to me, I'd just return the phone to the seller, get refunded, and make them have to deal with this. Swappa made a huge fucking deal about refunding buyers after the Note7 debacle and it should be the same thing here. freshprince_87 I hope that Kyle guy reads your comment. This may help him Jay Honestly, Swappa needs to be pushing this harder. I sold my Note7 last year and despite the fact that the buyer could have gone and gotten the refund from T-Mobile themselves, they chose to take Swappa up on their suggestion of getting the refund from me. (Add to this that Swappa said if I didn't agree to the refund, they'd "suggest" the buyer take the issue up with PayPal as the device was not sold as advertised. Seriously..) datkidpatrick it isn't the sellers fault... and its something that can be fixed... Jay I fail to see how this isn't the seller's fault for trying to game the system and make a profit. This sure as hell isn't Google's fault.. so who do you want to blame then? The unsuspecting buyers? datkidpatrick it is googles fault... the point they referred to in november is completely separate from the issue happening now... the issue happening now is many pixel phones that were sold and originated from fi is getting blacklisted... i sold my pixel after paying it of legit and it just got blacklisted... now please tell me how i tried to game the system... Jay For all I know, you could be one of those shady scalpers too who tried to make a profit by gaming the system. The burden of fixing this issue should still lie on the sellers. If someone wants their money back, they have every right to make you do the legwork of figuring out how you'll make your money back. datkidpatrick I contacted project fi for the buyer and it is escalated... again the point is it wasn't my fault... marcusmarcus2 If you are just trying to sell 1 phone that you got and paid for without trying to "game the system" it is not your fault, but it is your responsibility as the seller to try and resolve the issue, which it sounds like you are doing. Who's fault is it? Hard to tell until Google releases a comment about why this is happening. Did they block these by mistake? Then it is Googles fault. Are they doing it to block the bulk buyers that were "gaming the system" and just went over board and blocked some extra phones that were not part of those that gamed the system? Then it would be the fault of Google and those that gamed the system that caused Google to make the choice. hunter2 I wouldn't say it's his responsibility. He's selling a device. If the maker of that device decides to flip a kill switch in 18 months and disable every device out there then why blame him. Google is flipping a kill switch an all kinds of devices (just below there is a comment from a guy who bought and paid for his phone, then later switched carriers and had his originally bought phone killed). Trying to blame middle men here is crazy. marcusmarcus2 I'm not blaming the seller. Please re-read. I said the fault is with Google if they are the ones that decided to black list them. It is the sellers responsibility to try figure out why a device they sold is blacklisted. If they did nothing wrong, then they should be able to get it unblacklisted by working with Google. From the looks of some of the comments on here, it looks like the buyer would not be able to get the device of the black list but the seller should be able to. Again, I'm not blaming the middle man. There is a difference between fault and responsibility. Fault sounds like it is fully on Google. Responsibility goes across everyone though with some having more responsibility. Buyer has some responsibility to report the issue to the seller instead of just reporting it to paypal. Seller has more responsibility than the seller because they would be the one who would be able to work with Google/fi to get it off the black list. Google/fi would have even more responsibility to explain why devices are being blacklisted and getting devices off the black list if they should not be on there. Max As a somewhat frequent seller/buyer on Swappa and Ebay I can say that this is definitely the sellers responsibility to fix the problem or promptly accept a return for a refund otherwise this isn't so different from a bait and switch situation. datkidpatrick how is it a bait and switch if i paid off a phone legit and decided to sell it after... 3 months later it gets blacklisted... this is a mistake by google and its their responsibility to fix... Max If you paid off the phone legit and didn't do anything shady then it wouldn't have been blacklisted and if it was you, as the original buyer, are the one with more authority to contact Google, not the second hand buyer, therefore it's your responsibility to fix it. The buyer with a blacklisted phone has zero reasons to believe that you were truthful in your description even if you were. datkidpatrick well i did contact project fi for the buyer and it is escalated... Max Then you're doing the right thing (taking responsibility) and hopefully this gets resolved quickly by Fi! Although I don't know if they can just un-blacklist a phone? Hopefully they can. ericshmerick If I buy a product from a retail store and 92 days later it has an issue, guess what they will tell me when I show up barking for a refund? Yeah, pound sand kid. That's what they will say. So why do Swappa sellers suddenly have the responsibility to refund forever ala Costco? I get people are pissy at the situation, but the seller isn't responsible for Google's shadyness here. Max We're not talking about "an issue" here because that's what warranties are for, we're talking about a phone reported as lost/stolen after being sold this could potentially mean a fraudster that didn't fully pay the phone or a thief that sold a stolen phone, I doubt any serious retailer would do that... By the way that's what buyer protections are for, Paypal has six months of protection and credit card providers can be very flexible if you explain your case well and you're in the right. If a retailer pull something like this they would never win a chargeback. Max We're not talking about "an issue" here because that's what warranties are for, we're talking about a phone reported as lost/stolen after being sold this could potentially mean a fraudster that didn't fully pay the phone or a thief that sold a stolen phone, I doubt any serious retailer would do that... By the way that's what buyer protections are for, Paypal has six months of protection and credit card providers can be very flexible if you explain your case well and you're in the right. If a retailer pull something like this they would never win a charge back and the manufacturer and distributor would never be involved in the original transaction or charge back, it would be up to the retailer to go after the manufacturer or distributor. ericshmerick But nothing shady or illegal is going on here. If I and the original buyer and I use it on project fi for two months, then decide to sell it. How does that suddenly implicate me as being some sort of shady criminal? I would simply be selling a legally purchased piece of hardware that was paid in full. Max Can you please elaborate how the buyer knows that you sold "a legally purchased piece of hardware that was paid in full" if he has a blacklisted phone reported as lost/stolen in the hands? Good luck convincing the buyer, Paypal and a Bank that you're in the right in such a situation... Luxferro If they sold you shady (stolen or not legal) products you'd be dealing with them. tnt These are not devices being bought from an official retailer. There's no need to question the history of a device bought from Costco. Swappa (and Ebay and Craigslist for that matter) are not the same type of market. It's the seller's responsibility to know the history (as much as possible anyway) of the devices they're selling. freshprince_87 I guess it's safer to buy a Verizon Google Pixel instead if you intend on reselling it later. So the future buyer isn't screwed by Google. That is such a ridiculous policy drksilenc have to have a line with verizon to do that though. Wendell Brown Apparently not, this dude says his WERE Verizon phones that were locked.... https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/6d2yse/2_of_my_3_google_pixel_phones_blacklisted_on_the/ Me Google is just shooting themselves in the foot at this point with the Pixel Yan Qin I just sold my Pixel XL and switch to Galaxy S8, I do think I was out of my mind that I actually bought Pixel at full price. Jordan L anyone resell a project fi phone NOT through Swappa and have it blacklisted? maybe ProjectFi blacklisted only Swappa phones(still a strange move if it was on purpose) Jagermeister 2 of my 3 Pixel phones showed up blacklisted 2 days ago. I made a reddit post yesterday of my issue. I though it was part of an insurance fraud scam. https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/6d2yse/2_of_my_3_google_pixel_phones_blacklisted_on_the/ I had originally though our phones were from Verizon not Google Fi. We were happy Pixel customers that are now considering purchasing different phones because Google can report as stolen whenever they feel a Google Fi device was not transferred to a new owner per their TOS. How can any user purchasing a pre-owned or "new" Google Pixel be sure that it isn't a Google Fi device and won't be blacklisted in the future? Max Johnson Note to self, don't buy second hand Google devices. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Note to everyone: Don't buy first hand Google devices. Max Why? Mine works perfectly fine and so far it's the best phone I've ever owned. Dana Yeah, it's fine as long as you don't get it from Project Fi because you can't sell it if you want to upgrade to a new device. Max LOL, what? I simply bought it directly from store.google.com, no issues here and I can provide proof. This is something related to phones sold through Fi. hunter2 Congrats, scroll up one comment and you'll find a guy who's phone is blacklisted despite him being the original owner and being fully paid off. To answer your question of "Why", it's because not everyone is as comfortable gambling with their money as you are. Max 1) It was blacklisted by the carrier, not the manufacturer. 2) It was blacklisted after it was resold, sucks but as far as we know it doesn't affect the original seller, there's a difference there. 3) We don't know yet why this really happened. 4) Even with all of the above, I don't see how it fits in a "Don't buy first hand Google devices." statement. Maybe if you tell me "Don't deal with Project Fi service" I could somewhat agree. hunter2 http://disq.us/p/1iz7ts3 Sorry, should have permalinked the comment since the order is moving per votes. That guy was the original owner and claims to have been paid off. Moved to Verizon at some point and had the device he originally bough directly from Google blacklisted. Max Well that negates my point 2 and sucks even more. But still the blame here points 100% to Project Fi and not the phone itself nor Google as the manufacturer of the phone. Something really strange is happening with Project Fi devices and hopefully they will find out soon if it's an error, incompetence, sabotage or maybe even hacking. hunter2 I guess it depends on how willing you are to absolve the parent company of things a specific branch is doing. It would be like saying "don't blame MS, it's the IE team who makes the browser" during the IE6 days. Max Legally is evident that the responsibility is on Google but if you think that the group in charge of designing and manufacturing the Pixel has any minimal clue about what happens inside the group of the MVNO Project Fi then you're frankly clueless about how such a huge company works. By the way IE and Edge sucks but Visual Studio rocks and I'm liking more Windows 10 recently but I guess I should avoid using everything Microsoft because IE really sucks, right? hunter2 If a decisions like these can be made without going far enough up the chain of command that you're dealing with some higher ups, then I don't really want to know how this company runs. It's enough to tell me that I can't really trust them because you can't really depend on a company keeping in line with their corporate ideals when individual units can work with this much impunity. Avoiding/disliking MS was never about IE sucking. It was about IE being openly hostile and damaging to the web. This complaint was obviously projected at Microsoft themselves since no one believed that the IE team was working in a bubble. I don't know how old you are so maybe you weren't around when all this was going on. It's not about disliking a company because one or some of their many products are inferior. It's about disliking them because they employ user hostile tactics and you don't feel like you can support that (or at the very least want to punish them in the tiny way you can by voting with your wallet). Max So you already got an official response from Google about this? Can you share it? Because so far I have only read guesses about what is happening and nothing official yet. I'm old enough to have used MS-DOS 5 & 6 as well as Windows 3.1. That doesn't change the fact that saying "don't buy anything from a company" based on one division issues is just silly. If Google officially says that all of this was planned then maybe you could have a point, until then you're just stretching facts to prove a weak point. hunter2 I don't need to fill in the facts. I'm saying either way it's bad. The facts are that this happened. Additional facts about why it happened are irrelevant Max Well, if you're happy thinking like that be my guest, I guess some people is unable to see the colors and think the world is black and white. hunter2 For people whom this isn't a mundane thought experiment but are actually in a position where they need to buy a new device (not everyone is able to be without their phone until Google ultimately resolves this); the shades of gray in this scenario don't change their circumstances. The facts are that they have a phone that was remotely disabled. I'm assuming your shades of gray are the how's and why's of that? How is that of any consequence to these people? Steve_Jobroni Shut up, troll. DanSan got em! Matt This will be great for their resale value. ericshmerick Swappa comments: I GEEVE U $200 BUY NOW FINAL OFFERS!! JD Wooooo! Go Pixel, I'm definately not going near any Google hardware with a 1000ft pole now.I may use my 1001ft pole. In Many states, and at least in Canada this is not legal, you can't blacklist a phone for ToS violation. There's a very narrow list of reasons for a device to be blacklisted. Cuong This is a really shitty move from Google. At least sent a notification few days in advance and offer a way to appeal. What if a person was in an emergency situation? Imagine the lawsuit for that, Google. Why customers have to suffer because Google can't control their resellers? ericshmerick 911 always works. segag Thats Fuck all! Snowsky Mountain This may seriously make me rethink my use of Google hardware (especially phones). Stevie Do no evil Google. Do no evil. My Dixie Wrecked Yeah, they got rid of that mandate years ago. Seriously. Look it up. mxwp lol, yeah it was pretty funny. but i give Big G props for being somewhat honest about that. "hmm, we're huge now and so just cannot help to do some evil" Corey Kinard Just looked​ it up. Looks like it's still in place for Google. Alphabet's is different l though. It's "do the right thing." Sruly J Bought an unlocked Pixel yesterday for $334. Before I send it in to get checked and fixed by Google, I really should check the IMEI (normally I'd have the IMEI first, but the seller didn't give it to me). Michael D’Ambrosio "Someone with an answer." That'll get you far with Tech support. Smh vn33 Does the blacklisted phone works out of US, say in Canada? I assume yes, if it's the carriers that are doing the blacklisting. that said, it would really dampen my desire for a phone from Google. Stevie I am crossing my fingers that they don't come after my Nexus 6. Already bought and activated. There's no going back right? speedy1979 So to clarify google is randomly blacklisting any google pixel that is resold. I actually considered buying a ProjectFi device sometime ago; so glad I didn't go through with it. Kris Crowley I have fi service. When you buy a phone through fi you got a discount or a phone that you can't get through the Google store if you want. There is a disclaimer that if you buy it and never activate it that you will be charged additional Monies within 30 days. Now without knowing isn't possible that A the phone was bought at a discount and B the additional fee was levied but never paid? trixnkix637 Know the risks of buying used people. Do your homework. Asking where the seller bought the phone originally could've prevented all of this. Can't blame Google because someone tried to game the system both ways. marcusmarcus2 Know the risks of not using commas, people. You should never buy people, whether they are used or new. Rony Hmmm, is there a difference between a new and a used person. I've scoured the forums and haven't got a clear answer. marcusmarcus2 You would have to ask them before you buy them. They usually know when they've been used. But again, you should not buy any people. Def Ref But if you try to rent people, you start hearing words like "solicitation" and that's no fun. marcusmarcus2 Don't rent them either. While we are at it. Do not borrow, loan or steal people. Def Ref Is enticement allowed in your no fun world? Asking for a friend. marcusmarcus2 I don't see a problem with enticement as long as that enticement does not lead to stealing people. "No fun world"? You mean my world where I think people should not be viewed or treated as items/property? If yes, then yeah, I guess it is a no fun world. Def Ref Lighten up, Francis. marcusmarcus2 Lighten up, Francis? https://38.media.tumblr.com/39ef7347a58e308e67a5bd01cd124431/tumblr_nsld6lafvE1qh124lo1_500.gif Def Ref https://youtu.be/0OnpkDWbeJs That the title is misspelled AND mispunctuated is bonus. trixnkix637 Didn't NY and NV allow for the renting of people or is that wishful thinking? Asking for a friend. Rod This was so good, I had to sign into Disqus to upvote. trixnkix637 Buying people has been around for ages. Can't just stop now because of commas. marcusmarcus2 Buying used has been around for ages. trixnkix637 And so has it's risks. ericshmerick Wow I feel bad for the Swappa sellers who are getting PayPal charge backs right about now. Alexander Z Great This was the response I received. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/948da6656e25823e8dc529c4571fbc2d347f5e820ee9b7c91844d48c9745a112.png DanSan owner of the device ≠ person who purchased. way to go google. InnocentEd News flash this could happen with any phone from any manufacturer on any network that is resold used. I've had it happen with 2 iPhones and Apple could have cared less. You buy used, you take the risk. It's amazing how even credited tech journalists assume devices on Swappa are always going to be 100% safe. If Project Fi were not allowed to be resold via T&S then it's no diff than blacklisting a resold stolen phone...they had every right. Bewear This is why we can't have nice things. Rony Honestly this makes total sense. Its technically stealing the phone if you buy it for a discounted price and you dont activate it and sell it again. I think they made the right move. raffr It's not "technically" stealing. If you purchase a product at the price requested, you did not steal it. IF, big IF, in your purchase agreement it states you cannot resell the phone without activating it first, then google has a case. Serge Cebrian if you are paying for the service ... you are still paying for it even if you keep your older phone or a better phone if you want to unless you stop paying then its stealing ... but not if you keep the service// marcusmarcus2 They could have blacklisted these phones for that reason. But they could have also been overzealous when blacklisting devices and blacklisted numerous other devices that people did not do that with. It may have been the right move to block those that did do that, but if they inadvertently blocked additional devices, then hopefully they make the right move and unblock those devices that should not have been blocked. newtonfb Not new. Wife got a 5x on swappa. Phone was originally on FI but never taken off the account. We tried to activate it on FI but they did we couldn't until the owner released the phone? It worked fine on any other carrier. Had to get a new 5x Lance Biddle I paid off my pixel through project fi. I recently switched to Verizon. Yesterday Verizon notified me that my phone had been reported as stolen! When I awoke this morning my service had been disabled by Verizon. The support from Project Fi has been abysmal. What do I do to fix this? Corey Kinard Go to Reddit. Get ready for talks with the Better Business Bureau. Keep contacting Fi, keep screenshotting all the correspondences, you get all the buyers info in order to prove you are the original device owner. You don't fix this, you didn't cause it to break. Google fixes this. Everyone affected just has to light a fire under their ass. tnt Keep pushing / escalating with Project Fi. Ryan from GroupTweet I bought a Pixel from Tradeport USA (NH based company, shit!) about 3 months ago. The phone is on T-mobile right now and still currently working (fingers crossed). From my interpretation this appears only to be affecting Pixels bought through Google Fi - and perhaps not ones bought via Google Play store unlocked? Is that correct? Is there anyway I can check to see if my pixel was in fact sold via Google FI vs Google Play? Really hoping I don't wake up to a bricked phone in the next couple mornings... Sruly J You could contact Google, provide them with the IMEI, and they could let you know if it was bought through Google Play. Ryan from GroupTweet Thanks - but don't want to risk tipping them off that my phone should be on the blacklist :( Sruly J But wouldn't they know anyways if it should be blacklisted? I mean, how else would they have blacklisted so many phones this week? lauriedesautels So I have the Pixel and was planning on selling it via Swappa after my credits end from another phone. They ended up giving me a brand new Pixel XL but their service has become horrible where I live. So please correct me if I am wrong but if the Pixel is paid off and I switch carriers/ my Pixel is a paperweight? (I don't plan on using the phone on another carrier after 3 mo). ericshmerick According to this place, you can never sell it. You must carry it with you to your grave. Robert Montoya I have a Pixel that is currently blacklisted as of 5/23/2017 I bought it from Swappa... Google says they will lift the ban in 24 to 48 hours... That was 24 hours ago.. Phone still Blacklisted Wendell Brown I must have missed where it was shown that these deactivated phones were on Project Fi. As best I can tell, the only link to Fi is from an OLD article about the guy reselling phones several months ago. Is there any proof that this is in any way Fi related? MadJoe I have to say, if Google ever blacklisted my phone in a misguided sour-grapes attempt to punish the person who sold it to me, and without compensating me for it I would be rather angry. It would also be the absolute last Google product I ever purchased. As it is, this story has me glad I don't own anything more than a $25 Chromecast that I never use. I was seriously considering the Pixel 2 as my next phone, but not any more. If they were going to be such babies about the phones being resold, they should have vetted their buyers a little better. Corey Kinard It doesn't look like they were making any money off of you in the first place... Second-hand buyers/ bargain hunters rarely go out and pre-order $800 phones. Maybe you're different. They're definitely fucking up, but considering how little the pixel one sold and how much money they make I'm not sure they'll care about this any which way the wind blows. Same way Apple can just outright tell their customers to go fuck themselves over certain problems. MadJoe The problem is that too many people will ignore a company's unscrupulous behavior. If more of us would punished them by taking away access to our wallets, they'd think twice about trying to screw us. But people are lazy and lack commitment. So you're absolutely right, Google won't feel any hit by my deciding not to buy any more of their shit because a shit-ton of blind lemmings will gladly line up to jump off that spot on the cliff I chose not to use. And when a couple of them get screwed, they will cry "why isn't anyone else interested in helping me?" as the rest of the heard ignore them. On the bright side, the cycle will continue ad nauseum until I'm in a hole in the ground. Bruce Considering the ridiculous amount they are charging for the phones (Apple pricing without the Apple level support), this just about kills the resale value for a Pixel. Who the hell is going to buy a used phone for $500+ (because the original cost is so high) if their phones get blacklisted months later. And who the hell is going to buy the phones at the original price, when resale value will drop like a rock. And this doesn't even take into account all the BS that comes with the phone to begin with. 2 years of guaranteed OS updates. Hardware issues (Bluetooth, speakers, water resistance...) which don't get acknowledged amid finger pointing. Insufficient inventory even if they were open to replacements. The 128GB version (the 32GB is too little and the 64 GB doesn't exist) costs almost a $1000. The first time they tried this with the Nexus One, it didn't go well. This doesn't seem to be going much better. The Galaxy Nexus couldn't be upgraded because of drivers. The only real hits have been the Nexus 5 and the 6P. UniBroW *clutches iPhone 7 plus despite it's inferiority to android* Tj Hariharan Wait, do we actually KNOW that the phones that are blacklisted were originally purchased for reselling for profit? All i got from this article was that the phone was originally purchased from Project Fi.. RTNDO128 My phone was effected by this. I've been having issues with no T-Mobile service for the past couple of days on Project Fi. After reading this article, I used the Swappa IMEI checker and what do you know, my phone is reported "lost/stolen". I bought my Pixel on eBay at the beginning of January. Now I'm beyond their 30 day gaurentee. What an absolute clusterfuck. RTNDO128 My phone was effected by this. I've been having issues with no T-Mobile service for the past couple of days on Project Fi. After reading this article, I used the Swappa IMEI checker and what do you know, my phone is reported "lost/stolen". I bought my Pixel on eBay in the middle of February. Now I'm beyond their 30 day guarantee. What an absolute clusterfuck. Y2J You have 180 days in Paypal. RTNDO128 Thanks, I filed a claim with them. Hopefully this situation is covered. Max Did you contact first the seller? Otherwise it's a dick move to file a claim without first giving the seller the opportunity to see if he collaborates... RTNDO128 Thanks for your opinion. As stated, I'm beyond the 30 day eBay guarantee window. I created a "dispute" through the PayPal Resolution Center, which sends a message directly to the seller. PayPal is totally uninvolved with the dispute until I choose to escalate, which will only happen if I cannot get this resolved with the seller first. I just want to have our conversations documented in the event that the seller does not want to deal with this situation. Ken Kinda weird Google said that IMEI can't be blocked by manufacturer, I'm sure that's true. But what when manufacturer is also technically the carrier? Da_James Are you saying that "buying" a device in the USA doesn't mean you own it? Just SUE. Steve_Jobroni > as it's the carrier and not the manufacturer that has the ability to blacklist devices Do people not read the full article anymore? There seems to be a lot of Jabroni's blaming Google when it's the carrier that can only do the blacklisting. Sir_Brizz But that carrier is Project Fi, aka Google... Aleksandr Ivanov Change IMEI, problem solved! AbdulB1 lol Cassidy James Blaede I'd be interested in hearing how widespread this actually is, and a response from Google. My mom bought a Pixel from Swappa because Google was out of stock, and she's been loving it. I'd hate for her phone to become a brick because of this. Leonardo Baez I see a class action demand on the horizon? Đức Thành I'm a die-hard Google fan, but wow does Google need some fixing. justmy2pennies2012 There is one simple way Google can prevent the second hand market from making a profit. 1. Provide enough stock for all those who want to purchase the device! :) Bonus: Price the device accrodingly!! I gave up trying to buy one new from VZW and the Play Store. MisterAlex Did getting a Pixel phone through Fi require signing away your rights regarding "first sale?" And is that enforceable? RayNeverLearns You are Android Police. You might want to stay more up to date on this story and keep your readers updated, especially one that has a big impact on one of the purest Android flagships. http://www.techspot.com/news/69452-pixel-phones-project-fi-showing-up-blacklisted.html datkidpatrick happy to announce the phone i sold has been taken off the blacklist after communicating with project fi... so if you're affected by this contact google or more specifically project fi support... RayNeverLearns I believe Project Fi has done this for all affected Pixels. I didn't contact the person who sold it to me (Craigslist 7 months ago... wouldn't know where to even start) yet my phone was whitelisted earlier today. A little pain and it took almost 3 days, but a good resolution. datkidpatrick thats great... happy it's fixed...

The thing does cost $4,999, but some companies may find it pretty useful. Regardless, those who do happen to have one can now enjoy the official app, which Google has just released via the Play Store. What the app can do will depend on the type of device you are using. It can accomplish certain tasks when using a tablet, while using the application with a smartphone will turn your device into a glorified controller of sorts. Tablet users can create jams, as well as collaborate on them. It’s also possible to share, work together and insert content into jams. On the other hand, smartphone users can’t create new jams, but they can control what happens in the physical Jamboard. You can use the app to detect Jamboards around you, throw content at them and include sticky notes. Go ahead and download the Jamboard app now, but it will be pretty useless unless you have that $4,999 screen. Have any of our readers tried this thing?

It has raised speculation the handset will has a port on top to enable accessories to be plugged in - including the camera, which could be used to create augmented reality apps. Scroll down for video Essential tweeted this image showing what appears to be a 360 degree camera on top An edited version of the image reveals what looks like a 360 degree camera Earlier this year it was reported Rubin had recruited over 40 people to his new firm, to be called Essential, according to Bloomberg. It aims to build an entire technology ecosystem using AI - from phones and smart home gadgets to app stores. A previous tweet shows an extremely small bezel, with Rubin saying he was 'excited to get it into more people's hands'. Rubin also teased last month that Essential is working on a device that would have 360-degree video recording capabilities RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next NASA to reveal new details on groundbreaking mission to...

Share this article Share A previous tweet shows an extremely small bezel, with Rubin saying he was 'excited to get it into more people's hands'. 'Armed with about a 40-person team, filled with recruits from Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc.'s Google, Rubin is preparing to announce a new company called Essential and serve as its Chief Executive Officer, according to people familiar with the matter,' Bloomberg said. A search in LinkedIn reveals several of the employees, including Niccolo De Masi, the ex-CEO of Glu Mobuile, who is listed as the firm's President & COO.  Rubin also recently hired Andy Fouché from Magic Leap, a Google backed firm developing AR glasses.  Bloomberg claims Essential will produce an range of both home and mobile products, and Rubin discussed his handset plans with Sprint executives at the recent CES show. Rubin also teased last month that Essential is working on a device that would have 360-degree video recording capabilities ANDY RUBIN'S CAREER  Born in 1963, New Yorker Any Rubin worked on the first generation of wireless digital assistants, known as PDA. In December 1999 he launched Danger, creator of the Hiptop, a proto-smartphone, which was later bought by Microsoft.  Rubin cofounded Android in 2003 and sold it to Google in 2005, moving to the firm. In December 2013, Rubin started management of the robotics division of Google, before leaving on 30 October 2014 to start an incubator for hardware startups. Rubin and his wife, Rie, also own and operate Voyageur du Temps, a bakery in Los Altos, CA.   Rubin registered Essential Products Inc. with California regulators in November 2015, and in late 2016, the company registered 'Essential' with the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office. There, it listed smartphones, tablets, accessories and 'computer operating software for mobile phones' among its goods and services.  According to Bloomberg, the handset will be aimed at the luxury end of the market, and could be expanded using plug in modules.  Rubin is aiming to put the phone on sale around the middle of this year for a price close to that of an iPhone 7 ($649), a person familiar with the matter told Bloomberg, although they admitted 'all of the plans are still in flux'. Rubin is convinced AI is the next big change to ripple through the technology industry.  'New computing platforms happen every 10 to 12 years,' he said at the Bloomberg Technology Conference in June.  He believes that AI in the future will go one step further - being so powerful that it underpins every connected device. Mr Rubin said a combination of quantum computing and AI advancements could yield a conscious intelligence that would control every internet-enabled gadget.  Andy Rubin has recruited over 40 people to his new firm, to be called Essential, according to Bloomberg. It aims to build an entire technology ecosystem from phones to app stores and smart home gadgets.  'If you have computing that is as powerful as this could be, you might only need one. 'It might not be something you carry around; it just has to be conscious.' While Mr Rubin's claims are currently theoretical, his investment fund, Playground Global, is investing $300 million in companies trying to make this future of AI a reality. One of the companies his fund is investing in, is a quantum computing firm. Its name has not been disclosed. The company is made up of researchers who may one day be able to commercialise quantum devises using standard manufacturing processes, which could massively boost processing power.  Bloomberg claims Essential will produce an range of both home and mobile products, and Rubin (pictured) discussed his handset plans with Sprint executives at the recent CES show. Mr Rubin said: 'In order for AI to blossom and fulfill consumer needs, it has to be about data. 'That's where robotics come in - robots are walking mobile sensors, who can sense their environment and interact and learn from those interactions.'  Foxconn is in talks to manufacture Rubin's new smartphone, according to people familiar with the matter. At least one prototype of Rubin's phone boasts a screen larger than the iPhone 7 Plus's (5.5-inches) but has a smaller overall footprint because of the lack of bezels, one of the people said.   RUBIN'S DOG TAKES ON A ROBOT   While at Google's Rubin's dog hit the headlines after taking on a robot. A feisty terrier has taken on Boston Dynamics' 'Spot' dog by barking at it and even giving chase, showing that in the event of a robot uprising, dogs will still be man's best friend.The dog, named Cosmo, is said to belong to Andy Rubin, the co-founder of Android, who has previously managed the robotics program at Google. Google acquired Boston Dymamics, which makes numerous sized robotic animals in differing sizes, including Spot, which can run, climb stairs, jog next to its owner and even cope with being kicked.

Play it now! more GADGET REVIEWS Is this the ultimate party speaker? MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe. It features 24 hours of battery life and claims to be a 'mini-disco on the move'. But does it live up to the claim? Samsung's Galaxy S8: A hefty price tag and a dumb personal assistant Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning, but its $100 price hike is hard to swallow. Overall the S8 is for those who want elegance - and are willing to pay for it. Affordable, robust and surprisingly responsive: Samsung's Galaxy A5 With the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 having been pushed back, South Korea-based Samsung has plugged the gap with the Samsung Galaxy A5, a high-end device with a mid-range price tag. Is it really worth paying £280 for Nintendo's Switch? MailOnline's verdict While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

Now the electronics giant is bringing artificial intelligence to chips. Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way the company’s devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence -- such as facial recognition and speech recognition, said the person, who requested anonymity discussing a product that hasn’t been made public. Apple declined to comment. Engineers at Apple are racing to catch their peers at Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. in the booming field of artificial intelligence. While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice-recognition, competitors have since been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home digital assistants. An AI-enabled processor would help Cupertino, California-based Apple integrate more advanced capabilities into devices, particularly cars that drive themselves and gadgets that run augmented reality, the technology that superimposes graphics and other information onto a person’s view of the world. “Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI," said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst and co-founder of venture capital firm Loup Ventures. “At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence.” Improved Performance Apple devices currently handle complex artificial intelligence processes with two different chips: the main processor and the graphics chip. The new chip would let Apple offload those tasks onto a dedicated module designed specifically for demanding artificial intelligence processing, allowing Apple to improve battery performance. Should Apple bring the chip out of testing and development, it would follow other semiconductor makers that have already introduced dedicated AI chips. Qualcomm Inc.’s latest Snapdragon chip for smartphones has a module for handling artificial intelligence tasks, while Google announced its first chip, called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), in 2016. That chip worked in Google’s data centers to power search results and image-recognition. At its I/O conference this year, Google announced a new version that will be available to clients of its cloud business. Nvidia Corp. also sells a similar chip to cloud customers. The Apple AI chip is designed to make significant improvements to Apple’s hardware over time, and the company plans to eventually integrate the chip into many of its devices, including the iPhone and iPad, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. Apple has tested prototypes of future iPhones with the chip, the person said, adding that it’s unclear if the component will be ready this year. Apple’s operating systems and software features would integrate with devices that include the chip. For example, Apple has considered offloading facial recognition in the photos application, some parts of speech recognition, and the iPhone’s predictive keyboard to the chip, the person said. Apple also plans to offer developer access to the chip so third-party apps can also offload artificial intelligence-related tasks, the person said. Developer Conference Apple may choose to discuss some of its latest advancements in AI at its annual developer’s conference in June. At the same conference, Apple plans to introduce iOS 11, its new operating system for iPhones and iPads, with an updated user-interface, people with knowledge of the matter said last month. The company is also said to discuss updated laptops with faster chips from Intel Corp. An AI chip would join a growing list of processors that Apple has created in-house. The company began designing its own main processors for the iPhone and iPad in 2010 with the A4 chip. It has since released dedicated processors to power the Apple Watch, the motion sensors across its products, the wireless components inside of its AirPods, and the fingerprint scanner in the MacBook Pro. The company has also tested a chip to run the low-power mode on Mac laptops. Exclusive insights on technology around the world. Get Fully Charged, from Bloomberg Technology. Sign Up In 2015, Bloomberg reported that Apple’s culture of secrecy stymied the iPhone maker’s ability to attract top AI research talent. Since then, Apple has acquired multiple companies with deep ties to artificial intelligence, has begun publishing papers related to AI research, has joined a key research group and has made hires from the field. In October 2016, Apple hired Russ Salakhutdinov from Carnegie Mellon University as its director of AI research.

(Chinatopix via AP) By The Washington Post | PUBLISHED: May 26, 2017 at 1:38 pm | UPDATED: May 26, 2017 at 1:38 pm By Hamza Shaban, (c) 2017, The Washington Post AI: 2, Humanity: 0. A computer designed by Google researchers has beaten the world’s top Go player for the second game in a row, capturing the best-of-three match in Wuzhen, China, and confirming AI’s supremacy in what many consider as one of humanity’s most complex boardgames. Ke Jie, a 19-year-old Go grandmaster, began the game with stellar play, said Demis Hassabis, the CEO of DeepMind, the artificial intelligence firm that created AlphaGo, at a press conference. Google acquired his company in 2014. But the Chinese prodigy was eventually bested by AlphaGo. In South Korea last year, DeepMind’s machine defeated another championship-caliber player, Lee Sedol, stunning some in the field of artificial intelligence. “For the first 100 moves it was the closest we’ve ever seen anyone play against the Master version of AlphaGo,” Hassabis said after the game. “Today’s game was different from the first,” Ke said Thursday at the press conference. “AlphaGo made some moves which were opposite from my vision of how to maximize the possibility of winning. I also thought I was very close to winning the game in the middle but maybe that’s not what AlphaGo was thinking.” AlphaGo’s sudden dominance over human competitors has surprised AI researchers, who had suspected that machines would take much more time to master the intricacies of Go. The program began as a research project three years ago. In a 2016 Nature article, Google said that AlphaGo had beaten European champion Fan Hui, five games to zero, in a match that took place during the previous October, behind closed doors. That marked the first time any computer program had beaten a professional player at Go. The program went on to beat more stand out players. AlphaGo’s wins have revealed the ways that computers can augment human capability and spur new ways of thinking. And more broadly, the computer program’s feat helps validate a more optimistic take on the future of automation and AI, one in which humans aren’t necessarily displaced, but are enhanced in some way. This week’s match in China also demonstrated the very human limitations that can surface amid competition, primarily how stress and emotions can hinder decision making.”I was very excited. I could feel my heart bumping,” Ke said after the game. “Maybe because I was too excited I made some stupid moves.” Beyond the game of Go, DeepMind scientists believe that the technology that powers AlphaGo can help societies develop better ways to conserve energy and boost health research. The third and final game pitting Ke against AlphaGo will take place on Saturday, as part of Google’s “Future of Go Summit.” Another match will feature two professional human players facing one another, but each will have their own AlphaGo teammate.

There is now a new “Personal” tab (via Search Engine Roundtable) on the web and mobile to quickly see these results from your various Google apps. Nintendo Switch “Personal” is the newest filter in Google Search that helps users fine-tune results by content type, like Images, News, Shopping, etc. Depending on the query, Google usually reorders the tabs to list the most relevant filters first. However, for the moment, it appears that the Personal tab is always the last item in the “More” menu. This is the case through multiple search terms that readily bring up Gmail and Calendar cards in the main “All” tab. The most common result that appears under Personal are messages from Gmail, with around 10 messages appearing in a card. Tapping one will immediately open the full message in a tab, with the option to load in Gmail. Results from Calendar and Photos work similarly, with the latter immediately opening up the image, with a “View all Google Photos results” link at the bottom of the card offering to perform a full search in Photos. Similar to the rest of Google Search, ads do appear in the Personal tab, but at the very bottom underneath cards and results on the web. The Personal tab appears to be widely rolled out, with users first seeing the filter yesterday. Available on the web and mobile, it does not appear in the Google app for Android.

The addition of the tab was first reported by Search Engine Roundtable, which spotted the change earlier today. The Personal tab works similarly to the way the existing Maps, News, or Images tabs work — instead of showing you a search for links, it just takes the entered search terms and shows you results from your Google accounts instead. The Personal tab doesn’t show up by default — you’ll have to click through to the “More” option; it’ll be on the bottom. Google seems to be slowly rolling out the feature to users. In an informal polling of Verge staffers, most didn’t have it enabled yet. If you do have the Personal tab, though, the feature works on both the web and mobile versions of Google. We’ve reached out to Google for more information as to when users can expect to see the Personal filter on their own accounts, and will continue to update this post as we get more information.

Lidar is technology that uses near-infrared light to detect the shape of objects around it. next play/pause pre Waterloo Region Record By John R. Quain Giant tech companies are fighting over the technology in court. Startups around the world are racing to develop new versions of it. And engineers say it is essential to making autonomous cars safe. The obscure object of desire: lidar. "We believe it will be the basis for autonomous driving," said Guillaume Devauchelle, who oversees innovation at Valeo, a major parts supplier to automakers. The technology, which uses near-infrared light to detect the shape of objects around it, is the centrepiece of an intense court fight in California between Uber and Waymo, the self-driving business operated by Google's parent, Alphabet. In the case, Waymo accuses a former Google engineer, Anthony Levandowski, of stealing trade secrets about the company's lidar designs for his own autonomous driving startup — which he sold to Uber for nearly $700 million. Lidar — pronounced LIE-dar — is shorthand for light detection and ranging. It is a type of sensor that is at the heart of many autonomous car designs and is critical to several worldwide high-resolution mapping efforts. The same technology is used to delineate terrain from airplanes and detect speeding violations. The advantage of lidar is that it can generate precise three-dimensional images of everything from cars to trees to cyclists in a variety of environments and under a variety of lighting conditions. While autonomous car designs use numerous sensors, including ultrasonic, radar and video camera components, lidar has unique abilities. Unlike cameras, for example, lidar cannot be fooled by shadows or blinded by bright sunlight. The biggest hurdle to widespread lidar adoption is an economic one, and that is where the battle is being waged. When Google initially started its autonomous vehicle research eight years ago, the lidar sensors it used cost roughly $75,000. Those sensors were made by Velodyne Lidar, an industry leader. Velodyne declined to say what the current pricing is for such systems, but Waymo's chief executive, John Krafcik, said in a recent presentation that his company had reduced the cost of its lidar system by 90 per cent. But even at $7,500, such systems are seen as too expensive to meet automakers' demands. "Car companies want it to cost $100 and perform 10 times better, be smaller — and very reliable," said Omer Keilaf, chief executive of Innoviz Technologies, a lidar developer based in Israel. "So there's a big vacuum in the industry right now." The race to fill that void is largely focused on producing solid-state lidar systems, which would shrink the size of the sensors, eliminate moving parts involved in the optical mechanisms and enable the kind of mass manufacturing that could bring costs down, said Hongbo Zhang, a research associate at Virginia Tech who is working on a lidar design. Established automotive suppliers, such as Velodyne and Valeo; technology companies like Waymo and Uber; and relative newcomers like Innoviz, LeddarTech and Quanergy all have their sights set on making less expensive sensors. Luminar Technologies, a lidar company that recently came out of stealth mode, is focusing on improving the performance of sensors by extending the effective range of lidar past 200 metres. (Top-of-the-line sensors now have a range of 120 metres.) Austin Russell, Luminar's chief executive, said the company accomplished the longer range by using a more sensitive receiver, as well as a more powerful light output that remains safe enough to avoid damaging people's vision. Velodyne, which says it is the only current third-party lidar supplier for fully autonomous vehicles now being tested, is well aware that startups are gunning for its business. Velodyne is working on its own solid-state Velarray lidar sensor, said Mike Jellen, Velodyne president, and it plans to start mass-producing them next year in a 200,000-square-foot factory in San Jose. While there has been considerable speculation about how Velodyne will face the potential price competition, Jellen declined to estimate how much the new sensors might cost, saying only that a complete lidar sensor package for future vehicles might be priced in the "low thousands" per vehicle. Other companies building complete autonomous driving packages expect prices to fall faster. "In five years, for ridesharing cars, it could be an $8,000" option, said Jeffrey Owens, chief technology officer for Delphi. Delphi recently announced it was working with Intel, BMW and Mobileye on an autonomous driving platform. "In 2025, it could be $5,000," he said. "The problem is that we're still in AI learning mode and only buying in quantities of a couple-thousand," said Jellen, referring to artificial intelligence. "The problem is, the market isn't there yet." There are also some technical kinks that need to be ironed out with new systems. Different versions of lidar paint images of the world around them in different ways, said Zhang at Virginia Tech. That means different lidar sensors from different companies cannot simply be exchanged for one another on an autonomous BMW or Ford vehicle. How a car is trained and learns will partly depend on the specific type of lidar used. Despite these challenges, Keilaf of Innoviz and many others say there will not be fully autonomous cars without lidar — and it will have to be cheap. It will also have to meet exceptionally high standards. "An autonomous vehicle that's 99 per cent safe won't be good enough," said Russell of Luminar. "This is mission critical. You can't afford to miss a single object because that object could be a person."

Let alone trying to dial in with the help of Google's voice assistant. The good news is that these can be easily managed and organized. From your phone Android's stock phone app should be the first thing to try. Go to your Contacts -- we tried this on LG and Samsung phones, but depending on your phone's brand it can be a little different -- on the app, tap the Menu button > Manage Contacts > then select Merge. A screen with all repeated contacts will show up, so you can confirm which you want to merge one by one. From your desktop browser / Google Contacts A second method is made available from your Google Account. Log in to your Gmail Account and then go to your Contacts (or enter directly from this link). On the right sidebar there's a "Duplicates" option, which will show a list with all the candidates to be merged. Select "Merge" on each and you're done. An additional word of caution The two alternatives above are easy and accessible default options that Google provides to merge contacts. Unless you have thousands of contacts and hundreds of duplicates, they should serve you well. But an additional word of caution. There are a ton of "free" apps on the Play Store to merge contacts, however even if some of those promise to automatically merge with one click, we wouldn't compromise on security by letting a third-party ask for Google account credentials solely for this purpose. 5 days, 5 killer tech tips is a TechSpot monthly feature On the third week of every month, we'll publish 5 killer tech tips, one for each day of the week for a given app, service, or platform.

With its sensing, mapping, and localization capabilities, the Google Tango platform has a lot of promise for robotics. Here’s an update on some of what Google has been working on with it: And here’s the talk that Johnny Lee from the Tango project gave at Google I/O earlier this month. [ Google Tango ] Flyability’s Elios drone has the ability to fly almost anywhere thanks to the clever design of its roll cage. It’s already been deep down inside glaciers, so the next logical place to send it is a cave: Flyability took part in the scientific expedition (ref article from ESA) organized by the La Venta Association and Commissione Grotte Eugenio Boegan, together with the European Space Agency and astronaut Luca Parmitano, in the La Cucchiara caves near Sciacca, Sicily. Part of ESA’s Cooperative Adventure for Valuing and Exercising human behavior and performance Skills course (CAVES-X1), this expedition was primarily meant to train astronauts in an environment replicating extraterrestrial conditions. It has also been the opportunity to deploy Elios in extreme conditions by performing the exploration of an underground abyss. The known part of the cave consists of a gallery that ends in a 100 m deep abyss. This is as far as humans could go in the exploration and that’s where the collision-tolerant drone was used to continue the journey. With an ambient temperature of 37°C, 100% of humidity and continuous rain from condensation, the Flyability team joining the expedition operated the drone to find potential unexplored paths. Using Elios’ thermal camera to detect hidden hot air sources, the team could very quickly and clearly identify openings of various size. [ Flyability ] via [ ESA ] Thanks Adrien! You should probably not try this with your robot: [ Denso Robotics ] Evezor is a SCARA-type robot arm designed to be able to automate tasks using any tool you decide to strap to it: It’s a compelling vision, certainly, but the early bird price is over $3,000, and the project is looking for $250k. If you know this is for you, you’ll probably jump on it, but it’s a big investment for most makers. [ Evezor ] via [ BBG ] One of the desires with robotic systems is to devise easier ways to setup and program the robots. One potential approach to setup is known as “Programming by Demonstration” in which a human trainer demonstrates the task to the robot, and from that demonstration the robot learns the task which can be performed. During her summer internship at Fetch Robotics, Sarah Elliott worked on a web-based programming by demonstration system for the Fetch. [ Fetch Robotics ] Drone behemoth DJI continues to outdo itself with the launch of Spark, a very compact camera drone with a range of autonomous capabilities, including obstacle sensing, hand-gesture recognition, and pre-programmed flight behaviors like following and circling: One of the most impressive things is that you get all this for just $500. [ DJI ] Introducing Daisy, an 18-DOF hexapod walking robot built from X-Series modular actuators. This robot is now on display the the Chicago Museum of Science and Industry as part of their Robot Revolution exhibit. [ Hebi Robotics ] via [ CMU RI ] I’m not sure that I need my toy racecars to make snarky comments (I do just fine on my own, thank you very much), but the amount of sensing and actuation in Sphero’s latest toy is impressive: The car will run at up to 10 km/h, make it 40 minutes on a charge, and there are all kinds of moves and sounds that you can control with an app. But along with all of that intelligence and sensing and actuation comes a price to match: the toy is now on sale for $300. [ Sphero ] Security robots certainly have value, but the bad guys can probably outrun most of them. That’s not a problem for the O-R3, a security ground robot that can deploy an untethered drone to pursue a suspect: [ Otsaw ] via [ Engadget ] Sweep, the alarmingly affordable high quality lidar sensor from Scanse, is now available with an add-on kit that lets you take 3D scans of very large areas: The kit is $350, and the lidar itself isn’t included. But you have one on pre-order already anyway, right? [ Scanse ] Thanks Tyson! Lockheed Martin successfully launched Vector Hawk, a small, unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), on command from the Marlin MK2 autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) during a cross-domain command and control event hosted by the U.S. Navy. In addition to Marlin and Vector Hawk, the Submaran, an unmanned surface vehicle (USV) developed by Ocean Aero, provided surface reconnaissance and surveillance. During the Annual Navy Technology Exercise (ANTX) activities in August, the Submaran relayed instructions to Marlin from a ground control station via underwater acoustic communications. Following these instructions, the Marlin launched the Vector Hawk using a specially-designed canister from the surface of the Narragansett Bay. Following launch, Vector Hawk successfully assumed a mission flight track. All three autonomous vehicles—Marlin, Submaran and Vector Hawk—communicated operational status to the ground control station to maintain situational awareness and provide a means to command and control all assets. The four-pound Vector Hawk can fly for 70-plus minutes, at line-of-sight ranges up to 15 kilometers. Operators can recover and re-launch the Vector Hawk in a matter of minutes (including changing the system’s battery). Vector Hawk is built on an open architecture to enable rapid technology insertion and payload integration. Marlin MK2 is a battery powered, fully autonomous underwater vehicle that is 10 feet long with a 250 pound payload capacity, 18-24 hour endurance, depth rating of 1000 feet and weighs approximately 2,000 pounds. [ Lockheed Martin ] Scientists at Scuola Sant’Anna in Italy and EPFL (Ecole polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne) in Switzerland have built a prototype of a smart, light-weight and easy-to-personalize exoskeleton that counteracts the loss of balance and promotes balance recovery after an accidental slip. This is a first in wearable machines, which are normally used to assist or enhance regular movement, instead of preventing an unexpected event like falling. [ EPFL ] The EduExo is a robotic exoskeleton kit that you assemble and program yourself. It contains the hardware that you need to build an elbow exoskeleton. An accompanying handbook contains a tutorial that will guide you through the different assembly steps. In addition, the handbook provides background information on exoskeleton history, functionality and technology. In the end, you will have a good understanding about exoskeleton technology and its application, together with hands-on experience building and programming your own robotic exoskeleton. The Kickstarter is already funded, but you can pledge $180 towards a kit, or $250 if you want a kit that includes muscle control. [ EduExo ] The Acorn team has deployed a Sawyer collaborative robot operating a band saw, where the robot transfers, aligns and cuts pieces of wood to be used as mounts for rubber stamps. Sawyer cuts, drills and inserts the wooden handles for the stamp mounts, effectively automating a complicated, multi-step process. [ Rethink Robotics ] The Office of Naval Research (ONR) TechSolutions-sponsored Mine Warfare Rapid Assessment Capability (mRAC) is a man-portable threat detection and localization system that utilizes an ultra-sensitive magnetometer sensor package installed onboard a small quadrotor platform. [ ONR ] Elad Inbar CEO & Founder of RobotLAB Inc talking with the Learning Counsel about STEM, robotics and the ways in which schools can use technology to reimagine classroom learning.

(Photo by Jeff Gritchen, Orange County Register/SCNG) Show Caption of Expand   Five minutes into a test for memory, I’m pretty sure I’m really dumb, I’ve lost my mind — or both. Yeah, yeah, I know based on some of my columns some would vote both. But cut me some slack. Unknown to many people — like me — the earlier Alzheimer’s disease is detected, the better the chance of stopping it. Related Articles How an Orange County doctor is slowing Alzheimer’s progression in this patient Experts report that it can be delayed for as long as two decades. For many baby boomers, that means a lifetime. The Orange County Vital Brain Aging Program advises that if you are 45 or older get checked. The Alzheimer’s Association is looser. It’s basically if you can’t remember how to use the microwave, get tested. After talking to a Mission Viejo finance guy named Ted Esau whose dad died with Alzheimer’s, I’m taking no chances. Better early testing than wondering why I interviewed someone. I arrive at the Hoag Neurosciences Institute in Newport Beach and Celine Keeble, education and screening coordinator, explains the test in detail with patience and a smile. She rattles off a list of words. I’m a little overwhelmed and feel I’m lucky if I’m reciting back half. Photographer Jeff Gritchen is nearby, and I’m pretty sure he’s wondering about my sanity. I just hope he doesn’t report back to our version of Editor Perry White (Clark Kent’s boss, if I recall correctly) that one of his columnists is bonkers. Slowing Alzheimer’s The day starts badly. Even Google is forgetful. She — yes, my Google is a woman — sends me on a detour around a non-existent traffic jam. I arrive late to the institute next to Hoag Hospital. Honest, it was Google’s fault that I didn’t know where to go. Thanks to a subsidy from the institute and community donations, the Vital Brain Aging Program, OCBrain.org, only charges $45 and parking is free. As I register, I fill out a card that will be mailed next year reminding me to come in for re-testing. But what if I don’t recall the previous test? The receptionist laughs. They’ll call. I fill out a list of questions that are similar to an online self-assessment that the program offers at OCBrain.org. They include memory, depression, risk factors. Since the program began seven years ago, some 4,500 local residents have had assessments. More than 25 percent were referred to their primary care physician for a check-up. But three-fourths of those tested were over 64 — well after most experts advise to start testing. Much of the reason for getting tested is creating a baseline. If the following year’s result is lower, adjustments in behavior, diet and medicine can be made. Sometimes, Keeble says, the next test shows improved memory. Ways to protect memory include managing medical conditions, exercising at least three days a week for 30 minutes, maintaining a healthy weight, getting seven to eight hours sleep, having low cholesterol, challenging your mind. Dr. William Shankle is program director for memory and cognitive disorders at the Hoag Neurosciences Institute. “The big change in my field,” he says, “is that we do have the ability to test for (impairment) with a simple memory test while someone is still functioning normally.” But Shankle adds that it’s a challenge to convince people that memory testing is as normal and as useful as getting a blood test. UC Irvine Institute for Memory Impairments and Neurological Disorders, too, offers test opportunities. Its focus is research participation. The website is Mind.uci.edu. Of those tested through the Orange County Vital Brain Aging Program, 23 percent were impaired. More men than women were impaired. And — as expected — cognitive ability declined as people aged. But not as much as you might expect. Through age 75, fewer than 10 percent of participants were found impaired. By age 84, that reached 40 percent. By 94, it was close to 75 percent. But, mind you, being impaired includes a wide range of abilities from simple memory loss to serious Alzheimer’s. Keeble asks a list of questions. I admit to some depression, a little memory loss. When vinyl rocked the world, I could reel off the band members of Led Zeppelin. But now, I sometimes mix up John Bonham (drums) and John Paul Jones (bass). I know. Shameful, right? While Keeble compiles my results, she points out depression and stress can affect memory. Fear of testing Keeble is in the field nearly every day. She reports one of the toughest things she encounters is fear. People are afraid they might be getting Alzheimer’s. Yet often it’s simple aging or normal forgetfulness. When I was in my 20s, I sometimes locked my keys in my car. I still do. (Yes, I keep a spare.) I misplace my wallet. Years ago, I found it in the freezer. Recently, I found it in the garbage. Still, Keeble encounters true Alzheimer’s. “Some people cry,” Keeble says. “It’s true there’s no cure,” she acknowledges. “But there are lots of things that be done that can impact the quality of life.” Engaging different areas of the brain helps create connections, she explains. Being creative and problem-solving are key. Learning to do something new such as salsa dancing or taking up piano combine a variety of things that help with protecting memory. As we wrap up, Keeble hands me a sheet of paper. It is my memory screen results. There are no right or wrong answers. But there is an intricate interplay in the questions that test a variety of brain functions. The document says: “Normal memory.” For a test appointment: 949-764-6288. I’ll be back next year.

Here are a few ways machine learning has improved Gboard Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/24 4:33pm PDTMay 24, 2017 36 Plus 1 on G+ 110 Share on Facebook 97 Share on Twitter Total Shares243 Applications Google Google has been improving Gboard with the same type of tools it uses for speech recognition: machine learning. The budding technology is rapidly becoming a ubiquitous method for improving results and performance. If a network can be trained to accurately accomplish something in a performant way, odds are you'll see it introduced to any product it can be applied to. Gboard and text-input as a whole are no different, and we are reaping the benefits of improved corrections and predictions every time we swipe out a low-accuracy message to a friend. But how do these improvements work? This is going to be a pretty technical post, and I'm going to do my best to simplify things to a level where everyone can enjoy the subject. All of this is based on a recent Google Research blog post. If you are really into machine learning and you already know what every term I might use means, the source link is probably the best place for you to learn about the cool new stuff in Gboard. If, however, you think you might want a few of the concepts or terms explained, then this article might be the place for you. Google's latest research blog post is all about one thing: Gboard. The authors talk about some of the new features that were shown off at I/O, like the transliteration tools for typing in a language you might only have a phonetic familiarity with. But the biggest things discussed in the article relate to how input is determined, and the models and math that determine which swipes equate to which words, and how to most accurately correct mistakes. The two solutions Google has found revolve around its neural spatial models for processing input, and finite-state transducers for state progression to accurately determine content. These sound like complex ideas, but their cleverness can be explained. Input Neural spatial models are just a fancy way of saying machine learning applied to any space. For instance, the physical Gboard keyboard layout itself. When we type, we sometimes type wrong. And when we swipe, we sometimes swipe wrong. I might have meant to drag over "P" for this word, but I only made it to O. That's where these neural spatial models come in handy. They are able to determine probabilities for which letters you meant to hit based on physical proximity of input, as well as predictive models based on trained corrections. Originally, Gboard used a Gaussian model, combed with a set of simple rules. That's a fancy way of saying it used physical proximity in a sort of bell-curve out from a given key, combined with a basic understanding of certain common errors. The developers have replaced the older Gaussian and rule-based model with an LSTM, or long short-term memory model, trained by a CTC, or connectionist temporal classification. Big somewhat scary acronyms, but they're actually pretty simple ideas. A long short-term memory is a particular kind of neural net ideal for use in applications of intermittent or unknown event/time latencies, and Google has previously used these for speech recognition, the Google Assistant, and Google Translate. A connectionist temporal classification is a specific method of training a neural network. After all, a neural network is nothing without data to derive weighted triggers and values from. In this case, it means segmenting data input to the network by time and allowing the network to retroactively refer to input, states, and output before and after the current set. To further simplify, it means referring to data at many stages of analysis from multiple periods of time, increasing the value of context in the network's training. To pull data for training, Google used data sets comprised of information collected when users opt-in to share snippets, and set reverted corrections and suggestions as negative signals, and accepted corrections or suggestions as positive. To help visualize how it might work, we have this image. In the above, the left represents individual data points from the word "could" as swiped on Gboard. The right is a normalized temporal data for the same swiped input. By being able to refer to the probable center of an input, in temporal context with inputs that came before and after, we can tell that the overall path means "Could" even if we might not have hit a couple of letters quite right. Google was further able to adapt some of its speech recognition tools and data and apply it to corrections and suggestions in Gboard, optimizing things over iterations with a heavy dose of Tensorflow to increase the speed of analysis and output and decrease the number of errors. All that is well and good, but Google can also leverage the rules of a language to enhance predictions. As a basic example, consider: If you tapped O-T instead of I-T, Gboard can look at its dictionary and determine that "OT" isn't something you are likely to input, but that the similar "IT" is a word. Furthermore, "I" is physically close to "O," so you probably meant "IT." Easy. Well, Google is able to do a similar but improved sort thing via what is called a finite-state transducer. Processing To vastly over-simplify, a finite-state transducer, in this case, means an order of operations for processing input. The operational flow above shows the various stages of potential input for the words "I," "I've," and "If." In this image input at each stage comes before the ":" (with ε representing nothing as either input or output), and potential outputs are shown after the ":" as they each become logical. So we start having input the letter "i." From the top path we can see, if there is no additional input, then "I" is the correct output. If an apostrophe or space follows, followed by the letter "v," then "I've" is the likely output. If the letter "f" follows, then "If" is the likely output. The final two flows at the bottom return to start. You can think of it as just a series of rules for input and output. Google is able to use these same tools at other scales. For instance, developers can create these logical chains for whole words and their contexts, combined with the spatial models above and statistical likelihoods for possible inputs. These tools also apply to the transliteration features that were shown off at I/O. By implementing those same workflows and networks towards phonetically spelled input, it can guess what characters or words in another language you might mean. For anyone that might speak a language, but not know how to spell it, that's pretty cool. Unfortunately, if you can't read the language, you aren't really in a position to know if what it's typing is right or wrong, but it's still a useful tool. Output Gboard and machine learning are both pretty fantastically interesting and complex subjects. I hope our simplification of the tools behind it has helped you understand a bit more behind how it all works. It's useful to have knowledge about how the things we use on a daily basis work, not just in an abstract sense for intellectual fulfillment, but to provide us with a base for troubleshooting when things might go wrong. Now when GBoard makes seemingly odd recommendations, you might have a small idea as to why.

It's also buggy and crashy as hell. I switched to SwiftKey and haven't looked back. elijahblake it is very, very, very, bad at predicting correct words.. I do miss swiftkey sometimes. I guess i'm just hanging in there hoping the gboard starts learning. Just today instead of "this" it put "thoe" Dennis Ulijn I accidentally typed htought and it corrected it to brought instead of thought... Like... Why?! dimm0k I've mentioned this before... prior to the change of name to Gboard when it was Google Keyboard, the prediction was actually decent! since the name change however I agree that the prediction has been pretty crappy! words that I've typed pretty often still get mistaken for some other random word that doesn't even work in the sentence I'm typing out! JD I'm not the only one the noticed. That since the GBoard change it's turned to shit. When it was Google Keyboard it was neck and neck with Swiftkey David Thoren That's interesting.. I've never really used the prediction to type with, I just swipe through without looking, so I can't really speak to that.. But I have never seen Gboard crash or even get unstable. KlausWillSeeYouNow Gboard is totally unstable on my LG V20. Maybe it's just something specific to my device – but only recent versions of Gboard have had this issue for me. I miss the days of Google Keyboard, a stable product that actually worked. gv Haven't had any stability problems with g'board; don't think it's even crashed once on my axon7. But then again, it doesn't work worth a damn either, so is that really such an accomplishment? KlausWillSeeYouNow Yeah. Amen. Sounds like you and I should have a beer sometime. We clearly feel the same about Gboard. gv You can apply all the fancy machine learning you want, doesn't change that gv is total shit at predicting swiped words... it's so bad that I've gone back to swype despite it being a resource hog and slow. My favorite thing is you'll swipe a word, and gv will take a guess and be really wrong. So you'll back over it, swipe it again and gv will guess the EXACT SAME WORD. So you'll back over it, swipe it again, and gv will now be so sure that it won't offer *any* alternative suggestions (even though the alternative suggestions were also wrong) the third time. Machine learning, my ass! Machine stupidity; if it wasn't the correct word the first or second time you can be damn sure it's not the correct word the third time! So then you type in the word you actually want, and next sentence you need the same word. Idiot gv then suggests the original word AGAIN when you swipe it. Machine learning, my ass! At least swype is smart enough to know that if you just used a word it didn't swype in correctly, next time you swype something close to that (even if you didn't permanently add it to the dictionary) that's likely the word you wanted! KlausWillSeeYouNow AMEN! PREACH! I second this. It's so annoying. You said it better than I ever could, pal. Whatever Gboard's doing, it isn't working. Carson Saldanha I'm even on the beta on my 2014 Nexus 6 and it's running just fine--no crashes or anything. blahmoomoo If they can one day figure out when I mean to say "if" or "of", I'll be happy. It feels like less of a problem recently, but it still happens sometimes... Lare2 The problem I have with Gboard is that when you write on two languages and forget to change the language, over the time, it will start suggesting words on the wrong language. Rod This. On the other hand, Swiftkey handles languages nicely. h4rr4r It does this to me constantly. What I hate is that enabling a language for this requires adding its keyboard. For languages with the same alphabet but different layout it is really annoying. big_al77 I love gboard. Best keyboard for a while now Miku is Best Vocaloid I started using it as soon as they added bilingual prediction. Ha hecho mi vida mucho más fácil.

Ahora puedo escribir mis mensajes en spanglish sin problemas :) matteventu And why the hell when I write in Italian it often tells me "Download now the Portuguese dictionary" (or some shit like that) as a tip? Can't it understand that I'm writing in Italian, with also the Italian dictionary set up? Lare2 It's​ doing the same to me when typing in Spanish. Stu I've finally made the switch from fleksy to gboard. Not the smoothest transition but there are some pluses. I just wish that when I turned off auto capitalization it worked for everything and not just the first letter of a sentence. Wouldn't mind if it knew that punctuation went at the end of the last word, even if I put a space already (like with commas). Would also be nice if when I added words to the dictionary it knew better when to suggest them or auto add them. Even when I add shortcuts in the dictionary I still have to type very deliberately, add apostrophes myself, etc. My name is…. A far lesser keyboard to Swiftkey. Mike Each have their pros and cons, I personally prefer Gboard for it's speed but Swiftkey has more features going for it. KlausWillSeeYouNow There's nothing fast about having to correct nearly every word Gboard predicts or swipes wrong. It will change correctly typed words, like "got," to stuff that can neither be contextually nor structurally related, like "hey." It was just like torture. I wanted to love Gboard but couldn't :( Aaron I want to love Gboard still. Just couldn't keep using Swiftkey after after the MS buyout. KlausWillSeeYouNow Why? It's not like it has Outlook built in or anything. Prezes Dyrektor Because Microsoft spying on us is evil, and Google or Facebook for example are fair and righteous /s Aaron IDK. My ever growing disdain for Windows has expanded to all Microsoft products. It's not necessarily rational. Brandon Giesing I'm pretty sure they mean speed as in it doesn't lag your whole device like SwiftKey does. Yeah you do waste more time technically because correcting stuff non-stop but Gboard is definitely faster than SwiftKey when it comes to not lagging. KlausWillSeeYouNow I've had the exact opposite experience. Everything about SwiftKey is faster. Gboard is a lagfest. Dmitry Stepanushkin Sure some people will use swipe input, but I prefer tap, especially for English keyboard, it's much faster for me, and swipe feels unreliable. Mike I try to Swype all the time and it just feels like I'm wasting time versus just tapping. Christopher Bement Swiping is way faster for me. tlogank Gboard kills the battery on my S7 for some reason. I get more alerts about it eating my battery up than any other app. Wish that wasn't the case because it's my favorite keyboard, but I can't keep using it as is. Carson Saldanha Try setting the theme to black AMOLED. I know that shouldn't be the fix and probably won't fully fix it, but it'll for sure help a little and will only take a while until you get used to the look. tlogank I'm getting notices for it even when I'm not using it. It's like doing stuff in the background or something. Carson Saldanha Strange. Have you tried a reinstall? Christopher Bement What have you tried in an attempt to fix it? tlogank Not much besides uninstalling and reinstalling it. Doesn't seem to help for more than a day. Druter Gboard is one of the most inaccurate keyboards on the Play store right now. Sometimes it almost seems as if it's trying to make typing as full of errors as possible. I have taken to reading everything two or three times to catch the errors and it still manages to sneak some in there. I do not have confidence enough in Gboard to type even short sentences and hit send without proofreading. If this is machine learning, the machine needs to go back to school Captain_Invisible Yup! It is by far the worst correction I have ever experienced in a keyboard. I can press all the right letters for a word (that makes complete sense) just to have it "correct" to another word... Michael Oghia The spell check isn't as good as it used to be either. obk88 just used it for about a week its very intriguing...using gifs, doing quick search from the keyboard and also used the translation option...but typing is just more effortless on swfitkey. Prediction is better on swiftkey, no suggestions in chrome or other apps is really annoying & gliding isnt as smooth...google is going in the right direction but this app still needs work...for now im back on swfitkey but keeping an eye on gboard for sure gv gboard may have machine learning algorithms, but they suck out loud. The ONLY thing it has going for it is launch speed. Other than that, it's far slower because it mis-predicts what word I'm swiping nearly 85% of the time. Seriously, I was swiping a text the other day and it didn't swipe a correct word. Eventually wound up thumbing the message just so I could talk! tehboogieman One of my biggest issues with Gboard is the inconsistency of whole word delete when swipe typing. I recently discovered there is a swipe backspace feature that I haven't read about anywhere that partially makes up for it, but I wish they would make the experience more consistent. If AP hasn't mentioned it yet it might be post worthy. I like a lot of the other improvements that Gboard has over the previous Google/AOSP keyboard. I've noticed a lot of improvements in text correction that takes a little getting used to, where it actually corrects groups of words or phrases in some situations. Still annoyed that I can't sync with my other devices just because I have one GSuite account EH101 The GSuite thing pisses me off. And it's not even the 'main' account. Martin AP wrote about the "delete whole words by sliding from backspace" thing back when it was introduced a year ago, but then the keyboard was still called Google Keyboard. Ailín Ó’S SwiftKey will remain my goto however. Nathan J And yet, they still can't tell the difference between to and too, or insist I meant CSV when I trace type "can." Rod Great post! Amarus Kh I've been trying Gboard for four weeks now since I got a new phone, but I just can't get myself to like it. I find it annoying that it doesn't show suggestions in many types of input fields (e.g. my email address in user fields, chrome search/address bar, etc.), swiping is unreliable most of the time, predictions are rarely relevant and don't seem to have improved with use, and so on. I'm going back to Swype. Dave i use texpand for emails h4rr4r Can machine learning add the rest of the keys to the keyboard? xphyle Swiftkey for the Win. Samson In German no sign of improvement so far. F4LL0U7 That's really great, but they still haven't fixed the bug where you can't open the emoji gallery when using a physical bluetooth keyboard. ChrisHigs Most of the time i find it pretty good, but occasionally *is* it's frustrating. Sometimes it won't suggest the word I want when I am *doing* swiping directly over the letters of the word but suggests *stone* some other *weird* word. Like cos. No chips. No I want chips. Grr. Cos. No again. Cos cos cos cos cos cos. What I was trying to type was "chops" but it won't let me. Surrey Street Surrey Surrey Street Surrey. Why won't it recognise "suet". Flip, grr, flip, no, flop *send* seems another tricky *I've* one. I'm not going over the i but it suggests flip instead of flop half the time. This is all *speed* swiped on gboard and the asterisks are incorrect suggestions it made. bekifft Type them out, and drag the incorrect suggestions to the trash can. It should learn. The more you accept the incorrect corrections the more it will reinforce them. May want to clear all learned words and start over. ChrisHigs Thanks. I didn't know you could drag suggestions to delete them. I've just been playing with swiping some of those words again and making sure it's using the correct one and it's definitely behaving better. Like chop. I can now swipe chop and chip without it being confused. And flop. Flop flop flop. And flip. Yup. Handling them better now. Shame there's no way to manually type in a correction or see a longer list of words. bekifft You can't explicitly correct a particular word as far as I can tell, but if you remove the auto suggestion it is supposed to learn intelligently. I guess this is the future, we have to teach the machines like children and hope they grow up to be good. Martin Now if only Gboard could understand that when I type "har" ("have" in Swedish), I don't mean "här" or "hår" ("here" and "hair", respectively). Had I been using an English keyboard layout it would have been understandable, but with a Swedish layout Å and Ä are separate keys on the opposite side of the keyboard, meaning that I really, really didn't go anywhere near those letters. SwiftKey had the same problem, but fixed it many years ago. MHS I'm Danish, and with Swiftkey you can even change layout of the English keyboard to the same as Danish (or Swedish in your case). That way there's no language switching at all. Kevin I'd consider gboard among the worst for autocorrect. Example: I type "if I spell" googles three auto corrects from left to right is spell, spelling and spelled. When is "if I spelling" ever right? And why is that center? Swiftkey however, from left to right; spelled, spell, and spell it. All improved and in an order that makes the most sense. xyz And a Happy Holi to you too, machine. D.Smithee I like Gboard--I really do. But it's got too many niggling problems for me to leave Swiftkey. Like not putting a space after a comma or period.

A Googler who interned at Facebook and Apple shares her 4 best tips for landing your dream job in tech Tanza Loudenback May 26, 2017, 3:38 PM 5,953 facebook linkedin twitter email print Getting rejected isn't the end of the road — it wasn't for this engineer.Facebook/Life at Google Intense competition and notoriously challenging interview questions prove it's no easy feat landing your dream job in tech. Each year Lea Coligado was in school at Stanford, she applied to more than 20 software engineering or web development internships, including at Snapchat, Facebook, Apple, Pinterest, Microsoft, Palantir, Yelp, WhatsApp, and her dream company, Google. "Since I was a freshman, the thought of working at Google was always a dream," Coligado, 23, tells Business Insider. "It symbolized all the greatness that can come out of a Stanford education, and it seemed like everyone around me was either trying to work at Google or start the next one." But Google rejected Coligado's internship applications two years in a row. Instead, she went on rack up tons of interviewing experience with dozens of other tech companies and complete internships at Facebook and Apple. By the time she was a senior, Google reached out to Coligado for an interview, this time for a full-time software engineer position. She was hired and began working there in the fall of 2016. Coligado says that finally getting her foot in the door at Google "implied a certain understanding that No. 1, interviews are not a fault-proof system for discerning a candidate's ability — and sometimes even Google weeds out false negatives — and No. 2, that a candidate can learn and grow a lot from year to year." Below, check out Coligado's four best tips for finally landing that dream tech job or internship: View As: One Page Slides 1. Practice the interview WOCinTech Chat/Flickr This is always sound advice no matter what industry you're in. But for engineering jobs in particular, the technical interview, where you'll be asked to show off your coding skills, can be especially difficult. "Ask a peer to play 'interviewer' for an hour so you can practice whiteboarding algorithms in front of another person. Research projects at the company you're applying for and be prepared to talk about them with an interviewer," Coligado says. 2. Ask for help University of Exeter/Flickr Don't glean all your information about a position from the job posting — use your resources. "Even if you don't know anyone at the company you're applying to, find a recruiter's email online and ask for application tips or a tour of campus," Coligado says. In other words: network. "As a candidate you are entitled to have your questions answered, and you'd be surprised how many people are willing to help you," she says. "I once asked an engineer I didn't know to give me a tour of Twitter, and they did it. I didn't even have a Twitter account." 3. Don't obsess over things out of your control Sergey Tatarintsev/Strelka Institute/Flickr "Externalize the things that are out of your control," says Coligado. Specifically, how you may be treated in the interview process based on your race, gender, or ethnicity.  "While I was at Stanford, I heard everything from friends being referred to by the wrong pronoun after correcting their interviewer multiple times to having interviewers pay inordinate amounts of attention to their clothing (usually dresses)," Coligado says. "So if you feel like you're being evaluated for anything besides your ability to code and work with a team, the problem probably isn't yours. Remember that," she says. 4. Celebrate the small successes — and learn from the failures Sebastiaan ter Burg/Flickr On the other hand, Coligado says, "do internalize your successes and little victories, which you are in control of." If you had a good interview, celebrate it. If you didn't, then evaluate your shortcomings and fix them for the next time. Get the latest Google stock price here.

Google Earth, the software program that allows users to virtually explore our planet through topographic maps, satellite imagery, and more, relaunched last month with a suite of new features including guided tours of buildings by Frank Gehry and Zaha Hadid. Teaming up with storytellers, scientists, and nonprofits from around the world, Google created “Voyager,” a showcase of interactive guided tours that take users from the mountains, islands, and jungles of the world courtesy of BBC Earth’s “Natural Treasures” to treks on the Galápagos Islands to discoveries of Machu Picchu. As part of Voyager, Google Earth has compiled a tour of six Hadid-designed structures including the MAXXI museum in Rome, the Contemporary Arts Center in Cincinnati, and the headquarters of Belgium’s Port Authority in Antwerp. Eight of Gehry’s buildings are also featured, and they include the Vitra Design Museum in Weil am Rhein, Germany, the Frederick R. Weisman Art Museum in Minneapolis, the Cinémathèque Française in Paris, and the Dancing House in Prague. Each map point comes with a brief description and the ability to view the structure in 3D or 2D (aerial). This view also provides crucial geographic and spacial context that allows virtual visitors to see the surrounding neighborhoods and cities in which the buildings stand. Other features include “Knowledge Cards” and the ability to experience a locale in 3D and see it from every angle. The relaunch comes just days before Earth Day and is available on the web in Chrome and on Android, rolling out soon.

Generally speaking, Android TV was not hugely on the agenda, but at the same time, it did make a big impression. This is because Google took the opportunity to announce that a new interface was coming to Android TV. This is an interface designed to work with Android O, and if you do own a Nexus Player and know how to install the developer preview of Android O, then you can actually check out the new interface now. We already did take a closer look at the new interface when it was first shown off at Google I/O, and also a more in-depth look with our own Nexus Player (in the video below), so most of what is to be expected, is already known. The interface is very different from what is currently available on Android TV, as it does look to bring more focus to specific content. Which is a good thing. Although, at the same time, the early impressions left from the new interface is that less content is initially available. That is, there is less content available on-screen, at any given time. For instance, to access your apps on the new interface, you now have to click through to a dedicated app slide-out menu. Not a big deal, but not as quick as it was before – when they were all in view, all the time. This inevitably means there is now a very clear focus on select apps. Which does pose one particular issue going forward, as developers will need to take advantage of the relevant APIs to ensure that their apps are also able to adopt and make use of the new layout. If not, then those apps might not be as easily as accessible as before. In fact, Google even released a new developer posting on this on Thursday, further introducing the new layout and presumably, looking to garner interest from the developer side. The post specifically highlights that the new interface is “content-centric” and “organizes video content into channels and programs in a way that’s familiar to TV viewers.” While on that surface that sounds great, is it? After all, while flipping through channels on a TV is “familiar to TV viewers,” it is arguably, not a great experience, and certainly not the best experience for a device that mainly adopts an app-based UI. Which is largely the point here. If you are to take away anything from Google I/O 2017 on Android TV, then the new layout itself, is not the thing to focus on. That is the red herring here. What is much more important to understand is that Google (and the Android TV team specifically) no longer view Android TV as an app-based entity. Instead, it seems Android TV is going to become much more of a channel-based product going forward. Something that is clearly apparent in the terminology now being used by Google and the Android TV team, as they no longer refer to Android TV apps as apps, but instead, “channels.” While it can be debated as to whether that is a good thing or not, what is clear is that the success of this approach will largely depend on whether developers take to the new interface or not. After all, once this interface and channel-centric approach does become much more readily available on third-party Android TV devices, it will be up to those Android TV ‘channel’ developers to create and maintain their apps as channels. Which seems like it could be a lot of work for developers of lesser-known apps. As it is already an issue getting standard Android apps ported over to Android TV. These apps therefore, could end up becoming more of a background feature on Android TV devices, with your mainstream HBO, DIRECTV, Netflix, and so on, taking more of a center stage. While none of this will matter in the grand scheme of things – as those same ‘background apps’ will still be accessible through the system, they will no longer naturally be able to command as much prime real estate on the leanback launcher as they once did – and certainly not as much as the big-name options will. If that is the case, then while this might be a ‘channel-centric’ approach, you might also find that it is becoming a little more provider-centric, and less user-centric. Something that the most skeptical of people could focus on in more detail if they wanted – providers = revenue. While that is all just food for thought for now, unfortunately, there was not much else Android TV-based on offer at this year’s event. Google did briefly touch on Google Assistant compatibility with Android TV, but that touching was brief, with no further or firm details provided on when it will actually become available. Much was the case with the developer posting that came through yesterday. With the announcement simply detailing that the Google Assistant is “coming later this year.” Post navigation Download: Google Maps v9.54 Has Code for Notification Channels Samsung DeX Now Available in Canada for $249 May 26, 2017 | Android News , Android TV News , Special Features Show Comments Hide Comments () Latest News Google Offering 4 Free Months Of Play Music Unlimited Phone Comparisons: Samsung Galaxy S8 Vs Galaxy S7 Edge Tech Talk: Nokia Has A Chance Of Returning To Former Glory Google Photos’ Self-Tagging Feature Is Live OnePlus Referral Program: Sell OnePlus Phones, Gain Points Deal: Save 20% on LIFX’s A19 Smart LED Bulbs – 5/26/17 Best VR Headsets – May 2017 Google AI Engineers Are Leading An Investment Offshoot Leak Suggests Nubia Z17 Will Have UFS 2.1 Storage Weekly Poll: What Was Your Favorite Reveal From Google I/O 2017?

The new group will be separate from Google parent-company Alphabet's existing venture arms, CapitalG and GV, according to Axios. The new investment initiative suggests a greater alignment with Google CEO Sundar Pichai's "AI first" strategy. Jordan Novet | @jordannovet 11 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Getty Images Google CEO Sundar Pichai Google has established a new organization to invest in artificial intelligence startups, according to a new report. The new effort shows Google taking its experience with venture capital and applying it to AI, a type of computing that it has been increasingly using across its applications. The new organization will be separate from Google parent company Alphabet's funding activity within GV (formerly Google Ventures) and CapitalG (formerly Google Capital), Axios reported on Friday. Google itself has also made venture investments on its own. Google chief executive Sundar Pichai in the past year has started positioning the company as being "AI first" as opposed to being "mobile first." Having an investment group focusing on that does make sense given that thesis. show chapters Google pushes further into virtual reality by building standalone VR headsets    Thursday, 18 May 2017 | 3:47 PM ET | 01:37 Google has dedicated AI research groups including DeepMind, whose AlphaGo AI Go player earlier this week beat the top human Go player, Ke Jie. Google uses AI in its search engine, Gmail, Google Maps, Google Photos, and Google Translate, among other things. Startups who take on funding from the new group can receive mentorship, as well as services and space to operate, Axios said. AI startups have many places to go to for money, including other corporate venture arms and institutional venture capital firms. But having backing from the new group could provide a particular mark of legitimacy at a time when so many startups today claim to be using AI. Google declined to comment.

Then, in 2014 it added the ability to constantly scan apps to watch for malicious behavior. You were sort of taking Google at its word as a user that Verify Apps was indeed rummaging around to keep tabs on things. Now you can see some of what it's doing—the settings menu now shows which apps have recently been scanned. The Verify Apps menu is buried quite deep. It won't even appear when searching the settings. You'll find it under Google > Security > Verify Apps. That last jump wasn't available before. There were only a few settings toggles for Verify Apps, and they were in the main Google security menu. Now, there's a section at the top with four app icons of the apps most recently scanned, along with the time the last scan was completed. This seems to have popped up in the last few weeks via an update to Google Play Services. I've confirmed that a phone with a 10.0.x build did not have the updated menu, and a phone running v10.2.x did have it. This appears to only be a cosmetic tweak. The icons are not interactive and no additional information is provided. It's just a little extra peace of mind. Thanks: Alexander Blur Tags Google play services security verify apps subscribe ...

There were only a few settings toggles for Verify Apps, and they were in the main Google security menu." I can't understand why that whole sub menu is not part of the main security section in setting. Lateef Alabi-Oki Because Verify Apps is part of Google Play Services, not Android. Peter Smart Lock is also from Google Play Services but that's included in the main Security settings. I think Verify Apps in it's previous incarnation was included in the main security settings back in KitKat era. Lateef Alabi-Oki Good point. MJ Ummmm Google Play services is part of Android. All security setting in one spot and not hidden makes sense to me. Lateef Alabi-Oki Google Play Services is not part of Android. Although, I do agree that security settings should be found in one place. MJ I can't believe two people upvoted your totally wrong statement. A phone OEM can't even say their phone has Android on it without passing the CTS and being a GMS partner (aka license it from Google) which part of that is installing the Google Play services. No one is running AOSP on their phone. LOL Please let me know what legit Android phone OEM doesn't ship phones with Google Play services? Lateef Alabi-Oki Huawei, Xiaomi and a horde of Chinese, Indian and Russian OEMs ship Android phones without GPS. Saying Google Play Services is part of Android is like saying Gmail, or Google Maps, or Google Chrome is part of Android. Because an app or service ships with most Android devices doesn't make it part of Android. There's a real and technical demarcation between Android APIs and Google specific APIs. Google Play Services falls under Google specific APIs. MJ Thanks, no one cares about Chinese phone sold in China. LOL Google Play services is an app like Gmail. What? I guess you still understand difference between Android the OS distribution that comes on your phone and AOSP (which nobody runs). Who knew Fire tablets ran Android. Thanks for your input... Lateef Alabi-Oki This is not about "winning" arguments. There's no argument to be had. There are facts, and then there are alternatives facts. The fact of the matter is that Google services and apps are not part of Android. Also on Android, an app is basically a service that has a UI. So the difference between a service like Google Play Services and an app like Gmail is conspicuously superficial. MJ I agree this is no argument because what you are saying is incorrect. Again, Google decides what can be called Android...not you or me. Period. End of story. Lateef Alabi-Oki My Nexus 7 2013 is running LineageOS, the 3rd party Android ROM formerly known as CyanogenMod. I haven't flashed Gapps on it. So no Google Play Services or Google Play Store. Are you saying that device is not running Android? Because when I go to the about section of the device, it clearly tells me it's running Android Nougat. So pray tell me what this device is running if it's not Android? MJ They don't charge money for that huh? LOL Yes, they can't include Gapps or Play services with it because they don't have a license with Google. Please try to produce a phone or a custom ROM that you charge for and call it Android then try to sell that in the US. Amazon can't even do that... LineageOS is an OS based on AOSP but it's NOT Android which is an brand. This is why I say Play Services is part of Android because it is required if you want to call it Android. Lateef Alabi-Oki A device that passes the Android Compatibility Test Suite can be called Android. I don't know where you get the idea that a device that doesn't include Gapps or Play Services cannot be called Android. And no, Play Services is not part of Android. Here's a link to the official Android architecture. Please point me to where you see Play Services. https://source.android.com/devices/index.html Here's a link with the requirements to pass the Android Compatibility Test Suite. Once again, please point me to where Play Services is a requirement to build or sell Android devices with or without the Android brand. https://source.android.com/compatibility/index.html Here's a link about GMS licensing. Note where it says GMS, which includes Play Services, is not part of Android and only runs on top of Android. I'll bold that for you. After building an Android compatible device, consider licensing Google Mobile Services (GMS), Google’s proprietary suite of apps (Google Play, YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail, and more ) that run on top of Android. GMS is not part of the Android Open Source Project and is available only through a license with Google. For information on how to request a GMS license, see Contact Us. https://source.android.com/compatibility/index.html#licensing-gms MJ I never said Google Play services is part of AOSP and I have said the opposite. LOL Again, I have talking about Android the BRAND. I know AOSP exists but no phone runs that. The only reply I am interested is the answer to this question --> What phone can I buy in the US that doesn't have Google Play services installed? Thanks again for your input... Lateef Alabi-Oki Again, the criteria for labelling a devices as an Android device has nothing to do with Google Play Services or geographic location. Even Google says Google Play Services is not part of Android. As I've linked numerous times from Google and Android official sites, you can brand your device as Android as long as it passes the CTS. As for Android devices that don't have Play Services in the US, Amazon and Ebay are rife with them. I bought a Xiaomi device without Google Play Services on Ebay a few years ago. It was advertised and branded as an Android (TM) device. Lateef Alabi-Oki In addition to my above response, even more proof that Google Play Services and the Google Apps are not part of Android. How can I get access to the Google apps for Android, such as Maps? The Google apps for Android, such as YouTube, Google Maps, Gmail, and more, are Google properties that are not part of Android and are licensed separately. Contact [email protected] for inquiries related to those apps. https://source.android.com/source/faqs.html Andy Roid MJ just got blown the f out JD Because fuck consistency and common sense, it's the Google way that's why. Sruly J I like the improvement which Google has made to how security works. I took an old phone and tried installing an APK infected by ransomware. Right away it for picked up by Verify Apps. Peter Please can you post a screenshot of what happens when Verify Apps does it's thing. Sruly J I'll try later. Gotta find the APK again. Peter Thanks. Sruly J @Paul_Werner:disqus @disqus_Jj8ZZd6BPC:disqus Verify Apps blocks APK installation completely for dangerous apps. In this case, it blocked the installation of ransomware. I turned Verify Apps off, and app installation worked. When/if I get an alert later about the app, I'll post it here. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d72838119f33f71993c32d9a48055d77b75ff7512b196b70a09a15e2b00d45e9.jpg Sruly J @Paul_Werner:disqus @disqus_Jj8ZZd6BPC:disqus I changed the time on the phone to initiate scanning, then changed it back.

I'd say I'm disappointed that it took a while, but then again, not having scanning running continuously may be appreciated by some.

I don't think APKMirror will accept it. ;) Shockingly though, it's really easy to find. 1 apk site removed it, a different one still has it available. Artem Russakovskii Yeah, we definitely won't.

SMS support for Hangouts officially ends today, excluding Google Voice and Project Fi subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/22 2:29pm PDTMay 22, 2017 99 Plus 1 on G+ 289 Share on Facebook 105 Share on Twitter Total Shares493 Applications Google News Videos Today is the day that Hangouts finally loses SMS support. We were warned by Google about it months ago when Hangouts started showing a warning that it would no longer support the feature. But, as of today, it's finally set to happen. For anyone who isn't on Project Fi or Google Voice — both of which will continue to support SMS in Hangouts — this is the end of an era. Many people, myself included, made the final push into Hangouts over other services when SMS support was added. The integrated conversations made it much easier to keep short communications together in one place. So far there's no word on if SMS support will be coming to Allo. Now that Hangouts support for SMS is finally over, we aren't really left with a clear migration method. Anyone that might have made use of it will have to either deal with using two separate apps again or move over to a new service. If you are looking for recommendations, Google's stock Android Messages isn't so bad. But, if you've been enjoying having SMS and chats merged, that isn't really a solution. Allo is always an option. But, that's the same issue from the other side, you'd still need to find a way to send SMS messages. There's always Facebook Messenger or Signal, which both provide a combined SMS and chat solution. Each has its disadvantages, though.  The latter doesn't have quite the same feature set that Hangouts did, and the former is a Facebook product. Either way, it's closing time. You might have just enough left to send one last SMS before the lights are shut off. If you still plan on using Hangouts for chats going forward, make sure you've updated to the latest version of over at Google Play or APKMirror. Download QR-Code Hangouts Developer: Google Inc.

Undone in naught but a few years, with this final limb being ripped from the body. But I guess I'm on Project Fi, so I'm good for now. My parents weren't happy about this news, since our family communicates primarily on large Hangouts threads. mxwp but if they are using actual Hangouts IM threads and not SMS they can still use Hangouts Shannon Butler Home-based mummy Kelly Richards from New York after quitting from her fulltime occupation has able to make from $26000 to $28000 on a monthly basis from freelancing in the house... This is just one way she successfully done it >>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now humulos For sure, and they still do. They just don't like having to use multiple apps for messaging. Adrien Aubel IMHO those big plans haven't been followed by strict coding/design rules, and Hangouts became progressively a technical mess, then a true nightmare for anybody to work on, with the UI becoming slower with each version, fortunately partly compensated by faster phones. To be fair, SMS/MMS can be very complicated to deal with, and Android development was much harder and potentially messy when Babel has been developed, the technologies available nowadays would have helped a lot. So down the road it would have been neither productive or future-proof to keep iterating all efforts inside Hangouts, at least without a total recode from the ground up. Right now I wonder if they will indeed clean the code up to remove all carrier SMS/MMS, and eventually speed up the app and make it smaller, or just roughly disable it. t_newt If Hangouts became a technical mess, the solution isn't to drop Hangouts, it's to fix Hangouts. They could have made it a framework for their products that any of their messengers could be installed into. Instead they are trying to make it an enterprise Slack competitor. What company is going to trust their company to Google's leftovers? "SMS/MMS can be very complicated to deal with". Apparently this is true at Google. Duder12 They aren't getting the left overs. They are getting two brand new products. Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat. OhYeah! 2 products solving a problem that the last hangouts solved already in one app. Great pfmiller SMS can be complicated to deal with, but it's not dealt with by Hangouts. The OS handles SMS itself and then gives whichever SMS app you select access to the SMS message database. Adrien Aubel If you mean that the app doesn't have to interact directly with the radio, you're right. But the APIs provided for SMS/MMS by Google are nonetheless very tricky to integrate beautifully with. For example, the ContentProvider could be so much cleaner to interact with, and some OEMs like Samsung crash on non-simple queries. Another example is that most apps ship their own MMS logic, usually based on Google's own sources ( https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/services/Mms/+/master/ ), in case the carrier or OEM customized the system MMS logic and made it not work properly with apps other than their own, or if the system isn't configured correctly, and let the user the option to switch between this logic ("Legacy") and their system when it comes to send MMS. We could expect better from an OS serving 2B active users, but I'm glad it's at least open to 3rd party apps, unlike iOS. JG Personally, rather than spinning Allo off as its own new app, I would have preferred Google to treat it as the next major update to Hangouts. Have the team re-work the app from the ground up, streamlining the code, etc. If I'm not mistaking, around that time, Facebook and Shazam were launching their own reworked Lite app versions designed to use less bandwidth, storage and resources. Reworking Hangouts would have followed suite. Essentially, Google could have made their first Go ready app a year or so early. Hangouts already has a large username, and it has all of the features users have been asking for - cross device/platform and SMS support. And I don't think the is any issue with SMS being a challenge to implement as they have their own SMS app, Android Messages which send to work well enough to be the default app to push RCS. It shouldn't be too hard to fold it (and the Assistant) into Hangouts while streamlining it. My name is…. Nobody ever used Hangouts for SMS outside America. Actually, nobidy uses SMS no more. There DOES exist a world outside America, you know, and its much bigger!! sproc Haha, you wish. Everyone I know is stuck on sms. They try whatsapp and stuff then abandon it. Adrien Aubel Especially iOS users, who already have a great "Messages" app that outsmarts SMS when possible. For them it doesn't make too much sense to download another messaging app every now and then. Rodrigo Gomes da Silva So.. where are you from? Jay No you wish, but you must be in the states. No one i know uses SMS anymore. It's an archaic dead service, only used for bank transaction notifications and amazon deliveries. Everyone else is either on whatsapp (yes 220 million of us in this country and growing at 4 million a month) or (wechat which is like what 85-90 percent of China) No one cares for SMS. xyz And where do you live? America. We already know. TheDrunkenClam What an unnecessarily smug and nagging comment. Winston Well it's true, even if it's smug. Outside the US, SMS is pretty much dead as we've all moved towards WhatsApp, as carriers still don't give unlimited texts by default. I think it's time to start asking another company for SMS integration. Christopher Gannon That would work if so many people in the US weren't using iMessage, where the only way a non-apple user can chat is via SMS. Then apple makes it very difficult NOT to use it, so good luck convincing your friends to give up siri, etc. I'd also like a solution, like hangouts or iMessage, where messages aren't restricted to a phone, and I can seamlessly use both on my laptop, tablet or phone.

I live in us and everyone uses sms, so that's what I use. What everyone else uses is moot. Michael Sørensen Nonsense. I'm not in the US (Europe) and the VAST majority in my country still use SMS. Alejandro And how do you send voice clips through SMS? Good luck with that runamonk Why the fuck are you sending voice clips? Just call them for fucks sake lol. Jesus you kids these days. IT'S A PHONE. Adrien Aubel At invi we observed that a significant amount of our users rely heavily on push to talk and voice typing. We want to improve it so that when you pick up the phone and put it on your ear it plays any unread message to make it more lightweight, as well as an auto-transcribe, but it's already pretty useful when you and your contact are used to it. When you're biking, on your way to the office, cooking, cute messages to your SO, ideas (that you can send to yourself as well), ... You can let your recipient get to your message whenever (s)he wants rather than requiring his/her availability right here and then. That being said, we'll bring soon WebRTC video calls / possible Duo integration to get face-to-face in one tap, and we expect this to indeed take over and reduce the microphone features usage. nigra truo Hahaha, you look silly defending a deficiency, voice memos are super useful, especially when driving or if somebodie's on a call. Used by many not stuck on sms. runamonk I'm not defending anything, sms is old and very long in the tooth. It should have been removed years ago. Andrew MMS handles voice clips just fine in my experience. dblock Easy, if your SMS app supports this (mine does), you can send voice clips as an attachment like any other MMS message. nigra truo Wow, the man is still using the archaic technology that is mms. Hahaha! I have not sent one like that since 2011, when i discovered whatsapp. Adrien Aubel I don't know if that's exactly what you meant, but on invi ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi ) you have push to talk, voice typing, and ability to share audio externally from any app (depending on the format and your carrier we may host it ourselves and send a link FYI). It's not just yet open outside of USA but I can eventually give you an APK if you can't wait to try it out, lmk! Tomáš Petrík Free for everyone, you say? Not here... And yes, I am in the EU. nigra truo Sms is over in europe, don't know where you are from, but you might want to be less backward and start using whatsapp like a billion other people, sms is archaic and it Can't do so many things that whatsapp can, which is already the defacto international IM standard, even on iphones, as it supports all the platforms. Michael Sørensen Scandinavia. And no one uses WhatsApp. Maybe backwards, but it works, and I still haven't seen a compelling argument for changing... Josh Brown outside america and use it everyday. Jason Hirsch I was very annoyed at having to add Hangouts as my SMS client. I couldn't keep separate separate anymore. Now in combination with Fi, GV, 2 phones and obi it's a nightmare. On this overseas trip i couldn't force Fi to dial via WiFi. So i had to go back and install Hangouts dialer. If they (Google) have a master plan there's no rhyme or reason to it. Nick I'm not sure what the future holds for us Fi users, but it's looking grim. My family and work is in the same boat it seems. I have been promoting Hangouts for a long time since it could handle everything I needed plus some, now as our services split out communications start to waver... All I can hope for now is they at least follow through with their promises to allo and add desktop support. (Status: Soon ™) atc-tech Google Voice users should still be able to use it too, I think? I don't know. I switched the the updated GV app when it came out around the same time the hangouts DEintegration was announced, so I'm not sure, but I think Voice users still can... Aaron Berlin Who knows what the plan is long-term for GVoice in Hangouts, but the actual GVoice app is actually good now. No equivalent to the chrome extension/desktop app, though. Ryne Hager You are right, Google Voice users can also continue to receive SMS messages in the app, I'll make that more clear. atc-tech Cool. I wasn't sure GV still could, but I thought I remembered hearing that we could. I gave up already though and use the prettier new GV app... Wish they would add back more features though. Ryne Hager The new app is so pretty. I do wish my GV voicemails would show up in my call logs again, though. atc-tech Yes! Along with the options for do not disturb mode. mxwp i exclusively use my GVoice number for calls and texts and use it on Hangouts. the update GVoice app has an annoying bug in that it tries to connect every account on your phone instead of just your main one. i have submitted it as a bug but have not heard anything back Tom Harman So when does Allo officially get SMS support, lol. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Same time it gets tablet support: Never. rndusrnm479461 Am I the only one who doesn't understand what's so good about SMS integration in either Allo or Hangouts? Is it really hard for you people to use 2 apps? Jesus christ. Google's "Android Messages" is lightweight anyway, why is it such a problem to use it? It shouldn't even eat much RAM. Kyle Gospodnetich Yes, yes you are. Please never work for Google, or really any company that has a hand in communications. My name is…. No, he is not Kyle Gospodnetich Congrats, now there's two of you idiots. iluvthesoftsoft One do-it-all app > two apps Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi, https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi, we're trying to fix texting on Android and provide transparent switch between SMS&IM (devices handshake when you get into chats so that we determine whether you or the recipient has poor reception and should prefer SMS for example). MJ Two apps? One app for SMS and than Facebook, WhatsApp, Allo/Hangouts, and whatever to cover all my contacts. SMS is the only thing I can message 100% of my contacts with. Adrien Aubel Google's messaging strategy is now: - Android Messages for carriers & OEMs - meaning strictly SMS/RCS - Allo for their new consumer messaging service, and the focus of their upcoming work - Hangouts for business/enterprise They can't risk to upset carrier and OEMs by implementing non-carrier features in Android Messages / the default SMS app they provide. Or at least it's a risk they're not ready to take at that time. Btw I wouldn't say "Android Messages" is that lightweight btw, notably on modern devices it could be so much smoother :( sam1331 I don't get it either. When Android Messages came out I switched my SMS over to it. I quickly realized I was using it almost exclusively for 2 factor verification codes. But really, the notifications all go to the same place, I already have to decide whether to use Hangouts or Facebook Messenger when talking to basically anyone anyway. I also think people should push a little harder to move conversations over from SMS to something else, I've never found that to be very difficult. mxwp SMS is convenient because you know it will work with any American with a cell phone... including "dumb" flip phones. And it actually is really difficult to get people to switch to another service. Apple users just use imessage to send their SMS to me. And then I send them my glorious green bubbles and those ishills can suck it. YaKillaCJ Sms integration is important because it is supported by 100% of telecommunications service providers and integrated on all devices that can make a phone call and has a screen. You can even sms a home phone without a screen depending on carrier/service provider. Thus it messaging that works with 100% of your contacts. Having multiple Apps spread across 100s of contacts is plain annoying. So if any App wants to be taken serious, it needs to be serious and have sms. What's App already fills the void for bypassing sms across the globe. rndusrnm479461 This answer makes the most sense. Thanks. Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi! play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi We're still new and young but we're very serious about our ambitions and not settling when we know it could/should be better. To fix texting on Android, we provide transparent switch between SMS&IM (devices handshake when you get into chats so that we determine whether you or the recipient has poor reception and should prefer SMS for example). Very handy in some countries/areas/events. And lets you reach *anybody* (that has a phone number). My name is…. Nobody uses SMS no more, and if i wanna send a text message to the last of the Mohicans, i will use my SMS app. I dont want no stupid integration and no stupid 'SMS fallback' that will make things worse. Chatting is not texting. YaKillaCJ There are only 2 widely used methods of messaging across mobile devices. Sms and What's App. Sms is supported on EVERY device from 2 way pagers and flip phones to house phones and smartphones. Any device that has a phone number supports sms. The majority of people doesn't care about added features like stickers and gif. We just care that all I need is the person phone number and from there I can call or text them. That's it. Bottom line is that it has to be a standard adopted by carriers on a worldwide scale. Hence what's app reason for such large scale use is it uses existing phone numbers for login, existing phone book for contact list, free, minimum data usage and encrypted. Even that is still not even used by a third of the devices that use sms. Ryuuie Last I checked, WhatsApp charged $1 or someshit. erptastic It has not done that officially for years. And even before that, they always just extended my account. Ryuuie Ah. Looks like it was recent and official as of last January but they dropped it. It was an annual $1 fee to use the app. disqus_Xz3y8OiO3O It's free YaKillaCJ Who actually pays that. I don't recall anyone ever paying. Besides, it's only $1 a year and that significantly cheaper than carriers who don't have unlimited sms charge. nigra truo The majority of people don't care about features? Go check the market share of whatsapp, you are misinformed. The majority does care and only hillbillies still use flip phones. ;-) YaKillaCJ Features are nice but seamless compatibility is more important. Btw last I recall, less than half of mobile phones in use are smartphones worldwide. Using What's App doesn't allow me to message 100% of my contacts, SMS does. Bottomline. nigra truo Sms has endless limitations that is making it useless compated to something as full featured as whatsapp, i found it easier to convince my backwards US friends to use whatsapp, as this will be the universal standard anyway, 1 billion users gives you a hint. YaKillaCJ I do agree that the standard needs to move forward. What I'm saying is that it would have to be a standard adopted by carriers & service providers worldwide. Until then, any App that wants to be taken serious and get use needs to fall back on the current standard. What's App billion users is small compared to the billions in use that support SMS. USA alone has 500million numbers that support sms and that just 1 country. mxwp in the larger scheme of things, I agree with you that it is not a big deal. still, having one app do both was convenient. the other complaint is Android fanboys being envious of iMessage, which Hangouts could have become. exadeci The main reason that people use Imessage is that you get rich messaging capabilities out of the box if the person you are talking to has an Iphone everything is abstracted, you add someone's number and you start chatting right aways no need to exchange accounts id's or find which app you both use. And if the other doesn't have an Iphone you can still message them or if you killed your data plan it sends an sms. But Google doesn't add sms support because they are pushing for RCS which is a GOOD thing: Standalone Messaging 1-to-1 Chat Group Chat File Transfer Content Sharing Social Presence Information IP Voice call Best Effort Video call Geolocation Exchange Audio Messaging Network based blacklist Capability Exchange based on Presence or SIP OPTIONS All this WITHOUT using any data, data needs an link to be established this doesn't. Chris Hannan It's not hard for most of us to use it. The problem is the people we contact don't want to use separate apps. Everyone with iPhones uses iMessage because it just works by default. But barely anybody I know uses Hangouts and nobody I know uses Allo. If it was all built into one app that shipped with Android phones, more people would use it. Troy Leonard and I removed Hangouts as of today I will no longer consider using any google messaging service ever again Sruly J Isn't Gmail a form of messaging? (Or do you not use Gmail?) Troy Leonard Not for long I'm transitioning over to outlook.com. And upgrading my phone to an iPhone. I'm sick of slow to no updates on my phone,and done with Google ruining everything I ever liked about their apps and Android. naysayer Good riddance. Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi), a new app that we're making that brings a lot of the goodies iMessage brings to iOS users, with big long-term ambitions, and still trying to preserve a consistent and sleek UI. Hopefully that will make you stick to Android and you'll make your iPhone friends jealous in a few months/years ;) Zsolt V Why bother evangilizing? He already decided Outlook on an iPhone is better than Gmail, so let him enjoy it. Troy Leonard Your link is broken Adrien Aubel Fixed thanks! Disqus didn't like the closing ')' at the end of the link. XgudwilX eww outloook😲 Total Insecurity Saying "upgrading my phone to an iPhone" is the same as converting from atheism to any religion. Just a downgrade. bekifft It's true, and their failings and obvious ulterior motives in messaging have, for the first time in a decade, made me consider moving my email back to a private service over which I have control. Roy Thank you and have a nice flight. -Matoro Zeliph- Just want to make sure I'm not missing anything. So Google Voice SMS will no longer work too? Corbin Davenport That will still work as well. Ryne Hager Google voice will still work, just like Fi. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ It's primarily that regular SMS will no longer function in the app. A while back they killed of threading of SMS/MMS and Hangout messages, and now they are killing SMS/MMS entirely out of the app and suggestin people to switch to Android Messages. -Matoro Zeliph- Ok cool! I'm good then. Thanks for the clarification everyone Bill Blandford Hangouts SMS looks like it still works for Google Voice SMS too. Essentially, this is like Fi, which is a Google Voice number at heart. My wifi-only-device kids use Hangouts to call and text with a Google Voice #. Timmy Turner Yeah GV will continue to work through Hangouts since the number you use via Project-Fi is a GV given number. Adrien Aubel For people that were still using Hangouts and want to try a new app that also does SMS & IM, that tries to provide a fast & polished experience to fix texting on Android, I'd love some honest feedback! https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi We're trying hard to "make it right" and have so much planned on the roadmap, so any feedback is great to have to tweak things up. Let us know what you think! exadeci While the initiative is nice, why would we use your messaging app? If I want an instant message app that does sms and that no one else uses I already got Signal and at least Signal is proven to be secure. What makes Messenger (Facebook), WhatsApp and Imessage good? Their userbase. Ask anyone for a way to communicate and they will use one of those apps, no need for fallback sms when everyone has an account. Adrien Aubel Thanks for your feedback @exadeci:disqus! Great questions :) And Signal is nice as well! It's not for everybody but if you're happy with it keep using it but make sure to check us out in a few months to check that you haven't been missing out, we're going fast! I think there's much more to iMessage that makes it good than their userbase. It is a polished app that just works, and lets you reach anybody, therefore becoming your trusted "go to" texting app. We expect Google to release this summer new capabilities that will let you use IM in more scenarios. Very interesting stuff that we can't wait to let our users benefit from. But our initial target is actually SMS users, people that unlike you and I don't really care about the details, they just want a reliable app that sends and receive their messages. And they're actually quite happy with SMS/MMS in that regard, it just works (when you don't fight with APNs, something we try to prevent as well). We want to transparently "upgrade" those users that may be using Android Messages or a 3rd party app custom-made for the carrier or OEM, not necessarily developed with great care and polishment, and sometimes truly terrible (really, you wouldn't believe what's on some popular carriers, that most users end up using 10 times a day for years). Right now invi is mostly upgrading the transport of your messages and general experience as we develop another big focus of ours: bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages exchanged being plain text. Texting can be the most impersonal way of communication and this flattens relationships. A bar suggests as you type relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps you transmit how you truly felt when writing this message, it doesn't flatten as much your emotions (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). It always send instantly over IM as well (no upload or anything like that, optimized WebP images for super-fast download). Open your top 3 chats on Signal, chats that you have with people you care the most about, look at all this flat plain texting, and try to visualize the gap compared to what it could be, how it could have been more personal and transmitting more of your feelings or emotions. We're targeting this gap, and again, we're just getting started but have serious ambitions and motivation. If you use Snapchat, look at all that rich media that gets thrown to your eyes or that you throw to people, that doesn't always make sense and is often disconnected from conversations, sometimes losing its value and feeling like you just threw a bottle in the ocean, just leaving you with a list of who saw it. We're looking at that gap as well, as invi becomes more and more rich in terms of content creation. After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. We are in talks with some OEMs and resellers to make invi default which would help grow invi's user base and help us improve our product with more diverse usage, while some upcoming features of invi should ultimately help us get a lot more users naturally. exadeci Signal has actually Gifs from Giphy, stickers and the possibility to send a location but I don't use this kind of feature even on Messenger it's quite rare that I send a sticker. Google is strongly pushing for RCS adoption which would add all these emotions sharing: https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Rogers_Google_RCS.gif https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Telenor_6P_GIF_0UHHQdI.gif https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/RCS_Android_Update.width-600.png Adrien Aubel Exactly, but how relevant is Giphy? Again don't compare with things you've seen so far but with what it could potentially be if it truly understood your relationships and intentions, if it combined that with your taste and the way you usually communicate with this specific person. And what if your friends or other people were able to add their own media and stickers through channels and then be discovered, liked and followed, with deep intelligence powering it all and bringing the right content to the right user? We built invi to support all this, we don't just use a Giphy API, we used the most advanced and lightweight technologies to communicate in realtime with our backend, even on pretty bad 3G, from where we curate the media that eventually gets recommended to you. The screenshots you attached look great as well, but see Android Messages is a good example there's only 5 packs of stickers that won't get more relevant or smarter no matter how many stickers you use or how many times you use Android Messages. Idk who would use a given sticker hundreds of times, but anyway I'm not sure those were really representative of how Android Messages is most commonly used. The features are technically there, as often, but they're very limited in their potential as of now. The Awesome Bar isn't for everyone but can eventually help people like you, as images just get displayed while you're typing, no action required, and if you see one that you like you can just tap it to see how it looks and enrich your message, send and you're done. Google is pushing RCS, very true! And we're excited about the great work the Jibe team did in the past couple years. They're a bit shy to share their RCS client implementation at the moment, it may be unstable or not well documented at the moment, but we're meeting regularly with Google and hope to add RCS to our transparent switch as soon as possible, even though the user base is a bit limited at the moment it has the potential to grow fast and solve many issues. If they're reluctant for too long we may use other hubs that would communicate seamlessly through Unified Profile. But for now, we're watching the number of users actually benefiting from RCS grow while we focus on other areas of improvements. sam1331 I am actually kind of optimistic about all this, more so than I was maybe a year ago. They've been putting out a steady stream or improvements to Allo, and when I've experimented with it with a friend it actually is an enjoyable experience. Releasing it without a web app is just shocking, but if that's added and it works well, I could totally see moving over to it from Hangouts, where I do the vast majority of my communicating. The other piece of the puzzle is Duo. If they can integrate a Duo button in Allo conversations (like it seems they will), and they eventually add group calling, which can't be that far off, then I think it will be a nice solution for myself and my family. And I've got quite a few friends that are all about Android instead of iOS, so I can see them switching to Allo from Hangouts. But not until there is a web app, because they aren't stupid. Chad Knasinski I would use Allo if they added SMS support and a desktop version like Hangouts had. Nick.Trite Same here. I have Fi so I'll continue to use Hangouts for SMS. I really love the fact that I can switch seamlessly from desktop to mobile and still be sending SMS. Until Allo does that, I won't consider moving. Chad Knasinski Ditto Sir_Brizz And multi-device support. Can't even use it or sync it on my LTE Tablet... Carson Saldanha So, basically Hangouts but revamped? We've come in full-circle. Sir_Brizz Sure. The problem is that every other chat platform has these features in 2016. Including Hangouts. Roy Me to, love it. mxwp unless they remove hangouts from gmail, people will still secretly be using "hangouts" all the time. in fact, the only way Allo will ever take off without SMS is if it replaces Hangouts (gtalk) on gmail and inbox. Chad Knasinski So correct me if I am wrong here but Google wants us to do this with our messages: SMS - Google Messenger Business SMS - Hangouts Messages - Allo Facebook - Messenger Video Chat - Duo Business Video Chat - Hangouts Video Really? Are you kidding me here? Timmy Turner You've got it right and if there's a joke, you'll being waiting a while for the punchline. disqus_em5YfkbWdk What Business SMS and how is 8t different from other SMS? Zsolt V What does Facebook have to do with anything you wrote? So you are corrected. SpadeX Are you new to tech world? John Not exactly. SMS - Messenger SMS (Project Fi and Voice) - Hangouts SMS (Voice) - Voice Chat - Allo Chat - Hangouts Video chat - Duo Video chat - Hangouts Voice call - Hangouts Voice call (Voice) - Voice Nicholas Conrad Email - Gmail Business Email - G Suite SMS - Google Messenger Business SMS - Hangouts Messages - Allo Facebook - Google+ Video Chat - Duo Business Video Chat - Hangouts Meet Phone calls - Google Voice/Project Fi/Google Home FIFY xyz That's only for Google fanboys. Regular people ditched Google's messaging apps a long time ago. Timmy Turner I recommend Textra to anyone looking for a new SMS app. Sleek, customizable and continually updated/supported. Adrien Aubel Textra is very nice, notably customization-wise as you said, you can go deep and fine-tune basically any UX element. And it's super fast and lightweight as well. I am working as well on a new SMS app that also provides IM similarly to iMessage on iPhone, and many other features, most of them upcoming though. Would you mind giving me a honest feedback when you have the time? It's called invi on the Play Store https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi Timmy Turner Sure thing. freshprince_87 That invi SMS app is an awesome app. Near flawless app. but I stop using it because I kept having problems with MMS messages and also it just like Allo in the sense where if you uninstall the app and reinstall it on the same phone all your instant messages are all gone including some of the regular SMS /MMS messages. You need to make the app save all your messages on to an account like a Google account in the cloud. So that no matter what device you use the instant messages will still be there. Adrien Aubel @freshprince_87:disqus Thank you for your feedback! MMS can be very tricky and every carrier has its own set of specificities, I'm sorry about that, it shows we're still young but obviously like you said, such a core functionality bug makes our whole effort worthless for you here. Do you mind sharing your carrier, device model, and Android version? Did you try using "Legacy MMS" in the app settings? About the IM sync, that's an issue we're definitely looking into, considering all potential security and privacy issues, notably as some countries like USA recycle pretty aggressively your phone numbers, and with the desire to bring a Web client in mind. Google should announce this summer APIs that will eventually help us regarding security, so stay tuned :) freshprince_87 Thanks. I didn't use the legacy MMS. I hope that you add the IM sync soon. I'm on a T-Mobile service using the Moto Z Play on Android Nougat 7.0 Adrien Aubel Ok thank you, if you don't mind I have other questions to dive into your problem :) What specifically was failing? MMS sending, receiving, or both? Did it show an error? Is it only on group MMS or all MMS? Whatever information you may have will be helpful. Our next release should bring MMS reliability improvements and notably Wifi texting when supported by the carrier (first MMS may send up to 60s to send as we're trying out routes but then all other Wifi MMS should send very fast). Tom Westrick https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5ecvBaqHBk MJ Thank God I use Project Fi otherwise this would suck big time for me. TJ Mills Thank God I have Google voice.... Def Ref Actually, it sucks for Fi users who wish to economize on data because Hangouts no longer uses cellular SMS but requires a data connection, wifi or cell data. I didn't realize this was happening (because they said Fi wasn't going to be affected) until I got my replacement Nexus 6P and suddenly wasn't receiving SMS texts. They couldn't sort it out, even sending me a new SIM which didn't work either. It wasn't until I really started digging that I discovered that SMS required data to work and you'd either have to use a different SMS app (and lose multi-device sync; esp ability to type on computer thru Gmail) or turn on data. Lame. MJ OK... I am on WiFi most of the day myself but even with no WiFi it's still texting. Confused, you don't have data on Project Fi? Def Ref I keep my mobile data turned off unless I need traffic info for navigation or need to be in contact with someone via FB Messenger. Otherwise between home, work, Xfinity hotspots, etc., I'm usually not far from wifi. I don't care if I can't get my email for a half-hour while I'm driving. When you're paying per MB, you start noticing how much data apps guzzle. But last month I only used 85MB, so my next bill will be just over $24 with tax. Point is that before they killed SMS support, I didn't need to have data turned on to receive texts. Now I do. MJ I just don't see how you would guzzle data if usually on WiFi. I leave data on and use less than a GB a month. Granted, I don't check my email on my phone ever. LOL Dracono Love hangouts never used SMS. It also seems most negative reviews about it being slow was always tired to the SMS feature. I'm now curious with the removal of they'll us the opportunity to evolve or let it idle. mxwp it will evolve into a business app... but hopefully still available for consumers VAVAMk_2 Just give us SMS support in Allo for Christ's sake! Adrien Aubel SMS/MMS can be quite hard to deal with technically and Google didn't choose to go that way. It is possibly also due to the push they did to replace the default SMS app on many OEMs and carriers, strategically it's hard for them to push much of Google's agenda through the SMS app they give carriers, and they're mostly limited to SMS/RCS. Roy Christ will not give you SMS, bat Star of David could promise you RCS in Allo. mxwp Big G repeatedly stated it would never happen tim242 Liar. Adrien Aubel https://twitter.com/amitfulay/status/840236304130428928 Roy Great. It's was the plan all along. Now Allow will get RCS and web browser everything gonna integrate with Duo. I'm all the way in. I never like Hangout. I love Allo. #stop stop babies don't you cry. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I don't think that's possible. RCS is still mainly just an extension of SMS. If it doesn't support SMS, I don't see it handling RCS. Roy When RCS will come it will be with SMS already. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Based on what? Besnik Rrustemi No problem guys,we have like 69 other Messaging Apps by Google to choose from and maybe 2 new others coming soon. Roy Haha it's so old. Can someone can come with new jokes here? Besnik Rrustemi Well sorry Old Man then, never knew your age before. * Respect for Old People * Sir_Brizz Let the confusion officially begin! Indianajonze google can go fk themselves Robert Gerhart Why isn't anybody asking the bigger question: why the hell does anyone use outdated SMS in the first place? It's like complaining that Hangouts doesn't integrate butter churns and wagon wheels either. There is nothing more annoying than a text message. Adrien Aubel SMS is always nice to have in some situations, that happen more or less depending on where you live. Uncovered areas, concerts or big games, people having no LTE-enabled plans, or simply on some roads and highways. In USA for example all those scenarios happen a lot, notably in some states. And eventually, in most countries you still use SMS for 3rd party services, banks, transportation, or even government-related messages. Most importantly, in countries that still use SMS you can reach *anybody you know* from one app. And that's really a great thing to have. Now you're right, IM is so much more pleasant. Instant delivery, read status, last active time, way faster image format and transport. At invi ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi ) we try to take advantage of this and combine both the way it should be. When you open a chat with somebody, we trigger a handshake to check that both you and the recipient are well connected. If one of both doesn't answer on time, it simply switches to SMS/MMS, it's automatic and out of your way. Otherwise you take advantage of state-of-the-art transport with some unique optimizations. Try to send a GIF over IM and see how fast it goes, compared to MMS or even Whatsapp. Let me know what you think! Aaron Simple; SMS is ubiquitous. Every cellular device in operation can send and receive SMS, from the most current and expensive flagships like the iPhone and Galaxy, to the cheapest budget devices, all the way down to the oldest flip phones. I can text my dad on his flip, my wife on her Nexus or my Capt on his iPhone and each one will receive that message and reply. Show me an IM that can do all of that (that isn't on the iPhone). I guess that invi app that guy's been pedaling might, but I'm waiting for it to gain some traction before trying to convince anybody to switch to yet another IM. Rod The rest of the world uses Whatsapp, everyone has it installed. JG Even people with generic flip phones? Rod Nope, but I don't remember the last time I saw someone with a flip phone. The poor now bear Galaxy Win/Pocket/etc JG My aunt still has one. She recently attempted to upgrade to a smartphone but that seems to have failed big time... Apparently my telling her to tap the icon that's labeled "EMAIL" to get her email is too complicated... That and the free phone she got is a PoS... 512MB of RAM and only 4GB of storage - with the OS consuming all but like 100MB there of. So it didn't perform quite so hot. She seemed a bit surprised her free phone didn't perform as well as my Pixel XL does... Rod You're better off simply calling her. Lol JG Or even better off not getting in touch with her period. I also happened to see another flip phone in use while I was out traveling today. TJ Mills Everyone in China uses Wi chat. Rod I believe you meant WeChat. Yes, but WhatsApp still has the largest userbase. TJ Mills Yes, I did mean WeChat. I knew it looked wrong. My point is that not everyone is on WhatsApp in all places in the world. Where SMS is ubiquitous. Rod I have a friend that came from China, and he says most people in China uses WhatsApp as well. It's pretty omnipresent. Aaron And if everyone in the US would get on board with a single IM that would be great. But here iPhone users tend to stick with the stock Messages app. Great for sending iMessages between each other and SMS to the rest of us. Terrible for convincing them to switch to another IM. And most Android users I know use whatever stock SMS message app came with their phone for texting with iPhone users and old people and FB Messenger for IM with everyone in their friends list. So if you have a strategy for getting everyone on a single IM platform I'm sure the Allo team at Google would love to hear it. Jordan L I agree with your post. iphone users LOVE their stock messaging app, as they should it's the best app on their phone. It feels like, at least in my circle, iphone users have the stock messaging app, Facebook Messenger, and Whatsapp. "older" people only have the stock app as they can barely use their phones in the first place. "younger" people all three. Rod Yeah, I know how it works in USA. As a foreigner, it's funny to see how much you guys rely on SMS lol. Aaron Not funny haha but funny sad. :( Rod USA is a world apart. lomsha Believe it or not, even 2g is still a luxury in some countries, which makes​ instant messaging iffy. In those cases sms is a great alternative. Not everyone is in the 1st world with a sweet smartphone and reliable data access. TJ Mills Standard is better than better. When someone comes up with a universal replacement that works on all classes of phones, then the world can switch. Until then it's a mishmash of services and applications​to communicate. Why does everyone still use email? Because of the standards. Michael Sørensen Convince me why I shouldn't... Currently I can write to anyone for free without first asking them what their preferred platform is. And they can reply for free regardless of said preferred platform. Again, convince me why that's not good enough? And don't say "stickers". Just don't. Security? Bah, no sensitive information sent. Robert Gerhart Two words: phone call. Just freaking CALL them... You already have the phone in your hand, and you know they have one as well. If you can condense what you need to say into 144 characters, it probably isn't important enough to bother the other person with in the first place. No more retarded tap-tap-tap... Turb0wned That was a stupid answer. I'm not going to have 15 different messaging apps to be able to talk to people. iMessage just works with everyone. Adrien Aubel Agreed that there's something pretty great about being able to reach *all your friends* from a single app. At least the ones that have a freaking phone numbers :D Of course, it's just how messaging should be but it also makes sense that all big players would heavily restrict any 3rd party integration, messaging is a huge, strategical, market. nigra truo Very good point, sms is over and has been for a long time, it is just that americans are strangely still in love with the ancient spartanic standard, they are backwards compared to the rest of the globe. Whatsapp for example does not support sms because it REPLACES it obviously. Sms can't do rich communication without ugly crutches, try making a free voice or video call through it, send a full size video, high resolution photos, a contact, a document, your location, an audiorecording and everything encrypted. All these things whatsapp can do natively, on all platforms, not just on iphones or apple devices, 1 billion users speak a clear language. Midnitte At this point, I'm held hostage stuck using Hangouts since it's the only thing that natively supports desktop messaging. Sigh. Bryan Chandler Signal has a Chrome app for desktop messaging. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/signal-private-messenger/bikioccmkafdpakkkcpdbppfkghcmihk?hl=en Midnitte Ah yea, I would prefer something native though, plus I still use Hangouts for some contacts. I lament the loss of merged conversations too Lord Argyris "Each has its disadvantages, though. The latter doesn't have quite the same feature set that Hangouts did, and the former is a Facebook product." It's lines like these that keep.me coming back to AP. JD My support for Google and their messaging platforms ended the beginning of May. Kelly Clubb Well this sucks for any user that enjoyed an easy to use sms app. I use Hangouts and thankfully for project fi will continue it's support BossMa1n3 Eh..doesn't effect me stop using hangout for sms awhile ago..more interested in a flat screen phone with side bezels as thin as the one in the pic.. Grey PLEASE Bring Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet to all users. That has so many new and awesome features. It's like everything Allo isn't. DragoCubed The comment section is rough b_boogey_xl Bye Hangouts! hp-fourtwenty oh ffs...voice is still supported??? hell yeah!! nxtiak I'm waiting for the day G+ contacts disappear from Hangouts. I hate how on PC when I type a name to start a conversation it lists random people on G+. SHOW ME THE NAMES FROM MY DAMN CONTACTS GOOGLE!!!!!!!!! Maave RIP Hangouts. I had group chats, Google Voice, and SMS all in one. Now my group chats have moved to Telegram but I'm still stuck with nerfed Hangouts for GV. Chris Wachtman Hey, what's wrong with facebook? /s Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I switched to Signal because of this mess and I've very happy I did---it works great. The only feature I miss is tablet support, but it's coming soon, and unlike Google, when Signal receives a new feature, it's actually ready to be released, and works well. Jason E Perkins Boy am I glad for the second half of that title. ROB TEXTRA DC_Guy If Apple would just open up iMessage to Android, 99% of our messaging problems would be over. haha Dragos Lucian Totally forgot Hangouts existed. I've been using Telegram for quite some time now and I'm more than happy with it. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ The name of the app is very off-putting if they ever wanted to increase adoption among business/serious users. But as I found out just yesterday, it's actually a really nice SMS apparatus. rap Some say SMS is dead. But not everyone has a smartphone or data. SMS works without either. Adam Margeson Haven't been using it since I switched over to Allo. 1966CAH When it comes to messaging, Google is like an ex-girlfriend. Once, so sweet and alluring, now somebody I want nothing to do with. johdaxx Well, I hope they can sort this mess out eventually. I don't really care too much about SMS per se...but I do need some way to message people that don't have whatever apps I have or have apps I don't have. Especially if they have the audacity to use an iPhone or something. Brandon Hann This didn't affect me since I use Google Voice exclusively and have a data-only plan for my cell service. Let's just hope Google doesn't kill off Google Voice in the future. keithzg I would say, why remove a feature when you're clearly still supporting it for some users anyways, so it's no more maintenance to just leave it enabled for everyone? I would say that, if I thought there was any coherent or rational approach to messaging strategy and development at Google. Personally I switched to Facebook Messenger for SMS, if only because of Chat Heads (multitasking for IM is pretty nice). Was tempted towards Signal, but Signal wants you to import and encrypt your SMS's, and I don't want to get locked into an SMS app. derp_cookies These guys are starting to remind me more and more of Hooli. xyz Good decision. Next step is to discontinue Hangouts, then Allo, then Messages, and then Duo.

Resold Pixel phones originally purchased from Project Fi are having their IMEIs blacklisted Richard Gao Follow View All Posts 2017/05/25 5:30am PDTMay 25, 2017 57 Plus 1 on G+ 141 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares256 Google News Pixel Pixel XL Project Fi Back in November, when the Pixel was slowly beginning to ship to customers, there were numerous reports of people getting their Google accounts banned for purchasing Pixel and Pixel XL devices with the intent to resell them. It turns out that this issue hasn't exactly been laid to rest, as it seems that Pixel phones purchased from Project Fi for this purpose are now getting blacklisted via their IMEI numbers. As an overview, people originally bought Pixels from both the Google Store and Project Fi to sell them to a New Hampshire-based reseller. Why New Hampshire, you may ask? There's no sales tax. Both parties here were supposed to make a profit, but Google ended up banning a ton of accounts for a violation of their terms of service.. Considering how important Google is in our lives (Gmail, Google Photos, YouTube, Play Store, etc.), a lot of people were obviously not happy. In the end, Google did restore many of these accounts, but it was obviously enough for a good scare. However, it seems that Google still hasn't completely forgiven people for violating their ToS. Kyle Bennett, the editor-in-chief and founder of the HardOCP website, had his Pixel XL's IMEI blacklisted just yesterday. IMEIs are typically blacklisted by carriers when phones are lost or stolen, but that's clearly not what happened here. Calling T-Mobile didn't do anything, as their staff told him that they could not reverse the blacklisting. His communication with Swappa support was more interesting, though; here's what they told him: "Sorry to hear of the complaints. We have seen a great number of Pixel devices becoming blacklisted the past two days. We are still trying to figure out why this has happened to so many devices. We are working to find out the cause of this widespread issue. It would be best for both of you to keep on top of Google and pressing them for an explanation. In one other case, I saw this morning Google agreed to send the buyer a replacement device so that might be an option to look into. Seller please work with the buyer and Google to see if they can get to the bottom of it." Kyle then contacted Google support, with the first representative claiming that he had simply received a spam message. When he showed a second rep how his IMEI had indeed been blacklisted via Swappa's ESN/IMEI checker (useful tool if you're buying a phone, by the way), he was told that his Pixel XL hadn't been reported as stolen, but that it had been originally purchased through Project Fi. Kyle was also once again told that his phone hadn't really been blacklisted, but a quick rescan of his IMEI in Swappa proved otherwise. His case was escalated to Project Fi's support team, but the customer service rep refused to give him a reference number and told him that he'd receive it via email. After contacting a third representative, Kyle was informed that his phone had indeed been blacklisted, but that Google wasn't responsible for doing so. This lends further credence to the Project Fi explanation, as it's the carrier and not the manufacturer that has the ability to blacklist devices. The situation is still ongoing, but that's all we know for now; we'll update with more information as we get it.

Okay. NeverrKnowsBest You can sell a Project Fi phone. You just buy them in bulk and try to make a profit off Project Fi. Stupid that the customer is being punished for this, though. Green Dog Is it clear that this is one of the phones that was bought in bulk from that retailer? From my reading, it was just a resold phone. I mean obviously, it's not happening to all phones, but the fact that it's still happening is a concern. NeverrKnowsBest The IMEIs are being linked to one particular reseller in New Hampshire. celestre Do you have more information than is present in the article on this? NeverrKnowsBest I'm just going off what the article said. I would love to read more, but I highly doubt they are just flipping the switch on every resold Project Fi phone. That just isn't very plausible, at least to my knowledge. datkidpatrick you misunderstood the article... they referenced a time where a bulk reseller's phones were black listed... but now it is happening to a bunch of random sellers that decided to sell the phone... Richard Gao The bulk reseller's phones weren't blacklisted at that time. It is entirely possible that these are the same phones. datkidpatrick i purchased mine straight from project fi... sold it 3 months ago and the seller told me the other day it was blacklisted... and yes my mistake.. the bulk resellers email's were blocked or something like that... Cael Did you pay off the phone before you sold it? datkidpatrick yes i did... Corey Kinard So they're punishing someone that fully paid for a device from you, who fully owned the device? They're legally allowed to just fully break something they've already sold and have no right to? This is worse than when carriers wouldn't unlock phones... datkidpatrick im still giving google the benefit of doubt that it was a mistake... they just need to fix it PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ You'll easily win in small claims court if you have to refund and take the phone back. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ What kind of financing plan did you have? They were first sold in Oct. 22 2016 and this is only May 2017. I seem to remember 24 month financing or 12 month financing. You paid your phone off three months ago and already had sold it on Swappa for some time? datkidpatrick ya youre allowed to pay it off early... PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Maybe that's what caused the error at Fi in blacklisting by accident. datkidpatrick ya that doesn't make any sense... but it got fixed this morning by google... NeverrKnowsBest I see that now. Thanks for the clarification. In any case, there has to be something in common with these blacklisted phones, I don't think Google/Project Fi would blacklist all second hand phones, I don't think that's very plausible. Corey Kinard Do you really need to think straight when you are in competition for largest company in the world? They probably got algorithms looking for shit and those algorithms mess up. 4Ui812 That's pretty shitty Google. David Bowline Is it really? What's shitty is the people buying in bulk just to make an easy buck and therefore screwing people over. Swappa needs to go after these people. jonzey231 Yeah but if I bought a Pixel LAST YEAR and wanted to sell it no in preparation for the next Pixel or the OP5, for example, my customer may get screwed even though it was just an innocent buy and resell. Max Uh? That's not what happened here... so far this situation seems to be the result of a reseller elaborate plan to evade tax and sell the scarce phone for a bigger profit. This wasn't an individual reselling his/her own phone. jonzey231 Uh? I know that it was originally caused by the douche bags in NJ, but now it's affecting regular people. 4Ui812 That's called capitalism. No one is forcing you to buy it. What Google needs to do is fix all the reported issues with that shitty phone. As for the limited supply of said phone , again that's Google's fault (hell , I wouldn't be surprised if Google intentionally limted the supply ... That's a play out of nintys handbook) Duder12 I have a pixel. There is nothing wrong with my phone. I love it. SirCanealot But I have a Pixel and it is broken. Surely this is not possible to exist in reality? :O :O :O A Person It may suck, but who is to decide how my money is spent? kbbl Caveat emptor. SeanPR11 Or.... don't buy your phone from a New Jersey Douchebag. If people don't buy from them, they will stop doing this bullshit. It sucks that regular people are caught in the middle (which happens all too often). It seems Swappa should have known these phones were out there (given the business they are in) and flagged them with the IMEI checker. Alex Excuse them for doing whatever they like with a product they purchased. Pfff SeanPR11 Amen. Ryan from GroupTweet Yes, its shitty. If anything Google should go after the reseller, not the innocent legitimate customers that bought the devices and who are now punished because their phones are blacklisted. Alexander Z Great Swappa can't GO after anyone. Maybe suspend/revoke their account but that's it. My trusted seller hasn't been any help at all with the blacklisted pixel I bought. It's so messed up!! T4rd Saw the site/forum owner of a site I frequent get hit with this on his Pixel this week too. Crazy how the Pixel is being plagued with all sorts of extraneous issues. They can't stay in stock, forcing people to buy second hand, then they get black listed because of some weird policy Google has with Project Fi phones. Max Well being out of stock has nothing strange coming from a Google phone, that's been their main issue for a few years now (Nexus), and it happens even to Apple on launch but the difference is that they're a lot better ramping up production afterwards. This blacklisting is really weird, but so far it seems to be potentially related to a shady reseller so we'll have to wait and see if we get more clarification soon. Geoff Johnson As someone from New Hampshire, it's weird to see my state in an AP article, since nothing interesting ever happens here lol. This sucks though because buyers who bought their Pixel 2nd hand months ago now suddenly might get it blacklisted? J.J. Holy f. That is terrible. So random guy buys a second hand pixel (because Google was out of stock) later gets blacklisted by Google/fi. Gets no help from Google. Never buys a Google phone again. Real smart. Green Dog This on top of the seeming shaky quality of the phones may force me to an iPhone. J.J. I feel ya there but, i just can't do the iPhone thing. Loving this s8+ right now. Duder12 When consumers say this its just sad. Why when you have a difficult time with one android manufacturer immediately think its all Androids and switch to the iPhone? This is how Apple gets tons of customers. Everyone that had a bad time with Samsung just assumed their only other option was iPhone bc MARKETING. Green Dog Because I don't want to have to deal with OS updates through the carrier or a limited phone in terms of LTE bands, as is common for Android phones? People like other phones and I've played with some of them, but I like the Pixel/Nexus lines. But this does give me pause. blenderboy Well, the only offering that competes with iPhone in the world of android is the pixel phone. Samsung displays(hardware in general) are great but software experience can't be compared with iPhone or pixel. It is just sad that they can't keep up with Apple or Google. Google is trying really hard to reach there. I am still using Android because of the platforms openness. Duder12 Fair enough but you know what I mean. You are an exception but A LOT of consumers act this way. Honestly I bought my Pixel through the Google Store last fall and its been solid. I love it. Google needs to sort out the second hand market but these are growing pains. Hardware is still new to them bc the nexus line had help from the OEMs. Now they dont. marcusmarcus2 His comment does not address all Androids. He is only speaking of this one phone. It could be he was between using phones by Google and iPhones and he choose to go with Google's phone. Now with this situation, he decided to go to his second choice. I'm not defending switching to an iPhone over another manufacturer, just pointing out his statement you criticized did not say what you thought it was saying and you were the one to actually apply his statement to all Androids. Just playing the devil's advocate here Alex Because when you pay 7-8-900€ (the price of an iPhone) on an Android phone you expect it to be flawless. And that's normal! However, in real life, regardless if you pay 300 or 800€, Android remains Android, with its notoriously inconsistent battery life, inexplicable wakelocks, unfixed bugs (don't get me stored on the "low priority" bugs with thousands of stars), 2 year updates, etc, etc. tekfr33kn That seems a little dramatic considering that iPhones are far from flawless. You also pay that amount for your average laptop and they aren't flawless. It seems you, or someone else, is holding Android phones to an unrealistic standard. Alex Please don't compare a laptop with an Android phone. It makes absolutely no sense. Isn't it rather that manufacturers (Google being the first of them) increase the prices each year to hallucinating levels with little to no innovation or improvement in user experience. Take the S8 line. Beautiful phones, remarkable design, but a fraction of the cost you pay goes to that crap Bixby that nobody wants tekfr33kn I'll agree with you that Google is artificially raising the price far beyond what it should be but that's basic capitalism and market forces. If the market doesn't want those kinds of prices or can't support it, it won't sell. The issue is that people are actually willing to pay that. iPhones are the primary example. There's about $400 - $500 worth of stuff put in a phone that goes for $800 - $1000 and they still sell like hotcakes. I also agree with you about the S8's and Bixby but again, the market says that the S8 is a hot seller and so Samsung isn't about to change that trend. That kind of makes your argument moot. As for comparing a smartphone to a laptop - if you can't see the comparisons, it's either willful ignorance or you just don't know a thing about electronic devices (specifically smartphones or laptops). In either case, I can't help you with that. The fact is that they share more in common that differences. It's one of the many reasons that development strategies (hardware and software) often translate quite well between them. xyz Uhm, because the phone in question is the overpriced Google phone that is intended to compete with the iPhone and which Google fanboys insist is the greatest Android phone of all time. psychic99 It costs about the same to make a Pixel XL as it does an iphone 7, so why would you expect Google to make less margin than Apple? I will say their ecosystem and support SUCKs compared to Apple, so yeah it should be hundred less because the lifecycle experience of a Pixel will be much worse than Apple and the fact that they artificially end support after 2 years is atrocious. I have 4+ year old Nexus that operate just fine on custom ROMs. And BTW I don't think it is worth it either and happily keep my Nexus 6p for less than 50% the cost. I can't rationalize the price they are asking. Google's support is not consistent. Either they will go over the top to help, or tell you go away you are screwed, There is nothing in the middle, and until you engage them you have no idea if you are going to get help or the hand. Yet another reason they should be hundreds less. Merrill Sampson Just FYI, Google announced at IO a few days ago that they're extending the support cycle on the Pixel from 2 year to 5. marcusmarcus2 Do you have a source for that? https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705?hl=en#nexus_devices Android Version updates: October 2018 Security updates: October 2019 Duder12 Dont forget that apple blocked iPhones that had their fingerprint sensor replaced. Also, dont forget Apple is trying to get a bill banned that will allow consumers to have 3rd parties fix phones. PS: My Pixel is fucking awesome. NexusKoolaid "Dont forget that apple blocked iPhones that had their fingerprint sensor replaced." And this in and of itself was a good thing. With the sensor and the CPU being paired, the sudden appearance of a new sensor having a new signature was deemed to be a security breach. I'm not standing up for Apple here, just calling a spade a spade. And I don't know what information Apple could have shared with 3rd party repair houses (if they were inclined to play nice with them) without compromising security. "PS: My Pixel is fucking awesome." I wish I had one. But they were so hard to get hold of for so long that at this point I'll hang on to my 6P until the Pixel2 is out. psychic99 On Android if you reinstall the O/S or make major modifications they simply invalidate the fingerprint then you have to enter the password manually as a failback. Then you can enrol your fingerprint again. In fact every few days you have to manually enter your pin on N to get into the phone. Sounds like a reasonable method, rather than locking the phone forever. Apple went one step farther. You should go watch youtube... Apple is on a mission to make 3rd party repair a thing of the past. They even specifically make it hard to repair. They want control of the supply chain and dispose of equipment as fast as possible. NexusKoolaid On your first point, there is little control over hardware used to support the platform, so core design decisions are prone to fall back to a software solution. Apple on the other hand has tight control of their hardware and have the option for hardware based solutions, whatever the motivation might be, such as better security or to maintain control of their platform (probably a mix on the two). On your second point, I've read the headlines and seen videos on Youtube (like Louis Rossman). Yeah - their crusade against 3rd party repair sickens me to no small degree. Not just because it would prevent me from seeking out more economical and timely repair of my phone (if I had an iPhone), but because this type of precedent could trickle down to other things I might want to tinker with. Jay Hate to say it but that is the risk people run when you don't buy your devices brand new. J.J. True. But they exasperate said risk artificially for the perceived end goal.... More Profit. The truth is they are doing the exact opposite. This news definitely makes me pause on buying a pixel at all. The Second hand market is real and if i have a bad experience do to Google on a second hand device i will probably not buy new from them when i have the funds. james fuston If you (or the person who sells you a phone) violates the terms of service, you're gonna have a bad time regardless of manufacturer. blenderboy Real question to ask, did Apple ever had similar issue with many devices? hunter2 Probably not since Apple realizes that the perceived strong resale value is a determining factor for many people. Even people who may have never sold a product second hand gain some comfort from the knowledge that they could potentially recoup a lot of their costs if they ever needed to sell. ericshmerick Do the TOS say you can never ever resell the device? Serious question. ekana_stone No the TOS is that you resell as soon as you bought it, so like if you bought from fi cuz it's cheaper and the resold it a little under asking. It's only those phones that were black listed ericshmerick What defines "as soon as?" 5 minutes after purchase? 1 week? 2.8 months? 3 years? marcusmarcus2 Do we have confirmation that it is only those phones that were black listed? Could they have inadvertently black listed other phones from fi? EarlyMon The TOS say that commercial resale is not allowed and lots of them were resold by a private company in a scheme that tried to avoid sales tax. Santos Chavez It actually does say that isn't allowed, hence why they initially banned several accounts the first time. It was a breach of their TOS, and it still is. It's likely Project Fi saw these phones as stolen and blacklisted them. james fuston "You may only purchase Devices for your personal use. You may not commercially resell any Device, but you may give the Device as a gift." So if you purchase the device and resell it in New (unopened) condition, yeah. Fi could also pretty easily make the case that if you purchased the phone and turned around to sell it before the expiry of the original installment plan that you had purchased it with the intention of reselling. MisterAlex That's still not a commercial sale. If I go to the store, buy a Nintendo Switch, and immediately list it as a brand new Switch on Craigslist, I'm not a commercial seller. I'm still an individual selling something that's fully within my "first sale" rights to sell. james fuston Yeah, that's true if you're reading the second, and only the second, sentence there. The first one pretty clearly states "You may only purchase Devices for your personal use" MisterAlex If you think that reselling a personally owned item goes beyond the bounds of personal use, you're kidding yourself (and so is anyone who thinks that line of thinking would hold water, legally speaking). First Sale is a very broad consumer protection, my friend. Once you buy something of your own, you can do whatever you want with it, including sell it. (Edit: in the States, anyway.) james fuston Yep! Totally fine for you to sell it. Also totally fine for Google to deactivate your phone when you've done something you agreed not to do at the time of purchase. It's then legally on you to prove that they overstepped. MisterAlex You're clearly not parsing what I'm posting. Selling privately owned property is within the bounds of "personal use." james fuston Seeing as Google specifically included a clause about gifting, I'd venture to say they disagree with you. MisterAlex That's fine. Sony also disagreed that it had done anything wrong by removing Other OS. james fuston Cool! So we agree that whether or not you believe Google's terms of service to be legal, it's entirely on the customer to take action after being penalized for a violation of said terms of service. MisterAlex It's always up to the wronged party to seek litigation against a wrongdoer. james fuston In that case, I have no idea why you started commenting on legality when I was discussing terms of service violations. Rather, I would have no idea why if this weren't the comment section. MisterAlex A TOS is not a legally binding agreement. You defended enforcement of a TOS when that enforcement went contrary to law. That's why I brought up the comparison to Sony's PS3 lawsuit (which it lost). james fuston I'm not discussing whether terms of service are legally binding. I'm discussing whether or not the action being described (selling the phone) violates the ToS. It does. MisterAlex And my counter was to point out that putting something in a TOS doesn't make it hunky-dory. In fact, it's quite possible for a TOS to violate law. As I've illustrated. bekifft This is where America is so great. Even if the TOS is unenforceable by law, it is technologically enforceable, obviously. So they do it anyway, and now the onus is on you the little guy to get the multinational corporation to knock it off. Vape John most likely carrier issues the blacklisting... so project fi is the culprit psychic99 More profit? The sell them $150 below market rates. That is not free. I don't know what is actually going on but I would suspect that the original owner did something wrong or unethical. To be honest Google's systems are weird. I ported out my nexus5x and it took them almost 3 months to Bill me for the remainder. So maybe the original person cancelled their card, played games with DPP, activated it for one day and did it again. And again. xyz Fortunately, you can just buy an iPhone and get top notch support. hunter2 So the answer is to buy everything new and toss the old device in the landfill? Kind of sad to see how people just roll over and let over-reaching companies basically decimate the second hand market so they can increase their profits. Jay Never said that and you know it. I said this is the risk you take.. It's as simple as that. trixnkix637 That's the risk you take for not buying from reputable sources. Buying used has risks. Sucks he found out the hard way. jb0nez But the article says it's not Google, it's the carrier who blacklisted. Whatever that means... hunter2 That makes no sense. The carrier technically blocks that IMEI on their network, but only after another carrier submits it to the blacklist. It would be like if you SWATTED somebody and then said "it was the police who came to your house with guns not me". pfmiller On top of that this seems like an abuse of the blacklisting system. The system is intended to discourage theft, not as a means for companies to get revenge on their customers. psychic99 That's not true. Companies have been blacklisting devices for years if tos wasn't met. I have bought 3 phones through fi and they are heavily discounted. Google doesn't do that for free they expect you to activate them on fi for more than one day. Also if you are buying a phone from an individual and not a dealer you are taking a risk straight up. I have had friend have their phones blacklisted when they have bought phones from people and then they turned around and reported them as stolen. Swappa is a marketplace not a arbitrator. They are facilitating a sale. You guys need to know the difference. PayPal is your friend. hunter2 That's dumb. The whole point of cancellation fees is to re-coup the cost of subsidies if you break the contract. By going a different route, the only people who are getting punished are the people buying these phones. psychic99 Lots of people don't pay them and I have seen numerous accounts where friends have bought phones and have told me they got a "deal of a lifetime" to find their devices blacklisted and guess what they were people who never paid off their termination fees or have sold them then reported them stolen. And as an individual you need to take responsibility, if you purchase anything through a private transaction you should ask for poof of sale, do they own it, have it put in writing, etc. That way if the seller does something illegal then you have a remedy. This doesn't derisk anything tho. This is good education for people, to know where responsibility lies and the risks of buying from an individual versus an established dealer. In the case of Swappa, you should buy via Paypal, so there is a remedy. You can chargeback your loss if this happens within 6 months (I have done this will unethical sellers), so they are not being punished they are being inconvenienced. But that is the RISK you take buying from an individual. hunter2 I know you want to see Google as the good guy here, but within these comments there are accounts from people who bought outright, and months later sold their Pixel's and now months after that sale are being contacted by the seller about the device being blacklisted. bekifft I think you're missing his point. It's not about Google being the good or bad guy, it's that buying something third party is inherently risky and he's right, you should ask for a chain of evidence that proves the device is legit. Maybe I'm also just tired of people claiming they can find things so cheap online, when most of it is scams like this, and just devalues the whole market. hunter2 You need to look through these comments. There are people here who bought their phones directly from Fi and after switching carriers their fully paid off phones have been blacklisted. They were the original owners and these phones were never sold. There are also people here who bought phones, used them for months, and sold them after they were fully paid off. These people are saying that the proper they sold the phones to are now coming back and telling them they're blacklisted. bekifft In that case that is indeed disturbing. I am a Fi subscriber though I bought my phone direct from the Google store. Sounds like someone made a big mistake on the back end. Lance Biddle I bought my phone from Project Fi, and it has become blacklisted after changing to another carrier. Google is definitely the bad guy right now IMO pfmiller Just because other companies have been doing it, doesn't mean that it's not an abuse of the system. It's clearly not what the blacklisting system was intended for. Lance Biddle How about when you buy the phone from Project Fi, decide to switch carriers and the phone you outright own becomes black listed. I cannot connect to the Verizon service I'm paying for. And Verizon cannot do anything about. And Google/Project Fi isn't. I've wasted way too much time on the phone trying to get this resolved. They have told me it could be 2-5+ days to get it fixed. WTF!! Never Google again. Never. J.J. I'm sorry. That sucks hard. ProductFRED Considering the original seller probably isn't going to pay people back, all Google did was fuck over a bunch of legitimate customers. iPhone reselling is also a big issue, especially on new releases, but you don't see Apple doing this. J.J. Agree 💯. Most of these customers involved (who probably have had hardware and software issues already on top​ of this) will never buy a pixel again! Cassidy James Blaede Just for the record, the majority of Pixel users likely never have hardware or software issues. I, my mom, and a couple of my friends have Pixels and haven't had any issues. You probably hear about issues on Reddit a lot because the only reason to visit the Pixel subreddit is to complain. 🙃 Jordan L no issues here too. J.J. Not a redditer lol, but many other sites show the issues(as low as they may be) and if you were on the fence about spending that kind of money, these stories alone may sway many Duder12 Yep. Just like iphone touch disease and early shutdowns. Tr3ple Never had those issues. xyz That's true. I personally don't know anyone who has been murdered. Therefore, no one gets murdered. Cassidy James Blaede I'd wager that the majority of people don't get murdered. 😉 Written Description My Pixel XL has performed flawlessly since its purchase and it's my first Android phone after using every iPhone from the first generation on. Google's AI is better, its cloud storage is infinitely better, and I don't see going back to Apple anytime soon. J.J. I'm glad you have not had issues.... Others however have Duder12 Not me. Corey Kinard 3rd Np. Duder12 Mines been great... atl3630 great here too. Cael Apple is not a "carrier". ProductFRED Neither is Google. They just use other carriers' networks. Either way, that isn't justification for what they're doing. Unless they plan on replacing everyone's Pixel (which looks like a hard no), they fucked over a lot of legitimate customers. I buy my devices off of swappa most of the time. Tell me how I would get this fixed if neither the seller nor Google want to take responsibility. marcusmarcus2 Google is an MVNO. Per https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-mvno-cell-phone-carrier-578673 "An MVNO is a cell phone carrier (such as a prepaid wireless carrier) that typically does not have its own network infrastructure and licensed radio spectrum" Apple is not even an MVNO carrier. drksilenc fi is a carrier... JD With Fi Google is a Carrier. Mitch Gray This just happened to my fiance's phone. I bought it on swappa for her birthday months ago because Google store didn't have any in stock and this morning it is blacklisted. I'm so furious. I have had every Google phone since the Galaxy Nexus and because of this policy I will never buy another phone of theirs. She is now stranded without a phone and has no way of using it for work at the busiest time of the year for her (she is a teacher and it's graduation week). Who do I contact about this? We shouldn't be punished because someone gamed the system. J.J. I feel so bad for you. I hope you get it resolved. This is an atrocity! J.J. Should definitely hassle fi/Google and let them know if they don't resolve you will never buy and tell everyone you know not to buy and so on jibust No, stop don't tell them that, they might not withstand the shock of loosing them. /S T4rd I would contact the seller of the phone and/or Swappa if they're the service you went through. If they're no help somehow, then contact Paypal if that's how you paid for it. Google isn't going to unblacklist the phone regardless of what you say to them. It's virtually impossible for a phone to be unblacklisted once it has happened, so you're going to have to just get a refund and buy another phone. A Person Good luck with that. I am hesitant to ever buy again from Swappa.. and I used to love, love, love them. I purchased a device that was blatantly not as described. I then contacted Swappa and they instructed me that it is now between me and the seller. So I contacted the seller via the sale page and was basically told: "ummmm, nah". datkidpatrick at that point you could have went thru paypal and filed a claim... T4rd That's why you buy from reputable sellers. The few minor issues I've had on there were resolved quickly. atl3630 yes, same here. To date I've never had a swappa problem that didn't get resolved and the people have been very helpful. Don't blame swappa for shitty sellers. Buy from reputable sellers (like me). yankeesusa Swappa only helps communicating. To resolve any issues you must file a PayPal claim. datkidpatrick contact the seller and see if they can contact project fi/google... King_Android Ijs, BBB is an extremely powerful tool in order to get your voice heard from Corporate asap...... Stephen Hicks If the phone is under warranty still, file an RMA claim and state the bluetooth isn't working correctly on the device and that you've already tried factory resetting the phone as well as reconnected all the bluetooth devices with no improvement. Might work? njn There is no warranty for second hand phones. JRock I purchased a bootlooping 6P off eBay for cheap, erasing/flashing firmware had same result, RMA'd to Huawei and they promptly sent me a brand new one. Mark Depending on the credit card you used to buy the phone, you might have an extended warranty that might cover this. atl3630 You can get your money back. Contact the seller through swappa and tell them the issue. They will likely tell you it's been to long, I don't care, etc. If so, then file a PayPal claim. You have six months PayPal protection. Document that the phone no longer works and send it back to the seller with tracking. Then PayPal will refund you money, no matter what the seller says. M3D1T8R But doing this will just end up screwing over the seller. PayPal will simply take the money from their account and refund it to the buyer. So that's not fair to the seller either. PayPal's "seller protection" is a fraud. And their customer service is a total joke. They should be boycotted. atl3630 How does that screw over the seller? The seller screwed himself when he sold the phone. His beef is with ProjectFi, not the buyer. Frankly the buyer shouldn't have to deal with this crap since buyers have no way to determine the history of a phone. The seller sold a phone that stopped working. That's on them. M3D1T8R Because, obviously, the seller doesn't necessarily know the history and every previous owner of every phone. What if it's a phone someone bought previously used. They used it for a while just fine, and resold it. Then this IMEI block thing happened. atl3630 Yeah, that would suck. But still, it's not the buyer's fault. If something happens and somebody gets cheated out of $500+ then you better bet people are going to exercise whatever option they can to recover their money. PayPal protection would do that for them in the first 6 months. ericshmerick So anyone who sells a phone is on the hook for its functionality until the end of time? GTFO of here with that. It's ridiculous and you know it. atl3630 Six months, moron. PayPal protection is 6 months. Like it or not, facts. Stop being a little bitch. Roh_Mish What if the seller had bought directly from google. AP mentioned about the trains but there doesn't appear to to be a link between this and that fraud. Also there are many cases where buyer on PayPal will request a reverse and never return the product, screwing over the seller. And PayPal won't do anything about this. vn33 That really sucks .. .especially to someone near and dear to you. I would be beyond furious! Hope everything works out!! Duder12 Swappa will cover you here. You are fine. Get the ball rolling. Anwar Imraan Lucas To me it seems that the original buyer had reported his credit card lost or stolen and is disputing charges on his card which in terms maybe blacklisting those devices as stolen.. blindexecutioner You do Google the service of endless beta testing their software on a way overpriced phone and they blacklist you. Nice. Lawrence Good, that is what you get for buying the Bezel XL ericshmerick OH YOUUUU!!1 theadamsegal Yet another reason I will not buy a Google device again. Tiberian For the record: Kyle Bennett is the owner and founder of HardOCP, not just a simple writer for the site. ;) Richard Gao Did not know that. Thanks! datkidpatrick this happened by to me as well... i sold my pixel 3 months ago and the buyer just informed me it was blacklisted... i had no clue project fi was doing this and legit thought the buyer was trying to scam me... i contacted project fi support and was advised it was escalated to be removed from the blacklist... i paid off the phone before i sold it... this is definitely a mistake by google/project fi... they should be correcting this soon... Jordan L Can a carrier just randomly blacklist IMEIs?! I guess so. I was reading this thread thinking 'well, people probably just bought a stolen Pixel unknowingly' but your case proves this wrong. Navneet Suresh Shitty move Google ! :/ Jay If this happened to me, I'd just return the phone to the seller, get refunded, and make them have to deal with this. Swappa made a huge fucking deal about refunding buyers after the Note7 debacle and it should be the same thing here. freshprince_87 I hope that Kyle guy reads your comment. This may help him Jay Honestly, Swappa needs to be pushing this harder. I sold my Note7 last year and despite the fact that the buyer could have gone and gotten the refund from T-Mobile themselves, they chose to take Swappa up on their suggestion of getting the refund from me. (Add to this that Swappa said if I didn't agree to the refund, they'd "suggest" the buyer take the issue up with PayPal as the device was not sold as advertised. Seriously..) datkidpatrick it isn't the sellers fault... and its something that can be fixed... Jay I fail to see how this isn't the seller's fault for trying to game the system and make a profit. This sure as hell isn't Google's fault.. so who do you want to blame then? The unsuspecting buyers? datkidpatrick it is googles fault... the point they referred to in november is completely separate from the issue happening now... the issue happening now is many pixel phones that were sold and originated from fi is getting blacklisted... i sold my pixel after paying it of legit and it just got blacklisted... now please tell me how i tried to game the system... Jay For all I know, you could be one of those shady scalpers too who tried to make a profit by gaming the system. The burden of fixing this issue should still lie on the sellers. If someone wants their money back, they have every right to make you do the legwork of figuring out how you'll make your money back. datkidpatrick I contacted project fi for the buyer and it is escalated... again the point is it wasn't my fault... marcusmarcus2 If you are just trying to sell 1 phone that you got and paid for without trying to "game the system" it is not your fault, but it is your responsibility as the seller to try and resolve the issue, which it sounds like you are doing. Who's fault is it? Hard to tell until Google releases a comment about why this is happening. Did they block these by mistake? Then it is Googles fault. Are they doing it to block the bulk buyers that were "gaming the system" and just went over board and blocked some extra phones that were not part of those that gamed the system? Then it would be the fault of Google and those that gamed the system that caused Google to make the choice. hunter2 I wouldn't say it's his responsibility. He's selling a device. If the maker of that device decides to flip a kill switch in 18 months and disable every device out there then why blame him. Google is flipping a kill switch an all kinds of devices (just below there is a comment from a guy who bought and paid for his phone, then later switched carriers and had his originally bought phone killed). Trying to blame middle men here is crazy. marcusmarcus2 I'm not blaming the seller. Please re-read. I said the fault is with Google if they are the ones that decided to black list them. It is the sellers responsibility to try figure out why a device they sold is blacklisted. If they did nothing wrong, then they should be able to get it unblacklisted by working with Google. From the looks of some of the comments on here, it looks like the buyer would not be able to get the device of the black list but the seller should be able to. Again, I'm not blaming the middle man. There is a difference between fault and responsibility. Fault sounds like it is fully on Google. Responsibility goes across everyone though with some having more responsibility. Buyer has some responsibility to report the issue to the seller instead of just reporting it to paypal. Seller has more responsibility than the seller because they would be the one who would be able to work with Google/fi to get it off the black list. Google/fi would have even more responsibility to explain why devices are being blacklisted and getting devices off the black list if they should not be on there. Max As a somewhat frequent seller/buyer on Swappa and Ebay I can say that this is definitely the sellers responsibility to fix the problem or promptly accept a return for a refund otherwise this isn't so different from a bait and switch situation. datkidpatrick how is it a bait and switch if i paid off a phone legit and decided to sell it after... 3 months later it gets blacklisted... this is a mistake by google and its their responsibility to fix... Max If you paid off the phone legit and didn't do anything shady then it wouldn't have been blacklisted and if it was you, as the original buyer, are the one with more authority to contact Google, not the second hand buyer, therefore it's your responsibility to fix it. The buyer with a blacklisted phone has zero reasons to believe that you were truthful in your description even if you were. datkidpatrick well i did contact project fi for the buyer and it is escalated... Max Then you're doing the right thing (taking responsibility) and hopefully this gets resolved quickly by Fi! Although I don't know if they can just un-blacklist a phone? Hopefully they can. ericshmerick If I buy a product from a retail store and 92 days later it has an issue, guess what they will tell me when I show up barking for a refund? Yeah, pound sand kid. That's what they will say. So why do Swappa sellers suddenly have the responsibility to refund forever ala Costco? I get people are pissy at the situation, but the seller isn't responsible for Google's shadyness here. Max We're not talking about "an issue" here because that's what warranties are for, we're talking about a phone reported as lost/stolen after being sold this could potentially mean a fraudster that didn't fully pay the phone or a thief that sold a stolen phone, I doubt any serious retailer would do that... By the way that's what buyer protections are for, Paypal has six months of protection and credit card providers can be very flexible if you explain your case well and you're in the right. If a retailer pull something like this they would never win a chargeback. Max We're not talking about "an issue" here because that's what warranties are for, we're talking about a phone reported as lost/stolen after being sold this could potentially mean a fraudster that didn't fully pay the phone or a thief that sold a stolen phone, I doubt any serious retailer would do that...

If a retailer pull something like this they would never win a charge back and the manufacturer and distributor would never be involved in the original transaction or charge back, it would be up to the retailer to go after the manufacturer or distributor. ericshmerick But nothing shady or illegal is going on here. If I and the original buyer and I use it on project fi for two months, then decide to sell it. How does that suddenly implicate me as being some sort of shady criminal? I would simply be selling a legally purchased piece of hardware that was paid in full. Max Can you please elaborate how the buyer knows that you sold "a legally purchased piece of hardware that was paid in full" if he has a blacklisted phone reported as lost/stolen in the hands? Good luck convincing the buyer, Paypal and a Bank that you're in the right in such a situation... Luxferro If they sold you shady (stolen or not legal) products you'd be dealing with them. tnt These are not devices being bought from an official retailer. There's no need to question the history of a device bought from Costco. Swappa (and Ebay and Craigslist for that matter) are not the same type of market. It's the seller's responsibility to know the history (as much as possible anyway) of the devices they're selling. freshprince_87 I guess it's safer to buy a Verizon Google Pixel instead if you intend on reselling it later. So the future buyer isn't screwed by Google. That is such a ridiculous policy drksilenc have to have a line with verizon to do that though. Wendell Brown Apparently not, this dude says his WERE Verizon phones that were locked.... https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/6d2yse/2_of_my_3_google_pixel_phones_blacklisted_on_the/ Me Google is just shooting themselves in the foot at this point with the Pixel Yan Qin I just sold my Pixel XL and switch to Galaxy S8, I do think I was out of my mind that I actually bought Pixel at full price. Jordan L anyone resell a project fi phone NOT through Swappa and have it blacklisted? maybe ProjectFi blacklisted only Swappa phones(still a strange move if it was on purpose) Jagermeister 2 of my 3 Pixel phones showed up blacklisted 2 days ago. I made a reddit post yesterday of my issue. I though it was part of an insurance fraud scam. https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/6d2yse/2_of_my_3_google_pixel_phones_blacklisted_on_the/ I had originally though our phones were from Verizon not Google Fi. We were happy Pixel customers that are now considering purchasing different phones because Google can report as stolen whenever they feel a Google Fi device was not transferred to a new owner per their TOS. How can any user purchasing a pre-owned or "new" Google Pixel be sure that it isn't a Google Fi device and won't be blacklisted in the future? Max Johnson Note to self, don't buy second hand Google devices. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Note to everyone: Don't buy first hand Google devices. Max Why? Mine works perfectly fine and so far it's the best phone I've ever owned. Dana Yeah, it's fine as long as you don't get it from Project Fi because you can't sell it if you want to upgrade to a new device. Max LOL, what? I simply bought it directly from store.google.com, no issues here and I can provide proof. This is something related to phones sold through Fi. hunter2 Congrats, scroll up one comment and you'll find a guy who's phone is blacklisted despite him being the original owner and being fully paid off. To answer your question of "Why", it's because not everyone is as comfortable gambling with their money as you are. Max 1) It was blacklisted by the carrier, not the manufacturer. 2) It was blacklisted after it was resold, sucks but as far as we know it doesn't affect the original seller, there's a difference there. 3) We don't know yet why this really happened. 4) Even with all of the above, I don't see how it fits in a "Don't buy first hand Google devices." statement. Maybe if you tell me "Don't deal with Project Fi service" I could somewhat agree. hunter2 http://disq.us/p/1iz7ts3 Sorry, should have permalinked the comment since the order is moving per votes. That guy was the original owner and claims to have been paid off. Moved to Verizon at some point and had the device he originally bough directly from Google blacklisted. Max Well that negates my point 2 and sucks even more. But still the blame here points 100% to Project Fi and not the phone itself nor Google as the manufacturer of the phone. Something really strange is happening with Project Fi devices and hopefully they will find out soon if it's an error, incompetence, sabotage or maybe even hacking. hunter2 I guess it depends on how willing you are to absolve the parent company of things a specific branch is doing. It would be like saying "don't blame MS, it's the IE team who makes the browser" during the IE6 days. Max Legally is evident that the responsibility is on Google but if you think that the group in charge of designing and manufacturing the Pixel has any minimal clue about what happens inside the group of the MVNO Project Fi then you're frankly clueless about how such a huge company works. By the way IE and Edge sucks but Visual Studio rocks and I'm liking more Windows 10 recently but I guess I should avoid using everything Microsoft because IE really sucks, right? hunter2 If a decisions like these can be made without going far enough up the chain of command that you're dealing with some higher ups, then I don't really want to know how this company runs. It's enough to tell me that I can't really trust them because you can't really depend on a company keeping in line with their corporate ideals when individual units can work with this much impunity. Avoiding/disliking MS was never about IE sucking. It was about IE being openly hostile and damaging to the web. This complaint was obviously projected at Microsoft themselves since no one believed that the IE team was working in a bubble. I don't know how old you are so maybe you weren't around when all this was going on. It's not about disliking a company because one or some of their many products are inferior. It's about disliking them because they employ user hostile tactics and you don't feel like you can support that (or at the very least want to punish them in the tiny way you can by voting with your wallet). Max So you already got an official response from Google about this? Can you share it? Because so far I have only read guesses about what is happening and nothing official yet. I'm old enough to have used MS-DOS 5 & 6 as well as Windows 3.1. That doesn't change the fact that saying "don't buy anything from a company" based on one division issues is just silly. If Google officially says that all of this was planned then maybe you could have a point, until then you're just stretching facts to prove a weak point. hunter2 I don't need to fill in the facts. I'm saying either way it's bad. The facts are that this happened. Additional facts about why it happened are irrelevant Max Well, if you're happy thinking like that be my guest, I guess some people is unable to see the colors and think the world is black and white. hunter2 For people whom this isn't a mundane thought experiment but are actually in a position where they need to buy a new device (not everyone is able to be without their phone until Google ultimately resolves this); the shades of gray in this scenario don't change their circumstances. The facts are that they have a phone that was remotely disabled. I'm assuming your shades of gray are the how's and why's of that? How is that of any consequence to these people? Steve_Jobroni Shut up, troll. DanSan got em! Matt This will be great for their resale value. ericshmerick Swappa comments: I GEEVE U $200 BUY NOW FINAL OFFERS!! JD Wooooo! Go Pixel, I'm definately not going near any Google hardware with a 1000ft pole now.I may use my 1001ft pole. In Many states, and at least in Canada this is not legal, you can't blacklist a phone for ToS violation. There's a very narrow list of reasons for a device to be blacklisted. Cuong This is a really shitty move from Google. At least sent a notification few days in advance and offer a way to appeal. What if a person was in an emergency situation? Imagine the lawsuit for that, Google. Why customers have to suffer because Google can't control their resellers? ericshmerick 911 always works. segag Thats Fuck all! Snowsky Mountain This may seriously make me rethink my use of Google hardware (especially phones). Stevie Do no evil Google. Do no evil. My Dixie Wrecked Yeah, they got rid of that mandate years ago. Seriously. Look it up. mxwp lol, yeah it was pretty funny. but i give Big G props for being somewhat honest about that. "hmm, we're huge now and so just cannot help to do some evil" Corey Kinard Just looked​ it up. Looks like it's still in place for Google. Alphabet's is different l though. It's "do the right thing." Sruly J Bought an unlocked Pixel yesterday for $334. Before I send it in to get checked and fixed by Google, I really should check the IMEI (normally I'd have the IMEI first, but the seller didn't give it to me). Michael D’Ambrosio "Someone with an answer." That'll get you far with Tech support. Smh vn33 Does the blacklisted phone works out of US, say in Canada? I assume yes, if it's the carriers that are doing the blacklisting. that said, it would really dampen my desire for a phone from Google. Stevie I am crossing my fingers that they don't come after my Nexus 6. Already bought and activated. There's no going back right? speedy1979 So to clarify google is randomly blacklisting any google pixel that is resold. I actually considered buying a ProjectFi device sometime ago; so glad I didn't go through with it. Kris Crowley I have fi service. When you buy a phone through fi you got a discount or a phone that you can't get through the Google store if you want. There is a disclaimer that if you buy it and never activate it that you will be charged additional Monies within 30 days. Now without knowing isn't possible that A the phone was bought at a discount and B the additional fee was levied but never paid? trixnkix637 Know the risks of buying used people. Do your homework. Asking where the seller bought the phone originally could've prevented all of this. Can't blame Google because someone tried to game the system both ways. marcusmarcus2 Know the risks of not using commas, people. You should never buy people, whether they are used or new. Rony Hmmm, is there a difference between a new and a used person. I've scoured the forums and haven't got a clear answer. marcusmarcus2 You would have to ask them before you buy them. They usually know when they've been used. But again, you should not buy any people. Def Ref But if you try to rent people, you start hearing words like "solicitation" and that's no fun. marcusmarcus2 Don't rent them either. While we are at it. Do not borrow, loan or steal people. Def Ref Is enticement allowed in your no fun world? Asking for a friend. marcusmarcus2 I don't see a problem with enticement as long as that enticement does not lead to stealing people. "No fun world"? You mean my world where I think people should not be viewed or treated as items/property? If yes, then yeah, I guess it is a no fun world. Def Ref Lighten up, Francis. marcusmarcus2 Lighten up, Francis? https://38.media.tumblr.com/39ef7347a58e308e67a5bd01cd124431/tumblr_nsld6lafvE1qh124lo1_500.gif Def Ref https://youtu.be/0OnpkDWbeJs That the title is misspelled AND mispunctuated is bonus. trixnkix637 Didn't NY and NV allow for the renting of people or is that wishful thinking? Asking for a friend. Rod This was so good, I had to sign into Disqus to upvote. trixnkix637 Buying people has been around for ages. Can't just stop now because of commas. marcusmarcus2 Buying used has been around for ages. trixnkix637 And so has it's risks. ericshmerick Wow I feel bad for the Swappa sellers who are getting PayPal charge backs right about now. Alexander Z Great This was the response I received. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/948da6656e25823e8dc529c4571fbc2d347f5e820ee9b7c91844d48c9745a112.png DanSan owner of the device ≠ person who purchased. way to go google. InnocentEd News flash this could happen with any phone from any manufacturer on any network that is resold used. I've had it happen with 2 iPhones and Apple could have cared less. You buy used, you take the risk. It's amazing how even credited tech journalists assume devices on Swappa are always going to be 100% safe. If Project Fi were not allowed to be resold via T&S then it's no diff than blacklisting a resold stolen phone...they had every right. Bewear This is why we can't have nice things. Rony Honestly this makes total sense. Its technically stealing the phone if you buy it for a discounted price and you dont activate it and sell it again. I think they made the right move. raffr It's not "technically" stealing. If you purchase a product at the price requested, you did not steal it. IF, big IF, in your purchase agreement it states you cannot resell the phone without activating it first, then google has a case. Serge Cebrian if you are paying for the service ... you are still paying for it even if you keep your older phone or a better phone if you want to unless you stop paying then its stealing ... but not if you keep the service// marcusmarcus2 They could have blacklisted these phones for that reason. But they could have also been overzealous when blacklisting devices and blacklisted numerous other devices that people did not do that with. It may have been the right move to block those that did do that, but if they inadvertently blocked additional devices, then hopefully they make the right move and unblock those devices that should not have been blocked. newtonfb Not new. Wife got a 5x on swappa. Phone was originally on FI but never taken off the account. We tried to activate it on FI but they did we couldn't until the owner released the phone? It worked fine on any other carrier. Had to get a new 5x Lance Biddle I paid off my pixel through project fi. I recently switched to Verizon. Yesterday Verizon notified me that my phone had been reported as stolen! When I awoke this morning my service had been disabled by Verizon. The support from Project Fi has been abysmal. What do I do to fix this? Corey Kinard Go to Reddit. Get ready for talks with the Better Business Bureau. Keep contacting Fi, keep screenshotting all the correspondences, you get all the buyers info in order to prove you are the original device owner. You don't fix this, you didn't cause it to break. Google fixes this. Everyone affected just has to light a fire under their ass. tnt Keep pushing / escalating with Project Fi. Ryan from GroupTweet I bought a Pixel from Tradeport USA (NH based company, shit!) about 3 months ago. The phone is on T-mobile right now and still currently working (fingers crossed). From my interpretation this appears only to be affecting Pixels bought through Google Fi - and perhaps not ones bought via Google Play store unlocked? Is that correct? Is there anyway I can check to see if my pixel was in fact sold via Google FI vs Google Play? Really hoping I don't wake up to a bricked phone in the next couple mornings... Sruly J You could contact Google, provide them with the IMEI, and they could let you know if it was bought through Google Play. Ryan from GroupTweet Thanks - but don't want to risk tipping them off that my phone should be on the blacklist :( Sruly J But wouldn't they know anyways if it should be blacklisted? I mean, how else would they have blacklisted so many phones this week? lauriedesautels So I have the Pixel and was planning on selling it via Swappa after my credits end from another phone. They ended up giving me a brand new Pixel XL but their service has become horrible where I live. So please correct me if I am wrong but if the Pixel is paid off and I switch carriers/ my Pixel is a paperweight? (I don't plan on using the phone on another carrier after 3 mo). ericshmerick According to this place, you can never sell it. You must carry it with you to your grave. Robert Montoya I have a Pixel that is currently blacklisted as of 5/23/2017 I bought it from Swappa... Google says they will lift the ban in 24 to 48 hours... That was 24 hours ago.. Phone still Blacklisted Wendell Brown I must have missed where it was shown that these deactivated phones were on Project Fi. As best I can tell, the only link to Fi is from an OLD article about the guy reselling phones several months ago. Is there any proof that this is in any way Fi related? MadJoe I have to say, if Google ever blacklisted my phone in a misguided sour-grapes attempt to punish the person who sold it to me, and without compensating me for it I would be rather angry. It would also be the absolute last Google product I ever purchased. As it is, this story has me glad I don't own anything more than a $25 Chromecast that I never use. I was seriously considering the Pixel 2 as my next phone, but not any more. If they were going to be such babies about the phones being resold, they should have vetted their buyers a little better. Corey Kinard It doesn't look like they were making any money off of you in the first place... Second-hand buyers/ bargain hunters rarely go out and pre-order $800 phones. Maybe you're different. They're definitely fucking up, but considering how little the pixel one sold and how much money they make I'm not sure they'll care about this any which way the wind blows. Same way Apple can just outright tell their customers to go fuck themselves over certain problems. MadJoe The problem is that too many people will ignore a company's unscrupulous behavior. If more of us would punished them by taking away access to our wallets, they'd think twice about trying to screw us. But people are lazy and lack commitment. So you're absolutely right, Google won't feel any hit by my deciding not to buy any more of their shit because a shit-ton of blind lemmings will gladly line up to jump off that spot on the cliff I chose not to use. And when a couple of them get screwed, they will cry "why isn't anyone else interested in helping me?" as the rest of the heard ignore them. On the bright side, the cycle will continue ad nauseum until I'm in a hole in the ground. Bruce Considering the ridiculous amount they are charging for the phones (Apple pricing without the Apple level support), this just about kills the resale value for a Pixel. Who the hell is going to buy a used phone for $500+ (because the original cost is so high) if their phones get blacklisted months later. And who the hell is going to buy the phones at the original price, when resale value will drop like a rock. And this doesn't even take into account all the BS that comes with the phone to begin with. 2 years of guaranteed OS updates. Hardware issues (Bluetooth, speakers, water resistance...) which don't get acknowledged amid finger pointing. Insufficient inventory even if they were open to replacements. The 128GB version (the 32GB is too little and the 64 GB doesn't exist) costs almost a $1000. The first time they tried this with the Nexus One, it didn't go well. This doesn't seem to be going much better. The Galaxy Nexus couldn't be upgraded because of drivers. The only real hits have been the Nexus 5 and the 6P. UniBroW *clutches iPhone 7 plus despite it's inferiority to android* Tj Hariharan Wait, do we actually KNOW that the phones that are blacklisted were originally purchased for reselling for profit? All i got from this article was that the phone was originally purchased from Project Fi.. RTNDO128 My phone was effected by this. I've been having issues with no T-Mobile service for the past couple of days on Project Fi. After reading this article, I used the Swappa IMEI checker and what do you know, my phone is reported "lost/stolen". I bought my Pixel on eBay at the beginning of January. Now I'm beyond their 30 day gaurentee. What an absolute clusterfuck. RTNDO128 My phone was effected by this. I've been having issues with no T-Mobile service for the past couple of days on Project Fi. After reading this article, I used the Swappa IMEI checker and what do you know, my phone is reported "lost/stolen". I bought my Pixel on eBay in the middle of February. Now I'm beyond their 30 day guarantee. What an absolute clusterfuck. Y2J You have 180 days in Paypal. RTNDO128 Thanks, I filed a claim with them. Hopefully this situation is covered. Max Did you contact first the seller? Otherwise it's a dick move to file a claim without first giving the seller the opportunity to see if he collaborates... RTNDO128 Thanks for your opinion. As stated, I'm beyond the 30 day eBay guarantee window. I created a "dispute" through the PayPal Resolution Center, which sends a message directly to the seller. PayPal is totally uninvolved with the dispute until I choose to escalate, which will only happen if I cannot get this resolved with the seller first. I just want to have our conversations documented in the event that the seller does not want to deal with this situation. Ken Kinda weird Google said that IMEI can't be blocked by manufacturer, I'm sure that's true. But what when manufacturer is also technically the carrier? Da_James Are you saying that "buying" a device in the USA doesn't mean you own it? Just SUE. Steve_Jobroni > as it's the carrier and not the manufacturer that has the ability to blacklist devices Do people not read the full article anymore? There seems to be a lot of Jabroni's blaming Google when it's the carrier that can only do the blacklisting. Sir_Brizz But that carrier is Project Fi, aka Google... Aleksandr Ivanov Change IMEI, problem solved! AbdulB1 lol Cassidy James Blaede I'd be interested in hearing how widespread this actually is, and a response from Google. My mom bought a Pixel from Swappa because Google was out of stock, and she's been loving it. I'd hate for her phone to become a brick because of this. Leonardo Baez I see a class action demand on the horizon? Đức Thành I'm a die-hard Google fan, but wow does Google need some fixing. justmy2pennies2012 There is one simple way Google can prevent the second hand market from making a profit. 1. Provide enough stock for all those who want to purchase the device! :) Bonus: Price the device accrodingly!! I gave up trying to buy one new from VZW and the Play Store. MisterAlex Did getting a Pixel phone through Fi require signing away your rights regarding "first sale?" And is that enforceable? RayNeverLearns You are Android Police. You might want to stay more up to date on this story and keep your readers updated, especially one that has a big impact on one of the purest Android flagships. http://www.techspot.com/news/69452-pixel-phones-project-fi-showing-up-blacklisted.html datkidpatrick happy to announce the phone i sold has been taken off the blacklist after communicating with project fi... so if you're affected by this contact google or more specifically project fi support... RayNeverLearns I believe Project Fi has done this for all affected Pixels. I didn't contact the person who sold it to me (Craigslist 7 months ago... wouldn't know where to even start) yet my phone was whitelisted earlier today. A little pain and it took almost 3 days, but a good resolution. datkidpatrick thats great... happy it's fixed...

Kevin Lee on May 25, 2017 at 10:05 am More As you are no doubt aware, Google recently added additional reporting and transparency to the Quality Score (QS) metric that’s all-important in terms of calculating Ad Rank. (If you’ve never watched the updated Ad Rank explanation video by Hal Varian, Google’s chief economist, I recommend you take a look.) Determining the relative importance of Quality Score components Google has provided advertisers with data on Quality Score for some time; what’s new here is historical trend data visibility into three key QS components: expected click-through rate, ad relevance and landing page experience. While being able to inspect these new, granular metrics is great, it’s important to realize that all we’re gaining is an estimated importance of each of these QS components. And just as in cooking or baking, the mere fact that you’ve got some ingredients on hand, plus a vague idea of how much of each ingredient to use, doesn’t predict (or result in) the best possible outcome. Think about these factors and scores as indicating the quality of each ingredient in a given dish (for example, meatloaf). While great ingredients are necessary for a great outcome, knowing the quality of each ingredient alone isn’t sufficient. To create a world-class meatloaf, we also need an understanding of their relative importance. Unfortunately, Google’s latest tweak doesn’t tell us anything about this. But while we don’t know for certain the rank order of the quality factors that have the highest impact on the final Quality Score, we do have a pretty good (anecdotally derived) idea that predicted CTR is the most important one (the others count as well, but likely less so). Expected CTR is likely to remain the most important for many reasons, not the least of which is that it makes Google the most money per search for them to calculate QS based heavily on that data. It’s important to remember that — as Varian indicates — it’s in Google’s best interest to incentivize marketers to do things that improve their ads’ relevance (or CTR) while also making the post-click user experience better. (Admit it, there’s still a lot of room for improvement out there — and not just on your site!) We also have to remember that higher CTRs and relevance make Google (and Bing, too) more money in the long run, so these incentives are completely aligned. TIP: If you’ve seen a historical jump in cost per click (CPC) required to maintain historical position, being able to inspect the historical Quality Score is a great way to determine whether the surge in CPC was based on a QS fluctuation on your end, or if it’s due to increased auction pressure in the AdWords marketplace. Improving Quality Score and other key metrics Google continues to make it clear that we should pay attention to improving Quality Score. One of the great things about obtaining Quality Score improvements is that these provide you with an edge in paid search. This edge is key — not just to achieving the high positions for the searches that can drive substantial profitable volume for you, but also because if you don’t have it, your competition does (which means they’ll kick your butt). But improving your Quality Score isn’t the only way to ensure your ability to remain in top positions profitably. Improvement in other areas can make a huge difference in your long-term success. My favorites are (starting from the things you can do at the AdWords side of things): Reorganize your accounts. Having poorly structured campaigns and ad groups will depress your Quality Score. This is a change you can make at the AdWords side of the equation. Fix lousy ad copy or creative. When ad copy resonates against the keywords in an ad group, your CTR goes up (and CTR is the biggest component of QS). Improve targeting. This includes anything from using the right negative keywords to eliminating poorly targeted ad impressions to using audiences and dayparting to be there in the SERP when your most targeted customers are itching to click. Improve conversion rate. Whether you’re an e-commerce or multichannel merchant business, B-to-B, lead gen or services business, anything you can do to get a greater percentage of site visitors to take actions you value is a leverage point. If more of your clicks convert, your allowable bid goes up. Strive for mobile-friendliness. This factor is related to improving conversion rate. Remember, the mobile site visitor is increasingly important to Google, and so Google is grading you on mobile-friendliness. (TIP: While using the Google Search Console can identify the more glaring problems, also make sure you walk around the office, grab a bunch of devices and test your site yourself.) Increase average shopping cart size (for retail). This includes getting high gross profit customers to call in and get upsold by reps. Increase social media engagement of clicks that come in through search. Social can have a multiplier effect on marketing. Improve your own response rate or fulfillment rate. Customers like speed. That’s why Amazon Prime rocks. But speed in follow-up is also important in any service business. Don’t forget that all of the above strategies will help your overall business, not just your performance in search. They will eliminate friction, make your other media more effective and deliver conversions at higher values, thus delivering a win to your company’s top and bottom line.

Name: Subject: Message: Why you won’t be using Bluetooth 5 on your Galaxy S8 just yet – Gary explains Featuresby Gary Sims11 hours ago 16 397 8 The Bluetooth Special Interest Group (Bluetooth SIG) announced Bluetooth 5 during the summer of 2016 and then towards the end of that year the new specification was officially ratified and we started to see Bluetooth 5 appear in hardware, first in development boards and then in consumer devices, most notably the Galaxy S8. Last month I got hold of a couple of Bluetooth 5 enabled nRF52840 development boards from Nordic Semiconductor. Using these I was able to test the real world capabilities of Bluetooth 5 and also cut through some of the marketing hype about the new standard. Most notably I was able to clear up the huge confusion around the ideas that Bluetooth 5 offers 4 times the range and twice the speed. In fact it turns out that Bluetooth 5 does offer (almost) twice the throughput when the two communicating devices are close to each other, but towards the edge of the possible range I demonstrated that Bluetooth 5 has the same throughput as Bluetooth 4. At the same time I busted some of the myths about Bluetooth 5 offering 4 times the range. The way it has been presented is that the 4x range and the 2x throughput work hand-in-hand, whereas the truth is that the extra range is only available when using a special connection type built into Bluetooth 5, known as a CODED connection. These CODED connections offer a very low throughput, around 109Kbps, but with the advantage of greater range. Bottom line, forget any dreams of taking your Bluetooth 5 enabled speakers out into the yard while your smartphone is in your bedroom and still getting a good connection speed. For more details on all this you really should watch my video the truth about Bluetooth 5. After my testing with the development boards, I turned my attention to the Samsung Galaxy S8. My aim was to hack together a quick app which allowed me to test the throughput between two Galaxy S8 handsets over Bluetooth 5. So I went to Samsung’s developer website to look for a Software Development Kit (SDK) or maybe some documentation about how to access the Bluetooth 5 features, but I found nothing. Thinking that maybe Android already supported Bluetooth 5 I headed over to the official Android Bluetooth documentation, but again nothing. At this point I was becoming a bit worried, did the Galaxy S8 really support Bluetooth 5? My first port of call was the Bluetooth SIG website. I was able to find there the official certificate that showed that from a hardware point of view the S8 does indeed support Bluetooth 5. But which bits of Bluetooth 5? Support for the 2 Mbps and Coded connections are optional in Bluetooth 5. The only connection that is mandatory is the 1 Mbps connection speed from Bluetooth 4. Fortunately the Galaxy S8 supports the 2Mbps connection speed, however it doesn’t support the CODED connections. This means there is no “4 times the range” support in the Galaxy S8. I emailed the PR people at Bluetooth SIG to try to get some more information. They replied quickly and very nicely, however they weren’t able to add much information. The only information that they could share about the S8 was what is on the certification page. This means there is no '4 times the range' support in the Galaxy S8. While I was talking with the Bluetooth people we (as in the Android Authority team) tried to get some answers from Samsung and from Google. Google At Google I/O, my esteemed colleague Kris Carlon sought out some clever engineers from Google to ask about Bluetooth 5. What we have found out is that Bluetooth 5 will be officially supported in Android O. In fact it is already in the developer preview versions of Android O and the source code has been published in the Android Open Source Project (AOSP). Android O will support the new 2Mbps connection and the new CODED connection type (for that extra range). It will also support the new longer advertising packets. So it looks like Google’s support for Bluetooth 5 in Android O is pretty good and includes everything we need and expect. However, before you get too excited, we must remember that Bluetooth 5 functionality will only be available in handsets which have the relevant Bluetooth 5 hardware (i.e. chipset). You can’t convert an older Bluetooth 4 device into a Bluetooth 5 device just by upgrading to Android O. What this means is that the Samsung Galaxy S8 is well positioned to get native Bluetooth 5 support from Android, but only when Samsung releases an Android upgrade from Nougat to O. Samsung This leads me to one conclusion, you can't use Bluetooth 5 on the Samsung Galaxy S8. While the Bluetooth SIG and Google were very helpful, I can’t say the same about Samsung. Several different members of the Android Authority team have asked different representatives in Samsung about the status of Bluetooth 5 in the Samsung Galaxy S8. We have had a couple of replies thanking us for our question and a promise of a reply, but so far nothing. It has been more than two weeks! Since there is no support in Android N for Bluetooth 5, there is the possibility that Samsung has included support itself or that there is an SDK which developers can use to access the Bluetooth 5 features. The normal port of call for such information is developer.samsung.com/galaxy. Samsung provides a range of software development tools for accessing features like multi-windowing, fingerprint recognition, the S Pen and so on. However there is nothing about Bluetooth 5. Specifically for the S8 there is information about the Edge Panel and Samsung DeX, but no Bluetooth 5 documentation. This leads me to one conclusion, you can’t use Bluetooth 5 on the Samsung Galaxy S8. Wrap-up The Galaxy S8 has the right hardware to support Bluetooth 5, but it doesn’t have the right software. If Google and Samsung follow last year’s playbook then Android O will be released sometime this summer (maybe August) and then Samsung will get to work on releasing a version for the S8. The upgrade to Nougat arrived for the S7 in January/February of this year, so it is likely that the S8 will get Android O during the first part of 2018. Until then the Bluetooth 5 capabilities of the S8 remain locked and unusable.

If that is the case, then take a back seat, fake news, because what we could have is a deliberate right-wing propaganda machine that is altering the way that voters perceive candidates and issues. It could be much more detrimental to our democracy than any fake news. The Guardian has revealed that extreme conservative ideology is cycled through popular social media sites through algorithms so it becomes pervasive, dominant, and constant. Social media manipulation is trouble for democratic society everywhere. Cambridge Analytica’s Data Mining and Trump’s Victory One company that drives data, Cambridge Analytica, goes so far as to take credit for Trump’s election win through its ability to manipulate media messages targeted at persuadable voters. According to the homepage of its website, Cambridge Analytica (CA) uses data to change audience behavior. If you click on the “Political” tab, you can eventually find a description that says, “CA Political’s industry-leading data services help you to find, understand, and engage with voters more effectively. Our services can be purchased individually and tailored to your needs, but combined they offer a fully end-to-end campaign package. CA Political provides clients with a truly quantifiable approach to campaigning.” It is a company that openly brags that the “expertise and intelligence” it provided to the Trump campaign spurred his election win. How did CA’s data analysis lead to what CA describes as the “most remarkable victory in modern U.S. political history?” Why is CA now suing The Guardian for a 2017 article titled, “Robert Mercer: the big data billionaire waging war on mainstream media?“ That article now has a subtitle, “This article is the subject of a legal complaint on behalf of Cambridge Analytica LLC and SCL Elections Limited.” What exactly happened with the Trump campaign data, according to The Guardian‘s inquiry? And do the forces behind his win continue to use data manipulation to influence the US government today? How Trump Campaign Data Links to Google Searches How does a 21st century data-driven campaign for an unlikely candidate for President of the USA work? By designating three integrated teams — research, data science, and digital marketing — CA was able to move millions of data points into targeted messages directed at “the most persuadable voters and the issues they cared about.” The purpose? Hit them with messages at key times to get them to take action to vote for Donald Trump. Doesn’t really sound like anything different than any other contemporary campaign, does it? Just wait. Data mining to target voters is only one aspect of the controversy around CA and The Guardian. In December 2016, writer Carole Cadwalladr chronicled how some topics, when searched on Google, resulted in responses that “were being dominated by right wing and extremist sites.” In an interview, Jonathan Albright, professor of communications at Elon University, North Carolina, says that his research reveals that right-wing news sites attempted to do what most commercial websites try to do: find tricks that elevate their placement on Google’s PageRank system. They try to “game” the algorithm. Albright’s mapping of the news ecosystem has divulged that millions of links between right-wing sites were “strangling” the mainstream media during the 2016 Presidential election. CA was cited by Albright as a company that sites like Breitbart could use to track people as they surf the web, including their visits to Facebook. They wanted to direct specific ads to their advantage. According to Albright: “They have created a web that is bleeding through on to our web. This isn’t a conspiracy. There isn’t one person who’s created this. It’s a vast system of hundreds of different sites that are using all the same tricks that all websites use. They’re sending out thousands of links to other sites and together this has created a vast satellite system of right wing news and propaganda that has completely surrounded the mainstream media system.” Ordering of search results does influence people, says Martin Moore, director of the Centre for the Study of Media, Communication and Power at King’s College, London. He explains, “There’s large-scale, statistically significant research into the impact of search results on political views. And the way in which you see the results and the types of results you see on the page necessarily has an impact on your perspective.” The results of Albright’s research that a vast network of right-wing sites feeds Google searches make me a little sick to my stomach. The Case Study of Donald Trump for President: “A Full-Scale Data-Driven Digital Campaign” Let’s return to the case study of CA’s data collection and analysis for the Donald Trump presidential campaign. Let’s try to figure out what CA did that was different — and how The Guardian‘s expose was so controversial that it led to a lawsuit. CA built 20 custom data models to forecast the voter behavior of 180,000 individuals. Their digital marketing efforts led to a large-scale operation with 8-figure ad budgets and an infrastructure that supported all aspects of the campaign, “influencing voters where and when it counted.” The responses from each individual polled by phone or online were matched with existing data in CA’s database. They analyzed numerous topics — “from their voting history to the car they drive.” As they did so, CA correlated individual behaviors with voting decisions. These models allowed CA to predict the way individuals would vote, even without the backdrop of knowing their specific political beliefs. In essence, consumer and personal behaviors led to data organization and predicted which candidates the polled individuals would most likely prefer when it came time to vote. Then CA organized voters into different categories and determined the best way to influence them through marketing. With these audience segments identified, CA created and implemented a marketing strategy for Trump fundraising. Get Out the Vote programs, heavily laden with persuasive motifs, included targeted advertisements in key battleground states that were directed to the most persuadable voters. Designing Algorithms for Social Media Manipulation What’s essential to understand here is that CA collaborated with “30+ ad tech partners.” Cadwalladr at The Guardian wrote that “Google’s search results on certain subjects were being dominated by right wing and extremist sites.” CA’s marketing operation utilized a number of platforms, including social media, search engine advertising, and YouTube. By using the social media that polled individuals tended to frequent most often, CA was able to appeal to voters using language and imagery in ways very familiar to this audience — ways they would understand and to which they would respond strongly. “We used our data infrastructure to target voters who could be influenced in the most meaningful way. For example, if they cared about healthcare, targeted adverts directed them to websites explaining Trump’s views on the matter.” Trump’s views on healthcare, according to a October 9, 2016, Business Insider article, were criticisms about the Affordable Care Act as having “resulted in runaway costs, websites that don’t work, greater rationing of care, higher premiums, less competition, and fewer choices.” Words like “runaway,” “don’t work,” “rationing,” “higher,” “less,” and “fewer” worked to demoralize persuadable voters who may have already been struggling with health care costs in addition to other living expenses. If, as Albright’s research indicates, millions of links between right-wing sites were responsible for “strangling” the media, CA’s data mining and categorization during the Trump campaign may have worked as triggers to persuade undecided voters that the Trump Republican narrative was normal, sensible, and fiscally responsible. CA kept polling and assessing the Trump campaign progress in an real-time basis, with 17 states pinpointed as essential battleground states and 1500 people polled weekly in those key areas. More important than any other element, CA could also identify which voters were likely to support Donald Trump. Through social media portals that rerouted right-wing messages in deeply complex cycles, potential voters viewed right-wing rhetoric so frequently that it became a familiar message. Dr. Jonathan Rust, director of Cambridge University’s Psychometric Centre, says, “The danger of not having regulation around the sort of data you can get from Facebook and elsewhere is clear. With this, a computer can actually do psychology, it can predict and potentially control human behavior. It’s what the scientologists try to do but much more powerful. It’s how you brainwash someone. It’s incredibly dangerous. “It’s no exaggeration to say that minds can be changed. Behavior can be predicted and controlled. I find it incredibly scary. I really do. Because nobody has really followed through on the possible consequences of all this. People don’t know it’s happening to them. Their attitudes are being changed behind their backs.” So, CA influenced voter intention, and it also inspired people to take specific actions. What were the results? “Donations increased, event turnouts grew, and inactive voters who favored Trump were motivated to get out and vote on election day.” In the final months, reports based on the new data that emerged from polling were sent daily to the Trump campaign. Those reports demonstrated how voters might be shifting their perceptions of issues and candidates. What might that have looked like? Well, with CA’s ability to assess state-by-state reactions to any political event, they were able to understand any unexpected shifts in voting intention. The constant FBI Director Comey announcements about Secretary Clinton’s emails come to mind. With great pride, CA argues that its “work informed the campaign strategy and meant key voters, who might otherwise have stayed home, were reached in their own backyards. This ultimately contributed to the extraordinary victory of Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election.” CA’s efforts toward the Trump campaign, with data-driven marketing techniques, changed behavior in target populations. In other words, CA assisted the Trump campaign to use technology platforms to give voice to racists and xenophobes, according to Cadwalladr in another story in The Guardian. And the results continue to snowball. Trump boasted that Apple CEO Tim Cook called to congratulate him soon after his election victory. “And there will undoubtedly be pressure on them to collaborate,” says Moore at the Centre for the Study of Media, Communication, and Power. There are other reasons to be really concerned over and above Google right-wing search domination and CA’s 30+ media technology partners that have contributed to social media manipulation. What if one person has donated $45 million to different Republican political campaigns and another $50 million to right-wing, ultra-conservative nonprofits? Is he, as Cadwalladr suggests, “trying to reshape the world according to his personal beliefs?” Hedge Fund Billionaire Robert Mercer: The Man behind the Trump Data Mining & Manipulation He’s a brilliant but reclusive computer scientist. He made his fortune in language processing science that fed into today’s AI. Afterward, as joint CEO of Renaissance Technologies, a hedge fund that makes its money by using algorithms to model and trade on the financial markets, he became a billionaire. What has Mercer done to single-handedly promote right-wing agendas? He: funded the Heartland Institute, renowned for its climate denial and across-the-board fight against regulation; donated to the Media Research Center, which has a mission of “correcting liberal bias;” propped up Steve Bannon with $10 million for Breitbart; and, reportedly holds a $10 million stake in Cambridge Analytica (CA), which was spun out of a bigger British company called SCL Group. The Guardian claims that, “with links to Donald Trump, Steve Bannon, and Nigel Farage, the right wing U.S. computer scientist is at the heart of a multi-million dollar propaganda network.” And we are its tools: our social media conversations and interests are being redirected to win votes through ideological mechanisms that are invisible to us. Maybe it’s a coincidence that Greg Gianforte, a Republican technology executive who was charged with assault, defeated Rob Quist, the Democratic candidate, in a special election for Montana’s at-large House of Representatives seat. Or maybe not. Emma Briant, a propaganda specialist at the University of Sheffield, says that CA and other data mining sites like it have the technological tools to effect behavioral and psychological change. The social media sites where we go for leisure and relaxation are a new space where international geopolitics is being played out in real time, and we’re pawns in the game. It’s a new age of persuasion and social media manipulation, and, if Cadwalladr’s research stands up in court, we need to be hypervigilant about the sources we believe and the inferences we make based on those sources.

Anyways, the company had a marketing conference this week and it revealed that it wants to make money on Google Assistant. No kidding. New Beauty & the Beast promo is one way Google could monetize Home. cc: @gsterling @dannysullivan pic.twitter.com/9UlukSocrO — brysonmeunier (@brysonmeunier) March 16, 2017 How? Well, for starters, perhaps you’ll see more of those promotions during the “My Day” briefings from your Google Home. That one for Disney’s “Beauty and the Beast” revamp was an unpaid experiment, but it’s just one option the tech giant can take. The likeliest path — also the one of least resistance — is to use an existing ad product where suggested retailers in traditional search results will also get mentioned when a user asks, “Hey, where can I get XYZ?” Google Assistant may also play off of Alexa’s ability to buy stuff from Amazon in an instant, but instead of Amazon, it’d be through partner retailers through its search engine operations. Each sale would earn Mountain View a cut of the revenue. We’re not exactly cutting brave and bold new grounds like Burger King did, but Google could use less of the controversy as our data overlord at this point.

[Update: False alert] Google says gifting in the Play Store is "Infeasible," marks it as "Won't Fix" in the Issue Tracker Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 4:14am PDTMay 26, 2017 13 Plus 1 on G+ 61 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares117 Google News Update 1: 2017/05/26 5:03am PDT False alert. Issue was closed in 2013 because it was submitted to the wrong tracker. You know how almost every app or software store lets you buy apps and gift them to someone else? Well, you better put your dreams of ever doing that on Android to rest. Or burying them under 10 feet of disappointment. Someone at Google recently took a look at the Issue Tracker, saw the issue labeled "Implement Gifts within Android Market," which has been added back in 2010 when the Play Store was still the Android Market and which has gathered over 1100 stars and hundreds of comments from users requesting app gifting, and decided to be the bearer of bad news because you know what, this is "infeasible" and Google "won't fix" it. But the writing has been on the wall for a few days; we could have seen it coming if we had been playing closer attention. Credit gifting disappeared from the US Play Store on May 16, and then the support page for Google Play gift cards and promo codes was updated on May 17 to replace the "Google Play credit gifts" section with "Google Play book gifts." That change clearly shows that credit gifting was completely gone, not a glitch, and that from now on, you can only gift music and books, but definitely not credit. Above: Pre-May 17. Below: Current support page. Put 1 and 1 together and you understand that the future of gifting or buying someone credit on Google Play is grim. You better kill your dreams of purchasing apps/games for your friends or employees, gifting a niece or nephew some Play credit for new games educational apps, or encouraging your parents to use a certain app by buying it for them. I still can't wrap my head around the fact that Google, the behemoth that can make AI understand every word I say and predict the news I want to read and the traffic on my way to work, is saying that app gifting is "Infeasible" when other app stores have clearly managed to make it feasible. I'm sure there's a reason, but I can't think of any that would be unsurmountable for Google but not for others, or any that would apply to apps and games but not to books and music. The latter traditionally carry a lot more licensing and legislative limits than apps/games. As a consolation, you can turn to Google Play gift cards and Family Sharing in the countries where they're available to share or send apps and games to others. Update 1: 2017/05/26 5:03am PDT False alert. Issue was closed in 2013 because it was submitted to the wrong tracker. I apologize for the false alert. It looks like the issue was actually marked as "Infeasible" back in 2013 because it was posted to the wrong issue tracker and couldn't be fixed by the AOSP team but had to be submitted to the Google Product Forums instead. The issue has just picked up a lot of comments recently, which brought it to the attention of our tipster and thus our inbox, and with the recent disappearance of the Play credit gifting option, we incorrectly assumed there was a link there. What remains true though is that credit gifting is completely gone and you can only send music and books now. There's no proof that app/game gifting wouldn't make an appearance at some point, so I suppose there's a silver lining somewhere.

Rita El Khoury Yup, as shown in the screenshots, Books and Music gifting is available. But credit buying for others or gifting apps/games is now a dead dream. FaultException It was marked infeasible because it was on the wrong issue tracker, and it was back in 2013, not recently at all. See comment #108 on the issue where it was marked. Suicide_Note Not a big deal, really. demarcmj Agree. Low tech is better... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/276e854598d2a91aa3a795a84e4ecbec4f4f587c8e3da3c55b968c90ad4ec402.jpg Kristian Ivanov https://gfycat.com/RevolvingEdibleCivet h4rr4r Totally wrong article actually. This issue tracker is not for the play store. Thomas Gladdines If I ever had to implement gifting apps I would make it an in app purchase and then simply show a 100% off coupon. Dirk Google's New Logo Leaked https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d76f12396d72e618315517d469ee19d7f2a28065b296266f029594216b2e0728.png Kristian Ivanov I was thinking of posting a really witty comment about this, but the disappointment level was so low that I kind'a don't feel it's worth the effort. Nicholas Conrad Witty comment status: won't fix. Kristian Ivanov It was going to be awesome though, it involved old people, polar bears and a skateboard...oh well, at some point in the future when this is in the news again I'll post it :c Daniel But there's a good reason for it, it's not just that Google is evil: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36916787#comment108 Status: Won't Fix (Infeasible) This report applies to a mobile Google application or service, and the issue tracker where you reported it specializes in issues within the Open Source source code of the Android platform. We are not able to provide support for Google products in this issue tracker. Please report this issue in the appropriate Google Product Forum at https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/en/ God of chaos It all makes sense now! demarcmj Reading!?! What is this sorcery? Rita El Khoury Ugh... My ctrl+F skills failed me, I admit. Also my little knowledge of how the Issue Tracker works. I could see when or why it was marked as Infeasible so I incorrectly assumed it was now, when the comments flared up again. Nicholas Conrad Don't get down on yourself Rita, we all have days like this at work. Even knowing the premise of the article was mistaken, I'd rather read it again than another JRE video summary article. Rita El Khoury Thanks... I guess?! demarcmj The issue tracker is partly at fault. If you hover over the resolution in that side panel, the mouse turns to the finger like it's a link... but clicking on it doesn't do anything. You would think it would take you to the resolution post for more details. But nope. Rita El Khoury Exactly. I was thinking there's something wrong with Chrome or my connection and restarted it, but clicking wouldn't take me anywhere, so I was like... well, seems like this doesn't show an explanation. demarcmj Doesn't work in Firefox or IE either (haven't tried it in Edge, or whatever they're calling the Windows 10 browser). Do they have an issue tracker for the issue tracker? Mark R. Andrachek, Jr. No. But they might have a product forum. Which nobody at google will ever check, and some "community volunteer" will suggest your reboot your PC. Rita El Khoury Arghhhhh... You're right. Many of us here at AndroidPolice looked at this and we failed to see that it was marked as Infeasible in 2013. I'll edit the post to ad that info. In our defense, many of us at AP looked at this tip and thought the status change was new, especially with the way comments were flaring up on it in the past day and with all the changes to Google Play credit gifting. Daniel No problem! :) Thanks for adding the info FaultException It wasn't marked as infeasble recently, it was marked in 2013, because it's the wrong forum (the tracker is for AOSP/Android itself) See comment #108: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36916787#comment108 demarcmj Yup... and most of the comments since then are people bickering about not wanting to receive emails every time someone comments on the issue. Real productive thread they have going on over there [eyeroll] Zomby2D I'm guilty of contributing to the email pollution. I had the issue starred but I haven't been getting email notifications for the longest time from this. I don't even remember noticing that it had been closed all that time ago. I just started receiving notifications again last week and figured that the ticket being closed was the reason why people were suddenly complaining. Having the reason for closing it lost in the sea of comments didn't help. Rita El Khoury Right. Fixing the post to reflect that. Dennis Ulijn I can also see the fact that people buy 100 apps with a stolen credit card and sell them on the black market, like G2A or G2play. You talk about a lot of other stores doing this already, but the uplay and steam store have had a lot of problems with this and still have those problems, without a good way to combat it. Besides that, how will you solve the VAT system? Who pays? I can see how a lot of people want it, and of course i don't mind having the possibility, but there are more problems than 'just implement it'. Carson Saldanha I think it's due to security reasons but that sucks... h4rr4r Read the update! couldn't be fixed by the AOSP team but had to be submitted to the Google Product Forums instead. h4rr4r Good retraction, update! Rita El Khoury "because it was posted to the wrong issue tracker and couldn't be fixed by the AOSP team but had to be submitted to the Google Product Forums instead." Isn't that enough of an explanation? h4rr4r I was at first talking about just the update line. But on reading the full explanation I thought it was pretty good. Ideally the update line at the top would say something about why not when. Rita El Khoury That's an automatically truncated blurb that our WordPress theme does at the top. I'll manually change it to clarify that in a bit, I was just in a rush to update the post before we got more comments telling us how wrong we were. h4rr4r YAY! krazyfrog Apple has had App Store gifting for all content since years now and somehow it's "infeasible" for Google. 🙄 Rita El Khoury Refresh your page ;) Peter World Citizen I had seen people got fired for lesser mistakes. ;) Rita El Khoury We'd be firing half the AP team and Artem. Many of us looked at this and didn't notice. Guess the post I/O haziness hasn't dissipated yet. Mark R. Andrachek, Jr. Google's Issue Tracker recently got a re-vamp. They can control, I'm sure, what the closed states are for things in their own tracker. They really need to have a closed/won't fix state that indicates that the issue has been raised in the wrong venue going forward, if they want to keep the issue tracker limited to just AOSP. These kind of things keep coming up in the AOSP issue tracker and _will continue_ to come up in the AOSP tracker if nothing changes. They don't expose issue tracking for anything else. Finding these product forums at all, much less the right one, is an exercise in madness. And then when you do find them, they're typically staffed by unpaid community volunteers. Chances are high that nobody from Google will actually see your issue, much less respond. It's like shouting into the void. Funem They should just make it so you can purchase an item, then chose to install it or create a sort of promo code which you can then just give to someone to use. They could tie it in to the promo code system they have now. Until its claimed you could still retain the option to install it by using the code yourself. prwnd Dear Community, I suggested this and I apologise because I did not find it was changed in 2013.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Hamza Shaban By Hamza Shaban May 26 at 2:53 PM China’s 19-year-old Go player Ke Jie reacts during the second match against Google’s artificial intelligence programm AlphaGo in Wuzhen, eastern China’s Zhejiang province on May 25, 2017. AFP PHOTO / STR / China OUTSTR/AFP/Getty Images test AI: 2, Humanity: 0. A computer designed by Google researchers has beaten the world’s top Go player for the second game in a row, capturing the best-of-three match in Wuzhen, China, and confirming AI’s supremacy in what many consider as one of humanity’s most complex boardgames. Ke Jie, a 19-year old Go grandmaster, began the game with stellar play, said Demis Hassabis, the CEO of DeepMind, the artificial intelligence firm that created AlphaGo, at a press conference, according to the Associated Press. Google acquired his company in 2014. But the Chinese prodigy was eventually bested by AlphaGo. In South Korea last year, DeepMind’s machine defeated another championship-caliber player, Lee Sedol, stunning some in the field of artificial intelligence. “For the first 100 moves it was the closest we’ve ever seen anyone play against the Master version of AlphaGo,” Hassabis said after the game, according to the Verge. “Today’s game was different from the first,” Ke said Thursday at the press conference, according to the Verge. “AlphaGo made some moves which were opposite from my vision of how to maximize the possibility of winning. I also thought I was very close to winning the game in the middle but maybe that’s not what AlphaGo was thinking.” AlphaGo’s sudden dominance over human competitors has surprised AI researchers, who had suspected that machines would take much more time to master the intricacies of Go. The program began as a research project three years ago. In a 2016 Nature article, Google said that AlphaGo had beaten European champion Fan Hui, five games to zero, in a match that took place during the previous October, behind closed doors. That marked the first time any computer program had beaten a professional player at Go. The program went on to beat more stand out players. AlphaGo’s wins have revealed the ways that computers can augment human capability and spur new ways of thinking. And more broadly, the computer program’s feat helps validate a more optimistic take on the future of automation and AI, one in which humans aren’t necessarily displaced, but are enhanced in some way. This week’s match in China also demonstrated the very human limitations that can surface amid competition, primarily how stress and emotions can hinder decision making.“I was very excited. I could feel my heart bumping,” Ke said after the game, The New York Times reported. “Maybe because I was too excited I made some stupid moves.” Beyond the game of Go, DeepMind scientists believe that the technology that powers AlphaGo can help societies develop better ways to conserve energy and boost health research. The third and final game pitting Ke against AlphaGo will take place on Saturday, as part of Google’s “Future of Go Summit.” Another match will feature two professional human players facing one another, but each will have their own AlphaGo teammate. business on-innovations innovations Dallas shooting updates News and analysis on the deadliest day for police since 9/11. post_newsletter353 follow-dallas false after3th false Please provide a valid email address.

Google Maps v9.54 prepares to add saved locations for your school and gym, notification channels, and what looks like a task list [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 6:22am PDTMay 26, 2017 35 Plus 1 on G+ 54 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares139 APK Teardown Applications Downloads What's Really New Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 Saved locations for School and Gym 1.2 The 'Other' Notification Channel 1.3 A few new prompts 1.4 A task list called "Nearby Need?" 2 Download An update to Google Maps v9.54 began rolling out to users through the beta channel yesterday, but it doesn't appear to have any visible changes going live quite yet. However, a teardown of the apk does bring a few hints about what to expect in the future. There are clues about a couple of new saved destinations like the Home and Work slots that have become so useful, the first stirring of support for Android O's notification channels, a few new "promos" to get people interested in various features, and a very curious feature that might turn out to be a task list of sorts. As usual, we've got a link at the bottom to download this update to sideload if you're not interested in waiting for Google to deliver it to your device. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Saved locations for School and Gym If you find yourself regularly using the Home and Work saved locations for quick navigation, you'll enjoy this one. The Maps team is expanding the list to include two more common destinations: your gym and your school. <string name="GYM_LOCATION">Gym</string> <string name="SCHOOL_LOCATION">School</string> Since those two strings don't really include any specific telltale signs that they're intended to be default saved locations, I've included the two previously existing lines for Home and Work for comparison. It's pretty obvious that the naming convention matches up. <string name="HOME_LOCATION">Home</string> <string name="WORK_LOCATION">Work</string> There is also a newly added icon for education, which I would naturally assume will go with the School destination. There doesn't appear to be a similar icon dedicated to the Gym slot, but it's not as if Google can't easily color-fill the existing fitness icon. Nevertheless, this one missing icon might be a hint that Google won't make these new destination slots available until a future update includes the missing icon. These two new entries will obviously operate just like Home and Work for the purposes of navigation and quick route selection. And as always, users don't have to actually link these slots to real schools or gyms. I'm sure a lot of people will welcome this simple improvement because so many of us travel to more than just work and home in a typical day. The 'Other' Notification Channel I'll just make a quick mention of this topic since it's not really that interesting. Google Maps is going to have a notification channel on Android O titled "Other notifications." <string name="OTHER_NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL">Other notifications</string> I doubt this will be the only custom channel for Maps. After all, there are several subsections in Settings dedicated to each notification type, so we'll probably see the channel list grow a fair amount in the future. I would assume the Maps team is still trying to decide how to best organize the app's notifications. This "other" channel will probably become a placeholder for most of the notifications until they are organized into suitable channels. A few new prompts I normally skip changes that are meant to advertise existing features, but sometimes the focus of banners and notifications can give a little insight into the features and apps that may not be performing as well as expected or simply need user awareness. The latest Maps update includes three new promos. The first banner is for the Google Trips app. Launched around this time last year, Trips is basically an itinerary management app that's also intended for making local recommendations. Trips probably doesn't have a very substantial user base yet, so it's not hard to imagine why Google is trying to breathe a little more life into it. code <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_TITLE">Take your travel info with you</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_TITLE_WITH_AREA_NAME">Take your %1$s travel info with you</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_BODY">Reservations • Things to do • Day plans</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_DOWNLOAD_LINK">Get Google Trips app</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_DISMISS_LINK">No thanks</string> The next addition is intended to get users to try out the recently launched location sharing feature. It's pretty normal to show prompts to get users only newly released features, so there's nothing unusual about this one, but you can probably expect to see it in your navigation setup soon. code <string name="CAR_TI TLE_JOURNEY_SHARING">Share journey</string> <string name="JOURNEY_SHARING_PENDING_PROMPT_TEXT">Share your trip with %1$s</string> <string name="JOURNEY_SHARING_PENDING_PROMPT_TTS">Sharing your real-time location with %1$s until you arrive.</string> <string name="CAR_MENU_START_JOURNEY_SHARING">Share journey</string> <string name="CAR_MENU_STOP_JOURNEY_SHARING">Stop sharing</string> The final promotional banner will belong to the always familiar Local Guides program. As usual, it's going to encourage users to contribute to Maps for points. The one interesting oddity is that these strings have "v2" in their names. It's possible this just means they are for a new set of promos, or this might hint at a revised version of the points program. I would expect the former, but it's at least worth acknowledging the latter is possible. code <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_TITLE">Reach new Local Guides levels</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_TEXT">Now earn more points for your reviews, photos, edits, and adding new places.</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_GOTO_STATS">SEE YOUR LEVEL</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_OPEN_HELP">Learn more</string> A task list called "Nearby Need?" There's very little to go on for this topic, but it looks just weird enough that I suspect there's a feature brewing in there somewhere. A pair of new layouts were added with the name "nearby need," one of which defines the look of a list, and the other is for items in that list. There is also a single string with a related name and just the word "navigate" for text. <string name="NEARBY_NEED_NAVIGATE">Navigate</string> /layout/nearby_need_item.xml /layout/nearby_need.xml Based on this very limited amount of information, it does sound a little like a shopping list of sorts. Perhaps less like a grocery list and more like a list of chores or tasks – e.g. getting new tires on the car, picking up some materials for a weekend project, and buying new clothes. I would assume each item goes into a list and Google Maps will make it easy to navigate to the next nearest place where each of these things can be taken care of. I'm not actually sure if these are related, but there are also three new images to be found in the resources, and they certainly would fit with my theory. The first is for creating new tasks, the second is for completed tasks, and the final one is for "old" completed tasks. I suppose the old one might be for things a user did on previous days but hasn't removed from the list. This is all guesswork right now, but many people have been asking for ways to use Maps to get through chores, and this feels like the first hint of something like that. The one aspect that's not yet hinted at, but I certainly hope to see, is a feature that will sort tasks efficiently so people can choose the shortest (or fastest) route to get everything done. I'll keep watching and follow up when there are more developments. Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

They are used when you go to Your Contributions -> Check the Facts/Uncover Missing info. I think after all this time those two are still only for lvl 5 local guides... so yeah. Cody Toombs Right, the look of the images aren't new, but the files containing those images are. Or said more clearly, there are now multiple copies of those icons. mmark27 I sure would like there to be a "Work" and then a "Parking for Work" section for those that don't park right next to their office. Point being, if I want walking direction/estimations, give them from my office. If I want driving directions/estimations on time, know that I have to walk to my car, then drive from my parking location. The School addition will be good to finally have pop up automatically now though. Cody Toombs If you're not going to use all four slots for their intended purpose, you might just assign one of the others to be your work parking. Frankly, I would have liked these saved slots to have custom labels, since some people don't fit into this one shape. For example, I know somebody that has to travel to two different sites for the same job, and another friend that was enrolled in two different schools at the same time. It's not like one of these destinations can't go into the "Gym" slot, but it would be nice if the titles could make sense. mmark27 Right. I now have my "Work" location saved as my parking lot, which is silly, but it's the only way to get decent estimations. Your fix is what I'll be doing otherwise unless they fix it. The subtly though in this situation is El Goog knowing that the Work and Work Parking are linked existentially, so they can decipher where my body is and estimate from there, etc. Same can be said for Home and Home Parking if not directly on site. Would seem like Google's apartment-city-dwelling-first mentality would be more amenable to this off the bat. I agree that we should be able to have free labels on places and also as many places as we can stomach estimations/notifications on time to. Google knows where I am at all times....make it actually useful, guys. henleyb I work from home and Google would keep asking me to set my work address which is of course the same as my home address, it was a small but annoying thing. :) Austin Spangrud Sure would be nice if maps got integrated assistant into it. None of the commands and home commands that I have integrate with the Voice button in maps. Oh and In b4 where's my speed limit pop up Cody Toombs Speed limits are still limited geographically. Since I was in the Bay Area last week, I finally saw them pop up for the first time on my phone and in Android Auto. Funny enough, I now have a Speed Limit toggle in settings on one phone, but nowhere else :/ And now I'm probably not going to see the speed limits again for a long time. Paul_Werner Yeah and we used to have them and they disappeared. At least it did for me here in the Milwaukee, WI area. Same for when I travel to Chicago Nicholas Matranga Finally, it was so annoying to have to save my school address as my work address just to get commute updates. mike shwilly Grow up Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez Finally, Im glad that we can save more pinned-saved choices other than the usual Home and Work, although I would prefer to customize them on my own in the same manner we customize the saved list. I could make a really good use of few in my mind like Church, Work2, University, etc. Jon Xuereb Couldn't you use this school one for University Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez I used the word University just an example, the point is that it would be great to customize those pinned saves using our own creations. Paul_Werner I can't wait to see that "nearby need" implemented. Your guesswork on it sounds like it could be a really useful feature. h4rr4r Why are these static names? Why can't I add random strings and assign them saved locations? Ken Vincent what ever happened to speed limits? I thought that was on the verge of being a thing more then a year ago. UKTK8 "In the coming weeks" Meaning whenever Google d#$% well pleases. Jon Xuereb Lawyers I'm assuming dmo580 Yet Waze and other GPS apps have no issues. How about just displaying my current speed? Ken Vincent Not only that, but google provides speed limits as a service. I would imagine that is where Waze gets their speed limit info. https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/roads/speed-limits Jon Xuereb Because Google Maps is exponentially larger in terms of user base, and google is a bigger target for lawsuits Ken Vincent Waze is wholly owned by Google. They are not even an Alphabet company, they are Google. Jon Xuereb Still the size of the userbase affects the their risk assessment icyhotmike why not just let us add "Saved" locations such as Home and Work and whatever else we want? Damn Google in control of everything. makapav My God the Google apps and ecosystem are becoming such a clusterfuck with no sources of truth for data points. All the information is spread across random places. Richard Oldroyd I do use home a lot but for the others like gym I save as a contact and nav just as quick. Richard Oldroyd I'd love maps to display my current speed and advise what the speed limit is. Obviously they would have to add a warning saying they can not be held responsible for displaying an incorrect speed limit. I'd also like to see us be able to choose what is displayed underneath where they show destination time and miles to go, it would be useful to see arrival times at all stops not just the one you are currently naving to.

Name: Subject: Message: How OEM skins benefit stock Android Featuresby Robert Triggs13 hours ago 18 395 26 We all have our own reasons for loving Android, ranging from our favourite OEMs design language to a great feature that can’t be found elsewhere, or perhaps just a great value price point. This is mostly thanks to some healthy competition and a sprinkling of strong product diversity. But this isn’t just true for hardware, Android software can be just as diverse, as OEMs attempt to put their own spin on things in a bid to stand out. Some more successfully than others, it has to be said. Love them or loathe them, various OEM skins have enhanced and even innovated enough on stock Android to even become incorporated as key features in future versions. Despite the odd disaster, on the whole custom OEM skins and software have been a good thing for the broader ecosystem. Here are just some of the ways that OEM skins have benefited stock Android. Notification toggles and quick settings To start our trip we’ll go all the way back to the days of Gingerbread, that’s all the way back to Android 2.3 for those who prefer to deal in version numbers. We may take them for granted today, but notification toggles – the speedy way that you quickly turn your WiFi or Bluetooth on and off – and other quick settings haven’t always been within such easy reach. This feature actually made its debut courtesy of Samsung. It first appeared in the company’s Touchwiz 4.0 software built on Gingerbread, and the same feature wasn’t supported by Google until the launch of Ice Cream Sandwich (Android 4.0). That’s not a massively long gap between the two, but Samsung was a good year ahead of Google on this one. We should also give a hat tip to the rooting community too here, as they were also ahead of the curve and brought this particular feature to a wide range of devices before it was officially a core feature of Android too. I’m sure many of you veterans will fondly remember rooting and/or installing apps in order to stick convenient toggle buttons in your notification tray. Power Toggles anyone? See also: ‘Notification Dots’ bring notifications to your icons - Diving into Android O 1 week ago Multi-window Heavy multi-taskers would probably struggle to get by without multi-window support these days, and it’s now considered an important enough feature to finally be included in the AOSP as of Android 7.0 Nougat. However, multi-window is much much older than that, and a number of OEMs have included such a feature for years. Even Google talked about the idea back in the Honeycomb tablet days. The two most prominent OEMs supporting multi-window tools have been LG and Samsung. LG debuted its version of multi-window, known as split-view, back with the G3. Samsung introduced its version of Multi-Window even earlier, at the launch of the Galaxy S3. Although it should be noted that app support was much more limited in the features’ early days than it is now. This is certainly a piece of software that has improved with time. Interestingly, Samsung is still ahead of the curve when it comes to multi-window support, having also long including the ability to resize floating windows as well, which is particularly handy for Note users. LG also equipped many of its flagships with a similar technology called QSlide, which appeared all the way back with the Optimus G. Code for this feature has been spotted in core Android too, under the name Freeform Mode, but isn’t officially supported just yet. Miracast and content streaming Google’s Chromecast is the company’s most successful hardware product and has brought cost effective smart TV features and content streaming to a huge number of consumers. Casting is now an integrated part of Android and even Google’s Chrome browser. Although Chromecast and “casting” might now be household names, this technology actually just Google’s take on a bigger and older industry standard – Miracast. Miracast is a peer-to-peer wireless screencasting standard that uses Wi-Fi Direct connections to transfer audio and video data to another compatible device, usually a Wi-Fi enabled TV. Miracast has been supported in Android since version 4.2 and was quickly adopted by a wide range of OEMs, despite being dependant on OEMs implementing compatible hardware and software. A number of OEMs actually supported this technology before it was baked into stock Android too, including Samsung’s Galaxy S3 and Note 2, which ran Android 4.1 out of the box. Chromecast, on the other hand, uses an HDMI port, allowing it to be connected to devices that don’t normally support streaming. and also allows devices to multitask while streaming content. I should point out that Chromecast is not based on Miracast technology, so it’s not a like for like comparison. However, by supporting Miracast and Wi-Fi streaming in the early years, OEMs have certainly helped content streaming become a livingroom phenomenon. Fingerprint Scanner API Much like casting, fingerprint scanners are now viewed as an almost essential feature in today’s Android phones and software support is now firmly embedded in stock Android. However, Google itself didn’t do all of the work on the fingerprint API that is now being used to secure a wide range of apps. Much of the early work on fingerprint technology came from Samsung and LG, in order to keep up with Apple’s iPhone. Samsung debuted its first fingerprint scanner inside the Galaxy S5, which shipped with Android 4.4.2 KitKat. Due to this being an OEM specific implementation, the Galaxy S5 and the Note 4 only worked with Samsung’s in-house fingerprint API designed specifically for its hardware. The universal Fingerprint API wasn’t introduced into core Android until 6.0 Marshmallow, due in no small part to the cooperation of a number of OEMs. Thankfully, support in stock Android meant that software developers didn’t have to use OEM specific SDKs anymore in order to support the feature. Now all Android devices with a fingerprint scanner use the same API, making it much easier for developers to create supported apps. From originally just using your finger to unlock your phone, continued development now means that we can use our fingerprint to verify financial transactions and log into a variety of apps. Full screen app pages Collecting a wide range of app data onto a single page is now a staple of many an Android OEM skin, and often extends to include fitness data and social media updates, as well as news from various sources. Modern examples include Samsung’s Bixby Home and the Google Launcher, but the pioneer of this particular feature as part of a stock experience was HTC’s Blinkfeed. Blinkfeed first appeared inside the HTC One M7, which was on the scene way before Google implemented a similar idea inside its stock launcher. Other OEMs were also pretty early on this bandwagon, Samsung offered up news pages on its flagship phones via Flipboard Briefings, which came preinstalled on some Galaxy S6 and S7 handsets. LG also introduced a similar idea called the “Smart Notice” widget with the G3, that attempted to provide additional information about traffic, weather, and memos. This type of data collation and contextual information wasn’t always hugely useful at the time, but in a way it was also a precursor to today’s increasingly popular virtual assistants. Themes glorious themes Now we all know that various OEMs have tweaked the look and feel, as well as the features, of stock Android to help make their software look more distinctive. While opinions about aesthetics will always fall prey to individual tastes, some OEM efforts in the theming space have had a bigger impact on the scene than just introducing their various flavor. I’m talking about the Runtime Resource Overlay (RRO), or Layers as it’s also known, which is used by a number of ROMs for their theme engines, including Sony’s Xperia, CyanogenMod, and a selection of other custom ROMs. The Runtime Resource Overlay was originally developed by Sony in order to support its Xperia Themes options because stock Android, which was on Lollipop at the time, didn’t provide adequate capabilities. After some revisions to security, Sony’s Runtime Resource Overlay was eventually merged into stock Android. As a result, all OEMs now have access to these customization tools, even though Google still doesn’t use or publicise the feature. Samsung, LG, HTC, and others are all using at least part of RRO for their theme engines, making it perhaps one of the largest concealed contributions to the way that modern OEM launchers look and function. Wrap Up Clearly, there have been plenty of instances throughout Android’s history where OEMs have implemented major firsts ahead of stock Android, which in time have become core components of the OS itself. Likewise, stock Android has undeniably shaped the way that OEMs implement certain features for the better too. And this is just a short list of some of the major examples. Even those who prefer the look or clutter free nature of stock Android surely can’t deny that OEM features and software have had a positive impact on many aspects and features of stock Android. Whether this is as superfluous as as themes or button placements, right through to the deeper APIs and software that we all now use everyday. They’re an essential part of the ecosystem, even if certain models or skins aren’t to everyone’s tastes. It might be a tired message at this point, but the fierce competition in the Android market has been a major benefit to the ecosystem as a whole. Don’t you think?

How to compare paid search and organic search without sounding foolish Which search channel is better: paid or organic? Columnist Andy Taylor argues that there is no simple answer to this question, despite what some practitioners may want to believe. Andy Taylor on May 25, 2017 at 11:16 am More Last week, I had the misfortune of encountering perhaps the most misguided thread on digital marketing I’ve ever seen on Twitter (which is saying something), in which an SEO declared unequivocally that “organic search traffic beats paid traffic for every single metric.” To me, these statements seemed outrageous and even inflammatory. But much to my surprise, many SEOs caught onto this thread and were all about it. Et tu, Rand? Realistically, I’m not sure what data can truly back up these far-reaching statements declaring dominance of organic search performance over paid search in every metric. And Rand’s caveat fails to address the real problem of this thread, which is its narrow-minded, one-versus-the-other premise. In reality, some searchers will click on ads. Others will click on organic links. Marketers should be trying to capture both. Let’s talk about the current landscape and dive into how there are better, more nuanced ways to look at performance comparisons between paid search and SEO — without all the bluster. Paid search growth has long outpaced organic growth It’s no secret to paid search and SEO managers that Google has steadily made updates over the past couple of years that have directly harmed organic traffic, including the addition of a fourth text ad above organic links on desktop, the addition of a third (and then fourth) text ad above organic links on phones, doubling the size of Product Listing Ads on phones, moving the Local Pack to the top of search results, and more. As a result, overall organic traffic has declined Y/Y for the past several quarters, as shown in this chart from the quarterly Merkle Digital Marketing Report (registration required). You don’t have to take our word for it — take a look at Google’s Q1 2017 earnings report, which showed a 53 percent increase in paid clicks on Google properties Y/Y. Even though that includes other channels, the vast majority is search, and if you think that isn’t coming at the expense of organic — well, you’d be wrong. I don’t say this because I’m a paid search hack trying to butter up PPC. Our agency manages SEO as well — and does a fantastic job of it. I even lauded the strong organic growth we were seeing a couple of years ago in a presentation at SMX Advanced about Google’s declining paid search click growth at the time. If we were seeing big organic growth overall, I’d be screaming it from the rooftops and saying that every marketer needs to be throwing all their resources at organic. Unfortunately, that’s not the case — because again, Google has been steadily making changes that directly harm organic search and help to keep paid search click growth strong. So right off the bat, we have one metric that paid search has an advantage in. This is going to vary from brand to brand, but overall, this is the way things are moving for most marketers. But what about all those other metrics that are supposedly amazing for organic and terrible for paid search? Anyone who understands how to do such comparisons correctly would be careful to provide nuance and specificity in explaining how performance metrics should be analyzed. Unfortunately, Twitter is ill-suited for such details. Here are two tips for anyone looking to derive meaningful comparisons between paid search and SEO. 1. Segment query types and devices If most of your organic search traffic is coming from searches for your own brand name, but a smaller share of paid search traffic comes from branded queries, performance is going to vary. Shocking, I know. As such, you should be segmenting traffic and conversion performance by brand vs. non-brand, as well as doing category-level segmentations within those buckets. This was made harder by the rise of [not provided] obfuscating organic queries in analytics packages, but is still possible using tools such as Google Search Console. Similarly, organic and paid search might derive different shares of traffic from different device types for a given brand. Device types tend to perform differently in all sorts of metrics, from click-through rate to conversion rate to bounce rate. Thus, this would throw off any overall performance comparisons and require that metrics be broken down by device. In the case of analysis that declares some overall winner with zero nuance about how data was segmented, it’s almost guaranteed the individual didn’t bother making such segmentations. Declaring such overarching results apply to every brand in existence is just ridiculous. 2. Take advantage of both paid and organic, and measure incrementality But it’s not just about measuring how paid and organic search metrics compare on any given day. It’s also important to understand how they work together. Every marketer wants to rank organically for every keyword that they might consider bidding on in paid search, preferably in the top spot. But it’s simply not possible for every site to rank on the first page of organic listings for every single query that might drive value for them. Similarly, every brand would love to have an ad at the top of the page for every relevant query, but the economics of paid search are limiting. It’s not financially viable to bid to the top position for every term, and in many cases it’s not even feasible to bid to the first page of results given the expected return for a particular query. So we have a situation where brands would love to have both paid and organic listings (since users are inevitably going to click both types of listings), but in which it’s impossible to actually achieve perfect visibility in both. Understanding how these two types of visibility work together, then, is key. In the case of brand keywords, it’s certainly possible that a site might be able to pick up all of the paid search traffic it’s getting from brand ads through its organic listings. Of course, this is going to depend on factors such as if competitors are bidding on brand keywords and how many first page organic listings are occupied by the brand, but it’s possible. Still, we find that the vast majority of brand holdout tests show that organic links do not pick up all traffic that goes to brand ads, such that brand ads have some incremental value. There is no way to say that organic “outperforms” paid when it comes to talking about this incremental traffic — you’re either getting it through ads or you’re not getting it at all. Period. In the case of a non-brand query in which a site doesn’t even rank on the first page, pretty much all traffic coming from a paid search ad is incremental. Should you try to rank organically for that query? Absolutely, but it doesn’t mean you should forgo paid search just because you heard organic search is better in every metric. Conclusion: Get rid of search partisanship What I’m trying to get at here is that marketers should want to be “turned on” for as many different types of search visibility as possible, whether it be paid links, the local pack, the knowledge graph or plain old organic listings. Lauding one channel over another in sweeping statements is ridiculous and actually harms the discussion by completely ignoring important nuances. What’s worse, pitting one channel against another is incredibly detrimental to moving the conversation forward on how the two channels work together. Given the complicated relationship between paid and organic search that varies from query to query, such search partisanship is only good for those who specialize in one channel to make the case for their specialty. In that regard, I’m glad I work at an agency that manages both paid and organic search optimization, such that we can feel free to laud the benefits of both and talk about challenges and concerns in equal measure. We’re all about working across channels to squeeze every possible ounce of value out of search, whether it’s paid or organic, while single-minded folks clutch the pearls of the one channel they know how to manage. In short: Be open-minded, think critically, and understand the nuances of comparing paid and organic search.

Google launches ads measurement system for cross-device campaigns on YouTube, DoubleClick, GDN The Ads Data Hub is designed to give marketers impression-level insights for campaigns served across multiple devices. Ginny Marvin on May 26, 2017 at 2:17 pm More The ads measurement system that Google initially created for analyzing YouTube campaigns now includes data from the Google Display Network and DoubleClick. Google announced the expansion and the beta release of Ads Data Hub this week. The expanded scope of the cloud-based system further underscores the industry’s shift from relying on cookies to user and device IDs for tracking and reporting on ad performance as mobile usage has surpassed that of desktop. Ads Data Hub is designed to help advertisers measure the value of their campaigns as ads are distributed over an ever-expanding number of devices. Omnicom Media Group signed on as an early test partner. Ads Data Hub offers anonymized cross-device impression-level data from campaigns running on YouTube, Google Display Network and DoubleClick Ad Exchange. Marketers can hook in CRM, DMP or other marketing databases into the system to analyze campaign impact on the customer journey. Ads Data Hub runs in Google’s data warehouse, BigQuery. Marketers cannot extract any of the impression-level data from Ads Data Hub; Google says that’s for privacy reasons. Advertisers can give third-party measurement vendors including comScore, DoubleVerify, Integral Ad Science, Moat and Nielsen access to the system. However, those vendors must still rely on Google’s own data for measurement, long a pain point for advertisers who have been pushing Google (and Facebook) to lower their walls and support independent tracking for measurement and verification. Currently, the Ads Data Hub only supports analysis, but Google says it will eventually enable advertisers to “act on the insights they get from Ads Data Hub and buy media with greater precision.” About The Author Ginny Marvin As Third Door Media's paid media reporter, Ginny Marvin writes about paid online marketing topics including paid search, paid social, display and retargeting for Search Engine Land and Marketing Land.

The most recent gathering of the FYI Book Club had readers discussing Cathy O’Neil’s “Weapons of Math Destruction,” a lament on the overuse and misuse of complex, often flawed algorithms and mathematical models — and the sometimes scary impact of numbers on our own lives. Read more: An interview with author Cathy O’Neil “I had no idea so many algorithms were used,” said Jerry Bakker of Olathe. “People don’t understand the math models. They think that since it is math and the answer comes out of a computer, it must be true. But not necessarily.” Added Pat Schneider of Kansas City: “The pervasiveness of gathering data and using it wherever a business can is a little frightening and annoying. We all complain about the Facebook algorithms and the ads on Google. These data miners are gathering information from so many places. It makes me want to go into Google and search all sorts of interesting things just to mess with the research.” The room exploded in laughter, and attendees started listing outlandish search terms they would plug into Google. “This mathematical tool of modern technology is increasing the disparity of income,” said Clif Hostetler of Kansas City, Kan. “It’s enraging how these algorithms cause businesses to target insecure and economically disadvantaged people.” Janelle Sjue of Kansas City wasn’t surprised that lower-income populations are the target. “The algorithms look at correlation and not causation,” she said. “We have to separate the person from race.” On the bright side: “GPS works well for people who need it. Spam filters clear out bad emails. And some courts are using new algorithms to reduce recidivism. But the answers are not always reliable, and people don’t understand the limitations of the mathematical models.” Susan Tuncten of Kansas City also noted the helpful side of the financial algorithms. “On the positive side is the FICO (credit rating) score. It’s transparent. You know what to do to increase it or improve it,” she said. “That’s somewhat fair.” Hostetler asked, however, “Was it more fair than the small-town banker who knew everybody? Maybe FICO is fairer than the good-old-boy network.” For Peggy Brockschmidt of Kansas City, “The scariest chapter was the one on for-profit universities. The most vulnerable people are the ones who need the loans, and they get damaged.” Said Tuncten, “There are so many variables among the students, it’s impossible to measure or compare accurately.” Her daughter, Sara, chimed in: “These algorithms are created to make sense of data, but instead of improving our understanding, it’s as if people are changing their own behavior to make the algorithm a fact and not a guideline. College administrators are changing how they conduct academic business or oversee the educational aspects and institution’s culture.” Attendees gathered at the Mid-America Regional Council (MARC) offices, where senior researcher Jeff Pinkerton talked about the use of data to help city agencies and other entities anticipate fluctuations in population, employment and transit, among other issues. “Our computer model said only 7.3 of you would be here tonight. But I see 14, so we’ll have to go back and calibrate the formula,” Pinkerton joked. He said MARC doesn’t use mathematical models as they are depicted in “Weapons of Math Destruction.” “We don’t really use such algorithms, but we do review the way we use our data,” he said. “We’re trying to take the real world and make numbers out of it but be cautious about how we present data and make the right decisions.” Overall, readers said, they found O’Neil’s book accessible, engaging and informative. “I loved the way she wrote about math,” Tuncten said. “And I wasn’t surprised at the way it impacts our daily lives. Data tends to make my eyes roll, but it was fun the way she wrote about data, and it was understandable.” “O’Neil gave good guidelines for what constitutes a ‘weapon of math destruction,’ ” Schneider said. “The feedback loop is not appropriately designed or is completely missing. A good algorithm that’s good is one that could be changed. A bad one won’t be changed.” Kaite Mediatore Stover is the Kansas City Public Library’s director of reader’s services.

Dubbed “Judy,” the criminals behind the attack are using auto-clicking adware to generate fraudulent clicks on website ads and generate money. The unprecedented scale of Judy was discovered by Check Point Security. A team of researchers found the malware hidden inside 41 apps developed by a software company based in South Korea. According to the report, the apps have seen an “astonishing” number of downloads. Estimates of Judy’s spread range from 4.5 million to 18.5 million devices. Once activated, the malware starts to generate a very large number of fake clicks on online advertisements. In turn, these clicks deliver money to the hackers behind the campaign. By sneaking the malicious scripts into apps, the attackers can silently make money from ad providers. Check Point found a “large” revenue has been made because of the extensive spread of the malware. When the user downloads the malicious app, it starts communications with a remote command and control server. The server recognizes the connection and sends the device the adware used in the attack. Through an ensuing system of redirects and some manipulation of how the phone appears to web servers, a target website is launched. This specially crafted website contains adverts from Google’s AdSense network that are connected to the attacker. When the malware visits the page, it uses JavaScript code to scan its contents and identify the ads. It proceeds to trigger fake clicks on the various assets of the page, causing Google’s servers to register a click-through and grant the attacker money. By repeating this thousands of times on each infected device, a large revenue is created over time. [Image by Check Point Security] All the apps found to house the malware are disguised as innocuous children’s games. As they all contain the name “Judy” in their title, Check Point decided to name the campaign after the character that the apps feature as their protagonist. Amongst the titles are “Animal Judy: Teddy Bear care,” “Fashion Judy: Frozen Princess” and “Chef Judy: Birthday Food Maker.” Check Point also discovered that a handful of apps from other developers contain the malware too. It is not clear whether the different vendors are connected. The company speculated that one campaign might have borrowed code from the other, intentionally or perhaps inadvertently stealing the attack scripts too. The team estimated that a total of between 8.5 and 36.5 million users are likely to have been affected by all the known apps combined. Unusually, Check Point found that there is an actual developer behind the Judy apps. They are created by a Korean firm called Kiniwini, listed on the Play Store as ENISTUDIO. The company also builds apps for iOS devices. Check Point noted that most mobile malware is created by dedicated hackers, rather than developers looking for extra cash. [Image by BrianAJackson/Thinkstock] “It is quite unusual to find an actual organization behind mobile malware, as most of them are developed by purely malicious actors,” the company said. “It is important to note that the activity conducted by the malware is not borderline advertising, but definitely an illegitimate use of the users’ mobile devices for generating fraudulent clicks, benefiting the attackers.” Judy is causing concern because the suspect apps have remained in the Google Play Store undetected for a considerable length of time. Because they’re offered from the Play Store, even careful users who don’t get apps from unofficial sources could be affected. The oldest discovered app was last updated in April 2016. This suggests the campaign has been active for at least a year, during which Google hasn’t identified the fraud against its ad platform. Check Point alerted Google to the dangers of the Judy apps as soon as it uncovered the threat. The company responded rapidly, and all of the apps have now been delisted from the store. Google hasn’t commented on the threat or how “Judy” went undetected for so long, despite most of the apps having 4 or 5-star reviews. Check Point warned users to remain vigilant and use security tools capable of detecting zero-day mobile malware. You should also check the permissions that an app requires before installing it, although in this case there was little to indicate that the games were anything other than innocent children’s fun.

Google Maps v9.54 prepares to add saved locations for your school and gym, notification channels, and what looks like a task list [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 6:22am PDTMay 26, 2017 35 Plus 1 on G+ 54 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares139 APK Teardown Applications Downloads What's Really New Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 Saved locations for School and Gym 1.2 The 'Other' Notification Channel 1.3 A few new prompts 1.4 A task list called "Nearby Need?" 2 Download An update to Google Maps v9.54 began rolling out to users through the beta channel yesterday, but it doesn't appear to have any visible changes going live quite yet. However, a teardown of the apk does bring a few hints about what to expect in the future. There are clues about a couple of new saved destinations like the Home and Work slots that have become so useful, the first stirring of support for Android O's notification channels, a few new "promos" to get people interested in various features, and a very curious feature that might turn out to be a task list of sorts. As usual, we've got a link at the bottom to download this update to sideload if you're not interested in waiting for Google to deliver it to your device. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Saved locations for School and Gym If you find yourself regularly using the Home and Work saved locations for quick navigation, you'll enjoy this one. The Maps team is expanding the list to include two more common destinations: your gym and your school. <string name="GYM_LOCATION">Gym</string> <string name="SCHOOL_LOCATION">School</string> Since those two strings don't really include any specific telltale signs that they're intended to be default saved locations, I've included the two previously existing lines for Home and Work for comparison. It's pretty obvious that the naming convention matches up. <string name="HOME_LOCATION">Home</string> <string name="WORK_LOCATION">Work</string> There is also a newly added icon for education, which I would naturally assume will go with the School destination. There doesn't appear to be a similar icon dedicated to the Gym slot, but it's not as if Google can't easily color-fill the existing fitness icon. Nevertheless, this one missing icon might be a hint that Google won't make these new destination slots available until a future update includes the missing icon. These two new entries will obviously operate just like Home and Work for the purposes of navigation and quick route selection. And as always, users don't have to actually link these slots to real schools or gyms. I'm sure a lot of people will welcome this simple improvement because so many of us travel to more than just work and home in a typical day. The 'Other' Notification Channel I'll just make a quick mention of this topic since it's not really that interesting. Google Maps is going to have a notification channel on Android O titled "Other notifications." <string name="OTHER_NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL">Other notifications</string> I doubt this will be the only custom channel for Maps. After all, there are several subsections in Settings dedicated to each notification type, so we'll probably see the channel list grow a fair amount in the future. I would assume the Maps team is still trying to decide how to best organize the app's notifications. This "other" channel will probably become a placeholder for most of the notifications until they are organized into suitable channels. A few new prompts I normally skip changes that are meant to advertise existing features, but sometimes the focus of banners and notifications can give a little insight into the features and apps that may not be performing as well as expected or simply need user awareness. The latest Maps update includes three new promos. The first banner is for the Google Trips app. Launched around this time last year, Trips is basically an itinerary management app that's also intended for making local recommendations. Trips probably doesn't have a very substantial user base yet, so it's not hard to imagine why Google is trying to breathe a little more life into it. code <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_TITLE">Take your travel info with you</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_TITLE_WITH_AREA_NAME">Take your %1$s travel info with you</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_BODY">Reservations • Things to do • Day plans</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_DOWNLOAD_LINK">Get Google Trips app</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_DISMISS_LINK">No thanks</string> The next addition is intended to get users to try out the recently launched location sharing feature. It's pretty normal to show prompts to get users only newly released features, so there's nothing unusual about this one, but you can probably expect to see it in your navigation setup soon. code <string name="CAR_TI TLE_JOURNEY_SHARING">Share journey</string> <string name="JOURNEY_SHARING_PENDING_PROMPT_TEXT">Share your trip with %1$s</string> <string name="JOURNEY_SHARING_PENDING_PROMPT_TTS">Sharing your real-time location with %1$s until you arrive.</string> <string name="CAR_MENU_START_JOURNEY_SHARING">Share journey</string> <string name="CAR_MENU_STOP_JOURNEY_SHARING">Stop sharing</string> The final promotional banner will belong to the always familiar Local Guides program. As usual, it's going to encourage users to contribute to Maps for points. The one interesting oddity is that these strings have "v2" in their names. It's possible this just means they are for a new set of promos, or this might hint at a revised version of the points program. I would expect the former, but it's at least worth acknowledging the latter is possible. code <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_TITLE">Reach new Local Guides levels</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_TEXT">Now earn more points for your reviews, photos, edits, and adding new places.</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_GOTO_STATS">SEE YOUR LEVEL</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_OPEN_HELP">Learn more</string> A task list called "Nearby Need?" There's very little to go on for this topic, but it looks just weird enough that I suspect there's a feature brewing in there somewhere. A pair of new layouts were added with the name "nearby need," one of which defines the look of a list, and the other is for items in that list. There is also a single string with a related name and just the word "navigate" for text. <string name="NEARBY_NEED_NAVIGATE">Navigate</string> /layout/nearby_need_item.xml /layout/nearby_need.xml Based on this very limited amount of information, it does sound a little like a shopping list of sorts. Perhaps less like a grocery list and more like a list of chores or tasks – e.g. getting new tires on the car, picking up some materials for a weekend project, and buying new clothes. I would assume each item goes into a list and Google Maps will make it easy to navigate to the next nearest place where each of these things can be taken care of. I'm not actually sure if these are related, but there are also three new images to be found in the resources, and they certainly would fit with my theory. The first is for creating new tasks, the second is for completed tasks, and the final one is for "old" completed tasks. I suppose the old one might be for things a user did on previous days but hasn't removed from the list. This is all guesswork right now, but many people have been asking for ways to use Maps to get through chores, and this feels like the first hint of something like that. The one aspect that's not yet hinted at, but I certainly hope to see, is a feature that will sort tasks efficiently so people can choose the shortest (or fastest) route to get everything done. I'll keep watching and follow up when there are more developments.

They are used when you go to Your Contributions -> Check the Facts/Uncover Missing info. I think after all this time those two are still only for lvl 5 local guides... so yeah. Cody Toombs Right, the look of the images aren't new, but the files containing those images are. Or said more clearly, there are now multiple copies of those icons. mmark27 I sure would like there to be a "Work" and then a "Parking for Work" section for those that don't park right next to their office. Point being, if I want walking direction/estimations, give them from my office. If I want driving directions/estimations on time, know that I have to walk to my car, then drive from my parking location. The School addition will be good to finally have pop up automatically now though. Cody Toombs If you're not going to use all four slots for their intended purpose, you might just assign one of the others to be your work parking. Frankly, I would have liked these saved slots to have custom labels, since some people don't fit into this one shape. For example, I know somebody that has to travel to two different sites for the same job, and another friend that was enrolled in two different schools at the same time. It's not like one of these destinations can't go into the "Gym" slot, but it would be nice if the titles could make sense. mmark27 Right. I now have my "Work" location saved as my parking lot, which is silly, but it's the only way to get decent estimations. Your fix is what I'll be doing otherwise unless they fix it. The subtly though in this situation is El Goog knowing that the Work and Work Parking are linked existentially, so they can decipher where my body is and estimate from there, etc. Same can be said for Home and Home Parking if not directly on site. Would seem like Google's apartment-city-dwelling-first mentality would be more amenable to this off the bat. I agree that we should be able to have free labels on places and also as many places as we can stomach estimations/notifications on time to. Google knows where I am at all times....make it actually useful, guys. henleyb I work from home and Google would keep asking me to set my work address which is of course the same as my home address, it was a small but annoying thing. :) Austin Spangrud Sure would be nice if maps got integrated assistant into it. None of the commands and home commands that I have integrate with the Voice button in maps. Oh and In b4 where's my speed limit pop up Cody Toombs Speed limits are still limited geographically. Since I was in the Bay Area last week, I finally saw them pop up for the first time on my phone and in Android Auto. Funny enough, I now have a Speed Limit toggle in settings on one phone, but nowhere else :/ And now I'm probably not going to see the speed limits again for a long time. Paul_Werner Yeah and we used to have them and they disappeared. At least it did for me here in the Milwaukee, WI area. Same for when I travel to Chicago Nicholas Matranga Finally, it was so annoying to have to save my school address as my work address just to get commute updates. mike shwilly Grow up Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez Finally, Im glad that we can save more pinned-saved choices other than the usual Home and Work, although I would prefer to customize them on my own in the same manner we customize the saved list. I could make a really good use of few in my mind like Church, Work2, University, etc. Jon Xuereb Couldn't you use this school one for University Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez I used the word University just an example, the point is that it would be great to customize those pinned saves using our own creations. Paul_Werner I can't wait to see that "nearby need" implemented. Your guesswork on it sounds like it could be a really useful feature. h4rr4r Why are these static names? Why can't I add random strings and assign them saved locations? Ken Vincent what ever happened to speed limits? I thought that was on the verge of being a thing more then a year ago. UKTK8 "In the coming weeks" Meaning whenever Google d#$% well pleases. Jon Xuereb Lawyers I'm assuming dmo580 Yet Waze and other GPS apps have no issues. How about just displaying my current speed? Ken Vincent Not only that, but google provides speed limits as a service. I would imagine that is where Waze gets their speed limit info. https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/roads/speed-limits Jon Xuereb Because Google Maps is exponentially larger in terms of user base, and google is a bigger target for lawsuits Ken Vincent Waze is wholly owned by Google. They are not even an Alphabet company, they are Google. Jon Xuereb Still the size of the userbase affects the their risk assessment icyhotmike why not just let us add "Saved" locations such as Home and Work and whatever else we want? Damn Google in control of everything. makapav My God the Google apps and ecosystem are becoming such a clusterfuck with no sources of truth for data points. All the information is spread across random places. Richard Oldroyd I do use home a lot but for the others like gym I save as a contact and nav just as quick. Richard Oldroyd I'd love maps to display my current speed and advise what the speed limit is. Obviously they would have to add a warning saying they can not be held responsible for displaying an incorrect speed limit. I'd also like to see us be able to choose what is displayed underneath where they show destination time and miles to go, it would be useful to see arrival times at all stops not just the one you are currently naving to.

Google warns against misusing links in syndication & large-scale article campaigns If the primary purpose of distributing content is to gain links, both authors and publishers risk a Google penalty. Danny Sullivan on May 25, 2017 at 1:24 pm More Google’s out today with a warning for anyone who is distributing or publishing content through syndication or other large-scale means: Watch your links. Google’s post reminds those who produce content published in multiple places that, without care, they could be violating Google’s rules against link schemes. No content marketing primarily for links, warns Google Google says that it is not against article distribution in general. But if such distribution is done primarily to gain links, then there’s a problem. From the post: Google does not discourage these types of articles in the cases when they inform users, educate another site’s audience or bring awareness to your cause or company. However, what does violate Google’s guidelines on link schemes is when the main intent is to build links in a large-scale way back to the author’s site … For websites creating articles made for links, Google takes action on this behavior because it’s bad for the Web as a whole. When link building comes first, the quality of the articles can suffer and create a bad experience for users. Those pushing such content want links because links — especially from reputable publishers — are one of the top ways that content can rank better on Google. Warning signs What are things that may tip Google into viewing a content distribution campaign as perhaps violating its guidelines? Again, from the post: Stuffing keyword-rich links to your site in your articles Having the articles published across many different sites; alternatively, having a large number of articles on a few large, different sites Using or hiring article writers that aren’t knowledgeable about the topics they’re writing on Using the same or similar content across these articles; alternatively, duplicating the full content of articles found on your own site Staying safe There are two safe ways for those distributing content to stay out of trouble: using nofollow on specific links or the canonical tag on the page itself. Nofollow prevents individual links from passing along ranking credit. Canonical effectively tells Google not to let any of the links on the page pass credit. Publishers can be at risk, too It’s important to note that Google’s warning isn’t just for those distributing content. Those publishing it can face issues with Google if they haven’t taken proper care. From Google’s post: When Google detects that a website is publishing articles that contain spammy links, this may change Google’s perception of the quality of the site and could affect its ranking. Sites accepting and publishing such articles should carefully vet them, asking questions like: Do I know this person? Does this person’s message fit with my site’s audience? Does the article contain useful content? If there are links of questionable intent in the article, has the author used rel=”nofollow” on them? In other words, publishing content unquestioningly, in terms of links, could expose the publisher’s site to being penalized in Google. Why this new warning? Today’s warning from Google is generally the same as what it issued back in July 2013, when it cautioned about links in large-scale guest posting, advertorials, sponsored content and press releases. However, it’s more specific in terms of syndication and comes because of an issue that Search Engine Land has been investigating over the past month. Search Engine Land has a policy of generally not writing about cases of spam or suspected spam that aren’t already public in a significant way. Our open letter from 2014 explains this more. In short, if we did this, that’s all we would ever be writing about. That said, we received a tip about several businesses using article syndication that seemed worth taking a closer look at, given that the tactics potentially violated Google’s guidelines in a significant manner. Moreover, Google had been notified of the issue at the end of last year, twice, but had not apparently taken any action. The company tipping us — a competitor with those businesses — was concerned. Was this tactic acceptable or not? The many examples I looked at certainly raised concerns. Articles were distributed across multiple news publications. The articles often contained several links that were “anchor rich,” meaning they appeared to have words within the links that someone hoped they might rank well for. Mechanisms for blocking these links from passing credit were not being used. Google’s initial response to our questions about this was that it was aware there were issues and that it was looking to see how it might improve things. That seemed a weak response to me. It was pretty clear from my conversations with two of the companies distributing the content, and one of the publishers, that there was, at the very least, confusion about what was acceptable and responsibilities all around. Confusion about what’s allowed Both the companies producing content professed that they felt they were doing nothing wrong. In particular, they never demanded that publishers carry any particular links, which seemed to them to put them on the right side of the guidelines. One also said that it was using canonical to block link credit but that the publishers themselves might be failing to implement that correctly. Both indicated that if they weren’t doing things correctly, they wanted to change to be in compliance. In short: it’s not us to blame, it’s those publishers. And from the content I looked at on publisher sites, it was pretty clear that none of them seemed to be doing any policing of links. That was reinforced after I talked with one publisher, which told me that while it did make use of nofollow, it was reviewing things to be more “aggressive” about it now. My impression was that if nofollow was supposed to be used, no one had really been paying attention to that — nor was I seeing it in use. In the end, I suggested to Google that the best way forward here might be for them to post fresh guidance on the topic. That way, Search Engine Land wasn’t being dragged into a potential spam reporting situation. More important, everyone across the web was getting an effective “reset” and reeducation on what’s allowed in this area. Getting your house in order Now that such a post has been done, companies distributing such content and publishers carrying it would be smart to follow the advice in it. When Google issues such advice, as it did about guest blogging in January 2014, that’s often followed by the search engine taking action against violators a few months later. From a distributor point of view, I’d recommend thinking strongly about how Google ended today’s blog post: If a link is a form of endorsement, and you’re the one creating most of the endorsements for your own site, is this putting forth the best impression of your site? Our best advice in relation to link building is to focus on improving your site’s content and everything–including links — will follow (no pun intended). Bottom line: Deep down, you know if you were putting out this content primarily to gain links. If that was the case, you should work with those publishers to implement nofollow or canonical. If you can’t, then you should consider disavowing links to Google. Going forward, I’d look to implement nofollow or canonical as Google recommends, if you find that the large-scale distribution is bringing you useful direct clicks and attention. I will say that no one should take this to mean that you can never distribute content or that content can’t have any links at all that pass credit back to an originating site. Indeed, we have plenty of contributed content here on Search Engine Land. I’d be among the first screaming at Google if I thought it was trying to tell us or anyone that you couldn’t have such content unless you blocked all links. Things that make us feel Google-safe are that, most of all, we publish original content from contributors. It’s not the same content that’s simply dumped into multiple publications. Also, we have editors who often spend a significant amount of time working with writers and content to ensure that it’s publication-worthy. And we do try to watch for links that we don’t feel are earned or necessary in a story. We’re not perfect. No publisher will be. But I think from a publisher perspective, the more you are actually interacting with the content you publish to review and approve it, rather than blindly posting from a feed, the safer you will be. If you haven’t been doing that, then consider making use of nofollow and canonical on already-published content, as Google recommended. As for those guest blogging requests I’ll conclude with this part of Google’s post today: Webmasters generally prefer not to receive aggressive or repeated “Post my article!” requests, and we encourage such cases to be reported to our spam report form. Indeed. It’s amazing how many requests that we’re getting like this each day, and I know were not alone. It’s even more amazing when this type of guest blogging was supposed to be over. “Stick A Fork In It, Guest Blogging Is Done,” declared Matt Cutts in January 2014. Cutts, no longer at Google, was then the head of its web spam fighting team. His declaration was a shot heard around the web. Guest blogging almost became radioactive. No one seemed to want to touch it, much less send out idiotic bulk emails requesting a post. Those requests are back in force. It’s a pity that so many come from Google’s own Gmail system, where all Google’s vaunted machine learning doesn’t catch them as the spam they are. If you’ve been making such requests or accepting guest blog posts because of them, even in small scale, Google’s rules about policing links still apply.

Skip to content 512 Pixels About Projects Membership Sponsor RSS → Thinking About Shared iCloud Photo Libraries  May 26, 2017 ⌘ Permalink I had a very rocky experience with iCloud Photo Library in late 2015: I imported my photos and uploaded my 70GB photo library to iCloud. Everything went very smoothly, so I turned on iCloud Photo Library on my iPad. Aaaaaand it all exploded. Apple Support eventually got me up and running, but it took a while for me to fully trust the system. The reality is that iCloud Photo Library is pretty great when everything is working smoothly.1 Photos show up on my devices quickly, regardless if I snapped them with my iPhone or imported them from an SD card on my iMac. My wife has been using is for as long as I have, and she also enjoys the service. We’re both paying iCloud customers at this point, but like every other family using iCloud Photo Library, our sharing system is a bit of a mess. If I take photos on my “nice camera,” I’ll import the RAW files to my iMac, edit them, then import them into both of our libraries. If either of have an iPhone photo we want to share, we AirDrop it, as Shared Photo Streams downsize images and video: iCloud Photo Sharing supports JPEG, RAW, PNG, GIF, TIFF, and MP4, as well as special formats you capture with your iPhone, like slo-mo, time-lapse, 4K videos, and Live Photos. You can even share your Memory videos. When shared, photos taken with standard point-and-shoot cameras, SLR cameras, or iOS devices have up to 2048 pixels on the long edge. Panoramic photos can be up to 5400 pixels wide. iCloud Photo Sharing supports both MP4 and QuickTime video file types, and H.264 and MPEG-4 Video file formats. Videos can be up to five minutes in length and are delivered at up to 720p resolution. All of this leads to a lot of duplication between our libraries. Google recently introduced powerful new sharing tools, and as the guys on ATP spoke about this week, its time Apple step up to the plate with something new. Here’s Jason Snell on the subject: My wife and I have wanted to pool our photo libraries for ages now—the alternative is for me to occasionally plug her iPhone into my Mac and import her photos, and for her to ask me to AirDrop photos I’ve taken to her when she wants to post them to Facebook. Google Photos will allow that now—and Apple needs to follow suit. But, you’re saying to yourself, what if you want to share some but not all photos with a partner? Google’s announcement takes this extra step, letting you specify that certain sorts of photos—for example, photos of specific people—be shared, while others aren’t. While offering an all-or-nothing library sharing feature would be nice, it’s even better if sharing can have some granularity. Google’s headed there now. Will Apple follow? In thinking about how Apple could add family sharing to iCloud Photo Library, two types of solutions come to mind. Common Library In this world, Apple would have a way to have multiple iCloud accounts have access to one big, centralized common photo library. Users — let’s say a married couple — could both go in, create albums, make edits and more. Both people would have full read/write access to the library. There are issues with this, of course. Would individuals have their own iCloud Photo Libraries and access to the big shared one? How would Photos.app display this? I think this sort of thing could be confusing, and I bet people would end up with photos in the wrong library pretty easily. If users didn’t have their own personal libraries, I think many would be frustrated and sharing every single photo and screenshot they take. In short, I don’t think a big, shared library is the way to go. Library Access This solution is what I would prefer. In it, my wife and I would continue to have our own libraries, tied to our own iCloud accounts, just like we do today. However, we would be able to add each other as viewers to our libraries. Once access has been granted, her library would show up in the top-level of Photos.app as do things like People, Places, Videos, etc. I could tap her library to see all of her content, including albums, collections, etc. If I were to see something I wanted to add to my library, I could select it and tap “Add to My Library.” Doing so would prompt iCloud to add a full-resolution copy of that file to my personal library. In this world, she would not be able to edit anything in my library, but pull any content from it she wants in hers. This would not take care of the duplication issue, but would be less confusing than having one big library. WWDC is Coming Last year, Photos.app and iCloud Photo Library saw a lot of love, but Apple needs to keep its foot on the gas to stay competitive in this space. I hope they do just that on June 5. It’s still not perfect; I recently had a whole bunch of photos adopt the same description. After some back and forth with Apple, my radar was marked as a duplicate and closed. ↩ Post navigation ← Previous Post Become a Member I've been writing here for almost nine years, but the next decade of 512 Pixels requires your support.     Why is the site gray?

There are seats – but they’re filling up fast. There’s much to fear about our AI future. For a start, we face a future where many believe the only path forward is man versus machine. In this scenario humans are replaced by machines that think for themselves. This is the future depicted in films like Ex Machina and Her. Aaron Rosland, Counsellor (Commercial – Ontario), High Commission of Canada It is also a future we’re told will gobble up as many as 7 million jobs in the next five years. In fact, if we’re to believe the latest World Economic Forum data, 65 per cent of children entering primary school today will be working in jobs that don’t currently exist. For young people, it is a daunting prospect. Edelman’s latest Trust Barometer data found that nearly 6 in 10 young people are worried they won’t have the right skills to build careers in a more automated world. The future looks bleak in this scenario. But more and more, we are seeing a future where man plus machine is becoming a way of life; where everything in our daily lives from healthcare to banking can be augmented. It’s the future where thousands of new jobs are made not eliminated, a future where AI is additive; contributing as much as £654 a year to the Exchequer, according to the latest Accenture figures. It’s the future being written right now in Ontario, Canada. Two weeks ago, Britain’s own Geoff Hinton, the godfather of deep learning, unveiled the Vector Institute – a nearly $200m (CAD) institute located in Toronto, Ontario, whose raison d’être is to identify new business models for AI so that it can support and sustain economic growth. Digital pioneering runs deep in the Hinton family. He is the great-great-grandson of George Boole, whose “Boolean algebra” has become a bedrock of digital computing. A computer scientist at the University of Toronto, Hinton has been working on deep learning since the 1970s. He’s responsible for developing many of the AI techniques that allow machines to learn tasks by analysing large amounts of data. In fact, many of his students have gone on to become principal architects in the field today, swelling the ranks of Google, Facebook, Apple, and Microsoft. Vector is Hinton and others’ attempt to make Toronto the AI capital of the world. It’s an ambitious move, but Ontario’s tech industry is growing, and the province is fast becoming a leader in artificial intelligence. It doesn’t take long to tally up Ontario, and Canada’s AI successes thus far. Technologies found in Facebook’s facial recognition algorithms, Google’s Photos app, smartphone voice recognition and even Japanese robots were all developed in Canadian research labs. Meanwhile fledgling ideas are getting equal weighting. Take the example of Facebook executive, Steve Irvine, who recently made the decision to leave Silicon Valley for Toronto to start a company, Integrate.ai, focused on applied artificial intelligence. Part of the secret to Canada’s success is their public-private partnership models. Vector itself is a collaboration between the University of Toronto, the governments of Ontario and Canada, and a mix of private partners including Google, Accenture, and all five of Canada’s big banks. The model, which focuses on integrating AI into Canada’s economic future, is an effort to bridge the gap between university research and companies like Google to help commercialise research and connect companies with top talent. It’s this pool of talent that Silicon Valley has been fighting over for quite a few years. University of Toronto professor, Ajay Agrawal, noted a little over a year ago, that Canada was at risk of losing its top talent to the US. Vector is one way of reversing the brain drain. Ontario’s universities are already among the best in the world, but Vector will help those universities recruit and retain scientific talent and train hundreds of graduate students, and expand our reach with the next generation of AI entrepreneurs. Finally, and this is where I have a role to play as the Commercial Counselor for Ontario in the UK, is helping to market Ontario internationally as both a source and a destination for AI. In an economy prized for resource extraction, AI is the new frontier. Few outside of the research community realise Ontario’s credentials in producing some of the world’s top AI talent, but more importantly the opening of the Vector Institute is an opportunity to show people that we’re more than a training ground, we’ve become a destination, and a world-leading one at that, for commercialisation. The province is already home to nearly 200 AI-enabled companies, with many more to follow. AI is pushing boundaries and breaking new ground every day. That can frighten us, or we can choose to embrace it and be empowered by the new potential for our businesses and ultimately our daily lives. If, like me, you prefer the man plus machine scenario, then grab a place at the table. There are seats – but they’re filling up fast.

Bob Goodlatte (center), the leader of the House Judiciary Committee Alex Wong / Getty Facebook, Google, Microsoft and a host of tech companies asked Congress on Friday to reform a government surveillance program that allows the National Security Agency to collect emails and other digital communications of foreigners outside the United States. The requests came in the form of a letter to Republican Rep. Bob Goodlatte, a Virginia lawmaker who’s overseeing the debate in the House of Representatives to reauthorize a program, known as Section 702, which will expire at the end of the year without action by Capitol Hill. In their note, the tech companies asked lawmakers for a number of changes to the law particularly to ensure that Americans’ data isn’t swept up in the fray. Meanwhile, they endorsed the need for new transparency measures, including the ability to share with their customers more information about the government surveillance requests they receive. Signing the note are companies like Airbnb, Amazon, Cisco, Dropbox, Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, Lyft, Microsoft and Uber. Absent, however, is Apple, which previously has joined with its tech counterparts in pushing for limits in government surveillance programs. A spokesman did not immediately respond to a request for comment Friday. Section 702 is one of a number of U.S. surveillance authorities that had been the subject of great scrutiny and debate in the aftermath of Edward Snowden’s surveillance leaks. The disclosures have also caused years of heartburn for Silicon Valley, which has faced an onslaught of criticism from international customers who feel the tech industry is too close to the U.S. government. Many top tech companies even banded together in a lobbying group that pushed for surveillance reforms in 2013. As the fight over the NSA’s powers returns to Congress, however, the Trump administration has urged lawmakers to keep Section 702 in its exact, current form. Earlier this month, the NSA on its own terminated a piece of its program that essentially allowed the agency to collect Americans’ emails and texts if those communications contained key words related to foreigners that already are targeted for government surveillance. To that end, the tech companies writing Congress today said Congress should formally outlaw that practice, known as “about” collection, as part of its new legislation, to ensure it can’t come back. Otherwise, the government’s Section 702 program isn’t supposed to target Americans. But their communications still are lapped up in the bunch, sometimes incidentally, including cases in which an American is communicating directly with a non-U.S. person who is the subject of NSA scrutiny. Despite calls from the likes of Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Ore., the agency has never disclosed the total number of Americans affected by such a program. In response, the tech industry asked Congress to put in place “judicial oversight for government queries” for U.S. citizens’ data. And they asked House lawmakers to rethink other portions of the law to “reduce the likelihood of collecting information about non-U.S. persons who are not suspected of wrongdoing.” Subscribe to the Recode newsletter Sign up for our Recode Daily newsletter to get the top tech and business news stories delivered to your inbox.

Tech Search Search CEO DailyCEO Daily: Saturday May 27, 2017 Tech-CeteraThis Is How CEOs Unplug from Work ChipotleChipotle Says Hackers Stole Customer Payment Card Information DiversityMarriott CEO: At a Time of Great Anxiety Around Diversity, We Need to Communicate A demo of Facebook's Instant Articles format. Courtesy of Facebook. Facebook Here’s Why Facebook Is Helping Google and Apple With Instant Articles Mathew Ingram May 26, 2017 If there's one thing you can usually count on with Facebook, it's that any new feature it introduces will be designed primarily to benefit Facebook—in most cases to get users to spend more time inside the company's walled garden. That's why an announcement Facebook made on Thursday is unusual. The company said it would open the technology behind its mobile-focused Instant Articles feature so that it works with similar competing services offered by Google and Apple. With one step, publishers will now be able to use a Facebook software tool to produce articles that fit the Facebook Instant Articles standard, and also comply with Google's competing AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) standard, Support for the Apple News format is coming soon, the company said. This doesn't mean Google or Apple will get any more access to Facebook's platform than they would have before. But it does represent a kind of truce in the mobile news war, and in that sense it is a tacit admission of failure. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. By supporting Google and Apple's technologies, Facebook is essentially admitting that Instant Articles by itself wasn't enough to entice publishers. For the past two years or so, ever since it launched Instant Articles as a limited trial with partners like the New York Times (and Time Inc., which owns Fortune), the social network has been trying to get media companies to adopt it. In a nutshell, the feature takes articles that have been formatted for the web and strips them down to make them load more quickly in a mobile browser. Initially, this was an appealing idea for many publishers, which either didn't have the financial resources or the skills to make their stories load faster in mobile browsers. But at the same time, it was a problematic deal in many ways. Facebook offered anyone who participated in the program 70% of the revenue from ads that Facebook was able to sell, or 100% of the revenue from ads they sold themselves. But this revenue didn't exactly start pouring in. The company made a number of tweaks to try and improve the situation, but it didn't really move the needle for many media companies, especially since one of the main ways Facebook sped up the loading of pages was by blocking certain types of ads. In addition to that, some publishers were leery of giving Facebook even more control over their content. The giant social network already accounts for a huge amount of the traffic that many media outlets get from the web, and uses its algorithm to control who sees their content and when. Some, like the Washington Post, jumped in with both feet, but others—including Bloomberg, the Wall Street Journal, and ESPN—balked. Even the New York Times, a launch partner, eventually stopped participating in Instant Articles, and so did The Guardian (which also pulled out of Apple News). In part, that's because both papers were focusing on their digital subscriptions and membership programs, and Instant Articles wasn't really helping. Many publishers seem to be more interested in Google's AMP standard, which is more open than Facebook's. Although the search giant is in charge of the technology, it is an open-source project that makes its code public and theoretically allows anyone to take part in developing it. There are still concerns on the part of some media companies that Google has too much control over AMP, and that it is interested primarily in promoting its own advertising networks and technologies, but AMP still seems to have gotten more uptake than Instant Articles. It also supports subscriptions and paywalls, which Instant Articles doesn't. Apple News, meanwhile, got off to a slow start, with many publishers seeing extremely low traffic from articles they formatted for the service. But more recently there is evidence that some sites are seeing improved traffic from their Apple News articles. Apple also recently hired a managing editor for Apple News, a position that didn't exist before, which suggests that it might be looking to beef up the service and possibly even expand it.

Suggested Sharing is going live in Google Photos for some users Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/25 5:30pm PDTMay 25, 2017 38 Plus 1 on G+ 108 Share on Facebook 70 Share on Twitter Total Shares216 Applications Google News Google Photos is ground zero for the company's crazy machine learning technology. At Google I/O 2017, a number of new features were announced for Photos, including suggested sharing based on who's in a certain photo. But for that to work, Google needs to figure out who is who, and now the Photos web app is asking users to identify what they look like. Upon visiting photos.google.com, you may be welcomed by the above screen. Google already uses machine learning wizardry to match faces to people, so all you have to do is select which face is yours. Once you do that, you'll be able to search for "me" in the Photos search to find pictures of yourself. According to a recent teardown, this option should appear at some point in the Photos app as well, but it didn't for me. Presumably, this will be far more useful once the other features announced at Google I/O show up. Let us know in the comments if you have received the pop-up.

I got the pop up just the other day. I can search for "me" in addition to others such as my daughter's name. John Doe I did but for some reason it shows a photo of me from over 6 years ago even though I have plenty of recent photos LoL Corbin Davenport Yep, my picture was an awful photo of me from several years ago. John Doe I was able to change it by going to people then clicking on the picture and even when you choose a picture with a lot of people in it figures out which one is you and zooms in...creepy bozzykid It doesn't matter what photo you choose of yourself. The rest are all linked to you anyways. This isn't replacing your profile pic. John Doe No but some photos it has not figured out its me or at least when I click on me it doesn't show all the pictures of me but it is good enough to find pictures of me when I was a child which is crazy because I changed a lot. Stakoman Is this US only? would be great if you guys made a "how to enable face recognition google photos" post Suicide_Note Use a US VPN to start using the face recognition. Once you get things setup, you can stop using the VPN, though face recognition should still work. rndusrnm479461 You can use a VPN (get tunnelbear cause it's free) for Android, then clear cache, open photos and enable grouping of faces in the settings. Then you can disable VPN. I did this about a year ago and I've had it ever since without any problem both on Android and on the web. bozzykid I believe it uses one of the firsts photos you have stored. It has already linked the rest to you anyways. Régis Knechtel Not always, apparently, cause it used a recent photo for me. I think it's random. Brendapdaniels Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Defenestratus No. Régis Knechtel "his option should appear at some point in the Photos app as well" It asked to chose my face me today in the android app, while I was setting up a new phone. jcopernicus I accidentally closed the prompt...how to I get it back? Corbin Davenport On the web, go to Settings -> Group similar faces, and there should be an option to pick your face. Yatin No, I'm from India Drakenoid Yes, I'm also from India. Naga Sridhar I am from India too, but are you in India? myssi Pop-up recieved, I'm from Pakistan. Tomáš Petrík And I guess we will be left out in the EU, again :/ Indefinite Implosion I'm in NL and got it a few days ago? A day or two after the announcement maybe (crunch time, so days are a blur). I didn't tip because it doesn't do anything right now so hardly seems worthy of a post. roberto.elena Do you already have "group similar faces" activated? If yes, then you will get this update. Tomáš Petrík No, it is disabled for accounts registered in the EU due to some stupid privacy ruling of the EU. roberto.elena I know, but you can activate it using a VPN (or at least that was possible when they launched Google Photos). Once it's activated, you don't need the VPN anymore, and you get all updates related to face recognition features. Nelson Not correct. I'm in Europe and by using Opera VPN plus Google Photos cache clear the feature appeared Suicide_Note Use a US VPN and you can join the party. Tomáš Petrík It's not about VPN this time. Accounts registered in the EU have facial recognition disabled due to some stupid privacy ruling of the EU. Jens Törnblad That's why you activate the feature with a VPN. Suicide_Note Ah, okay. I wasn't aware of that. Definitely sucks. rndusrnm479461 Get tunnelbear for Android. Choose a US vpn. Clear Google Photos cache -> open it -> enable grouping of faces in the settings. You only have to do this once. I did it a year ago and it has worked ever since on all my devices. Tomáš Petrík It's not about VPN this time, though. Accounts registered in the EU have facial recognition disabled due to some stupid privacy ruling of the EU. rndusrnm479461 Really? I registered mine in EU in ~2008 and activated face grouping in early 2016 without problems. henleyb I got it a day or two ago. Was an old photo but searching for 'me' did bring up correct photos for me so that's something. Looking forward to the sharing stuff next. :) Suicide_Note Haven't seen this popup yet, but on a related note, photo books have gone live for me in the Photos app. Fresh360 My coworker purchased an iPhone 7+ yesterday and I was setting up her apps and when I installed Photos this option actually popped up. I immediately went to my S7 to see did I have it and nothing. Joao Letelier Ummm...

Who Do You Trust More With Your Safety: Google or Ford? By Doug Newcomb May 26, 2017 10 Comments A new survey from Inrix notes that carmakers have advantages—for now—in the race to win over consumers with autonomous technology. A decade ago, it would have been unimaginable that a tech company like Google could successfully challenge automakers, that Tesla would be worth more than Ford, or that ridesharing firms would be major players in personal transportation. Fully autonomous vehicles (AVs) are expected to massively disrupt the car industry, but who will win the hearts and minds of consumers and the inevitable self-driving car war: Automakers, tech giants, or ridesharing companies? It's "a new battleground," according to Bob Pishue, a senior economist at Inrix. US Trusts Tech In a recent survey, Inrix polled about 5,000 people from five countries who purchased a new vehicle in the last four years. Respondents were asked who they trust most to build an AV: traditional automakers (e.g. BMW and General Motors); established tech giants (e.g. Apple and Google); newer carmakers (e.g. Tesla and Fisker Motors); ridesharing companies (e.g. Uber and Lyft); or trust all equally or none of the above. The level of trust varied by region. For example, respondents in the US were slightly more trusting in tech powerhouses like Google and Apple than automakers to build AVs (27 percent vs. 23 percent, respectively). This outlook shifts significantly in Germany, where nearly three times as many respondents trust traditional car makers most to build AVs. Interestingly, in all the countries surveyed (France, Italy, and the UK were also included), fewer than 4 percent of respondents had confidence that ridesharing companies will get robo-rides right. Despite Americans' marginally higher faith in tech providers over automakers, the survey found that car companies have a distinct advantage in several respects. "With unknown and potentially unproven technology such as autonomous driving, consumers may default strongly to trusted brands such as the traditional car manufacturers," Inrix said. "It will be important for car manufacturers to demonstrate that they can develop successful high-tech products," Inrix argued. My cynical side says good luck with that, since automakers have had a difficult time successfully integrating smartphone interfaces into cars, allowing Apple CarPlay and Google Android Auto to gain traction. Related Taking Cadillac's Tech-Heavy CT6 Plug-In Hybrid for a Spin Taking Cadillac's Tech-Heavy CT6 Plug-In Hybrid for a Spin But building a smartphone interface—or a smartphone—is nowhere near as complex as manufacturing a car, and this is where tech companies could falter and consumer confidence could waver. "A problem that new entrants like Google, Apple, Uber, and Lyft may face in convincing consumers to purchase or use AVs they manufacture is that they have no experience or familiarity of these brands in this space." As car owners become more familiar with semi-autonomous driving technologies such as Volvo's Pilot Assist, it could also help automakers keep consumers in the fold in a future of autonomous driving. The survey also says that "familiarity with these emerging technologies and their benefits will be central to winning customers, especially early adopters of AVs." While it's inconceivable that some automakers could be sidelined within a decade, history hasn't been kind to incumbents in the tech space and is littered with once prominent, pioneering brands such as Kodak, Atari, and Palm. Car companies at least have a potential head start in the AV race. Back to top Previous : The Return of Arcade Sports Titles Makes Video Games Great A...

(He instead attended Newcastle Polytechnic.) He is not expected to cut back on any of his duties at Apple, where he helped influenced the architecture of the new Apple Park campus. “I am thrilled to formalise my relationship with the RCA, given the profound influence the College has had on so many of the artists and designers that I admire," Ive said in a statement released Thursday by the college. “Our design team includes many RCA alumni, who embody the fundamental values of the College. I look forward to advising both the College and students, hoping that my experience proves useful in their work.” According to the release, Ive joins the RCA at “a critical point in its evolution into a dynamic, STEAM-focused postgraduate university, expanding its research and knowledge exchange centres into the domains of computer and materials science, the impact of the digital economy, advanced manufacturing and intelligent mobility.” Among his responsibilities, Ive will advise the school on the construction of a new building at Battersea, scheduled to open in 2020. Ive holds over 5,000 patents and received an honorary doctorate from the RCA in 2009. He also holds honorary doctorates from both Oxford and Cambridge Universities.

With hundreds of competing brands, industry standards, and manufacturer apps, managing everything is akin to a full-time job. However, if you’re invested in the Google ecosystem of products, there’s some good news: you can use one app to control all of your products and settings. Better yet? It’ll even work with plenty of non-Google products. The app is Google Home. Not to be confused with the speaker of the same name Google Home Review Google Home Review Google Home is a personal assistant smart speaker, and comes from a company that literally knows everything. The $130 Google device answers questions, controls your smart home, and plays music. Should you buy one? Read More  and Google Assistant, the Google Home app used to be called Google Cast. But what exactly does the Google Home app integrate with? What features does it offer? And is it really the one-size-fits-all solution you’ve been waiting for? Keep reading to find out. Which Devices and Services Are Supported? The Google Home app works with any device, app, or service that also integrates with the Google Home smart speaker. It’s a long list, but the services and products can broadly be divided into three sections: audio, video, and smart home. Audio — YouTube Music, Google Play Music, Spotify, TuneIn Radio, Pandora, Deezer. Video — YouTube, Netflix, Hulu, Google Play Movies, Google Chromecast. Smart Home Devices — Google Home speaker, Nest, Phillips Hue, Samsung SmartThings, Honeywell, Belkin Wemo, TP-Link, IFTTT. (More on these later.) You can use the app on both Android and iOS. Let’s take a detailed look at how to use the app. Download — Google Home app for Android Download — Google Home app for iOS The Tabs When you load the Google Home app, you will see three tabs along the top of the screen. They are Watch, Listen, and Discover. The tabs are primarily used for casting content around your home. Watch The Watch tab allows you to find any video content on apps you already have installed on your device. Along the top of the window, you’ll see links for the compatible apps.

It’s a vital app to have if you’re running lots of the supported devices around you home. But it’s also unwieldy to use. It feels like Google is trying to cram too much into it, resulting in confusing and complicated in-app navigation. The issue is symptomatic of the app’s roots in Google Cast. It doesn’t feel logical to have the casting content and smart home management content under the same umbrella. Alas, it’s early days. The rebranding from Google Cast to Google Home only happened in late-2016 and it seems Google is still wrestling with the best way to move forward. It’s certain to improve as time passes.

In other words, the one cool thing that Google Home Devices have that Amazon Devices don't is a half-baked feature only works with some subset of products with Google Home branding. In fact, other than a Chromecast, I haven't seen that feature work at all. Reply Dan Price 412 articles Dan is a British expat living in Mexico.

Long Beach, Calif.-based DynamicPoint is describing the release as a “significant milestone.” The release includes a SharePoint Add-In that can be deployed in either SharePoint on-premises or Online, which makes it easier to use Dynamics 365, AX and CRM. According to Kiril Genov, the product architect, with this new version users can publish any information from Dynamics 365, AX, GP, NAV and CRM in a SharePoint portal. For enterprise workers, this means easier document, data and information sharing and management around things like sales orders, customer contacts, or any other information stored in Dynamics 365, AX and CRM. DynamicPoint customers also have the option to add on capabilities which allow users to make edits and flow them directly back into Microsoft Dynamics. Third-party suppliers and partners continue to push out complements to the Microsoft portfolio, even as the company has made strides under the leadership of Satya Nadella to close gaps in its offerings.  SharePoint Customer, Vendor and Employee Portal v2.0 is a good example of this and if it works as the company claims, it is definitely worth a look. Microsoft Moves Into Africa Also this week, Redmond, Wash.-based Microsoft announced new expansion plans. With the increased demand for its Office 365 and Azure services, the company is looking for ways to expand its cloud infrastructure. Microsoft recently claimed that Office 365 has 100 million commercial users while Azure is snapping at the heels of both Amazon Web Services and Google. With that in mind, it announced it will open two data centers in South Africa — in Johannesburg and Cape Town — with initial availability in 2018. In a statement, Scott Guthrie, executive vice president, Cloud and Enterprise Group said it will offer Azure, Office 365 and Dynamics 365 to enterprises from these centers and will also guarantee data residency for companies concerned about compliance. “Few places in the world are as dynamic and diverse as Africa today. In this landscape, we see enormous opportunity for the cloud to accelerate innovation, support people across the continent who are working to transform their businesses, explore new entrepreneurship opportunities and help solve some of the world’s hardest problems,” Gutherie wrote. With the two new centers, Microsoft will have 40 cloud regions globally and will give it an entry point into a continent that is still relatively underdeveloped in terms of enterprise computing. It has beaten both Google and Amazon to the punch here. Neither company has set up a presence in Africa yet, though AWS is present in 16 regions encompassing 42 zones globally, while Google has eight regions with plans to expand before the end of the year. Google Unveils New Gif Maker Meanwhile, Mountain View, Calif.-based Google unveiled a Data GIF Maker which allows creation of data visualizations based on any two sets of data.  Google News Lab developed the new Data GIF Maker. For the moment it is a very basic offering that can be used to compare stats about different sets of information as that information evolves. Simon Rogers, data editor at the Google News Lab explained in a blog post: “Data visualizations are an essential storytelling tool in journalism, and though they are often intricate, they don’t have to be complex. In fact, with the growth of mobile devices as a primary method of consuming news, data visualizations can be simple images formatted for the device they appear on.” The tool is available for anyone to use. And judging from a quick search of the Google Keyword site they do offer some useful graphics. “We typically use the tool to represent competing search interest, but it can show whatever you want it to — polling numbers, sales figures, movie ratings,” the blog post continued. This is not Google Data Studio ‘Lite’ (Google Data Studio turns data into easy to read and share dashboards and reports) but it's interesting move and in the hands of Google, could go a long way. PandaDoc Raises $15 Million Finally this week, San Francisco-based PandaDoc announced it raised $15 million in Series B funding led by Rembrandt Ventures Partners, with participation from Microsoft Ventures, HubSpot, EBRD and Altos Ventures. PandaDoc develops an all-in-one platform that supports document creation around sales activity, including quotes, proposals and contracts. A newcomer to the enterprise documents space, PandaDoc was founded in 2013 and set itself the target of helping organizations, “close more deals.” On its website it claims to have been instrumental in closing $16 billion worth of deals. To do that it developed a suite of tools that includes document templates, editing, document tracking and e-signature smarts, as well as offering integrations with the likes of Salesforce. In 2015 it raised $5 million in a funding round by Altos Ventures with additional participation from TMT Investments and other unnamed investors. 0 Comments Top Articles Related Articles Recent Comments 10 Digital Workplace Trends Shaping the Future of Work SharePoint Emerges From Its Ugly Duckling Phase DAM Moves to Heart of Enterprise in Forrester Vendor Landscape Web CMS vs. PIM: Which to Use for Ecommerce Catalogs?

Image: google By Freia Lobo2017-05-26 09:44:54 -0700 Google wants to help make your research look better. To help journalists share their research and tell stories in a more visual and appealing way, Google just launched Data GIF Maker, a data visualization creator. "Data visualizations are an essential storytelling tool in journalism, and though they are often intricate, they don’t have to be complex," Google wrote in their announcement. " In fact, with the growth of mobile devices as a primary method of consuming news, data visualizations can be simple images formatted for the device they appear on." The project came out of Google's News Lab, an initiative to support journalists and storytelling. The lab also created the popular Google Trends project. SEE ALSO: Google's new Google Photos update can now automatically share your selfies To make a data gif with Google's new tool, simply add two terms, their titles, and an additional description (for our test, we used data from a 2014 study about how people pronounce internet terms):  Image: google The tool will then generate a handy gif like this: Image: google Right now the tool is very basic and currently supports comparisons between only two data points, meaning it's not the best fit for complex data and comparisons. But for simple visualizations, Data Gif Maker is extremely easy to use. By adding some color and animation, journalists can make the research they're trying to share a lot easier and more pleasant to consume, rather than listing the same information in text. The tool is free to use and you can try it here.

Google Maps v9.54 prepares to add saved locations for your school and gym, notification channels, and what looks like a task list [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 6:22am PDTMay 26, 2017 35 Plus 1 on G+ 54 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares139 APK Teardown Applications Downloads What's Really New Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 Saved locations for School and Gym 1.2 The 'Other' Notification Channel 1.3 A few new prompts 1.4 A task list called "Nearby Need?" 2 Download An update to Google Maps v9.54 began rolling out to users through the beta channel yesterday, but it doesn't appear to have any visible changes going live quite yet. However, a teardown of the apk does bring a few hints about what to expect in the future. There are clues about a couple of new saved destinations like the Home and Work slots that have become so useful, the first stirring of support for Android O's notification channels, a few new "promos" to get people interested in various features, and a very curious feature that might turn out to be a task list of sorts. As usual, we've got a link at the bottom to download this update to sideload if you're not interested in waiting for Google to deliver it to your device. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Saved locations for School and Gym If you find yourself regularly using the Home and Work saved locations for quick navigation, you'll enjoy this one. The Maps team is expanding the list to include two more common destinations: your gym and your school. <string name="GYM_LOCATION">Gym</string> <string name="SCHOOL_LOCATION">School</string> Since those two strings don't really include any specific telltale signs that they're intended to be default saved locations, I've included the two previously existing lines for Home and Work for comparison. It's pretty obvious that the naming convention matches up. <string name="HOME_LOCATION">Home</string> <string name="WORK_LOCATION">Work</string> There is also a newly added icon for education, which I would naturally assume will go with the School destination. There doesn't appear to be a similar icon dedicated to the Gym slot, but it's not as if Google can't easily color-fill the existing fitness icon. Nevertheless, this one missing icon might be a hint that Google won't make these new destination slots available until a future update includes the missing icon. These two new entries will obviously operate just like Home and Work for the purposes of navigation and quick route selection. And as always, users don't have to actually link these slots to real schools or gyms. I'm sure a lot of people will welcome this simple improvement because so many of us travel to more than just work and home in a typical day. The 'Other' Notification Channel I'll just make a quick mention of this topic since it's not really that interesting. Google Maps is going to have a notification channel on Android O titled "Other notifications." <string name="OTHER_NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL">Other notifications</string> I doubt this will be the only custom channel for Maps. After all, there are several subsections in Settings dedicated to each notification type, so we'll probably see the channel list grow a fair amount in the future. I would assume the Maps team is still trying to decide how to best organize the app's notifications. This "other" channel will probably become a placeholder for most of the notifications until they are organized into suitable channels. A few new prompts I normally skip changes that are meant to advertise existing features, but sometimes the focus of banners and notifications can give a little insight into the features and apps that may not be performing as well as expected or simply need user awareness. The latest Maps update includes three new promos. The first banner is for the Google Trips app. Launched around this time last year, Trips is basically an itinerary management app that's also intended for making local recommendations. Trips probably doesn't have a very substantial user base yet, so it's not hard to imagine why Google is trying to breathe a little more life into it. code <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_TITLE">Take your travel info with you</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_TITLE_WITH_AREA_NAME">Take your %1$s travel info with you</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_BODY">Reservations • Things to do • Day plans</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_DOWNLOAD_LINK">Get Google Trips app</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_DISMISS_LINK">No thanks</string> The next addition is intended to get users to try out the recently launched location sharing feature. It's pretty normal to show prompts to get users only newly released features, so there's nothing unusual about this one, but you can probably expect to see it in your navigation setup soon. code <string name="CAR_TI TLE_JOURNEY_SHARING">Share journey</string> <string name="JOURNEY_SHARING_PENDING_PROMPT_TEXT">Share your trip with %1$s</string> <string name="JOURNEY_SHARING_PENDING_PROMPT_TTS">Sharing your real-time location with %1$s until you arrive.</string> <string name="CAR_MENU_START_JOURNEY_SHARING">Share journey</string> <string name="CAR_MENU_STOP_JOURNEY_SHARING">Stop sharing</string> The final promotional banner will belong to the always familiar Local Guides program. As usual, it's going to encourage users to contribute to Maps for points. The one interesting oddity is that these strings have "v2" in their names. It's possible this just means they are for a new set of promos, or this might hint at a revised version of the points program. I would expect the former, but it's at least worth acknowledging the latter is possible. code <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_TITLE">Reach new Local Guides levels</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_TEXT">Now earn more points for your reviews, photos, edits, and adding new places.</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_GOTO_STATS">SEE YOUR LEVEL</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_OPEN_HELP">Learn more</string> A task list called "Nearby Need?" There's very little to go on for this topic, but it looks just weird enough that I suspect there's a feature brewing in there somewhere. A pair of new layouts were added with the name "nearby need," one of which defines the look of a list, and the other is for items in that list. There is also a single string with a related name and just the word "navigate" for text. <string name="NEARBY_NEED_NAVIGATE">Navigate</string> /layout/nearby_need_item.xml /layout/nearby_need.xml Based on this very limited amount of information, it does sound a little like a shopping list of sorts. Perhaps less like a grocery list and more like a list of chores or tasks – e.g. getting new tires on the car, picking up some materials for a weekend project, and buying new clothes. I would assume each item goes into a list and Google Maps will make it easy to navigate to the next nearest place where each of these things can be taken care of. I'm not actually sure if these are related, but there are also three new images to be found in the resources, and they certainly would fit with my theory. The first is for creating new tasks, the second is for completed tasks, and the final one is for "old" completed tasks. I suppose the old one might be for things a user did on previous days but hasn't removed from the list. This is all guesswork right now, but many people have been asking for ways to use Maps to get through chores, and this feels like the first hint of something like that. The one aspect that's not yet hinted at, but I certainly hope to see, is a feature that will sort tasks efficiently so people can choose the shortest (or fastest) route to get everything done. I'll keep watching and follow up when there are more developments.

They are used when you go to Your Contributions -> Check the Facts/Uncover Missing info. I think after all this time those two are still only for lvl 5 local guides... so yeah. Cody Toombs Right, the look of the images aren't new, but the files containing those images are. Or said more clearly, there are now multiple copies of those icons. mmark27 I sure would like there to be a "Work" and then a "Parking for Work" section for those that don't park right next to their office. Point being, if I want walking direction/estimations, give them from my office. If I want driving directions/estimations on time, know that I have to walk to my car, then drive from my parking location. The School addition will be good to finally have pop up automatically now though. Cody Toombs If you're not going to use all four slots for their intended purpose, you might just assign one of the others to be your work parking. Frankly, I would have liked these saved slots to have custom labels, since some people don't fit into this one shape. For example, I know somebody that has to travel to two different sites for the same job, and another friend that was enrolled in two different schools at the same time. It's not like one of these destinations can't go into the "Gym" slot, but it would be nice if the titles could make sense. mmark27 Right. I now have my "Work" location saved as my parking lot, which is silly, but it's the only way to get decent estimations. Your fix is what I'll be doing otherwise unless they fix it. The subtly though in this situation is El Goog knowing that the Work and Work Parking are linked existentially, so they can decipher where my body is and estimate from there, etc. Same can be said for Home and Home Parking if not directly on site. Would seem like Google's apartment-city-dwelling-first mentality would be more amenable to this off the bat. I agree that we should be able to have free labels on places and also as many places as we can stomach estimations/notifications on time to. Google knows where I am at all times....make it actually useful, guys. henleyb I work from home and Google would keep asking me to set my work address which is of course the same as my home address, it was a small but annoying thing. :) Austin Spangrud Sure would be nice if maps got integrated assistant into it. None of the commands and home commands that I have integrate with the Voice button in maps. Oh and In b4 where's my speed limit pop up Cody Toombs Speed limits are still limited geographically. Since I was in the Bay Area last week, I finally saw them pop up for the first time on my phone and in Android Auto. Funny enough, I now have a Speed Limit toggle in settings on one phone, but nowhere else :/ And now I'm probably not going to see the speed limits again for a long time. Paul_Werner Yeah and we used to have them and they disappeared. At least it did for me here in the Milwaukee, WI area. Same for when I travel to Chicago Nicholas Matranga Finally, it was so annoying to have to save my school address as my work address just to get commute updates. mike shwilly Grow up Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez Finally, Im glad that we can save more pinned-saved choices other than the usual Home and Work, although I would prefer to customize them on my own in the same manner we customize the saved list. I could make a really good use of few in my mind like Church, Work2, University, etc. Jon Xuereb Couldn't you use this school one for University Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez I used the word University just an example, the point is that it would be great to customize those pinned saves using our own creations. Paul_Werner I can't wait to see that "nearby need" implemented. Your guesswork on it sounds like it could be a really useful feature. h4rr4r Why are these static names? Why can't I add random strings and assign them saved locations? Ken Vincent what ever happened to speed limits? I thought that was on the verge of being a thing more then a year ago. UKTK8 "In the coming weeks" Meaning whenever Google d#$% well pleases. Jon Xuereb Lawyers I'm assuming dmo580 Yet Waze and other GPS apps have no issues. How about just displaying my current speed? Ken Vincent Not only that, but google provides speed limits as a service. I would imagine that is where Waze gets their speed limit info. https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/roads/speed-limits Jon Xuereb Because Google Maps is exponentially larger in terms of user base, and google is a bigger target for lawsuits Ken Vincent Waze is wholly owned by Google. They are not even an Alphabet company, they are Google. Jon Xuereb Still the size of the userbase affects the their risk assessment icyhotmike why not just let us add "Saved" locations such as Home and Work and whatever else we want? Damn Google in control of everything. makapav My God the Google apps and ecosystem are becoming such a clusterfuck with no sources of truth for data points. All the information is spread across random places. Richard Oldroyd I do use home a lot but for the others like gym I save as a contact and nav just as quick. Richard Oldroyd I'd love maps to display my current speed and advise what the speed limit is. Obviously they would have to add a warning saying they can not be held responsible for displaying an incorrect speed limit. I'd also like to see us be able to choose what is displayed underneath where they show destination time and miles to go, it would be useful to see arrival times at all stops not just the one you are currently naving to.

The latest version of its OS for wearable devices was already months behind schedule, after Google said in September that its release would be delayed until early 2017. By mid-April, many devices still hadn't received the update, but Google insisted that all remaining devices awaiting the upgrade would get it by the end of May, including the Moto 360 2nd Gen. Yesterday, Motorola tweeted that Android Wear 2.0 will roll out "in phases" to that device, "possibly as early as today". @NamelessWing @Moto Happy to report that AndroidWear 2.0 will start rolling out in phases on Moto 360 2nd Gen, possibly as early as today. — Motorola Support (@Moto_Support) May 25, 2017 It's not clear if any Moto 360 2nd Gen devices have actually received the update yet, but it seems that the wait is finally coming to an end. That said, Motorola hasn't provided any indication of when it expects the rollout to be completed, so it could still be days - or even weeks - before all of those devices are upgraded. The Moto 360 Sport was also on the list of devices that Google said would be upgraded by the end of May. However, it looks like those plans have slipped again - in a further tweet, Motorola confirmed that Android Wear 2.0 is still coming to the Moto 360 Sport, but added: "...we have no timing to share." @jfemoreau Moto 360 Sport will get 2.0 but we have no timing to share. - Daisy — Motorola Support (@Moto_Support) May 25, 2017 Meanwhile, ASUS announced last week that it had begun its Android Wear 2.0 rollout for the ZenWatch 3, but later said that it was "mistaken", and that it was aiming to start its rollout later this month.

Anyone with the corresponding app on their device can pay for goods and services with a simple tap of their phone against a compatible point-of-sale terminal with near-field communication, or NFC. Here’s everything you need to know about Android Pay, including the places and banks that support it. PayPal joins Android Pay Android Pay is an excellent replacement for your credit or debit cards but what about your PayPal account? Starting May 24, Android Pay users running version 4.4 or higher of the mobile operating system will be able to link PayPal to their profile. Previously, the only way to use the popular web-based payment platform in-store was through a PayPal debit card, or by inputting your phone number and PIN into one of the few compatible terminals out in the wild. To get started paying with PayPal from your Android device, tap the button at the bottom right like you normally would to add a card, then select “Add other payment methods.” PayPal may ask you to load funds to your account if you have not already. If you do not see the option yet, it may take a little while before the update rolls out to your device. Additionally, it is important to note PayPal support is only live for U.S. users at this time. Android Pay is currently only able to pull from your PayPal balance for transactions but eventually, any cards you have saved on your PayPal account will also be supported. International release Android Pay made its debut on the global stage when it launched in the U.K. in May 2016, and the service has slowly continued to expand since. It’s now available in Japan, Ireland, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, and Poland. At Google I/O 2017, the company announced the service will arrive in at least another five countries before the end of the year: Brazil, Canada, Russia, Spain, and Taiwan. We don’t have details on specific launch partners for each territory but check back for updates as more information becomes available. Canada Android Pay could launch in Canada as soon as May 31, according to MobileSyrup, which cites anonymous sources. At the moment, it’s not officially known which banks and card companies will support the platform when it debuts. However, some clues dating back to late last year hint at support from Interac, one of Canada’s debit payment processing networks. This was revealed by 9to5Google when it investigated the Android Pay app back in December. At the time, some users also reported they were able to add and complete transactions with certain Visa cards through Android Pay. This caused many to believe the service had officially been launched, but Google elaborated shortly afterward, claiming that it wasn’t quite ready for prime time yet. Since then, some of the cards that were working have had support removed. Russia Prior to Google I/O, four banks were named in relation to Android Pay’s Russian launch: Sberbank, Alfa, Raiffeisen, and Tinkoff. These banks could be the first to receive the service when it launches over the coming months. The report comes courtesy of Russian news sites by way of AndroidPolice, which also relays that Visa recently updated its Russian support pages with references to Android Pay, before removing them from the site. In tandem with Google’s confirmation at I/O, this means launch could be imminent. Belgium Google is officially bringing Android Pay to Belgium. The company announced the news in a blog post, which highlights that the service will be usable in as many as 85,000 institutions. It will work with both MasterCard and Visa and supports three major banks — BNP, Fintro, and Hello Bank. Not only that, but the company says that CBC, KBC, and KBC Brussels are all on the way. Japan Contactless and mobile payments are already widely used in Japan, and on December 12, Android Pay becomes the latest option for shoppers. However, it has launched with Rakuten Edy, an eMoney service accepted in more than 470,000 locations, rather than local banks. Operated through the usual Android Pay app, you create an Edy card or use an existing one, ready to use in supporting stores. In 2017, Google says to expect more payment options, including Visa and Mastercard, through its cooperation with local payment specialists FeliCa Networks. Ireland On December 6, Android Pay made its way to Ireland, and it promises compatibility “at thousands of retail locations throughout Ireland that accept contactless payments.” From McDonald’s to supermarket Tesco to book retailer Eason, there are plenty of places in which Europeans can now use Android Pay. Here is a list of places where Android Pay is now accepted in Ireland. New Zealand In November, New Zealand received access to Android Pay, and according to Google, it will be available at a number of common locations, including The Warehouse, Domino’s, McDonald’s, etc. As of right now, it only supports the BNZ Flexi Debit Visa card, but it will expand to more services as time goes on. Poland Poland got Android Pay in November, and Google says it’s available at more than 400,000 retail locations such as Costa Coffee, Carrefour, and Rossman. You can add your Mastercard or Visa debit or credit cards from the following Polish banks: Alior Bank, Bank Zachodni WBK, and T-Mobile Banking Services. Google says support for mBank will come soon, as well as other banks in the coming months. The payment service will also be available in various apps soon, including Allegro, Ceneo, Fancy, iTaxi.pl, and Uber. Hong Kong In October, Android Pay launched in Hong Kong, with a related blog post announcement noting that the service would be accepted “at over 5,000 locations in Hong Kong where contactless payments are accepted, including stores such as at 7-Eleven, Circle K, Fortress, Mannings, Maxim’s Cakes, MX, McDonald’s, Pacific Coffee, ParknShop, SmarTone, Watsons, Wellcome, and more.” Moreover, it also works in several apps including Boutir Collect, Deliveroo, Kaligo, Klook, Snaptee, and coming soon, Uber. You can check here to see all the supported banks in Hong Kong, including Hang Seng Bank, DBS Bank, Dah Sing Bank, the Bank of East Asia, Standard Chartered Bank, and more. Australia In Australia, Google has listed an impressive number of supported banks — more than 25 including ANZ, Beyond Bank, and Macquarie. Unfortunately, ANZ is the only one out of the top four banks in Australia to support the payment service. To see the list of supported Australian banks, check here. Aussies will also soon be able to use Android Pay within select apps such as Catch of the Day, Deliveroo, Domino’s, EatNow, Hotel Tonight, Kogan.com and more. That means speedier checkout times in apps as you won’t have to type out all your credit card information. Singapore In late June, Singapore became the third country to get Android Pay. It’s compatible with any contactless terminal in the country and supports loyalty cards and credit card rewards programs. The service is compatible with MasterCard and Visa cards from many of the country’s largest institutions, including DBS Bank, Standard Chartered Bank, OCBC Bank, POSB Bank, and UOB. You can check the full list of supported banks in Singapore here. United Kingdom Google’s first financial partners in the U.K. are the Bank of Scotland, First Direct, Halifax, HSBC, Lloyds Bank, Nationwide, MBNA, and M&S Bank. The search giant recently added Santander, RBS, Ulster Bank, and NatWest to the list. Both MasterCard and Visa debit and credit cards from co-operating banks will work, and TSB customers should know only selected account types can use the service. Even though it supports Apple Pay, it doesn’t look like Barclays will ever support Android Pay. The second-largest U.K. bank launched its own NFC payments service called Contactless Mobile. You can check this list to see which banks support Android Pay in the U.K. Retailers that will accept Android Pay payments include Costa Coffee and Starbucks, Boots, Waitrose, Aldi, Superdrug, and KFC. Plus, like Apple Pay, transport for London’s ticketing system will support it. Various shopping apps such as Deliveroo, Fancy, Kickstarter, Zara, Takeaway.com, and Hotel Tonight will offer Android Pay as a payment option. The contactless payment restriction of £30 remains in place, but in some situations, you’ll be able to spend up to £100 provided you authorize the transaction using a fingerprint or PIN code. SUPPORT IN THE U.S. All four major banks in the U.S. support Android Pay — that’s Chase Bank, Wells Fargo, Citibank, and Bank of America. Chase Bank grossly lagged behind the rest of the major U.S. banks, but as of September 2016, it has finally added support for Android Pay. Of course, plenty of other banks are also lagging behind, but now the likes of BMO Harris have finally added support for the service. In addition to adding your credit and debit cards to the service, Bank of America is installing NFC-enabled ATMs around the country — this would allow you to access your bank account to withdraw cash just by tapping your phone. Other U.S. institutions, integrations In May 2017, Google announced support for 71 new banks and credit unions, including 1st Constitution Bank, Central State Bank, and more. If your bank or credit union didn’t already support Android Pay, it may well do so now. You can check out the full list of supported banks and credit unions for yourself here. Before that, Google added 46 new banks to its roster, but they are names many will not recognize, except for Fifth Third Bank. Some of the others, according to Android Police, include the Alaska USA Federal Credit Union, Greenfield Banking Company, and the Peoples Federal Credit Union. You can check to see if your bank supports the service here. Most banks that already support Apple Pay will back Google’s service since both use similar NFC technology for payments — other top institutions include PNC, Capital One, TD Bank, HSBC, American Express, Ally Bank, and USAA. In mid-December, the company added support for 31 additional rural banks and credit unions across the contiguous United States. They include Allegacy Federal Credit Union, the Bank of Walterboro, Canyon State Credit Union, First Piedmont Federal Savings, Jackson Community Federal Credit Union, Northeast Georgia Bank, San Francisco FCU, USC Credit Union, Verve, and Washington Trust Bank. The expanded support comes on the heels of 19 additions earlier in December 2016. These include 1st Advantage Federal Credit Union, ACU of Texas, Alpine Credit Union, Alternatives FCU, Bank of the Ozarks, Union State Bank of Fargo, and Valley Federal Credit Union. MasterCard, Visa, American Express, and Discover support Android Pay. Sites that support Visa Checkout and Masterpass will soon be able to handle Android Pay as well, thanks to a strategic partnership. You’ll be able to use your fingerprint to confirm payments as well, and Visa Checkout and Masterpass customers will be able to link their accounts with Android Pay as well. The integration will roll out in early 2017. Mobile banking app integration Android Pay is now integrating with several banking apps around the world to make it a little easier to use Android Pay. Now, many customers will be able to add cards to Android Pay from their mobile banking apps at the tap of a button. At the launch of the new feature, there are a few banks that are supported, including Bank of America, Discover, Bank of New Zealand, mBank, and USAA. In-App and mobile web purchases Although you’ll probably use Android Pay mostly in shops, it will also let you make in-app purchases. When you’re about to purchase something in an app that supports the service, you’ll see a button that will allow you to pay using Android Pay, eliminating the need to get your wallet and pull out your credit or debit card. At the moment, Google has listed more than a dozen apps that support in-app purchases with Android Pay including Lyft, OpenTable, Hotel Tonight, Instacart, and, most recently, Etsy. If you make purchases via the Chrome Browser app on your phone, you’re in luck. Google is adding support for Android Pay for certain sites, making the checkout process less of a hassle. It currently works with a handful of sites such as Groupon and 1-800-Flowers. The integration with Visa Checkout and Masterpass is sure to boost the number of sites that support Android Pay as well. “Just like in stores and in apps, Android Pay does not share actual account numbers with merchants, so users can shop online with confidence, knowing that Android Pay keeps their card number secure,” according to the Android blog. COMPATIBLE DEVICES AND SECURITY To use Android Pay, you’ll need an NFC-enabled smartphone running Android 4.4 KitKat and above. It will work at stores with NFC contactless payment terminals. Like most NFC payment systems, Android Pay comes with all the necessary security, including a way to shut down devices that have been stolen so nobody can use your card. The system uses tokenization, which processes transactions via individual random account numbers, rather than your actual credit or debit card account number. In-app purchases are as safe as its NFC contactless counterpart. Rewards and loyalty As Android Pay is meant to replace your wallet, it’s expanding to include all those other cards you would typically have on you as well — gift and loyalty cards. Google has been expanding its partnerships, and as such the company says Android Pay is the first mobile wallet to “deeply integrate” with Uber’s Payment Rewards program. Walgreens says its Balance Rewards members can now apply their loyalty account via Android Pay at checkout. If you’re a member, all you need to do is add your Balance Rewards card to the Android Pay app. When you’re at the register, hold up your Android smartphone to the NFC terminal to apply your rewards information — when you’re ready to pay, hold the smartphone up again at the same place. You’ll have to add your credit or debit card beforehand to complete the purchase, of course. Stores with NFC terminals support Android Pay Like all other forms of NFC payment, Android Pay will be accepted in more than one million stores across the United States, including Toys ‘R’ Us, GameStop, Subway, Whole Foods, and more. Walmart does not accept contactless payments, yet.

 How Tim Armstrong, a hotshot Boston sales guy, wowed Google's founders, built its multi-billion-dollar ad business from scratch, then became AOL's CEO Alyson Shontell May 26, 2017, 12:27 PM 5,118 facebook linkedin twitter email print Tim Armstrong was an early Google employee who is now AOL's CEO. AP Tim Armstrong is the CEO of AOL, and he will be the CEO of the combined AOL-Yahoo company under Verizon once that merger is completed. Before joining AOL, Armstrong was an executive at Google who helped build its advertising business from $700,000 a year to billions every quarter. He was also an expert advertising salesman and entrepreneur, and the first person to sell a $1 million digital-advertising deal, back when all the money was flowing to print and TV companies. Armstrong visited Business Insider and spoke with Business Insider's US editor in chief, Alyson Shontell, for "Success! How I Did It." In the interview, Armstrong discussed how he built a high-powered career. During the wide-ranging conversation, he talked about: How he started a newspaper out of college, where actor Casey Affleck worked for him. How he became a great digital-ad salesman and sold the first $1 million ad deal online. What it’s like to be interviewed by Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin. How he helped Google pivot from a licensing business to an advertising business, and launch products like AdSense, which would eventually generate billions in revenue. How you know it's time to leave a safe, cushy job (Google) for one that's high-risk (AOL). The advice his dad gave him the night before he started at AOL. How he spent his first 100 days as CEO. How he makes gnarly decisions and comes to peace with them. How he inspires his teams when morale is low. How talks with Verizon CEO Lowell McAdam heated up and led to AOL's $4.4 billion acquisition. How you can be an effective leader who is also well liked and respected. The advice Tim gives to his children, and to anyone who wants to build a high-power career. Here's the full interview, which you can listen to below. Subscribe to "Success! How I Did It" on Acast or iTunes.

A strawberry farm, volunteering to be fired, and employing Casey Affleck SUN VALLEY, ID - JULY 6: (L to R) Nancy Armstrong walks with husband Tim Armstrong, chief executive officer of AOL Inc., as they attend the annual Allen & Company Sun Valley Conference, July 6, 2016 in Sun Valley, Idaho. Every July, some of the world's most wealthy and powerful businesspeople from the media, finance, technology and political spheres converge at the Sun Valley Resort for the exclusive weeklong conference. Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images Alyson Shontell: Tim Armstrong is the CEO of AOL, and he'll be the head of the combined AOL-Yahoo company when the merger closes. Before AOL, Tim built Google's ad products and is basically responsible for the brainchild of AdSense. And he built the ad team from scratch. We're really happy to have you, Tim. Tim Armstrong: Alyson, good to see you. Thanks for having me on a rainy New York day. Shontell: I want to go all the way back, to the beginning of your career. It sounds as if you were always entrepreneurial. I remember the story about your making a strawberry farm successful during college? Armstrong: When I was growing up, I always had the entrepreneurial bug. There were multiple things I did when I was younger, in my middle-school and high-school ages. But one of them was with a friend from college. There was a strawberry farm that the bank owned. I don't know if the farmer had lost it to the bank, but there was a strawberry farm, and we went to the bank and they weren't using the farm, so we said, "Could we take over the farm for the summer and do a pick-your-own strawberries? It'd be a lot less work for us, and probably a lot more profitable." And so we did a you-pick strawberry farm, from a farm we didn't own, and cut a deal with the bank to do it. We had hundreds of customers drive up and go pick their own strawberries, and it ended up being a very successful venture and a lot of fun. Shontell: So then you graduate and you have a short stint in finance? Armstrong: Right when I graduated from college, I actually taught a program called the Explorer Program at Wellesley College. That was for the summer. Then I went to an investment bank in Boston, and I was there for about three or four months, and I realized that banking was not something for me. So I went to my boss and said, "You know, I think you should let me go." Shontell: You volunteered to be fired? Armstrong: Yeah, I just said, "I don't think this is the career for me, and I should do something else." And they said, "No, why don't you stay? It seems like you could do a good job here over time." And I said, "I want to go do something else." So I left and ended up starting a newspaper in Boston, out of that experience. And that's really what got me — if you look back to the seminal moment for me — what got me sitting here today — it was really that decision. Shontell: It's no wonder you're the head of essentially a media company now. So BIB, was the “Beginnings in Boston” newspaper that you started. And the way you got into that, I guess you had been cold-calling executives, just hoping they would talk to you? And you discovered that nobody would talk to you unless you were a reporter? Armstrong: I was calling people in Boston. I was really trying to just figure out what I wanted to do, and learn about different careers. I again had thought that banking would be something I would be really interested in, but when I realized it wasn't, I thought, "I should go do research and find out, really, what I want to do." And so I would call different executives in Boston, CEOs of companies, and see if they would meet with me, and not many of them would. I called one of a very large financial institution in Boston, and the woman was very nice on the phone, the CEO’s assistant. She said, "You know, the only people who really cold-call here, or who get through to the CEO, are journalists." Later that night, I was talking to my roommate and I said, "You know what we should do? We have all our friends in their 20s, everyone's finding jobs or figuring out what they want to do — why don't we start a publication to get advice from all of these people, and give it to them? Boston's filled with young people graduating." So we decided to launch the magazine. It was targeted at exactly my demographic back then, and I didn't know anything about publishing newspapers or magazines, but we basically launched from scratch. We sold everything we owned — cars, bikes, surfboards, the whole thing. We bought an Apple Quadra 650 computer. And we basically learned how to publish from scratch, and print from scratch, distribute from scratch. In that journey, I learned probably the most I've ever learned, just about what a business is from start to finish. And it was a wonderful experience. It was really hard. We did an OK job at it, not great. And we ended up buying a second newspaper, which was a better idea. That was in Cambridge and Harvard Square. So that was the launch of my phone calls to newspaper ownership, in a very short time period. Shontell: It sounds like you never had a problem cold-calling people, which is Sales 101. So it's not really surprising that you ended up having a career in that. But you were telling me a funny story before this podcast, about how actor Casey Affleck used to work with you? Armstrong: So we bought the second newspaper, The Square Deal, and if you went to Harvard back in those days, you used it. It had coupons in the back; it told you what was happening around town, in Cambridge Square. And we hired people, kids from Harvard, to hand them out to other Harvard students. I was at a dinner a couple of years ago, when Casey Affleck said to me, "Hey do you remember me? Do I look familiar?" And I said, "Yeah, of course you're familiar — you strike me as very familiar." He said, "You don't remember, but I used to work at The Square Deal and hand out the newspapers for you." Obviously he's done really well, and he's not handing out newspapers anymore, for sure. I think he's even won an Academy Award, so that was a fun story, and a good memory back to the old days. NEW YORK, NY - NOVEMBER 19: AOL CEO Tim Armstrong attends AOL's MAKERS: Once And For All Premiere at the DOC NYC on November 19, 2015 in New York City. Photo by Larry Busacca/Getty Images for AOL Shontell: So you soon became interested in the internet. You visited MIT and saw a presentation about it, and you switched gears. What happened there? Armstrong: Another friend of mine, Peter Dunn, owned a store in Boston called Cool Beans, which was a Grateful Dead store. And he was very networked in the Cambridge and MIT communities. He said, "Hey, there are some people coming. They have this new thing called an "internet browser." We're going to meet down at MIT, and you can see it." I went down, and literally within one minute of them turning it on and showing what the browser did, I looked at my friend and said, "I'm selling my newspaper as soon as I got back to the office. I'm going to go do this thing. This is 100 times easier, faster, and more scalable than what we're doing in the newspaper business." And so I literally went back, called my parents on the way home from that meeting, and I said, "I'm selling the newspaper. I'm going to try to move to an internet environment." We started actually trying to put our newspapers online. This is 1994, I think. And then, long story short, I moved pretty quickly. We sold our share in the newspaper back to another publisher in Boston, and then I went off to start doing internet things, which was a lot of fun. Shontell: So you rise as this great salesperson, with the first internet magazine, I believe. And the company you end up later working for gets acquired by Disney? Armstrong: Yes. After the newspaper, the only thing I found right away — because not many people were doing internet things — was IDG, the big tech publisher, was launching the first internet magazine, which was a magazine about the coming internet. I went to work there. In those travels — it's an incredibly long story — but I went to an event with the founders of NASCAR, the France family. And the Frances got up and gave a presentation about where they thought this internet thing was going. I talked to the NASCAR family, and they basically said, "Look, there's this company. Paul Allen's starting a company on the West Coast called 'Star Wave.'" Shontell: Microsoft cofounder Paul Allen, right? Armstrong: Yes. And they were the first real content company on the internet. So when I got back to Boston from that trip, I had a voicemail on my phone from Star Wave. And they said, "Hey, we heard you're in Boston. We hear you're doing internet things, and you're trying to do advertising and content on the internet. We have a company in Seattle. Would you like to come out and visit us?" So I flew out to Seattle. I did a day's worth of interviews and got offered the job at the end of the day. I went back, moved from Boston with a bag of clothes — I didn't own anything else at the time —and moved to Seattle. And I had an awesome experience out of Star Wave. We launched ESPN.com, NFL.com, ABCnews.com, and worked with a whole crew of people from all over the US who had moved there to really get into internet content. And that was an amazing experience. Then Disney bought us. I ended up moving back to New York, to work for Disney, helping them get their internet things off the ground, including ESPN and ABC. Shontell: From what I understand, you were pretty young when you went out to Seattle. You were in your mid-20s maybe, and you were working across platforms, which was a really early concept of TV-plus-digital, plus all these things. And you're also working with the legacy-TV sales guys, who are the old guys who've worked their way up to the top. How did they let you in? Why were you such a good salesman? Armstrong: Well, one is, when I was at Star Wave in Seattle originally, I had done, at the time, the largest deal on the internet ever done. So I did a $1 million deal back in probably 1996 or 1997. And this was when most of the deals were $10,000 deals. I got on Paul Allen's radar screen. I ended up flying down to a Portland Trailblazers game with Paul Allen and some friends from Star Wave. And then when Disney bought the company and I moved to New York, people knew about this deal. The deal I had done was with Rick Scott, who's now the governor of Florida. He was the CEO of Columbia/HCA, and he did the first really, truly large ad deal at Star Wave and for ESPN. When I got to New York, I sort of had a reputation of somebody who was energetic, creative, and doing deals. I showed up in New York, and I was really one of only a couple internet people there. It was a little bit more like we were outside-the-box people who didn't fit into the normal way that everything was happening in New York and media. So they kind of took us everywhere. It was sort of like a dog-and-pony show, and we were the dog. I learned a lot from working at ESPN, which was an amazing company with amazing people. I got to spend a lot of time with people who were super knowledgeable about advertising and super knowledgeable about content. I became, like, their internet buddy. What it's like to be interviewed by Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin Sergey Brin and Larry Page, the cofounders of Google. Getty / Michael Nagle Shontell: That served you well, because then Google came calling. Google at the time was this tiny startup. It was barely generating any revenue. Omid Kordestani, who's now the executive chairman of Twitter, calls you up. Armstrong: Right. Shontell: And he's at Google at the time. What does he say and what's that meeting like? Armstrong: Omid had called, through another woman I worked with at Star Wave. And he said, "Can you meet me in New York City?" I met him at the Carlisle Hotel in New York on a rainy Friday. And we hit it off right away. If you know Omid, he's one of the best humans on the planet, and one of the most engaging. At that time, Google was into licensing software. That was the main business model at that point. And they were thinking about getting more into advertising, so Omid asked me a whole bunch of questions about what I thought, and I ended up going out to meet and have breakfast with Sergey Brin in Palo Alto. I had had another job offer at the time from a large gaming company, an unbelievable job. Which would have, at my age, been super enticing. But after meeting Omid and Larry Page and Sergey Brin, and some other people from Google, you could tell there was going to be magic there. And it wasn't exactly clear what it was going to be, but I decided to join Google, and that was a great decision. A lot of fun, and just an unbelievable experience. And again, super-talented people. It was a highlight for me. Shontell: Do you remember what that first meeting with Larry and Sergey was like? What is it like meeting the Google founders back then, as they're growing it? Armstrong: I don't think I've ever told this story. But when I had my first discussion with them, they basically said at the beginning of the meeting, after a few questions, "We're not really sure what to ask you. Ask yourself the questions. Like, what questions would you ask yourself, if you were us?" So I said, "Look, I'm very direct person, very honest. Here's what I would ask, the following questions." And I thought that was interesting. I realized later, after working with them, that that was not an anomaly, that was one of their tactics. But they were driven. I think to this day, Larry and Sergey are obviously very smart, and very creative. They're very competitive also, in a good way. I'd say they care a lot. At their size now and what they're doing, I'm sure there's a lot of feedback on them, how people feel about them. But they're, at their heart, very good people. Both of them. Creating AdSense for Google, from scratch NEW YORK, NY - SEPTEMBER 26: Tim Armstrong speaks onstage during the Building Brands People Love: A Fireside Chat with AOLs Tim Armstrong on the Times Center Stage during 2016 Advertising Week New York on September 26, 2016 in New York City. Photo by John Lamparski/Getty Images for Advertising Week New York Shontell: When you get to Google, it's generating about $700,000 a year in ad revenue. And now it's generating about $25 billion a quarter. So you got in and helped them figure out what ad products were going to work. And one was AdSense, right? How did you help develop that? It's now a multibillion-dollar-a-quarter business for them. Armstrong: First of all, Salar Kamangar used to be the head of YouTube and was really the brainchild behind AdWords, and a few other people we worked with. Really, it all kind of came together in a very mad-scientist way, of how AdWords got off the ground, and the ad business. But there were a whole bunch of us working on it, and it had a good outcome on the AdWords side. And then one day a guy named John Firm, who worked in our ad-sales group, came and said, "Hey, we have a whole bunch of customers who don't have budgets spent on search. They basically load all their budgets in. There's lot of room for other places they could run it, but we can't spend all their money." And by the way, one of our publishers, About.com, said, "Is there any way for you guys to help us figure out how to make more money?" And so we literally took a PowerPoint page, mocked up a content page, and put AdWord boxes on it that were laid into the content. We took it into the Google meeting, to the executive-team meeting, and said, "Hey, why don't we syndicate all of our ads onto content properties?" Which today doesn't sound like brain surgery, but it was a moment in the company's history when there were a whole bunch of people who didn't want to do it. They were like, "We're a search company. Let's stay focused on search. This doesn't make any sense. Display ads don't really work." There was a big argument, back and forth, but at the end of the day we got a group of engineers. We hired Kurt Abrahamson, who was the president of Jupiter, to come and run it. We spend about a year in my group developing it and growing it, and then we turned it over to Susan Wojcicki, who's running YouTube now. She took it over and ran it. Then Applied Semantics was a company that was bought by the product and engineering team, so that was another product that had a lot of founders to it, I guess, and a lot of success because a lot of energy got put into it. One untold story about Google I should have gone back to is, one of the reasons Google is successful in ads is because the search-licensing business went away. Yahoo bought Inktomi, and so one of Google's major revenue lines kind of went away, because search licensing went to a free model from a paid model. That allowed a lot of the engineering talent at Google to go focus on ads. I think without that type of transition, we never would have had the horsepower in terms of the intellectual capital on engineering a product. Sometimes in business you get lucky, and what looked like a bad situation with the licensing business turned out to be an unbelievably big opportunity. And that's really what led to AdWords. And with the DoubleClick acquisition, there was lots of stuff like that that came out of it. What looked like a tough situation originally turned out to be a boon for the entire company. Shontell: So this works. You become this god within Google, managing this massive department. Armstrong: I was not a god within Google. There were a lot of gods within Google. So there was a massively talented team there. Unbelievable talent, yeah. A call from Jeff Bewkes Time Warner CEO Jeff Bewkes Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images Shontell: Well, that may be true, but still. The head of Time Warner gives you a call, Jeff Bewkes. He notices what you've built and what you've done. This is 2009. What made you intrigued to take a meeting with him, and to talk about the idea of joining AOL? Armstrong: You know, a few things I would go back to. The reason I ended up going to Google was that it looked like there was a huge opportunity in the information business, and putting information connected with where commerce happens, was a big opportunity. Earlier in the 2000s I had cofounded and funded a company with my college roommate, Luke Beatty, called Associated Content, which was more of a content company that eventually got sold to Yahoo. But my time at Google, I'd say after I was there for almost 10 years, I have a personal career philosophy, which is, I think you should continue to do something as long as you're learning quantum number of things in general. And I think the quantum learning is probably the most important attribute to people's careers, to continue to grow. At Google I just wasn't learning anymore, but my interest level over time had started to get really focused in on the content space, and where media was going, and working on Associated Content a little bit. I was on the board for a while. It got me interested in where content was going. And then when Jeff Bewkes called, it seemed like a unique opportunity. I could go into my investing philosophy, but I'm also somebody who likes to invest. I think a lot of opportunities are opportunities because everyone can't see them. And if you can read something in the newspaper, it's probably not an opportunity anymore. And AOL was the exact opposite. It was something that everyone had given up on, but they had a lot of resources, a lot of users, and they had a lot of talent. So it seemed like an opportunity. If I was going to do something disruptive, that'll also be a big runway to do something disruptive because people frankly were counting it out. I think that you have a choice to go to a startup to start something, or you have a choice to do something at bigger scale. I wanted to do something at bigger scale. And it was just an interesting asset. It was probably going to be a windy path, because it was inside of Time Warner. If we wanted to spin it out, we'd have to go through the whole process of spinning it out, and then we'd have to make all these changes to the company, and it was a challenging experience, and that's what I wanted at the time. How to weigh a big, risky career move and leave your safe, cushy job Arianna Huffington's Twitter stream Shontell: So at the time when you're having this conversation, you're thinking about taking the job. But there was a graveyard of AOL CEOs. There were five, I think, within that decade. How did you measure the risk, and how did you decide to jump? How did you make sure you weren't the sixth CEO in that graveyard? Armstrong: Yeah, you know, it's interesting. I didn't want to take the job if I didn't think I could do it. And I definitely had a lot of reflection time on that, because a lot of these companies that have these situations have a lot of CEOs, and they're all smart people. They are good at their careers. I was carefully thinking about it, but on the other hand I thought: What if this totally fails and it's the world's biggest failure? Really — who cares? I'll probably learn more doing it. A lot of people said to me, "Why would you ever leave Google? Why would you leave Google and your reputation at Google to go do something like AOL?" But I thought about it the opposite way, which was, if you wanted to have the most intense learning experience, and apply a lot of the skills I had learned in the 10 or 15 years prior, AOL seemed like a great opportunity to do that. My personality is more entrepreneurial, and it just seemed like an opportunity that, although it had tons of risk, it also had tons of opportunity. And you've got to be willing. My dad said to me the night before I started at AOL, "This is a burn-the-bridge moment. If you fail at this, you can't walk backward. So you should figure out how to always look forward." My dad said to me the night before I started at AOL, 'This is a burn-the-bridge moment. If you fail at this, you can't walk backward. So you should figure out how to always look forward.' And I think that was a great piece of advice, because that's essentially what we had to do, over and over and over again. Shontell: How do you make a burn-the-bridge decision? How do you know you're making the right choice? Especially as the leader of a huge company? Armstrong: One thing is, when I took the AOL job, I traveled around and went on a little mini leadership roadshow before I actually started. I got to announce that I was going to start, and then I had some time before I started and I spent a lot of time with a lot of different leaders, who I respected, who are big leaders across corporate America and some entrepreneurs. Essentially, I think in a CEO job, you have to be OK with risk and you have to be OK with failure. I have a saying which is, "You have to fail toward a goal." As long as you're failing, if you know what the goal is, it's OK to fail in that direction. And that's the advice I got from people. On that roadshow, I had a lot of people challenge me. The best mentors I had are also the most challenging people. And on that roadshow, they asked me a lot of the questions I ended up facing further on. I wasn't prepared for all of them but I kind of knew what the role was, and what the job was going to be. And fortunately, or unfortunately, for AOL, a lot of that I learned on the job overall. So it was challenging. Shontell: And when you come into a new job like that, do you need to bring your own team with you? Because that's something you did. You cleared out the executives, brought in some people from Google. Was that essential? Armstrong: When I first started I brought a couple people like Maureen Sullivan, who's the president who runs Rent the Runway now. She was the first person who came over from Google with me. And what I told the AOL team was, "Look, this is the team. Everyone's going to have their shot. We have to change what we're doing. Some of the changes, if you want to roll with them and stick with them, great. If this is not what you want to do, raise your hand, because we're going to go in a different direction." And I think over time I did end up bringing a bunch of people in from Google, and other people as well. I would say looking back on it, overall, you had a very challenged company. Out of the gates, we were trying to spin a company out of a public company and take it public alone, which is a massive challenge. Forget about one that's in a downturn, overall. I think there was a whole group of us who were somewhat experienced, but not fully experienced in doing all the things that we were doing. So we were figuring it out on the fly. I bet if you went back and talked to a lot of those people, it was probably one of the best — and hardest — but best learning experience. If I went back to it now, at my experience level, I would probably take a step back and take a better account of my own skills of what I was really good at, and what I was not good at. And I probably would have augmented the team slightly. Not that I wouldn't have brought the people in from Google, but I would have had a couple other people around me who had more experience, and I think that was a lesson, and something I'm frankly taking into the Yahoo deal we're working on now. How to inspire a team when morale is low TechCrunch/Flickr Shontell: You also had a really tough challenge of, this was an uninspired company. It had gone through a couple of rough years, maybe people didn't even remember what a good year felt like. And you had to come in and get people to buy into your vision and get people excited again. So how do you go in and breathe inspiration into a company that feels deflated? Armstrong: We did a 100-day process, and I traveled around the whole globe. There were about 10,000 AOL employees at the time, I saw about 9,000 of them in person, and I had three processes I was running: feedback from the entire company and team, feedback from the management team, and then a list I was keeping of things that I thought we should be doing. After the 100 days, we held a meeting at the Time Warner Center and I put up three whiteboards. On one white board I wrote back the results from the entire global team of what they thought we should invest in. I put up a white board of what the management team thought, and I put up a whiteboard of what I thought. I flipped them all around at the same time. Each one had five things on them. All of the white boards were identical, except for one area on the white board that I had flipped around on my personal side. So the whole company was already in alignment and I think that got people excited. They weren't told what the strategy was. They got input, and everyone was on the same path in believing in it. A meeting with Verizon's CEO that led to a $4.4 billion deal Lowell McAdam. Business Insider/Michael Seto Shontell: Down the road, Lowell McAdam, the CEO of Verizon, and you have a conversation. Verizon ends up buying AOL for $4.4 billion. How did that conversation start, and how do you decide, as the head of a huge company, that this was the right move? Armstrong: There were two things. Lowell is an incredible CEO at Verizon, and somebody who really helped grow it from a wire line to wireless — and Verizon to become one of the most successful companies on the planet in doing so. When I sat down with Lowell, it was one-on-one. It was at the Allen and Co. conference at what they call the "duck pond," where people kind of have meetings after the conference is over. And essentially I had a blank sheet of paper and Lowell asked me a number of questions. Things like, where the industry is going, what the structure would be, and what I thought was happening. I drew him a diagram of what I thought was happening. We talked for an hour or two about it, and then I didn't see him for months afterward, and then he called. We had talked about [how] maybe there are operational things to do together between the companies, and then he called and came back in the fall. I met with him, and we had more and more conversations. So over the course of time, there was a very natural progression of where things were going. On the AOL front, what was happening was everything was going mobile and everything was going data-driven. I used to carry around a five-column chart from our board-of-directors meetings that I started every meeting with, that had the strategic priorities for the company. Mobile, video, and data were the first three things on that chart, and I knew we needed to solve that issue. And Verizon, at the time, wanted to solve their challenge of, how do they grow services? So what naturally grew out of that conversation was a combination of what Verizon needed to solve and what we needed to solve. It didn't start out as an M&A deal. It started as a big operational deal, then it went to a joint venture, then it went to a full company sale. But that's how it started. And at the same time, there were other companies kicking the tires on AOL, and we were meeting with people, but the reality was Verizon, if you think the future is mobile, then it's going to be about video and data. If you think the future is mobile, then it's going to be about video and data. It's hard to argue Verizon wasn't a great outcome for us as a business. I've been there for two years now; it's been a great experience. Shontell: One thing that's happening in the broader media landscape in digital is this term "duopoly." A lot of media executives keep talking about it — it's the idea that Google and Facebook. the duo, are taking a ginormous share of all digital-ad dollars. There was recent a study from IAB that showed 89% of the digital money was going to those two, and 11% was going to everybody else, like AOL or Business Insider. How do you look at this landscape and what AOL's role can be? Where is everything going, in your opinion? Armstrong: I think you have got to add Amazon to that list. Shontell: A "triopoly." The digital triopoly of Google, Facebook, and Amazon — and how everyone else can survive Associated Press Armstrong: People are saying duopoly, but they are missing one of the legs of the stool. Amazon's a real competitor in the space. I'm probably a contrarian thinker on this. I like the fact that Google and Facebook are getting more successful, and getting bigger at what they're doing. Frankly for us, we have a different strategy. So the stronger they get at what they're doing, the harder it will be for them to adjust out of that big scale to some of the things that we're thinking about doing. We're a big publisher; we're one of the largest publishers on the web with our content, and we're one of the larger ad players. So it's challenging, but you have a choice. I'll give you the choice. You have a choice of being in an industry that's growing at 15, 20, 30% globally. The internet is going to double in the next five years in terms of people who are connecting to it, through mobile. Only 15% of commerce by 2020 is going to be on the internet. There's huge opportunity in front of us. You have a choice as a leader and as a company. You can go compete in linear spaces or offline spaces that are really challenged, or you can go into a space that's growing and you compete against gold-medal Olympic athletes. It's tough to say Google and Facebook aren't executing at the top of their game. Same thing with Amazon. But that sets an awesome bar for us as a company to compete at that level. And it challenges us creatively to try to get in that game. From where we sit right now, I'd choose the tailwind industry that's growing, and I would choose to have Olympic-gold-medal competitors, because it's only going to raise our game. I would choose to have Olympic-gold-medal competitors, because it's only going to raise our game. With the industry, I have a whole viewpoint on industry consolidation, but where the world's going, we're heading to a place where there's going to be giant scale we've never seen before globally. There's going to be a set of companies that have the abilities to do that. And those companies are going to really, really have the chances to build companies the size that the world hasn't seen before. Shontell: A final question: You've had to make a lot of hard decisions as a leader of many companies at this point. But you're also personable and a likable guy. How do you strike that balance between gaining respect from your employees and making the hard choices, and being liked and respected at a manager? The advice Tim gives to his children, and to anyone building a career Armstrong: There's advice I got when I was growing up — and I give it to my own kids — which is: To thine own self be true. What you see is what you get. If you interact with me, this is who I am, love me or hate me. And I think being authentic is important. The second thing is, the mentor crew I have. I have a bunch of advice I always give to younger people, but one of them is to build your personal entourage or board of directors. I have five or eight people outside the company I rely on. I have one person, David Bell, who used to be the CEO of IPG. He's in our office almost every day. I meet with him every Friday. And every Friday he starts by telling me everything I'm doing wrong. For me, it's the most helpful meeting of the week because it always resets me back to, "OK, what am I supposed to be doing as a leader? What's my job? What are those things? If you're yourself, and you're authentic, and you're honest and direct. The other thing I've learned from David and people like [former Starbucks CEO] Howard Schultz and [American Express CEO] Ken Chenault and other people like that who have mentored me over time is, just be direct with people. I did an all-company meeting with AOL and Yahoo yesterday. I got asked if there are going to be impacts from doing the deal. I said, "Yes, there are. That's what happens when two companies come together." I'm not going to beat around the bush. We're going to try to do the least amount we possibly can, but the bottom line is, that's part of what's happening with the deal and I want to be direct about it. So that directness, I think, helps a lot, and being honest with yourself. NOW WATCH: I wear these computer glasses every day even though I have perfect vision — here's why Loading video...

Alphabet Inc., parent company of Google, reports financial results, Thursday, April 27, 2017. (AP Photo/Matt Rourke) By Benjamin Raven braven@mlive.com In a new measure to track if its online advertisements are working, Google is now tracking credit card transactions -- online and offline -- the company announced earlier this week.  The measure will allow the company to see how many sales were actually generated by online ads. The Washington Post reports that while this has been described as "the holy grail" by advertising insiders, it has reopened the can of Google and how it uses people's personal information for its own gain.  "Mobile has blurred the line between the digital and physical worlds. While most purchases still happen in-store, people are increasingly turning to their smartphones to do research beforehand -- especially on Google.com and Google Maps," the company writes in its announcement. "To help consumers decide where to go, marketers are using innovations like Promoted Places and local inventory ads to showcase special offers and what's in-stock at nearby stores. Now, you can also make it easy for them to find a store from your YouTube video ads using location extensions." Google will add driving times and direction to nearby stores to YouTube ads, which is described as an effort to get people out into the real world and into real stores.  The Post reports Google declined to offer information on how the system works or what companies are analyzing purchases. A Google spokesperson told the newspaper that it will have an "undisclosed partner" handling the records, but that this partner had access to 70 percent of credit and debit card transaction in the U.S.  CNN Money reports Google made $21.4 billion of its Alphabet property's $24.8 billion in sales alone in 2016.  For those who feel uncomfortable about Google using their purchases for the betterment of online ads, log out of Google, turn off search history and location history.  "People are often searching with the intent to buy. That's why we're bringing in-market audiences to Search to help you reach users who are ready to purchase the products and services you offer," Google says in the statement. "For example, if you're a car dealership, you can increase your reach among users who have already searched for 'SUVs with best gas mileage' and 'spacious SUVs'. "In-market audiences uses the power of machine learning to better understand purchase intent. It analyzes trillions of search queries and activity across millions of websites to help figure out when people are close to buying and surface ads that will be more relevant and interesting to them."

ADVERTISE SUBSCRIBE CONTACT ABOUT LIFE Google: You can check out any time you like, but you can never leave by Gordon Hunt 1 hour ago Image: Atomazul/Shutterstock Google is building a new tool to allow users keep track of hotel reviews, perhaps in a bid to keep people from moving on to fully fledged booking sites. Tech giant Google likes to be the centre of attention. Its search engine is a perfect example of this, though there are many other tools knocking about showing the company’s thirst for users’ time. Amping it up For example, Google’s partnership with AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) is one of the more creative shifts in recent months. According to Google’s latest figures, pages read through AMP load twice as fast as before, via Google Search, with 2bn pages across 900,000 domains now read through the medium. While it’s not dragging traffic away from news sites, it does mean users are remaining housed in Google’s constructs. And it’s this AMP approach that we’re reminded of when news of Google’s hospitality plans began leaking out this month. Checking in The company is rolling out a new tool to allow users keep track of hotel reviews, following a few weeks of tests in the wild. “Google is continually improving the information shown to people to help them make decisions about where to go,” said Google. “When people are searching for a hotel to stay at, we want to ensure we make it easy for people to find useful and relevant web reviews about that place to help them make informed decisions.” Third-party reviews – those from Expedia, for example – will show in a carousel for some hotel listings. According to Search Engine Land, the review overview section has a more robust interface, showing stronger colours. “The detailed review section will show a graphical user interface based on type of travel,” according to the report. Earlier today (26 May), Google revealed another new product: Data GIF Maker. The service is aimed at journalists, bloggers and general storytellers as a way to spice up data, enhance articles and bring simple text to a better level. “Data visualisations are an essential storytelling tool in journalism, and though they are often intricate, they don’t have to be complex,” said Google. “In fact, with the growth of mobile devices as a primary method of consuming news, data visualisations can be simple images formatted for the device they appear on. “We typically use the tool to represent competing search interest, but it can show whatever you want it to – polling numbers, sales figures, movie ratings etc.” Related: Google, travel 66 DAYS 4 HOURS 26 MINUTES Get your early bird tickets now!

Resold Pixel phones originally purchased from Project Fi are having their IMEIs blacklisted Richard Gao Follow View All Posts 2017/05/25 5:30am PDTMay 25, 2017 57 Plus 1 on G+ 141 Share on Facebook 58 Share on Twitter Total Shares256 Google News Pixel Pixel XL Project Fi Back in November, when the Pixel was slowly beginning to ship to customers, there were numerous reports of people getting their Google accounts banned for purchasing Pixel and Pixel XL devices with the intent to resell them. It turns out that this issue hasn't exactly been laid to rest, as it seems that Pixel phones purchased from Project Fi for this purpose are now getting blacklisted via their IMEI numbers. As an overview, people originally bought Pixels from both the Google Store and Project Fi to sell them to a New Hampshire-based reseller. Why New Hampshire, you may ask? There's no sales tax. Both parties here were supposed to make a profit, but Google ended up banning a ton of accounts for a violation of their terms of service.. Considering how important Google is in our lives (Gmail, Google Photos, YouTube, Play Store, etc.), a lot of people were obviously not happy. In the end, Google did restore many of these accounts, but it was obviously enough for a good scare. However, it seems that Google still hasn't completely forgiven people for violating their ToS. Kyle Bennett, the editor-in-chief and founder of the HardOCP website, had his Pixel XL's IMEI blacklisted just yesterday. IMEIs are typically blacklisted by carriers when phones are lost or stolen, but that's clearly not what happened here. Calling T-Mobile didn't do anything, as their staff told him that they could not reverse the blacklisting. His communication with Swappa support was more interesting, though; here's what they told him: "Sorry to hear of the complaints. We have seen a great number of Pixel devices becoming blacklisted the past two days. We are still trying to figure out why this has happened to so many devices. We are working to find out the cause of this widespread issue. It would be best for both of you to keep on top of Google and pressing them for an explanation. In one other case, I saw this morning Google agreed to send the buyer a replacement device so that might be an option to look into. Seller please work with the buyer and Google to see if they can get to the bottom of it." Kyle then contacted Google support, with the first representative claiming that he had simply received a spam message. When he showed a second rep how his IMEI had indeed been blacklisted via Swappa's ESN/IMEI checker (useful tool if you're buying a phone, by the way), he was told that his Pixel XL hadn't been reported as stolen, but that it had been originally purchased through Project Fi. Kyle was also once again told that his phone hadn't really been blacklisted, but a quick rescan of his IMEI in Swappa proved otherwise. His case was escalated to Project Fi's support team, but the customer service rep refused to give him a reference number and told him that he'd receive it via email. After contacting a third representative, Kyle was informed that his phone had indeed been blacklisted, but that Google wasn't responsible for doing so. This lends further credence to the Project Fi explanation, as it's the carrier and not the manufacturer that has the ability to blacklist devices. The situation is still ongoing, but that's all we know for now; we'll update with more information as we get it.

Okay. NeverrKnowsBest You can sell a Project Fi phone. You just buy them in bulk and try to make a profit off Project Fi. Stupid that the customer is being punished for this, though. Green Dog Is it clear that this is one of the phones that was bought in bulk from that retailer? From my reading, it was just a resold phone. I mean obviously, it's not happening to all phones, but the fact that it's still happening is a concern. NeverrKnowsBest The IMEIs are being linked to one particular reseller in New Hampshire. celestre Do you have more information than is present in the article on this? NeverrKnowsBest I'm just going off what the article said. I would love to read more, but I highly doubt they are just flipping the switch on every resold Project Fi phone. That just isn't very plausible, at least to my knowledge. datkidpatrick you misunderstood the article... they referenced a time where a bulk reseller's phones were black listed... but now it is happening to a bunch of random sellers that decided to sell the phone... Richard Gao The bulk reseller's phones weren't blacklisted at that time. It is entirely possible that these are the same phones. datkidpatrick i purchased mine straight from project fi... sold it 3 months ago and the seller told me the other day it was blacklisted... and yes my mistake.. the bulk resellers email's were blocked or something like that... Cael Did you pay off the phone before you sold it? datkidpatrick yes i did... Corey Kinard So they're punishing someone that fully paid for a device from you, who fully owned the device? They're legally allowed to just fully break something they've already sold and have no right to? This is worse than when carriers wouldn't unlock phones... datkidpatrick im still giving google the benefit of doubt that it was a mistake... they just need to fix it PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ You'll easily win in small claims court if you have to refund and take the phone back. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ What kind of financing plan did you have? They were first sold in Oct. 22 2016 and this is only May 2017. I seem to remember 24 month financing or 12 month financing. You paid your phone off three months ago and already had sold it on Swappa for some time? datkidpatrick ya youre allowed to pay it off early... PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ Maybe that's what caused the error at Fi in blacklisting by accident. datkidpatrick ya that doesn't make any sense... but it got fixed this morning by google... NeverrKnowsBest I see that now. Thanks for the clarification. In any case, there has to be something in common with these blacklisted phones, I don't think Google/Project Fi would blacklist all second hand phones, I don't think that's very plausible. Corey Kinard Do you really need to think straight when you are in competition for largest company in the world? They probably got algorithms looking for shit and those algorithms mess up. 4Ui812 That's pretty shitty Google. David Bowline Is it really? What's shitty is the people buying in bulk just to make an easy buck and therefore screwing people over. Swappa needs to go after these people. jonzey231 Yeah but if I bought a Pixel LAST YEAR and wanted to sell it no in preparation for the next Pixel or the OP5, for example, my customer may get screwed even though it was just an innocent buy and resell. Max Uh? That's not what happened here... so far this situation seems to be the result of a reseller elaborate plan to evade tax and sell the scarce phone for a bigger profit. This wasn't an individual reselling his/her own phone. jonzey231 Uh? I know that it was originally caused by the douche bags in NJ, but now it's affecting regular people. 4Ui812 That's called capitalism. No one is forcing you to buy it. What Google needs to do is fix all the reported issues with that shitty phone. As for the limited supply of said phone , again that's Google's fault (hell , I wouldn't be surprised if Google intentionally limted the supply ... That's a play out of nintys handbook) Duder12 I have a pixel. There is nothing wrong with my phone. I love it. SirCanealot But I have a Pixel and it is broken. Surely this is not possible to exist in reality? :O :O :O A Person It may suck, but who is to decide how my money is spent? kbbl Caveat emptor. SeanPR11 Or.... don't buy your phone from a New Jersey Douchebag. If people don't buy from them, they will stop doing this bullshit. It sucks that regular people are caught in the middle (which happens all too often). It seems Swappa should have known these phones were out there (given the business they are in) and flagged them with the IMEI checker. Alex Excuse them for doing whatever they like with a product they purchased. Pfff SeanPR11 Amen. Ryan from GroupTweet Yes, its shitty. If anything Google should go after the reseller, not the innocent legitimate customers that bought the devices and who are now punished because their phones are blacklisted. Alexander Z Great Swappa can't GO after anyone. Maybe suspend/revoke their account but that's it. My trusted seller hasn't been any help at all with the blacklisted pixel I bought. It's so messed up!! T4rd Saw the site/forum owner of a site I frequent get hit with this on his Pixel this week too. Crazy how the Pixel is being plagued with all sorts of extraneous issues. They can't stay in stock, forcing people to buy second hand, then they get black listed because of some weird policy Google has with Project Fi phones. Max Well being out of stock has nothing strange coming from a Google phone, that's been their main issue for a few years now (Nexus), and it happens even to Apple on launch but the difference is that they're a lot better ramping up production afterwards. This blacklisting is really weird, but so far it seems to be potentially related to a shady reseller so we'll have to wait and see if we get more clarification soon. Geoff Johnson As someone from New Hampshire, it's weird to see my state in an AP article, since nothing interesting ever happens here lol. This sucks though because buyers who bought their Pixel 2nd hand months ago now suddenly might get it blacklisted? J.J. Holy f. That is terrible. So random guy buys a second hand pixel (because Google was out of stock) later gets blacklisted by Google/fi. Gets no help from Google. Never buys a Google phone again. Real smart. Green Dog This on top of the seeming shaky quality of the phones may force me to an iPhone. J.J. I feel ya there but, i just can't do the iPhone thing. Loving this s8+ right now. Duder12 When consumers say this its just sad. Why when you have a difficult time with one android manufacturer immediately think its all Androids and switch to the iPhone? This is how Apple gets tons of customers. Everyone that had a bad time with Samsung just assumed their only other option was iPhone bc MARKETING. Green Dog Because I don't want to have to deal with OS updates through the carrier or a limited phone in terms of LTE bands, as is common for Android phones? People like other phones and I've played with some of them, but I like the Pixel/Nexus lines. But this does give me pause. blenderboy Well, the only offering that competes with iPhone in the world of android is the pixel phone. Samsung displays(hardware in general) are great but software experience can't be compared with iPhone or pixel. It is just sad that they can't keep up with Apple or Google. Google is trying really hard to reach there. I am still using Android because of the platforms openness. Duder12 Fair enough but you know what I mean. You are an exception but A LOT of consumers act this way. Honestly I bought my Pixel through the Google Store last fall and its been solid. I love it. Google needs to sort out the second hand market but these are growing pains. Hardware is still new to them bc the nexus line had help from the OEMs. Now they dont. marcusmarcus2 His comment does not address all Androids. He is only speaking of this one phone. It could be he was between using phones by Google and iPhones and he choose to go with Google's phone. Now with this situation, he decided to go to his second choice. I'm not defending switching to an iPhone over another manufacturer, just pointing out his statement you criticized did not say what you thought it was saying and you were the one to actually apply his statement to all Androids. Just playing the devil's advocate here Alex Because when you pay 7-8-900€ (the price of an iPhone) on an Android phone you expect it to be flawless. And that's normal! However, in real life, regardless if you pay 300 or 800€, Android remains Android, with its notoriously inconsistent battery life, inexplicable wakelocks, unfixed bugs (don't get me stored on the "low priority" bugs with thousands of stars), 2 year updates, etc, etc. tekfr33kn That seems a little dramatic considering that iPhones are far from flawless. You also pay that amount for your average laptop and they aren't flawless. It seems you, or someone else, is holding Android phones to an unrealistic standard. Alex Please don't compare a laptop with an Android phone. It makes absolutely no sense. Isn't it rather that manufacturers (Google being the first of them) increase the prices each year to hallucinating levels with little to no innovation or improvement in user experience. Take the S8 line. Beautiful phones, remarkable design, but a fraction of the cost you pay goes to that crap Bixby that nobody wants tekfr33kn I'll agree with you that Google is artificially raising the price far beyond what it should be but that's basic capitalism and market forces. If the market doesn't want those kinds of prices or can't support it, it won't sell. The issue is that people are actually willing to pay that. iPhones are the primary example. There's about $400 - $500 worth of stuff put in a phone that goes for $800 - $1000 and they still sell like hotcakes. I also agree with you about the S8's and Bixby but again, the market says that the S8 is a hot seller and so Samsung isn't about to change that trend. That kind of makes your argument moot. As for comparing a smartphone to a laptop - if you can't see the comparisons, it's either willful ignorance or you just don't know a thing about electronic devices (specifically smartphones or laptops). In either case, I can't help you with that. The fact is that they share more in common that differences. It's one of the many reasons that development strategies (hardware and software) often translate quite well between them. xyz Uhm, because the phone in question is the overpriced Google phone that is intended to compete with the iPhone and which Google fanboys insist is the greatest Android phone of all time. psychic99 It costs about the same to make a Pixel XL as it does an iphone 7, so why would you expect Google to make less margin than Apple? I will say their ecosystem and support SUCKs compared to Apple, so yeah it should be hundred less because the lifecycle experience of a Pixel will be much worse than Apple and the fact that they artificially end support after 2 years is atrocious. I have 4+ year old Nexus that operate just fine on custom ROMs. And BTW I don't think it is worth it either and happily keep my Nexus 6p for less than 50% the cost. I can't rationalize the price they are asking. Google's support is not consistent. Either they will go over the top to help, or tell you go away you are screwed, There is nothing in the middle, and until you engage them you have no idea if you are going to get help or the hand. Yet another reason they should be hundreds less. Merrill Sampson Just FYI, Google announced at IO a few days ago that they're extending the support cycle on the Pixel from 2 year to 5. marcusmarcus2 Do you have a source for that? https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/4457705?hl=en#nexus_devices Android Version updates: October 2018 Security updates: October 2019 Duder12 Dont forget that apple blocked iPhones that had their fingerprint sensor replaced. Also, dont forget Apple is trying to get a bill banned that will allow consumers to have 3rd parties fix phones. PS: My Pixel is fucking awesome. NexusKoolaid "Dont forget that apple blocked iPhones that had their fingerprint sensor replaced." And this in and of itself was a good thing. With the sensor and the CPU being paired, the sudden appearance of a new sensor having a new signature was deemed to be a security breach. I'm not standing up for Apple here, just calling a spade a spade. And I don't know what information Apple could have shared with 3rd party repair houses (if they were inclined to play nice with them) without compromising security. "PS: My Pixel is fucking awesome." I wish I had one. But they were so hard to get hold of for so long that at this point I'll hang on to my 6P until the Pixel2 is out. psychic99 On Android if you reinstall the O/S or make major modifications they simply invalidate the fingerprint then you have to enter the password manually as a failback. Then you can enrol your fingerprint again. In fact every few days you have to manually enter your pin on N to get into the phone. Sounds like a reasonable method, rather than locking the phone forever. Apple went one step farther. You should go watch youtube... Apple is on a mission to make 3rd party repair a thing of the past. They even specifically make it hard to repair. They want control of the supply chain and dispose of equipment as fast as possible. NexusKoolaid On your first point, there is little control over hardware used to support the platform, so core design decisions are prone to fall back to a software solution. Apple on the other hand has tight control of their hardware and have the option for hardware based solutions, whatever the motivation might be, such as better security or to maintain control of their platform (probably a mix on the two). On your second point, I've read the headlines and seen videos on Youtube (like Louis Rossman). Yeah - their crusade against 3rd party repair sickens me to no small degree. Not just because it would prevent me from seeking out more economical and timely repair of my phone (if I had an iPhone), but because this type of precedent could trickle down to other things I might want to tinker with. Jay Hate to say it but that is the risk people run when you don't buy your devices brand new. J.J. True. But they exasperate said risk artificially for the perceived end goal.... More Profit. The truth is they are doing the exact opposite. This news definitely makes me pause on buying a pixel at all. The Second hand market is real and if i have a bad experience do to Google on a second hand device i will probably not buy new from them when i have the funds. james fuston If you (or the person who sells you a phone) violates the terms of service, you're gonna have a bad time regardless of manufacturer. blenderboy Real question to ask, did Apple ever had similar issue with many devices? hunter2 Probably not since Apple realizes that the perceived strong resale value is a determining factor for many people. Even people who may have never sold a product second hand gain some comfort from the knowledge that they could potentially recoup a lot of their costs if they ever needed to sell. ericshmerick Do the TOS say you can never ever resell the device? Serious question. ekana_stone No the TOS is that you resell as soon as you bought it, so like if you bought from fi cuz it's cheaper and the resold it a little under asking. It's only those phones that were black listed ericshmerick What defines "as soon as?" 5 minutes after purchase? 1 week? 2.8 months? 3 years? marcusmarcus2 Do we have confirmation that it is only those phones that were black listed? Could they have inadvertently black listed other phones from fi? EarlyMon The TOS say that commercial resale is not allowed and lots of them were resold by a private company in a scheme that tried to avoid sales tax. Santos Chavez It actually does say that isn't allowed, hence why they initially banned several accounts the first time. It was a breach of their TOS, and it still is. It's likely Project Fi saw these phones as stolen and blacklisted them. james fuston "You may only purchase Devices for your personal use. You may not commercially resell any Device, but you may give the Device as a gift." So if you purchase the device and resell it in New (unopened) condition, yeah. Fi could also pretty easily make the case that if you purchased the phone and turned around to sell it before the expiry of the original installment plan that you had purchased it with the intention of reselling. MisterAlex That's still not a commercial sale. If I go to the store, buy a Nintendo Switch, and immediately list it as a brand new Switch on Craigslist, I'm not a commercial seller. I'm still an individual selling something that's fully within my "first sale" rights to sell. james fuston Yeah, that's true if you're reading the second, and only the second, sentence there. The first one pretty clearly states "You may only purchase Devices for your personal use" MisterAlex If you think that reselling a personally owned item goes beyond the bounds of personal use, you're kidding yourself (and so is anyone who thinks that line of thinking would hold water, legally speaking). First Sale is a very broad consumer protection, my friend. Once you buy something of your own, you can do whatever you want with it, including sell it. (Edit: in the States, anyway.) james fuston Yep! Totally fine for you to sell it. Also totally fine for Google to deactivate your phone when you've done something you agreed not to do at the time of purchase. It's then legally on you to prove that they overstepped. MisterAlex You're clearly not parsing what I'm posting. Selling privately owned property is within the bounds of "personal use." james fuston Seeing as Google specifically included a clause about gifting, I'd venture to say they disagree with you. MisterAlex That's fine. Sony also disagreed that it had done anything wrong by removing Other OS. james fuston Cool! So we agree that whether or not you believe Google's terms of service to be legal, it's entirely on the customer to take action after being penalized for a violation of said terms of service. MisterAlex It's always up to the wronged party to seek litigation against a wrongdoer. james fuston In that case, I have no idea why you started commenting on legality when I was discussing terms of service violations. Rather, I would have no idea why if this weren't the comment section. MisterAlex A TOS is not a legally binding agreement. You defended enforcement of a TOS when that enforcement went contrary to law. That's why I brought up the comparison to Sony's PS3 lawsuit (which it lost). james fuston I'm not discussing whether terms of service are legally binding. I'm discussing whether or not the action being described (selling the phone) violates the ToS. It does. MisterAlex And my counter was to point out that putting something in a TOS doesn't make it hunky-dory. In fact, it's quite possible for a TOS to violate law. As I've illustrated. bekifft This is where America is so great. Even if the TOS is unenforceable by law, it is technologically enforceable, obviously. So they do it anyway, and now the onus is on you the little guy to get the multinational corporation to knock it off. Vape John most likely carrier issues the blacklisting... so project fi is the culprit psychic99 More profit? The sell them $150 below market rates. That is not free. I don't know what is actually going on but I would suspect that the original owner did something wrong or unethical. To be honest Google's systems are weird. I ported out my nexus5x and it took them almost 3 months to Bill me for the remainder. So maybe the original person cancelled their card, played games with DPP, activated it for one day and did it again. And again. xyz Fortunately, you can just buy an iPhone and get top notch support. hunter2 So the answer is to buy everything new and toss the old device in the landfill? Kind of sad to see how people just roll over and let over-reaching companies basically decimate the second hand market so they can increase their profits. Jay Never said that and you know it. I said this is the risk you take.. It's as simple as that. trixnkix637 That's the risk you take for not buying from reputable sources. Buying used has risks. Sucks he found out the hard way. jb0nez But the article says it's not Google, it's the carrier who blacklisted. Whatever that means... hunter2 That makes no sense. The carrier technically blocks that IMEI on their network, but only after another carrier submits it to the blacklist. It would be like if you SWATTED somebody and then said "it was the police who came to your house with guns not me". pfmiller On top of that this seems like an abuse of the blacklisting system. The system is intended to discourage theft, not as a means for companies to get revenge on their customers. psychic99 That's not true. Companies have been blacklisting devices for years if tos wasn't met. I have bought 3 phones through fi and they are heavily discounted. Google doesn't do that for free they expect you to activate them on fi for more than one day. Also if you are buying a phone from an individual and not a dealer you are taking a risk straight up. I have had friend have their phones blacklisted when they have bought phones from people and then they turned around and reported them as stolen. Swappa is a marketplace not a arbitrator. They are facilitating a sale. You guys need to know the difference. PayPal is your friend. hunter2 That's dumb. The whole point of cancellation fees is to re-coup the cost of subsidies if you break the contract. By going a different route, the only people who are getting punished are the people buying these phones. psychic99 Lots of people don't pay them and I have seen numerous accounts where friends have bought phones and have told me they got a "deal of a lifetime" to find their devices blacklisted and guess what they were people who never paid off their termination fees or have sold them then reported them stolen. And as an individual you need to take responsibility, if you purchase anything through a private transaction you should ask for poof of sale, do they own it, have it put in writing, etc. That way if the seller does something illegal then you have a remedy. This doesn't derisk anything tho. This is good education for people, to know where responsibility lies and the risks of buying from an individual versus an established dealer. In the case of Swappa, you should buy via Paypal, so there is a remedy. You can chargeback your loss if this happens within 6 months (I have done this will unethical sellers), so they are not being punished they are being inconvenienced. But that is the RISK you take buying from an individual. hunter2 I know you want to see Google as the good guy here, but within these comments there are accounts from people who bought outright, and months later sold their Pixel's and now months after that sale are being contacted by the seller about the device being blacklisted. bekifft I think you're missing his point. It's not about Google being the good or bad guy, it's that buying something third party is inherently risky and he's right, you should ask for a chain of evidence that proves the device is legit. Maybe I'm also just tired of people claiming they can find things so cheap online, when most of it is scams like this, and just devalues the whole market. hunter2 You need to look through these comments. There are people here who bought their phones directly from Fi and after switching carriers their fully paid off phones have been blacklisted. They were the original owners and these phones were never sold. There are also people here who bought phones, used them for months, and sold them after they were fully paid off. These people are saying that the proper they sold the phones to are now coming back and telling them they're blacklisted. bekifft In that case that is indeed disturbing. I am a Fi subscriber though I bought my phone direct from the Google store. Sounds like someone made a big mistake on the back end. Lance Biddle I bought my phone from Project Fi, and it has become blacklisted after changing to another carrier. Google is definitely the bad guy right now IMO pfmiller Just because other companies have been doing it, doesn't mean that it's not an abuse of the system. It's clearly not what the blacklisting system was intended for. Lance Biddle How about when you buy the phone from Project Fi, decide to switch carriers and the phone you outright own becomes black listed. I cannot connect to the Verizon service I'm paying for. And Verizon cannot do anything about. And Google/Project Fi isn't. I've wasted way too much time on the phone trying to get this resolved. They have told me it could be 2-5+ days to get it fixed. WTF!! Never Google again. Never. J.J. I'm sorry. That sucks hard. ProductFRED Considering the original seller probably isn't going to pay people back, all Google did was fuck over a bunch of legitimate customers. iPhone reselling is also a big issue, especially on new releases, but you don't see Apple doing this. J.J. Agree 💯. Most of these customers involved (who probably have had hardware and software issues already on top​ of this) will never buy a pixel again! Cassidy James Blaede Just for the record, the majority of Pixel users likely never have hardware or software issues. I, my mom, and a couple of my friends have Pixels and haven't had any issues. You probably hear about issues on Reddit a lot because the only reason to visit the Pixel subreddit is to complain. 🙃 Jordan L no issues here too. J.J. Not a redditer lol, but many other sites show the issues(as low as they may be) and if you were on the fence about spending that kind of money, these stories alone may sway many Duder12 Yep. Just like iphone touch disease and early shutdowns. Tr3ple Never had those issues. xyz That's true. I personally don't know anyone who has been murdered. Therefore, no one gets murdered. Cassidy James Blaede I'd wager that the majority of people don't get murdered. 😉 Written Description My Pixel XL has performed flawlessly since its purchase and it's my first Android phone after using every iPhone from the first generation on. Google's AI is better, its cloud storage is infinitely better, and I don't see going back to Apple anytime soon. J.J. I'm glad you have not had issues.... Others however have Duder12 Not me. Corey Kinard 3rd Np. Duder12 Mines been great... atl3630 great here too. Cael Apple is not a "carrier". ProductFRED Neither is Google. They just use other carriers' networks. Either way, that isn't justification for what they're doing. Unless they plan on replacing everyone's Pixel (which looks like a hard no), they fucked over a lot of legitimate customers. I buy my devices off of swappa most of the time. Tell me how I would get this fixed if neither the seller nor Google want to take responsibility. marcusmarcus2 Google is an MVNO. Per https://www.lifewire.com/what-is-an-mvno-cell-phone-carrier-578673 "An MVNO is a cell phone carrier (such as a prepaid wireless carrier) that typically does not have its own network infrastructure and licensed radio spectrum" Apple is not even an MVNO carrier. drksilenc fi is a carrier... JD With Fi Google is a Carrier. Mitch Gray This just happened to my fiance's phone. I bought it on swappa for her birthday months ago because Google store didn't have any in stock and this morning it is blacklisted. I'm so furious. I have had every Google phone since the Galaxy Nexus and because of this policy I will never buy another phone of theirs. She is now stranded without a phone and has no way of using it for work at the busiest time of the year for her (she is a teacher and it's graduation week). Who do I contact about this? We shouldn't be punished because someone gamed the system. J.J. I feel so bad for you. I hope you get it resolved. This is an atrocity! J.J. Should definitely hassle fi/Google and let them know if they don't resolve you will never buy and tell everyone you know not to buy and so on jibust No, stop don't tell them that, they might not withstand the shock of loosing them. /S T4rd I would contact the seller of the phone and/or Swappa if they're the service you went through. If they're no help somehow, then contact Paypal if that's how you paid for it. Google isn't going to unblacklist the phone regardless of what you say to them. It's virtually impossible for a phone to be unblacklisted once it has happened, so you're going to have to just get a refund and buy another phone. A Person Good luck with that. I am hesitant to ever buy again from Swappa.. and I used to love, love, love them. I purchased a device that was blatantly not as described. I then contacted Swappa and they instructed me that it is now between me and the seller. So I contacted the seller via the sale page and was basically told: "ummmm, nah". datkidpatrick at that point you could have went thru paypal and filed a claim... T4rd That's why you buy from reputable sellers. The few minor issues I've had on there were resolved quickly. atl3630 yes, same here. To date I've never had a swappa problem that didn't get resolved and the people have been very helpful. Don't blame swappa for shitty sellers. Buy from reputable sellers (like me). yankeesusa Swappa only helps communicating. To resolve any issues you must file a PayPal claim. datkidpatrick contact the seller and see if they can contact project fi/google... King_Android Ijs, BBB is an extremely powerful tool in order to get your voice heard from Corporate asap...... Stephen Hicks If the phone is under warranty still, file an RMA claim and state the bluetooth isn't working correctly on the device and that you've already tried factory resetting the phone as well as reconnected all the bluetooth devices with no improvement. Might work? njn There is no warranty for second hand phones. JRock I purchased a bootlooping 6P off eBay for cheap, erasing/flashing firmware had same result, RMA'd to Huawei and they promptly sent me a brand new one. Mark Depending on the credit card you used to buy the phone, you might have an extended warranty that might cover this. atl3630 You can get your money back. Contact the seller through swappa and tell them the issue. They will likely tell you it's been to long, I don't care, etc. If so, then file a PayPal claim. You have six months PayPal protection. Document that the phone no longer works and send it back to the seller with tracking. Then PayPal will refund you money, no matter what the seller says. M3D1T8R But doing this will just end up screwing over the seller. PayPal will simply take the money from their account and refund it to the buyer. So that's not fair to the seller either. PayPal's "seller protection" is a fraud. And their customer service is a total joke. They should be boycotted. atl3630 How does that screw over the seller? The seller screwed himself when he sold the phone. His beef is with ProjectFi, not the buyer. Frankly the buyer shouldn't have to deal with this crap since buyers have no way to determine the history of a phone. The seller sold a phone that stopped working. That's on them. M3D1T8R Because, obviously, the seller doesn't necessarily know the history and every previous owner of every phone. What if it's a phone someone bought previously used. They used it for a while just fine, and resold it. Then this IMEI block thing happened. atl3630 Yeah, that would suck. But still, it's not the buyer's fault. If something happens and somebody gets cheated out of $500+ then you better bet people are going to exercise whatever option they can to recover their money. PayPal protection would do that for them in the first 6 months. ericshmerick So anyone who sells a phone is on the hook for its functionality until the end of time? GTFO of here with that. It's ridiculous and you know it. atl3630 Six months, moron. PayPal protection is 6 months. Like it or not, facts. Stop being a little bitch. Roh_Mish What if the seller had bought directly from google. AP mentioned about the trains but there doesn't appear to to be a link between this and that fraud. Also there are many cases where buyer on PayPal will request a reverse and never return the product, screwing over the seller. And PayPal won't do anything about this. vn33 That really sucks .. .especially to someone near and dear to you. I would be beyond furious! Hope everything works out!! Duder12 Swappa will cover you here. You are fine. Get the ball rolling. Anwar Imraan Lucas To me it seems that the original buyer had reported his credit card lost or stolen and is disputing charges on his card which in terms maybe blacklisting those devices as stolen.. blindexecutioner You do Google the service of endless beta testing their software on a way overpriced phone and they blacklist you. Nice. Lawrence Good, that is what you get for buying the Bezel XL ericshmerick OH YOUUUU!!1 theadamsegal Yet another reason I will not buy a Google device again. Tiberian For the record: Kyle Bennett is the owner and founder of HardOCP, not just a simple writer for the site. ;) Richard Gao Did not know that. Thanks! datkidpatrick this happened by to me as well... i sold my pixel 3 months ago and the buyer just informed me it was blacklisted... i had no clue project fi was doing this and legit thought the buyer was trying to scam me... i contacted project fi support and was advised it was escalated to be removed from the blacklist... i paid off the phone before i sold it... this is definitely a mistake by google/project fi... they should be correcting this soon... Jordan L Can a carrier just randomly blacklist IMEIs?! I guess so. I was reading this thread thinking 'well, people probably just bought a stolen Pixel unknowingly' but your case proves this wrong. Navneet Suresh Shitty move Google ! :/ Jay If this happened to me, I'd just return the phone to the seller, get refunded, and make them have to deal with this. Swappa made a huge fucking deal about refunding buyers after the Note7 debacle and it should be the same thing here. freshprince_87 I hope that Kyle guy reads your comment. This may help him Jay Honestly, Swappa needs to be pushing this harder. I sold my Note7 last year and despite the fact that the buyer could have gone and gotten the refund from T-Mobile themselves, they chose to take Swappa up on their suggestion of getting the refund from me. (Add to this that Swappa said if I didn't agree to the refund, they'd "suggest" the buyer take the issue up with PayPal as the device was not sold as advertised. Seriously..) datkidpatrick it isn't the sellers fault... and its something that can be fixed... Jay I fail to see how this isn't the seller's fault for trying to game the system and make a profit. This sure as hell isn't Google's fault.. so who do you want to blame then? The unsuspecting buyers? datkidpatrick it is googles fault... the point they referred to in november is completely separate from the issue happening now... the issue happening now is many pixel phones that were sold and originated from fi is getting blacklisted... i sold my pixel after paying it of legit and it just got blacklisted... now please tell me how i tried to game the system... Jay For all I know, you could be one of those shady scalpers too who tried to make a profit by gaming the system. The burden of fixing this issue should still lie on the sellers. If someone wants their money back, they have every right to make you do the legwork of figuring out how you'll make your money back. datkidpatrick I contacted project fi for the buyer and it is escalated... again the point is it wasn't my fault... marcusmarcus2 If you are just trying to sell 1 phone that you got and paid for without trying to "game the system" it is not your fault, but it is your responsibility as the seller to try and resolve the issue, which it sounds like you are doing. Who's fault is it? Hard to tell until Google releases a comment about why this is happening. Did they block these by mistake? Then it is Googles fault. Are they doing it to block the bulk buyers that were "gaming the system" and just went over board and blocked some extra phones that were not part of those that gamed the system? Then it would be the fault of Google and those that gamed the system that caused Google to make the choice. hunter2 I wouldn't say it's his responsibility. He's selling a device. If the maker of that device decides to flip a kill switch in 18 months and disable every device out there then why blame him. Google is flipping a kill switch an all kinds of devices (just below there is a comment from a guy who bought and paid for his phone, then later switched carriers and had his originally bought phone killed). Trying to blame middle men here is crazy. marcusmarcus2 I'm not blaming the seller. Please re-read. I said the fault is with Google if they are the ones that decided to black list them. It is the sellers responsibility to try figure out why a device they sold is blacklisted. If they did nothing wrong, then they should be able to get it unblacklisted by working with Google. From the looks of some of the comments on here, it looks like the buyer would not be able to get the device of the black list but the seller should be able to. Again, I'm not blaming the middle man. There is a difference between fault and responsibility. Fault sounds like it is fully on Google. Responsibility goes across everyone though with some having more responsibility. Buyer has some responsibility to report the issue to the seller instead of just reporting it to paypal. Seller has more responsibility than the seller because they would be the one who would be able to work with Google/fi to get it off the black list. Google/fi would have even more responsibility to explain why devices are being blacklisted and getting devices off the black list if they should not be on there. Max As a somewhat frequent seller/buyer on Swappa and Ebay I can say that this is definitely the sellers responsibility to fix the problem or promptly accept a return for a refund otherwise this isn't so different from a bait and switch situation. datkidpatrick how is it a bait and switch if i paid off a phone legit and decided to sell it after... 3 months later it gets blacklisted... this is a mistake by google and its their responsibility to fix... Max If you paid off the phone legit and didn't do anything shady then it wouldn't have been blacklisted and if it was you, as the original buyer, are the one with more authority to contact Google, not the second hand buyer, therefore it's your responsibility to fix it. The buyer with a blacklisted phone has zero reasons to believe that you were truthful in your description even if you were. datkidpatrick well i did contact project fi for the buyer and it is escalated... Max Then you're doing the right thing (taking responsibility) and hopefully this gets resolved quickly by Fi! Although I don't know if they can just un-blacklist a phone? Hopefully they can. ericshmerick If I buy a product from a retail store and 92 days later it has an issue, guess what they will tell me when I show up barking for a refund? Yeah, pound sand kid. That's what they will say. So why do Swappa sellers suddenly have the responsibility to refund forever ala Costco? I get people are pissy at the situation, but the seller isn't responsible for Google's shadyness here. Max We're not talking about "an issue" here because that's what warranties are for, we're talking about a phone reported as lost/stolen after being sold this could potentially mean a fraudster that didn't fully pay the phone or a thief that sold a stolen phone, I doubt any serious retailer would do that... By the way that's what buyer protections are for, Paypal has six months of protection and credit card providers can be very flexible if you explain your case well and you're in the right. If a retailer pull something like this they would never win a chargeback. Max We're not talking about "an issue" here because that's what warranties are for, we're talking about a phone reported as lost/stolen after being sold this could potentially mean a fraudster that didn't fully pay the phone or a thief that sold a stolen phone, I doubt any serious retailer would do that... By the way that's what buyer protections are for, Paypal has six months of protection and credit card providers can be very flexible if you explain your case well and you're in the right. If a retailer pull something like this they would never win a charge back and the manufacturer and distributor would never be involved in the original transaction or charge back, it would be up to the retailer to go after the manufacturer or distributor. ericshmerick But nothing shady or illegal is going on here. If I and the original buyer and I use it on project fi for two months, then decide to sell it. How does that suddenly implicate me as being some sort of shady criminal? I would simply be selling a legally purchased piece of hardware that was paid in full. Max Can you please elaborate how the buyer knows that you sold "a legally purchased piece of hardware that was paid in full" if he has a blacklisted phone reported as lost/stolen in the hands? Good luck convincing the buyer, Paypal and a Bank that you're in the right in such a situation... Luxferro If they sold you shady (stolen or not legal) products you'd be dealing with them. tnt These are not devices being bought from an official retailer. There's no need to question the history of a device bought from Costco. Swappa (and Ebay and Craigslist for that matter) are not the same type of market. It's the seller's responsibility to know the history (as much as possible anyway) of the devices they're selling. freshprince_87 I guess it's safer to buy a Verizon Google Pixel instead if you intend on reselling it later. So the future buyer isn't screwed by Google. That is such a ridiculous policy drksilenc have to have a line with verizon to do that though. Wendell Brown Apparently not, this dude says his WERE Verizon phones that were locked.... https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/6d2yse/2_of_my_3_google_pixel_phones_blacklisted_on_the/ Me Google is just shooting themselves in the foot at this point with the Pixel Yan Qin I just sold my Pixel XL and switch to Galaxy S8, I do think I was out of my mind that I actually bought Pixel at full price. Jordan L anyone resell a project fi phone NOT through Swappa and have it blacklisted? maybe ProjectFi blacklisted only Swappa phones(still a strange move if it was on purpose) Jagermeister 2 of my 3 Pixel phones showed up blacklisted 2 days ago. I made a reddit post yesterday of my issue. I though it was part of an insurance fraud scam. https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/6d2yse/2_of_my_3_google_pixel_phones_blacklisted_on_the/ I had originally though our phones were from Verizon not Google Fi. We were happy Pixel customers that are now considering purchasing different phones because Google can report as stolen whenever they feel a Google Fi device was not transferred to a new owner per their TOS. How can any user purchasing a pre-owned or "new" Google Pixel be sure that it isn't a Google Fi device and won't be blacklisted in the future? Max Johnson Note to self, don't buy second hand Google devices. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Note to everyone: Don't buy first hand Google devices. Max Why? Mine works perfectly fine and so far it's the best phone I've ever owned. Dana Yeah, it's fine as long as you don't get it from Project Fi because you can't sell it if you want to upgrade to a new device. Max LOL, what? I simply bought it directly from store.google.com, no issues here and I can provide proof. This is something related to phones sold through Fi. hunter2 Congrats, scroll up one comment and you'll find a guy who's phone is blacklisted despite him being the original owner and being fully paid off. To answer your question of "Why", it's because not everyone is as comfortable gambling with their money as you are. Max 1) It was blacklisted by the carrier, not the manufacturer. 2) It was blacklisted after it was resold, sucks but as far as we know it doesn't affect the original seller, there's a difference there. 3) We don't know yet why this really happened. 4) Even with all of the above, I don't see how it fits in a "Don't buy first hand Google devices." statement. Maybe if you tell me "Don't deal with Project Fi service" I could somewhat agree. hunter2 http://disq.us/p/1iz7ts3 Sorry, should have permalinked the comment since the order is moving per votes. That guy was the original owner and claims to have been paid off. Moved to Verizon at some point and had the device he originally bough directly from Google blacklisted. Max Well that negates my point 2 and sucks even more. But still the blame here points 100% to Project Fi and not the phone itself nor Google as the manufacturer of the phone. Something really strange is happening with Project Fi devices and hopefully they will find out soon if it's an error, incompetence, sabotage or maybe even hacking. hunter2 I guess it depends on how willing you are to absolve the parent company of things a specific branch is doing. It would be like saying "don't blame MS, it's the IE team who makes the browser" during the IE6 days. Max Legally is evident that the responsibility is on Google but if you think that the group in charge of designing and manufacturing the Pixel has any minimal clue about what happens inside the group of the MVNO Project Fi then you're frankly clueless about how such a huge company works. By the way IE and Edge sucks but Visual Studio rocks and I'm liking more Windows 10 recently but I guess I should avoid using everything Microsoft because IE really sucks, right? hunter2 If a decisions like these can be made without going far enough up the chain of command that you're dealing with some higher ups, then I don't really want to know how this company runs. It's enough to tell me that I can't really trust them because you can't really depend on a company keeping in line with their corporate ideals when individual units can work with this much impunity. Avoiding/disliking MS was never about IE sucking. It was about IE being openly hostile and damaging to the web. This complaint was obviously projected at Microsoft themselves since no one believed that the IE team was working in a bubble. I don't know how old you are so maybe you weren't around when all this was going on. It's not about disliking a company because one or some of their many products are inferior. It's about disliking them because they employ user hostile tactics and you don't feel like you can support that (or at the very least want to punish them in the tiny way you can by voting with your wallet). Max So you already got an official response from Google about this? Can you share it? Because so far I have only read guesses about what is happening and nothing official yet. I'm old enough to have used MS-DOS 5 & 6 as well as Windows 3.1. That doesn't change the fact that saying "don't buy anything from a company" based on one division issues is just silly. If Google officially says that all of this was planned then maybe you could have a point, until then you're just stretching facts to prove a weak point. hunter2 I don't need to fill in the facts. I'm saying either way it's bad. The facts are that this happened. Additional facts about why it happened are irrelevant Max Well, if you're happy thinking like that be my guest, I guess some people is unable to see the colors and think the world is black and white. hunter2 For people whom this isn't a mundane thought experiment but are actually in a position where they need to buy a new device (not everyone is able to be without their phone until Google ultimately resolves this); the shades of gray in this scenario don't change their circumstances. The facts are that they have a phone that was remotely disabled. I'm assuming your shades of gray are the how's and why's of that? How is that of any consequence to these people? Steve_Jobroni Shut up, troll. DanSan got em! Matt This will be great for their resale value. ericshmerick Swappa comments: I GEEVE U $200 BUY NOW FINAL OFFERS!! JD Wooooo! Go Pixel, I'm definately not going near any Google hardware with a 1000ft pole now.I may use my 1001ft pole. In Many states, and at least in Canada this is not legal, you can't blacklist a phone for ToS violation. There's a very narrow list of reasons for a device to be blacklisted. Cuong This is a really shitty move from Google. At least sent a notification few days in advance and offer a way to appeal. What if a person was in an emergency situation? Imagine the lawsuit for that, Google. Why customers have to suffer because Google can't control their resellers? ericshmerick 911 always works. segag Thats Fuck all! Snowsky Mountain This may seriously make me rethink my use of Google hardware (especially phones). Stevie Do no evil Google. Do no evil. My Dixie Wrecked Yeah, they got rid of that mandate years ago. Seriously. Look it up. mxwp lol, yeah it was pretty funny. but i give Big G props for being somewhat honest about that. "hmm, we're huge now and so just cannot help to do some evil" Corey Kinard Just looked​ it up. Looks like it's still in place for Google. Alphabet's is different l though. It's "do the right thing." Sruly J Bought an unlocked Pixel yesterday for $334. Before I send it in to get checked and fixed by Google, I really should check the IMEI (normally I'd have the IMEI first, but the seller didn't give it to me). Michael D’Ambrosio "Someone with an answer." That'll get you far with Tech support. Smh vn33 Does the blacklisted phone works out of US, say in Canada? I assume yes, if it's the carriers that are doing the blacklisting. that said, it would really dampen my desire for a phone from Google. Stevie I am crossing my fingers that they don't come after my Nexus 6. Already bought and activated. There's no going back right? speedy1979 So to clarify google is randomly blacklisting any google pixel that is resold. I actually considered buying a ProjectFi device sometime ago; so glad I didn't go through with it. Kris Crowley I have fi service. When you buy a phone through fi you got a discount or a phone that you can't get through the Google store if you want. There is a disclaimer that if you buy it and never activate it that you will be charged additional Monies within 30 days. Now without knowing isn't possible that A the phone was bought at a discount and B the additional fee was levied but never paid? trixnkix637 Know the risks of buying used people. Do your homework. Asking where the seller bought the phone originally could've prevented all of this. Can't blame Google because someone tried to game the system both ways. marcusmarcus2 Know the risks of not using commas, people. You should never buy people, whether they are used or new. Rony Hmmm, is there a difference between a new and a used person. I've scoured the forums and haven't got a clear answer. marcusmarcus2 You would have to ask them before you buy them. They usually know when they've been used. But again, you should not buy any people. Def Ref But if you try to rent people, you start hearing words like "solicitation" and that's no fun. marcusmarcus2 Don't rent them either. While we are at it. Do not borrow, loan or steal people. Def Ref Is enticement allowed in your no fun world? Asking for a friend. marcusmarcus2 I don't see a problem with enticement as long as that enticement does not lead to stealing people. "No fun world"? You mean my world where I think people should not be viewed or treated as items/property? If yes, then yeah, I guess it is a no fun world. Def Ref Lighten up, Francis. marcusmarcus2 Lighten up, Francis? https://38.media.tumblr.com/39ef7347a58e308e67a5bd01cd124431/tumblr_nsld6lafvE1qh124lo1_500.gif Def Ref https://youtu.be/0OnpkDWbeJs That the title is misspelled AND mispunctuated is bonus. trixnkix637 Didn't NY and NV allow for the renting of people or is that wishful thinking? Asking for a friend. Rod This was so good, I had to sign into Disqus to upvote. trixnkix637 Buying people has been around for ages. Can't just stop now because of commas. marcusmarcus2 Buying used has been around for ages. trixnkix637 And so has it's risks. ericshmerick Wow I feel bad for the Swappa sellers who are getting PayPal charge backs right about now. Alexander Z Great This was the response I received. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/948da6656e25823e8dc529c4571fbc2d347f5e820ee9b7c91844d48c9745a112.png DanSan owner of the device ≠ person who purchased. way to go google. InnocentEd News flash this could happen with any phone from any manufacturer on any network that is resold used. I've had it happen with 2 iPhones and Apple could have cared less. You buy used, you take the risk. It's amazing how even credited tech journalists assume devices on Swappa are always going to be 100% safe. If Project Fi were not allowed to be resold via T&S then it's no diff than blacklisting a resold stolen phone...they had every right. Bewear This is why we can't have nice things. Rony Honestly this makes total sense. Its technically stealing the phone if you buy it for a discounted price and you dont activate it and sell it again. I think they made the right move. raffr It's not "technically" stealing. If you purchase a product at the price requested, you did not steal it. IF, big IF, in your purchase agreement it states you cannot resell the phone without activating it first, then google has a case. Serge Cebrian if you are paying for the service ... you are still paying for it even if you keep your older phone or a better phone if you want to unless you stop paying then its stealing ... but not if you keep the service// marcusmarcus2 They could have blacklisted these phones for that reason. But they could have also been overzealous when blacklisting devices and blacklisted numerous other devices that people did not do that with. It may have been the right move to block those that did do that, but if they inadvertently blocked additional devices, then hopefully they make the right move and unblock those devices that should not have been blocked. newtonfb Not new. Wife got a 5x on swappa. Phone was originally on FI but never taken off the account. We tried to activate it on FI but they did we couldn't until the owner released the phone? It worked fine on any other carrier. Had to get a new 5x Lance Biddle I paid off my pixel through project fi. I recently switched to Verizon. Yesterday Verizon notified me that my phone had been reported as stolen! When I awoke this morning my service had been disabled by Verizon. The support from Project Fi has been abysmal. What do I do to fix this? Corey Kinard Go to Reddit. Get ready for talks with the Better Business Bureau. Keep contacting Fi, keep screenshotting all the correspondences, you get all the buyers info in order to prove you are the original device owner. You don't fix this, you didn't cause it to break. Google fixes this. Everyone affected just has to light a fire under their ass. tnt Keep pushing / escalating with Project Fi. Ryan from GroupTweet I bought a Pixel from Tradeport USA (NH based company, shit!) about 3 months ago. The phone is on T-mobile right now and still currently working (fingers crossed). From my interpretation this appears only to be affecting Pixels bought through Google Fi - and perhaps not ones bought via Google Play store unlocked? Is that correct? Is there anyway I can check to see if my pixel was in fact sold via Google FI vs Google Play? Really hoping I don't wake up to a bricked phone in the next couple mornings... Sruly J You could contact Google, provide them with the IMEI, and they could let you know if it was bought through Google Play. Ryan from GroupTweet Thanks - but don't want to risk tipping them off that my phone should be on the blacklist :( Sruly J But wouldn't they know anyways if it should be blacklisted? I mean, how else would they have blacklisted so many phones this week? lauriedesautels So I have the Pixel and was planning on selling it via Swappa after my credits end from another phone. They ended up giving me a brand new Pixel XL but their service has become horrible where I live. So please correct me if I am wrong but if the Pixel is paid off and I switch carriers/ my Pixel is a paperweight? (I don't plan on using the phone on another carrier after 3 mo). ericshmerick According to this place, you can never sell it. You must carry it with you to your grave. Robert Montoya I have a Pixel that is currently blacklisted as of 5/23/2017 I bought it from Swappa... Google says they will lift the ban in 24 to 48 hours... That was 24 hours ago.. Phone still Blacklisted Wendell Brown I must have missed where it was shown that these deactivated phones were on Project Fi. As best I can tell, the only link to Fi is from an OLD article about the guy reselling phones several months ago. Is there any proof that this is in any way Fi related? MadJoe I have to say, if Google ever blacklisted my phone in a misguided sour-grapes attempt to punish the person who sold it to me, and without compensating me for it I would be rather angry. It would also be the absolute last Google product I ever purchased. As it is, this story has me glad I don't own anything more than a $25 Chromecast that I never use. I was seriously considering the Pixel 2 as my next phone, but not any more. If they were going to be such babies about the phones being resold, they should have vetted their buyers a little better. Corey Kinard It doesn't look like they were making any money off of you in the first place... Second-hand buyers/ bargain hunters rarely go out and pre-order $800 phones. Maybe you're different. They're definitely fucking up, but considering how little the pixel one sold and how much money they make I'm not sure they'll care about this any which way the wind blows. Same way Apple can just outright tell their customers to go fuck themselves over certain problems. MadJoe The problem is that too many people will ignore a company's unscrupulous behavior. If more of us would punished them by taking away access to our wallets, they'd think twice about trying to screw us. But people are lazy and lack commitment. So you're absolutely right, Google won't feel any hit by my deciding not to buy any more of their shit because a shit-ton of blind lemmings will gladly line up to jump off that spot on the cliff I chose not to use. And when a couple of them get screwed, they will cry "why isn't anyone else interested in helping me?" as the rest of the heard ignore them. On the bright side, the cycle will continue ad nauseum until I'm in a hole in the ground. Bruce Considering the ridiculous amount they are charging for the phones (Apple pricing without the Apple level support), this just about kills the resale value for a Pixel. Who the hell is going to buy a used phone for $500+ (because the original cost is so high) if their phones get blacklisted months later. And who the hell is going to buy the phones at the original price, when resale value will drop like a rock. And this doesn't even take into account all the BS that comes with the phone to begin with. 2 years of guaranteed OS updates. Hardware issues (Bluetooth, speakers, water resistance...) which don't get acknowledged amid finger pointing. Insufficient inventory even if they were open to replacements. The 128GB version (the 32GB is too little and the 64 GB doesn't exist) costs almost a $1000. The first time they tried this with the Nexus One, it didn't go well. This doesn't seem to be going much better. The Galaxy Nexus couldn't be upgraded because of drivers. The only real hits have been the Nexus 5 and the 6P. UniBroW *clutches iPhone 7 plus despite it's inferiority to android* Tj Hariharan Wait, do we actually KNOW that the phones that are blacklisted were originally purchased for reselling for profit? All i got from this article was that the phone was originally purchased from Project Fi.. RTNDO128 My phone was effected by this. I've been having issues with no T-Mobile service for the past couple of days on Project Fi. After reading this article, I used the Swappa IMEI checker and what do you know, my phone is reported "lost/stolen". I bought my Pixel on eBay at the beginning of January. Now I'm beyond their 30 day gaurentee. What an absolute clusterfuck. RTNDO128 My phone was effected by this. I've been having issues with no T-Mobile service for the past couple of days on Project Fi. After reading this article, I used the Swappa IMEI checker and what do you know, my phone is reported "lost/stolen". I bought my Pixel on eBay in the middle of February. Now I'm beyond their 30 day guarantee. What an absolute clusterfuck. Y2J You have 180 days in Paypal. RTNDO128 Thanks, I filed a claim with them. Hopefully this situation is covered. Max Did you contact first the seller? Otherwise it's a dick move to file a claim without first giving the seller the opportunity to see if he collaborates... RTNDO128 Thanks for your opinion. As stated, I'm beyond the 30 day eBay guarantee window. I created a "dispute" through the PayPal Resolution Center, which sends a message directly to the seller. PayPal is totally uninvolved with the dispute until I choose to escalate, which will only happen if I cannot get this resolved with the seller first. I just want to have our conversations documented in the event that the seller does not want to deal with this situation. Ken Kinda weird Google said that IMEI can't be blocked by manufacturer, I'm sure that's true. But what when manufacturer is also technically the carrier? Da_James Are you saying that "buying" a device in the USA doesn't mean you own it? Just SUE. Steve_Jobroni > as it's the carrier and not the manufacturer that has the ability to blacklist devices Do people not read the full article anymore? There seems to be a lot of Jabroni's blaming Google when it's the carrier that can only do the blacklisting. Sir_Brizz But that carrier is Project Fi, aka Google... Aleksandr Ivanov Change IMEI, problem solved! AbdulB1 lol Cassidy James Blaede I'd be interested in hearing how widespread this actually is, and a response from Google. My mom bought a Pixel from Swappa because Google was out of stock, and she's been loving it. I'd hate for her phone to become a brick because of this. Leonardo Baez I see a class action demand on the horizon? Đức Thành I'm a die-hard Google fan, but wow does Google need some fixing. justmy2pennies2012 There is one simple way Google can prevent the second hand market from making a profit. 1. Provide enough stock for all those who want to purchase the device! :) Bonus: Price the device accrodingly!! I gave up trying to buy one new from VZW and the Play Store.

RayNeverLearns I believe Project Fi has done this for all affected Pixels. I didn't contact the person who sold it to me (Craigslist 7 months ago... wouldn't know where to even start) yet my phone was whitelisted earlier today.

Name: Subject: Message: 5 of the best underrated Android phones Newsby Dane O'Leary13 hours ago 13 818 18 Whether you’re a power user, enthusiast, or a mainstream consumer, there’s a strong chance that the Android phone in your pocket is one of the last couple generations of Samsung, LG, HTC, or Sony flagships. In fact, statistics indicate that there’s more than a one-in-five chance that any smartphone user — whether he or she is using Android, iOS, or Windows Phone — owns a Samsung Android phone. So clearly, the Android smartphone market is dominated by flagships produced by the companies I mentioned above and a small number of others you might expect. But there’s a new trend we’ve been seeing over the past couple years. We can now find flagship-level quality in mid-range devices. In other words, it’s no longer necessary to spend upward of a thousand dollars to get much of what the Samsung Galaxy S8 has to offer. Companies like Huawei, OnePlus, ZTE, and Lenovorola are leading the charge when it comes to making Android phones we would’ve snubbed just a few short years ago that can actually compete with the industry’s best-selling flagships. In tribute to those devices that are often overlooked in favor of the big flagships, here are five of the best and most underrated Android phones, as well as what makes them so great. Vivo V5 Plus — the unsung selfie hero Every now and then, I like to look up the top OEMs for smartphone sales. At the top of the list, you always see Samsung, followed distantly by Apple. Beyond those two, there are a number of top-selling OEMs that are virtually unknown in the U.S., one of which is Vivo. Only appearing among the top-selling OEMs occasionally, Vivo is arguably most well-known for the Xplay 3S, which was the first smartphone with a 1440p QHD display. While Vivo hasn’t made too many headlines since then, the company still makes great smartphones. Interestingly, many of Vivo’s smartphones focus on one specific feature or set of features. In the case of the Vivo V5 Plus, that would be selfies. Let’s face it: As painful as they can make browsing our social media feeds, selfies are an important smartphone feature for a lot of people. According to statistics, about 17 million selfies are uploaded to social media each week, and that’s just by millennials between the ages of 18 and 24. And if you’ve ever taken a selfie, you know that it can take dozens of shots before you get the perfect “duck face”, so we can safely assume that far more than 17 million selfies are actually taken. Meanwhile, Google says that more than 24 billion of users’ selfies are uploaded to Google Photos. Let that sink in for a minute. See also: Vivo V5 Plus review February 9, 2017 With more than 24 billion of selfies uploaded to Google Photos, a top-notch front facing camera clearly meets consumer demand. For all your selfie aficionados out there, the Vivo V5 Plus is a device you may want to consider. It has 16 MP shooter on the rear, but that’s not where the V5 Plus shines. On the front is a dual-camera setup with a primary sensor at 20 MP and an 8 MP secondary to bring in additional depth-of-field information. In other words, you get incredible sharpness and rich detail due to the primary’s higher-than-average pixel count, and the secondary sensor allows you to achieve that highly-desirable bokeh effect, which is how you get that creamy blurred background behind a subject that’s perfectly in focus. Aside from the impressive selfie capabilities, the Vivo V5 Plus has an aluminum unibody design that’s more than reminiscent of the iPhone with a 5.5” display, a Hi-Fi audio chip, and Vivo’s own Funtouch 3.0 Android skin. After a quiet launch in January of this year, the V5 Plus is available for around $400, but the cost of importing may drive up that cost considerably since it’s not officially available in the US at this time. It may not be worth the trouble with its slightly unimpressive specs, but in the hands of someone with selfie addiction, the Vivo V5 Plus is priceless. Xiaomi Mi Note 2 — where power, design, and shamelessness converge Notice how both the front and back glass curve to meet the aluminum chassis in perfect symmetry, how there’s a complete absence of side bezels, how the only materials present in the construction of the device is glass with a bit of metal. Xiaomi’s phablet is more than just reminiscent of another company’s design language; before you even hold it in your hand, Xiaomi’s Mi Note 2 is sure to trigger a sense of déjà vu, evoking memories of the brief time we spent with the late Samsung Galaxy Note7. Were it not for the Note7’s tragically short lifespan, we surely would’ve seen the Mi Note 2 as just another Asian clone. As it stands, the Mi Note 2 is as overlooked as it is impressive, and (at least for the time being) it happens to also be the best way to fill that Note7-shaped hole in our hearts. Fortunately, the Mi Note 2’s resemblance to the Note7 is more than just skin deep. Unfortunately, Xiaomi opted for a 5.5-inch 1080p FHD OLED rather than going QHD like the Note7, but the Mi Note 2 runs on a Snapdragon 821 CPU, Adreno 530 GPU, 6 GB of RAM, and 128 GB of built-in storage. Our own benchmarks show the Mi Note 2 as an outstanding performer, meaning that the power users among us should have no issues running the latest apps and games. It can appease photography enthusiasts, too, with a 22.5 MP rear camera and a somewhat less impressive 8 MP front-facing camera. See also: Xiaomi Mi Note 2 review February 6, 2017 One of the most polarizing features of Asian-made Android phones is the… distinctive software. Many Asian OEMs put iOS-like skins over Android and Xiaomi’s MIUI is no exception. While the consensus seems to be that MIUI has been getting better over time, the development community has gained root access on the Mi Note 2, so you’re not stuck with Xiaomi’s skin necessarily. Also like other Asian-made Android phones, the main issue with the Mi Note 2 seems to be access. Since it’s not officially offered in the West, you’ll need to be motivated to get your hands on the Note7 look-a-like, but for those who put in the leg work, the Mi Note 2 features LTE bands that make it usable in virtually any market. HTC 10 — still a great multimedia experience Yes, I consider last year’s HTC flagship to be one of the most underrated Android smartphones, and I’ll tell you why. First, there’s the fact that the HTC 10 was barely a blip on the 2016 smartphone-market radar. Leading up to the 10, most would agree that HTC was having a rough go of it, but the 10 could’ve been the device that turned things around. It had an impressive all-metal build with a dramatic chamfer that lent to a more dramatic appearance as well as a great in-hand feel and usability. For those who find “phablets” to be too unwieldy, the HTC 10’s 5.2-inch QHD display hit the sweet spot. But what made the HTC 10 a compelling option in 2016 — and what continues to make HTC 10 a viable contender — is the multimedia experience it offers. HTC has become synonymous with BoomSound, which, historically, came in the form of two front-facing speakers embedded in a device’s top and bottom bezels. However, one of the things that probably put many would-be buyers off the 10 was HTC’s decision to do away with the two front-facing BoomSound speakers that we’d come to know and love, and, instead, go with a bottom-facing primary speaker/woofer with the device’s earpiece doubling as a tweeter; it’s a similar setup as we eventually saw on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. To be clear, this new iteration of BoomSound still put every other smartphone’s built-in audio to shame, but it was a tougher sell because it was technically a step backward. See also: HTC 10 revisited: one year later 2 weeks ago The HTC 10 is still a solid all-around contender, especially when you can pick it up for half (or even less) its original retail cost. In addition to the BoomSound speaker setup, the HTC 10 offers Hi-Res audio processing with a 24-bit DAC. Coupled with display resolution of 1440p, the HTC 10 is a beast when it comes to multimedia. Whether you’re listening to music, watching movies, or even just perusing YouTube, you can really see all the time and effort HTC put into the 10. And let’s not forget that the 10’s primary camera ranks among the top smartphone cameras to date, receiving the same score as the brand new Samsung Galaxy S8 and being beaten only by the Google Pixel and the new HTC U11. While its initial retail cost of $699 wasn’t unreasonable, the multimedia powerhouse was stifled by the highly-acclaimed Galaxy S7 line as well as super-competitive “budget flagships” like the OnePlus 3. Then Google’s Pixel phones (which are notably produced by HTC) came along and were yet another nail in the proverbial coffin. In fact, T-Mobile dropped the HTC 10 just two months after its launch due to extremely poor sales. But despite being outshined by increasingly stiff competition, the HTC 10 is still a solid contender, especially when you can pick it up for half (or even less) its original retail cost. Meizu Pro 6 Plus — a Jack of a trades Those of us who closely follow smartphone tech and reviews know that the best smartphones are the ones that tick the most boxes. We want to see smartphones that have great cameras, plenty of battery life, high-quality displays, and strong performance with unique and attractive designs. Meanwhile, each of us have certain boxes that are more important than others; for instance, you might need enough battery life to go at least two days between charges while I prefer a smartphone with a top-performing camera. Therefore, those that are strong performers in most categories without being mind-blowing in any of them are easy to overlook, which is the case with the Meizu Pro 6 Plus. Unless you live in Asia, China-based Meizu is probably another unfamiliar OEM, but the company has been seriously upping its smartphone game. The aforementioned Pro 6 Plus earns both the “pro” and “plus” in its name with its 5.7-inch QHD display and octa-core Exynos 8890 CPU; yes, that’s the same chip that’s in the international variants of the Samsung Galaxy S7, S7 Edge, and ill-fated Note7. As well, the Pro 6 Plus utilizes the Sony IMX386 sensor as its 12 MP rear shooter, which also happens to be the primary sensor in the Honor 6X’s dual-camera setup. See also: Meizu PRO 6 Plus and Meizu M3X announced November 30, 2016 Considering that it’s running one of the top CPUs of last year, it goes without saying that the Meizu Pro 6 Plus is a strong performer. And rather than being another iPhone ripoff in terms of design, it’s almost like Meizu took a more Frankensteinian approach, borrowing design cues from a number of different devices. For instance, the vertically-oriented rear camera and circular LED flash are reminiscent of the Axon 7, but the aluminum unibody design evokes the OnePlus 3 while still being faithful to the design of Honor’s other devices. Since its release last fall, the Pro 6 Plus has been available in Asian markets for just over $500, but as with other entries on the list, it’s not too difficult to have one shipped into the U.S. from abroad. Lenovo P2 — the Android Energizer If any of us felt pangs of worry when Lenovo bought Motorola from Google a few years ago, there’s surely no need to worry anymore. Virtually every Motorola device that’s come out since the acquisition has been well-received, from the budget-minded Moto G and X series to the higher-end Z series. But what about Lenovo’s own smartphones? Aside from launching the first Tango-enabled smartphone, Lenovo has seemed keen to let Motorola bear the brunt of the company’s smartphone sales, which is why it was so easy to overlook the Lenovo P2, a real diamond in the rough. At a glance, the Lenovo P2 is nothing if not unassuming. Its design isn’t exactly memorable, its Snapdragon 625 CPU isn’t going to win any speed tests, and a 5.5-inch 1080p display is barely average by today’s standards. In short, the P2’s specs list is the epitome of humdrum… that is, until you see there’s a whopping 5100 mAh battery behind the scenes. No, that’s not a typo. Considering that it has a 1080p display and wasn’t designed to be a workhorse, the P2 would’ve had excellent battery life even with a normal-sized battery, but the Lenovo smartphone can offer an unprecedented three-day battery life. If you don’t really need that kind of longevity, Lenovo also suggests using the P2’s 5100 mAh battery a portable power bank for your wearables and Bluetooth headsets. The P2 would’ve had excellent battery life with a normal-sized battery, but Lenovo recommends either enjoying the three-day battery life that 5100 mAh can offer or using a P2 as a portable power bank. If there’s a lesson to be learned from the Lenovo P2, it’s that our perception of a device can change dramatically when there’s one particular feature that stands out from the crowd. It helps, too, that battery life happens to be important to most people since it’s a device’s battery that allows us to enjoy its other features. So even though many of the P2’s specs are merely satisfactory, the fact that the device can three days (or perhaps even longer) between charges makes it much more desirable. Plus, it offers all-metal construction, a fingerprint sensor, expandable storage, and the ability to fast-charge that huge battery while costing roughly $230. Although it might not be the right choice for everyone, the Lenovo P2 is definitely an underrated Android smartphone in my book.

Google reported Christopher Cole to authorities in February 2016 after they noticed the suspicious activity on the 41-year-old's account. Police initially said he had uploaded thousands of child porn photos, but further investigation has since revealed he had allegedly reproduced some of those images. Cole was charged in May 2016 with three counts of possession of child sexually abusive material and one count of using a computer to commit a crime. He was handed an additional two charges this month after investigators found he had allegedly reproduced images. The charges relate to his online activity between December 2014 and October 2015.  Google reported Christopher Cole to authorities after they noticed the suspicious activity on the 41-year-old's photo account RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Man, 33, who placed an online ad seeking 'a family with a...

 Labour's Catherine West: 'Google paid just £36.4 million in tax on UK sales of more than £6 billion. What made this possible? A government not tackling tax avoidance' Catherine West May 26, 2017, 5:58 AM 551 facebook linkedin twitter email print Catherine West / Labour Catherine West is the Labour candidate for Hornsey & Wood Green, in London, in the 2017 General Election. She is also Labour's foreign affairs spokesperson. In 2015, Google paid back taxes of £130 million to the Exchequer for the previous 10 years, a figure roundly considered trivial in comparison to its profits. As Parliament's public spending watchdog said, the deal was secretive and the amount “disproportionately small when compared with the size of Google’s business in the UK.” Yet, last year it paid just £36.4 million, despite parent company Alphabet showing UK sales of more than £6 billion. What made this possible? A government not tackling the issue of tax avoidance. It is this that has allowed the likes of Amazon, Starbucks, Facebook and Vodafone to pay meagre amounts of tax relative to their operations in the UK. Just last week, drinks giant Diageo paid £107 million over a dispute relating to profits that were moved between the UK and the Netherlands. Many readers will think tax is not a moral question, but a legal one. And to be clear: Labour knows few would choose to pay more tax, that few people wake up and decide what they’d like to do today is pay more. But the overwhelming majority of people and companies pay their tax at the rate at which it is set, understanding that public services must be maintained. Big corporations should be no exception; there should be an equal playing field between smaller and bigger companies. Both should pay the legally mandated amount, and the government has an obligation to collect no more and no less. Successive governments (including, most recently, the Conservatives) have pledged to crack down on multinational corporations playing the international tax system in order to pay less tax in countries including the UK. Labour wants to reset this relationship, to create policy that makes business transparent such that it cannot avoid paying such tax. Labour seeks to reset the relationship so small businesses on which we all rely are put on equal footing with larger multinationals. A policy that requires companies with more than £36 million in turnover, or more than 250 employees, to file a complete tax return at Companies House along with annual accounts will help achieve this. It simply should not be one rule for small businesses and another for large businesses. Labour wants to help small businesses, protecting them by reintroducing the lower small profit rate of corporation tax. And Labour will exclude small businesses from costly plans to introduce quarterly reporting, as well as establishing a national investment bank to inject £250 billion of lending power across the next decade, helping small businesses gain access to finance where traditional banks have closed their doors. Meanwhile, those who struggle to pay a higher minimum wage will be helped with a new employment allowance. These policies will come as we crack down on late payments from large firms that have held back SMEs. Some £26 billion is held back due to late payments from large companies, following the example of Australia where there is binding arbitration and fines for persistent late payers. Arbitration will have teeth under Labour. This is a policy that the Federation of Small Business supports to bolster the economy and help businesses, much like the policy to offer small firms loans from regional development banks will, or the scrapping of quarterly reporting for small firms, a burdensome and cumbersome regulation that will harm individual businesses, the high street and the economy. It is becoming clearer that the current course of policy is going to kill small businesses. The FSB says members in central London are going to see dramatic hikes in the next five years, with 30% saying they will have to move away from the centre over the period due to the increase. They argue for more relief for businesses during transition, which Labour has committed to. The Institute for Economic Affairs says rates at minimum need to be changed more frequently to reduce the shock to businesses. It is Labour which has said it will do this. The Institute of Directors, meanwhile, says that the next government needs to accept that the existing business rating system is not responsive to the modern economy “and needs broad-based, affordable reform focused upon smaller and medium-sized businesses. The system is wildly complex, unfair to SMEs and will need real consultation to ensure we get it right.” It is Labour who is committed to a review with an eye to fundamental reform of the system to ease the burden on businesses. As a Labour MP in London, I understand the value that is added by big businesses, innovation and investment that have benefited the economy and society. Yet I also understand, and regularly hear, the problems facing small businesses, who will be a prized part of the industrial strategy. Under a Labour government, they will be given an opportunity to thrive. Visit Catherine West's Facebook page here.

The update is a part of Android version 2.15 of Google Photos, which can be downloaded from the Play Store. By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Published:May 26, 2017 9:10 pm   Google announced a host of new features for Photos at its annual developer conference. (Source: Google Play Store) Google Photos has added the ability to archive photos. Though not a major update, it surely qualifies as a significant one given it will make sorting/hiding pictures easier. It has been rolled out for Android users and version 2.15 of Google Photos can be downloaded from the Play Store. Archived photos will not appear in the main photos view, but will still be able visible in search, albums, as well as in the new Archive view. To archive a photo, just click on the Archive option (present just below Trash) in the navigation drawer. Users can archive multiple pictures in one go as well, by clicking on a new icon on the top right corner. Archive view is same as main photos view. Once archived, photos will be removed from main photo library. The feature will come in handy when you’d want to hide particular pictures from friends and family, but not delete them. You can easily put such photos in Archive folder, and share the rest of photos with other people. It helps while sorting repeated photos, screenshots etc as well. Google announced a host of new features for Photos at its annual developer conference. Suggested Sharing feature uses machine learning technology to remind users to share photos with their contacts, while Shared Libraries makes it easier to automatically share relevant photos with friends and family. Lens is coming to Photos as well. Archive feature was recently introduced by Instagram for its platform as well. It lets users save their older posts as well to view them privately. These posts can later be made public anytime a user wants. Instagram will add a new encircled clock icon on the top right of user’s profile that will let them view archived posts.

Google app v7.3 beta prepares for podcast subscriptions, data saver for Now Cards, and more [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/24 6:31pm PDTMay 24, 2017 39 Plus 1 on G+ 120 Share on Facebook 124 Share on Twitter Total Shares283 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 Podcast subscriptions 1.2 Audio Player Notification Channel 1.3 Data Saver for Now Cards 1.4 Google Assistant on Chrome OS (Tease) 1.5 New Icons 1.6 Image attribution? 2 Download Version 7.3 of the Google app began rolling out to users in the beta channel earlier today. There are a few odd little changes to be found poking around in the UI, like a new menu shortcut on many of the Assistant settings screens that leads to the Activity Controls settings, but it's all pretty innocuous. We'll surely see more significant features going live as Google activates them remotely over the coming weeks™. Nevertheless, there are some interesting things to be found during the course of a teardown. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Podcast subscriptions Last year, Google took a (half-hearted) stab at supporting podcasts with the Play Music app. The same day, in a much less expected move, it also became possible to listen to individual episodes right from a Google search. Fast forward several months and Google Assistant also gained the ability to play podcasts, which turned out to be a fairly natural feature for Google Home. While Play Music allows users to subscribe to podcasts, listening to one through Google Search or Assistant meant asking for shows by name, and may also require a specific episode number if you want to hear anything but the most recent recording. Now it looks like Google is going to close that gap with built-in podcast subscriptions. code <string name="podcasts">Podcasts</string> <string name="no_podcasts_found">No podcasts found</string> <string name="delete_favorites">Delete selected podcasts</string> <string name="subscribe">Subscribe</string> <string name="unsubscribe">Unsubscribe</string> <string name="confirm_unsubscribe_title">Unsubscribe from this show?</string> By all appearances, podcast subscriptions will be accessible in Google Assistant settings and will likely be treated much like subscriptions to news sources. The one obvious difference is that Google will track which episodes have been played so you won't miss any or have to listen to repeats. I do want to know if this will use the same subscription list and episode tracking as Play Music, because it would certainly be annoying if the two are independent and can't be kept in sync. However, if this is done right, it will make Google Home a really great appliance for podcast listening. Note: Some previously added strings already related to podcasts, but only in the context of marking them as favorites. The new text shows that a more fully-baked feature is planned. Audio Player Notification Channel The Google app already has a huge number of notification channels, but there is a new one titled "Audio Player" on the way. There can be no doubt that this topic is related to the previous section about podcasts; but I broke it out as a separate topic because it will surely fit other situations, as well. <string name="audio_player_notification_channel">Audio Player</string> Naturally, this channel will be occupied by a player control and should pop up anytime there is audio playing through the Google app. For example, search results can also be used to find and play audio clips from popular music. There's really not much more to say about this, but it's probably good that users will have the option to modify settings for these notifications. Data Saver for Now Cards If you've been following along for a while, it's probably pretty obvious Google has been tweaking many of its apps to be more responsible about data usage, especially in countries known to have slow throughput and low data caps. If this applies to you, then there's a setting that you might want to keep an eye out for. Google is adding a Data Saver mode for the Now Cards. code <string name="turn_on_feed_datasaver">Data saver</string> <string name="feed_datasaver_details">When data saver is on, your feed won’t get the latest content.</string> <string name="feed_datasaver_preference">feedDataSaverPreference</string> from: /xml/now_cards_settings.xml <com.google.android.apps.gsa.search.core.preferences.CustomSwitchPreference android:key="@string/feed_datasaver_preference" android:defaultValue="false" /> This differs from the Lite Mode that Google began working on and testing last year. That setting was intended to optimize the data passing between the server and user so that it would consume less while delivering the same (or similar) quality of content. The Data Saver feature discussed here is focused on preventing Google from updating the Now Cards in the background. If you don't even look at Google Now cards, or maybe don't care about seeing them updated unless they are manually refreshed, this is definitely a feature you'll want to look for. Google may have already made it available in certain regions, but it's not yet showing up for me, so I suggest taking a look in the Google settings under the Your Feed section. If it's enabled for your device, the Data Saver option should be at the very top of the list. Google Assistant on Chrome OS (Tease) During an interview with The Telegraph in mid-December, Hiroshi Lockheimer made a pretty clear statement that Google Assistant was destined to arrive on Chrome OS at some point in the future. That was about six months ago and it seems nobody has seen it happen in any official capacity yet. However, a couple of new strings in the Google app actually do appear to suggest this plan hasn't been abandoned. <string name="chrome_os_opa_value_proposition_cancel">No Thanks</string> <string name="chrome_os_opa_value_proposition_continue">Continue</string> Only the string names matter in this situation. The text will just be used to label a pair of buttons. The bit about "chrome os" is pretty clear, and the "opa" segment is a standard shorthand for Google Assistant. As for the "value proposition" bit, I assume these buttons will be used on an ad that either encourages users to set up Assistant when it becomes available, or may even suggest buying a Chromebook. For now, it's hard to tell since the content of the message isn't included at this time. It may be pushed to users remotely when it's time to run the message. While this gives no clues about a release date or any new features, at least it's a paltry sign of hope for Chrome OS users that have become frustrated with waiting for Assistant to make its grand debut on laptops. New Icons I usually skip over new icons since most of them are redundant or don't really relate to anything too special. However, there are three that might be worth a quick mention. The first belongs to the recently announced Google Lens. It matches the icon shown during the I/O keynote and the filename confirms it. While the icon is there, it doesn't show up anywhere in the live interface, which isn't too surprising since Lens hasn't actually launched yet. No doubt it will appear in the Google Assistant at some point, probably in the same horizontal row with the new keyboard icon for text input. The next icon is the always familiar RSS logo. I don't want to venture too many guesses about any features it might lead to, but it would make sense if the Google app is going to become a little more friendly towards subscribing to content providers instead of providing just randomly chosen articles. Last but not least, we have the water symbol from The Fifth Element. It actually represents "waves" in this case. It might have to do with coastal conditions, recreational spots, or surfing reports. Okay, I admit it, I only included this one so I could squeeze in that a movie reference. Image attribution? Finally, we've come to a mystery topic. The resources for the latest update include a brand new menu named attribution_popup_menu.xml with just one command called "view image source." code <string name="view_image_source">View image source</string> from /menu/attribution_popup_menu.xml <menu xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"> <item android:visible="true" android:title="@string/view_image_source" /> </menu> As a person that writes a lot of original content and edits a lot of images, my first instinct was that this might be related to a tool that would help people identify the origin of many images on the Internet. After many attempts to test that theory, I'm not so confident about it. My second thought is that this menu is related to the Google Attribution announcement made just yesterday. The timing and name certainly go together, but it's hard to come up with a reason why somebody would need to view the source of an image in that context. I don't have too many other thoughts on this one, but speculation in the comments is welcome.

James Amend Yes. I have. I wasn't able to update the Google App via the Play Store or via APK. The only way I was able to get it to install/update was to revert back to Nougat, update it, and then return to O. I haven't had any issues since. It seems like the app never got stuck on the version from 7.1.2 and that broke something (I didn't have the updated launcher either after updating to O). mondeca Google's lame implementation of podcasts is really disappointing. I love my PocketCasts, but I was hoping for a quality effort from Google to spur competition. Carson Saldanha App shortcuts too! Cody Toombs They're not actually new. They were there in earlier versions, but a bug in one or two of the previous builds prevented them from showing up for a while. Carson Saldanha Ah, thanks for the clarification. I had seen it on 9to5Google earlier today and I guess they were mistaken. 👌 Kawshik Ahmed It's coming on Chrome OS but not on Pixel C or any other Android tablets -_- Cody Toombs I have a feeling that thing about tablets not getting Assistant will prove to be a relatively short-lived thing. It was a Pixel Phone exclusive for a long while, then went to phones (many of which are still waiting for it, I'm told), and then the SDK for other devices came out. I've got a feeling they'll start (or at least announced) a rollout to tablets in a few months, probably right around October. Andy J Yeah it drives me up the wall when they keep saying "Your assistant available everywhere" and I'm like - well..... no.... it's not is it. I mean right now I have an LGG4 in the UK - I'm still waiting for it to arrive. I have a Google Home - so right now my assistant is available in exactly one place (it's technically also on my G Watch R - but AW2 is next to useless so it doesn't count) Joseph Walker Full time mommy Kelly Richards from New York after quitting from her regular job managed to earn from 26000$ to 28000$ a month from freelancing inside the house... This is the way she working it >>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now Denholm Willmer Shouldn't the Data Saver that's integrated into Nougat work for Now cards as well? Instead of having an individual Data Saver option for everything perhaps it should be done on a system level and made customizable boop Nougat is on 7% of devices. The Google app is on nearly 100% of devices. Denholm Willmer I can see where you're coming from, but if you're going to have a Data Saver option in Nougat, you might as well make it function the way it says, because I think that's what a user would expect. If not, it should be able to be customized to their liking. Douglas J Hunley I agree. If you're on N or higher and have Data Saver enabled in the OS, then all these apps that have their own toggle should be toggled to on as well. Then you could turn them off individually as desired. If I enable data saver at the OS level it's pretty obvious that I want to globally save data... I shouldn't have to turn on the option in Chrome, in Now, in X, in Y, etc etc boop I wonder what the activation method for Assistant will be? Long press of the search/app button? Keyboard shortcut? Or will we just have to open the app? Vantius Long press the home button, like it already is. Umesh Chamara at least they should have expand their google now support to few more counties.

Home > Google News > Google Adds Personal Tab To Search Filters Google Adds Personal Tab To Search Filters May 26, 2017 • 7:26 am | (1) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google Search Engine Prev Story Next story Tweet Pin It   Prev Story Next Story Google now lets searchers filter their search results by "personal" results. By that, it mostly means emails, flights, anything related to that Gmail account they are logged into. You should be able to see it if you are logged into a normal Gmail account and do a normal Google search. If you are logged out or logged into a Google Apps (GSuite) account, you won't see it. Here is a screen shot of the option: This was spotted first by Jessica Grammer and posted on Twitter. Here is what happens when you filter by personal results, at least for me: It shows me a bunch of emails. Note, I don't use my personal Gmail account much, so it is mostly filled with spam. Google first launched personalized results in search back in 2012 but it was included in your core results without the personal filter option. I asked Google for a comment on this but I have yet to hear back. When I do hear back, I'll post something here and at Search Engine Land. Forum discussion at Twitter.

Home > Google News > Google SEO > Google Warns: Don't Do Article Creation For Links Google Warns: Don't Do Article Creation For Links May 26, 2017 • 8:21 am | (68) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google Search Engine Optimization Prev Story Next story Tweet Pin It   Prev Story Next Story Yesterday, Google published a blog post named a reminder about links in large-scale article campaigns. Truth is, there is absolutely nothing new about what is written there. If you do guest blogging or article publishing for the purpose of link building, with the intent of manipulating Google's search results - then that is something Google can and does penalize for. Sometimes those penalties can negatively impact your overall site's ranking and sometimes it means that Google ignores the links on a site or to a site. Either way, it can hurt. Google wrote "what does violate Google's guidelines on link schemes is when the main intent is to build links in a large-scale way back to the author’s site. Below are factors that, when taken to an extreme, can indicate when an article is in violation of these guidelines:" Stuffing keyword-rich links to your site in your articles Having the articles published across many different sites; alternatively, having a large number of articles on a few large, different sites Using or hiring article writers that aren’t knowledgeable about the topics they’re writing on Using the same or similar content across these articles; alternatively, duplicating the full content of articles found on your own site (in which case use of rel=”canonical”, in addition to rel=”nofollow”, is advised) Nothing new... This died in 2014 and has died several times since then. But many folks are now expecting mass manual actions to follow this blog post from Google. Truth is, I am not sure. I did expect that last time Google did a reminder post and it did not happen, no mass manual actions hit after that. So I asked Gary Illyes from Google if we will see new manual actions or penalties and I didn't really get a response, here is what he said: @rustybrick You know why we published this...— Gary Illyes ᕕ( ᐛ )ᕗ (@methode) May 26, 2017 I do, but I can't say. It was timed with a story from Danny Sullivan named Google warns against misusing links in syndication & large-scale article campaigns so read that. But again, I can't say much. Pedro Dias, a former Googler thought manual actions will flow after this: @rustybrick @methode Yes!— Pedro Dias (@pedrodias) May 26, 2017 So did Kaspar, another former Googlers: Typically after a post like this a round of manual actions are just around the corner. #Google on article campaignshttps://t.co/DTa9s96noB— Kaspar Szymanski (@kas_tweets) May 26, 2017 But will it? I'll keep an eye out and keep you all posted. Forum discussion at Twitter.

The Google representative was asked on Twitter if all ads above the fold are bad and John said "no." Of course, the specific example showed Google mobile results for a query where all you saw on the page were ads. Here is the Q&A: @jroakes no— John ☆.o(≧▽≦)o.☆ (@JohnMu) May 20, 2017 Here was the example given to John: Kinda hard to beat organically. pic.twitter.com/jOOeFgOQUS— NaN 🇺🇸 (@jroakes) May 19, 2017 No organic results to be seen without scrolling past the ads. We know Google has a top ad heavy penalty and has said time and time again, do not block your organic content with ads. Hence the interstitials mobile penalty and other algorithm updates hitting sites that make it hard to find your primary content. So here you go, Google says not all ads above the fold are bad. Google really needs to get the organic and paid policies on the same page ASAP. Forum discussion at Twitter.

gizmodo Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root gizmodo Battle of the TV Boxes: Android vs Apple vs Amazon vs Roku David NieldYesterday 10:37am Filed to: media streaming set-top boxes Apple TV Android TV Amazon Fire TV Roku 263 3 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Images: Gizmodo If you’re in the market for a dinky little black box to slide under your living room TV set and pipe through some quality content, you’re in luck: there’s lots of them to pick from. All the major names now have established boxes on the market. While Gizmodo is a big fan of the Roku box and everything it can do, it’s not the only media box in town, and it might not even be the perfect box for you. So instead we compared the four major operating systems running in those boxes to help you sort out exactly which platform will best meet your needs. tvOS Image: Gizmodo What works: Classy interface Great integration of apps with first party content What doesn’t: Advertisement Too Apple-centric Apps remain hit and miss Whether you’re an Apple loyalist or not, you can’t deny the company makes some stylish-looking software, and tvOS is no exception. In terms of flow, ease of use, and intuitiveness, this is hands-down the best interface out of the ones we tested, it’s also the only choice if you’re full invested in the iTunes ecosystem, as media purchased there can’t be played on non-Apple devices. Part of tvOS’s success as an interface is due to the Touch Remote that comes with any tvOS device. Swiping and tapping and gesturing on it feels just right. The little touches Apple has added—the animations as you move around, the movie-quality screensavers—all help as well. It’s the kind of interface you just want to sit and play with. Sponsored It helps that there’s stuff to do. While Apple was slow to embrace apps on the set top box, it’s taken no time to build a strong bench of apps you’re familiar with. Though tvOS is still missing some big names, including Spotify. We should also knock it down for being so Apple-focused—getting content up from a Windows or Android device is possible, but not particularly easy. Image: Screenshot Most of the big video names are present: Netflix, Hulu, YouTube, Vimeo, and HBO Go. Amazon Video is a big miss, but is reportedly on the way later this year. Getting at your Apple movies, TV shows, photos and music is simple too. Gaming support is...not great. We’re a long way from the stage where cool new iOS games automatically appear on the Apple TV at the same time that the launch for the iPhone or iPad. The critically acclaimed puzzlers Lara Croft Go and Hitman Go are available, for example, but they’re the rare top notch titles available. The tvOS also has the rare useful voice assistant—provided you’re looking for something to watch in the iTunes Store. While it will only currently search for media in the iTunes store the voice assistant, Siri, also allows you to fast forward through a video, or rewind and switch on the captions if you missed a line of dialog. Image: Gizmodo All the box OSes we’re reviewing here, except for the Roku, favor their own video and music platforms over those offered by their rivals, and for many users that makes it obvious which one to buy. If all your music was purchased on the Play Store than think about an Android TV, and if it is all from iTunes than you’ll probably prefer an Apple one. Advertisement Advertisement It’s one major downside is the lack of 4K, HDR, and UHD support. Most new TVs are 4K and enjoy the higher quality picture HDR and UHD afford, so Apple’s inability to give you the best version of Netflix’s latest show is a major mark in the negative column. Android TV Image: Gizmodo What works: Smart interface and voice control Seamless Chromecast support What doesn’t: Advertisement Voice input is limited Options wildly vary between devices Unlike tvOS, Android TV is found on a variety of television sets (including Sony) and boxes (including the Nvidia Shield). For this article we’ve been testing out the Nvidia Shield, showing Android TV in its best light, but the Shield has features (like 4K and HDR support) that might not be available in the Android TV device you’ll find yourself with. The good news is the Android TV interface has gradually found its way to a usable and even vaguely attractive stage: It scrolls well, it’s intelligently laid out, and everything is easy to find. Voice search works well enough, though Android TV pushes you towards Google’s store just as the Apple TV does towards iTunes. Advertisement Advertisement All the major video apps are here now, including Amazon Video. Even Spotify has an official app! And there are a number of Android apps that work right out of the box, including web and file browsers. Image: Screenshot If you’re on the Nvidia Shield the game selection is nearly as good as a console like the PS4 or Xbox One. Nvidia allows streaming directly from the servers so you don’t have to worry about the specs of your local box. But broadly speaking the game options on Android TV seems roughly on par with Apple TV: there are some major names, like Crossy Road, but on the whole developers don’t seem to be rushing to make Android TV versions of their Android games (or indeed their Android apps in general). The voice search functionality, or Google Assistant if you’ve got it, can do basic web queries as well as looking for sci-fi movies or comedy shows, but it’s not as useful as Siri for navigating around inside videos or any extra tricks like that recapping dialog one. Image: Screenshot Where a tvOS can act as an AirPlay receiver, Android TV turns your box or television set into a Chromecast, which means all that casting goodness is available without the hassle of an extra dongle and an extra power supply. Chromecasting works as well on Android TV as it does anywhere else, so you can get a ton of content from your phone up to the big screen without needing to necessarily install a TV app. Amazon Fire TV Image: Gizmodo What works: Advertisement Alexa comes built-in Great for Prime members What doesn’t: Advertisement Limited apps outside movies/TV No extra casting capabilities Like Android TV, the Amazon Fire TV platform is available on a variety of boxes, sticks and televisions, and which model you pick up is going to determine which features you get, like support for 4K streaming and downloading. The Fire TV has been around for a while now, in one form or another, and while the interface doesn’t quite match up to the slickness of tvOS or Android TV in our eyes, it does the job as well as it needs to. A recent revamp means it’s much more modern-looking than it used to be. Advertisement Tiles up and down and from left to right with pleasing style, and fades and overlays add to the aesthetic appeal, though as you would expect, Amazon’s own apps are put front and center. As we’ve said before, this is very much a box for Prime members. Image: Amazon Apps-wise, you get Amazon’s take on the Google Play App Store, and while Netflix, Amazon Video, Hulu, and some catch-up services are here, you can’t get at content from iTunes, Spotify or Google Play. There’s no proper YouTube app either, though you can install a wrapper for the TV-optimized version of the YouTube website. While Amazon probably wants you to use its boxes as makeshift gaming devices, a good selection of games isn’t on offer. You do get a few titles that are fine for filling a few minutes of spare time, but the big-name titles are few and far between, and here Amazon Fire TV is lagging behind its rivals from Google and Apple. Advertisement Alexa is now on board these devices, which means you get voice search and everything else that Alexa entails: reading out events from your calendar, checking up on the weather (with a rather nice-looking widget), and pulling up information from the web. Image: Amazon You can also use the Alexa voice search through the remote to look for different types of content (with hits from Amazon services shown first), and to control playback while you’re watching movies and shows, Siri-style. Again though it’s going to be of most use if you already use Alexa elsewhere. Advertisement If you’re a Prime subscriber and a heavy user of Amazon’s music and video services, then the Fire TV boxes or sticks are a decent (and inexpensive buy). For everyone else, it’s difficult to come up with a compelling reason why you would prefer this over something running Apple, Google, or Roku software. It’s lack of support for popular apps is a problem. Roku Image: Gizmodo What works: Advertisement The best selection of content Best value range of devices What doesn’t: User interface looking dated Slow performance on some devices We’ve long loved the boxes and sticks that Roku has to offer, and the interface is now making its way to a variety of budget smart TVs as well. As with Android TV and Amazon Fire TV, some of the features you get will vary depending on which device you’re running your Roku experience through. Advertisement Those features make a difference: if you want 4K and HDR, we think the Roku Premiere+ or Roku Ultra are the best set-top boxes you can buy right now, but you don’t get those lovely extras if you’re sticking with a Roku stick. Adjust your expectations accordingly. Roku has always excelled at the number of services it supports, and new ones are still being added. Just about every service out there, except for Apple’s digital stores, have a Roku app to make use of, so whether you’re tuning in with Netflix, Hulu, Plex, Google Play Movies & TV or anything else, it’s a cord-cutters dream. Image: Gizmodo Outside of the entertainment apps, Roku doesn’t quite offer the same breadth of choice as the other platforms we’ve discussed above—the selection of games is pretty meagre, for example—but there are some nice surprises to be found, like the Firefox browser. Advertisement Advertisement Roku doesn’t have a voice assistant to call its own, but you can search using your voice through the remote or the mobile apps, and we found it to be responsive and smart. Most importantly, it covers all the apps you’ve got installed, and the feed idea, which automatically populates with media you’ve followed or previously shown an interest in, is a masterstroke as well. Considering Roku devices are so capable and so well priced, there’s not much to talk about in terms of negatives, but the dated-looking UI is one of them. It feels staid and sluggish compared with the software Google, Apple, and Amazon are putting out right now, and the apps themselves don’t seem to get much developer love either. Image: Gizmodo A slightly old-fashioned interface isn’t the biggest dealbreaker, but it feels like Roku could use a visual refresh everywhere from its software to its chunky remote. Some extra tricks, like in-app voice control and the ability to quickly refine searches, would be welcome improvements too. Advertisement Roku’s independence from Apple, Google, and Amazon remains its main advantage, and if you hop between devices and platforms then it makes sense to have a Roku as your media streaming box of choice (though of course getting anything from iTunes requires an Apple-branded box). On the downside, you don’t get any Airplaying or Chromecasting capabilities, and there’s not the broad developer support you find with tvOS or Android. If Roku wants to remain the go-to streaming device brand it’s become, there’s lots of hard work ahead.

Google Maps v9.54 prepares to add saved locations for your school and gym, notification channels, and what looks like a task list [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 6:22am PDTMay 26, 2017 35 Plus 1 on G+ 54 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares139 APK Teardown Applications Downloads What's Really New Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 Saved locations for School and Gym 1.2 The 'Other' Notification Channel 1.3 A few new prompts 1.4 A task list called "Nearby Need?" 2 Download An update to Google Maps v9.54 began rolling out to users through the beta channel yesterday, but it doesn't appear to have any visible changes going live quite yet. However, a teardown of the apk does bring a few hints about what to expect in the future. There are clues about a couple of new saved destinations like the Home and Work slots that have become so useful, the first stirring of support for Android O's notification channels, a few new "promos" to get people interested in various features, and a very curious feature that might turn out to be a task list of sorts. As usual, we've got a link at the bottom to download this update to sideload if you're not interested in waiting for Google to deliver it to your device. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Saved locations for School and Gym If you find yourself regularly using the Home and Work saved locations for quick navigation, you'll enjoy this one. The Maps team is expanding the list to include two more common destinations: your gym and your school. <string name="GYM_LOCATION">Gym</string> <string name="SCHOOL_LOCATION">School</string> Since those two strings don't really include any specific telltale signs that they're intended to be default saved locations, I've included the two previously existing lines for Home and Work for comparison. It's pretty obvious that the naming convention matches up. <string name="HOME_LOCATION">Home</string> <string name="WORK_LOCATION">Work</string> There is also a newly added icon for education, which I would naturally assume will go with the School destination. There doesn't appear to be a similar icon dedicated to the Gym slot, but it's not as if Google can't easily color-fill the existing fitness icon. Nevertheless, this one missing icon might be a hint that Google won't make these new destination slots available until a future update includes the missing icon. These two new entries will obviously operate just like Home and Work for the purposes of navigation and quick route selection. And as always, users don't have to actually link these slots to real schools or gyms. I'm sure a lot of people will welcome this simple improvement because so many of us travel to more than just work and home in a typical day. The 'Other' Notification Channel I'll just make a quick mention of this topic since it's not really that interesting. Google Maps is going to have a notification channel on Android O titled "Other notifications." <string name="OTHER_NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL">Other notifications</string> I doubt this will be the only custom channel for Maps. After all, there are several subsections in Settings dedicated to each notification type, so we'll probably see the channel list grow a fair amount in the future. I would assume the Maps team is still trying to decide how to best organize the app's notifications. This "other" channel will probably become a placeholder for most of the notifications until they are organized into suitable channels. A few new prompts I normally skip changes that are meant to advertise existing features, but sometimes the focus of banners and notifications can give a little insight into the features and apps that may not be performing as well as expected or simply need user awareness. The latest Maps update includes three new promos. The first banner is for the Google Trips app. Launched around this time last year, Trips is basically an itinerary management app that's also intended for making local recommendations. Trips probably doesn't have a very substantial user base yet, so it's not hard to imagine why Google is trying to breathe a little more life into it. code <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_TITLE">Take your travel info with you</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_TITLE_WITH_AREA_NAME">Take your %1$s travel info with you</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_BODY">Reservations • Things to do • Day plans</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_DOWNLOAD_LINK">Get Google Trips app</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_DISMISS_LINK">No thanks</string> The next addition is intended to get users to try out the recently launched location sharing feature. It's pretty normal to show prompts to get users only newly released features, so there's nothing unusual about this one, but you can probably expect to see it in your navigation setup soon. code <string name="CAR_TI TLE_JOURNEY_SHARING">Share journey</string> <string name="JOURNEY_SHARING_PENDING_PROMPT_TEXT">Share your trip with %1$s</string> <string name="JOURNEY_SHARING_PENDING_PROMPT_TTS">Sharing your real-time location with %1$s until you arrive.</string> <string name="CAR_MENU_START_JOURNEY_SHARING">Share journey</string> <string name="CAR_MENU_STOP_JOURNEY_SHARING">Stop sharing</string> The final promotional banner will belong to the always familiar Local Guides program. As usual, it's going to encourage users to contribute to Maps for points. The one interesting oddity is that these strings have "v2" in their names. It's possible this just means they are for a new set of promos, or this might hint at a revised version of the points program. I would expect the former, but it's at least worth acknowledging the latter is possible. code <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_TITLE">Reach new Local Guides levels</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_TEXT">Now earn more points for your reviews, photos, edits, and adding new places.</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_GOTO_STATS">SEE YOUR LEVEL</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_OPEN_HELP">Learn more</string> A task list called "Nearby Need?" There's very little to go on for this topic, but it looks just weird enough that I suspect there's a feature brewing in there somewhere. A pair of new layouts were added with the name "nearby need," one of which defines the look of a list, and the other is for items in that list. There is also a single string with a related name and just the word "navigate" for text. <string name="NEARBY_NEED_NAVIGATE">Navigate</string> /layout/nearby_need_item.xml /layout/nearby_need.xml Based on this very limited amount of information, it does sound a little like a shopping list of sorts. Perhaps less like a grocery list and more like a list of chores or tasks – e.g. getting new tires on the car, picking up some materials for a weekend project, and buying new clothes. I would assume each item goes into a list and Google Maps will make it easy to navigate to the next nearest place where each of these things can be taken care of. I'm not actually sure if these are related, but there are also three new images to be found in the resources, and they certainly would fit with my theory. The first is for creating new tasks, the second is for completed tasks, and the final one is for "old" completed tasks. I suppose the old one might be for things a user did on previous days but hasn't removed from the list. This is all guesswork right now, but many people have been asking for ways to use Maps to get through chores, and this feels like the first hint of something like that. The one aspect that's not yet hinted at, but I certainly hope to see, is a feature that will sort tasks efficiently so people can choose the shortest (or fastest) route to get everything done. I'll keep watching and follow up when there are more developments.

They are used when you go to Your Contributions -> Check the Facts/Uncover Missing info. I think after all this time those two are still only for lvl 5 local guides... so yeah. Cody Toombs Right, the look of the images aren't new, but the files containing those images are. Or said more clearly, there are now multiple copies of those icons. mmark27 I sure would like there to be a "Work" and then a "Parking for Work" section for those that don't park right next to their office. Point being, if I want walking direction/estimations, give them from my office. If I want driving directions/estimations on time, know that I have to walk to my car, then drive from my parking location. The School addition will be good to finally have pop up automatically now though. Cody Toombs If you're not going to use all four slots for their intended purpose, you might just assign one of the others to be your work parking. Frankly, I would have liked these saved slots to have custom labels, since some people don't fit into this one shape. For example, I know somebody that has to travel to two different sites for the same job, and another friend that was enrolled in two different schools at the same time. It's not like one of these destinations can't go into the "Gym" slot, but it would be nice if the titles could make sense. mmark27 Right. I now have my "Work" location saved as my parking lot, which is silly, but it's the only way to get decent estimations. Your fix is what I'll be doing otherwise unless they fix it. The subtly though in this situation is El Goog knowing that the Work and Work Parking are linked existentially, so they can decipher where my body is and estimate from there, etc. Same can be said for Home and Home Parking if not directly on site. Would seem like Google's apartment-city-dwelling-first mentality would be more amenable to this off the bat. I agree that we should be able to have free labels on places and also as many places as we can stomach estimations/notifications on time to. Google knows where I am at all times....make it actually useful, guys. henleyb I work from home and Google would keep asking me to set my work address which is of course the same as my home address, it was a small but annoying thing. :) Austin Spangrud Sure would be nice if maps got integrated assistant into it. None of the commands and home commands that I have integrate with the Voice button in maps. Oh and In b4 where's my speed limit pop up Cody Toombs Speed limits are still limited geographically. Since I was in the Bay Area last week, I finally saw them pop up for the first time on my phone and in Android Auto. Funny enough, I now have a Speed Limit toggle in settings on one phone, but nowhere else :/ And now I'm probably not going to see the speed limits again for a long time. Paul_Werner Yeah and we used to have them and they disappeared. At least it did for me here in the Milwaukee, WI area. Same for when I travel to Chicago Nicholas Matranga Finally, it was so annoying to have to save my school address as my work address just to get commute updates. mike shwilly Grow up Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez Finally, Im glad that we can save more pinned-saved choices other than the usual Home and Work, although I would prefer to customize them on my own in the same manner we customize the saved list. I could make a really good use of few in my mind like Church, Work2, University, etc. Jon Xuereb Couldn't you use this school one for University Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez I used the word University just an example, the point is that it would be great to customize those pinned saves using our own creations. Paul_Werner I can't wait to see that "nearby need" implemented. Your guesswork on it sounds like it could be a really useful feature. h4rr4r Why are these static names? Why can't I add random strings and assign them saved locations? Ken Vincent what ever happened to speed limits? I thought that was on the verge of being a thing more then a year ago. UKTK8 "In the coming weeks" Meaning whenever Google d#$% well pleases. Jon Xuereb Lawyers I'm assuming dmo580 Yet Waze and other GPS apps have no issues. How about just displaying my current speed? Ken Vincent Not only that, but google provides speed limits as a service. I would imagine that is where Waze gets their speed limit info. https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/roads/speed-limits Jon Xuereb Because Google Maps is exponentially larger in terms of user base, and google is a bigger target for lawsuits Ken Vincent Waze is wholly owned by Google. They are not even an Alphabet company, they are Google. Jon Xuereb Still the size of the userbase affects the their risk assessment icyhotmike why not just let us add "Saved" locations such as Home and Work and whatever else we want? Damn Google in control of everything. makapav My God the Google apps and ecosystem are becoming such a clusterfuck with no sources of truth for data points. All the information is spread across random places. Richard Oldroyd I do use home a lot but for the others like gym I save as a contact and nav just as quick. Richard Oldroyd I'd love maps to display my current speed and advise what the speed limit is. Obviously they would have to add a warning saying they can not be held responsible for displaying an incorrect speed limit. I'd also like to see us be able to choose what is displayed underneath where they show destination time and miles to go, it would be useful to see arrival times at all stops not just the one you are currently naving to.

Close May 25, 2017 Last September, we reported on a study showing that consumers would be interested in vehicles made by tech firms like Apple and Google. The gist was that decades-old car companies like Ford, General Motors, and Toyota could soon face stiff competition from auto industry newbies. Now, there's another study to discuss, and if its findings are accurate, legacy manufacturers could sleep slightly easier. It shows that, while shoppers may be excited about cars from Google and Apple, they have doubts about self-driving vehicles made by ride-sharing companies like Uber and Lyft. Methods and findings The study in question was the Connected & Autonomous Vehicle Consumer Survey, and it was conducted by INRIX, one of the world's largest transportation research firms. The company polled 5,054 drivers in the U.S., the U.K., Germany, France, and Italy to gauge their feelings about connected and self-driving cars. Here are some of the study's biggest takeaways: Safety When Americans were asked whether autonomous vehicles would be as safe or safer than conventional cars, a whopping 71 percent said yes. The notable exception? Baby Boomers, 73 percent of whom said no, self-driving cars won't be any safer.  In Europe, the responses were similar. In fact, in Italy, some 85 percent of respondents said that autonomous vehicles will be at least as safe as today's cars, if not safer. The U.K. was something of an outlier, with nearly 40 percent of respondents there saying that self-driving cars will be less safe.  Manufacturers When asked which sorts of companies they trust most to build autonomous vehicles, 27 percent of Americans said they preferred tech giants like Apple and Google. Traditional automakers trailed slightly at 23 percent. Just four percent of respondents put their faith in ridesharing firms like Uber. Europeans had a different response: on average, nearly three times as many said they'd trust traditional automakers over tech firms when it came to self-driving cars. The one thing that was consistent, though, was a general lack of trust in ride-sharing companies, which hovered around four percent.  Privacy That same U.S./European split was reflected in respondents feelings about privacy concerns. In the U.S., consumers were 1.4 times more likely to trust tech giants with their data than legacy automakers. Europeans, on the other hand, tended to trust car companies with their data--though it's worth noting that 34 percent said that they didn't trust anyone on that front. More important than nationality, however, was age: younger consumers (i.e. Gen Xers and Millennials) in all countries were more likely to put their faith in tech firms. Those of Boomer age and older preferred to trust car companies. Autonomous features When it came to autonomous features (as opposed to fully autonomous vehicles), respondents were generally more excited. On both sides of the Atlantic, 80 percent or more of those polled were either interested in or already using technology like rear and front collision alerts, blind-spot warnings, automatic braking, blind-spot warnings, and road condition alerts.  More than 70 percent of respondents said that they'd be interested in paying for or having as standard equipment a wide range of features dedicated to safety (e.g. automatic braking), driver assistance (e.g. concierge services), navigation, vehicle management, and driver well-being (e.g drowsiness alerts). Fewer said that they'd be willing to shell out for infotainment services (e.g. Apple CarPlay or Android Auto) Page 1 of 2 1 2 Next > Tags: Autonomous cars Lyft self-driving cars Study surveys Uber Waymo News 2017 The Car Connection See the winners » 2017 The Car Connection See The Winner and Nominees » Recommended Galleries 2018 Honda Odyssey boasts premium pricing, lots of amenities 2018 Subaru Forester turns out lights with new Black Edition Teaching the classics: how young drivers are discovering manuals 2017 Chrysler Pacifica Limited long-term test: not just a passenger hauler People who read this also read 2018 Ford Expedition, 2017 Aston Martin DB11, US sues FCA...

Russian Hackers Are Using Google's Own Infrastructure to Hack Gmail Users Security researchers have exposed a sophisticated hacking and disinformation campaign that targeted more than 200 Gmail users. Russian government hackers seem to have figured out that sometimes the best way to hack into people's Gmail accounts is be to abuse Google's own services. On Thursday, researchers exposed a massive Russian espionage and disinformation campaign using emails designed to trick users into giving up their passwords, a technique that's known as phishing. The hackers targeted more than 200 victims, including, among others, journalists and activists critical of the Russian government, as well as people affiliated with the Ukrainian military, and high-ranking officials in energy companies around the world, according to a new report. Read more: Would You Click on These Fake Gmail Alerts? Researchers at the Citizen Lab, a digital rights research group at the University of Toronto's Munk School of Global Affairs, were able to identify all these victims following clues left in two phishing emails sent to David Satter, an American journalist and academic who's written Soviet and modern Russia, and who has been banned from the country in 2014. On October 7, Satter received a phishing email designed to look like it was coming from Google, claiming someone had stolen his password and that he should change it right away. As with seen with other phishing attacks targeting people affiliated with the Hillary Clinton campaign that led to the DNC leaks of last year, the email, however, didn't come from Google. It was actually from a group of hackers known as Fancy Bear, or APT28, whom many believe work for Russia's military intelligence, the GRU. A screenshot of the phishing email received by David Satter (Image: Citizen Lab) The "Change Password" button linked to a short URL from the Tiny.cc link shortener service, a Bitly competitor. But the hackers cleverly disguised it as a legitimate link by using Google's Accelerated Mobile Pages, or AMP. This is a service hosted by the internet giant that was originally designed to speed up web pages on mobile, especially for publishers. In practice, it works by creating a copy of a website's page on Google's servers, but it also acts as an open redirect. According to Citizen Lab researchers, the hackers used Google AMP to trick the targets into thinking the email really came from Google. "It's a percentage game, you may not get every person you phish but you'll get a percentage," John Scott-Railton, a senior researcher at Citizen Lab, told Motherboard. So if the victim had quickly hovered over the button to inspect the link, they would have seen a URL that starts with google.com/amp, which seems safe, and it's followed by a Tiny.cc URL, which the user might not have noticed. (For example: https://www.google[.]com/amp/tiny.cc/63q6iy) Using Google's own redirect service was also perhaps also a way to get the phishing email past Gmail's automated filters against spam and malicious messages. "It's a percentage game, you may not get every person you phish but you'll get a percentage." According to Citizen Lab, who doesn't directly point the finger at Fancy Bear, the email was actually sent by annaablony[@]mail.com. That address was used in 2015 by Fancy Bear to register a domain, according to security firm ThreatConnect. And another domain used in the October attacks exposed by Citizen Lab was also previously linked to Fancy Bear, according to SecureWorks, which tracked the phishing campaign against the DNC and the Clinton campaign. Curiously, the email targeting Satter came just a few days before Google warned some Russian journalists and activists that "government-backed attackers" were trying to hack them using malicious Tiny.cc links. A screenshot of a phishing email received by a Bellingcat journalist in October Now we know that in October of 2016, when the hackers targeted Satter and at least 200 other people, the trick of using Google AMP was working, and Google hadn't blocked it. Google has previously dismissed concerns about open redirectors, arguing that "a small number of properly monitored redirectors offers fairly clear benefits and poses very little practical risk." On Thursday, a company spokesperson said that this is a known issue and last year some Google AMP URLs started showing a warning if the company's systems are uncertain whether the link is safe to visit, such as this. But for some security researchers, they are dangerous. "The AMP service's behavior as an open redirect for desktop browsers was clearly abused in this situation and is also just trivial to abuse in general," Nicholas Weaver, a senior researcher at the International Computer Science Institute at UC Berkeley, told Motherboard in an email. "There is undoubtedly some engineering tradeoff I'm not seeing that causes them to maintain it." Google's redirectors might not be the only part of Google's infrastructure that Fancy Bear hackers have been taking advantage of. Citizen Lab researchers found a Tiny.cc URL that targeted an email address—myprimaryreger[@]gmail.com—that other security researchers suspect was used by Fancy Bear to test their own attacks. A screenshot of the Google Plus page of "myprimaryreger[@]gmail.com," an account researchers believe was controlled by Fancy Bear (Image: Citizen Lab). That address had a Google Plus page filled with images that appear in real, legitimate Gmail security alerts. It's unclear what the hackers used these for, or if they used them at all. But the researchers said that perhaps the hackers were embedding them in phishing emails, and the fact that they were hosted on Google Plus perhaps helped thwart Gmail's security controls. The Fancy Bear hackers are known to use popular services like URL shorteners in their high-profile hacking operations. And, sometimes, those URL shorteners betray them and end up revealing who they targeted. Between March 2015 and May 2016, as part of their operation to hack Clinton's campaign chairman John Podesta, and former National Security Advisor Colin Powell, the hackers targeted more than 6,000 people with more than 19,000 phishing links. Some of those used Bitly URLs that, as it turned out, could be decoded to figure out who they were intended to. An analysis of the Bitly link used to phish John Podesta (Image: Thomas Rid/Twitter) Similarly, in this case Citizen Lab researchers were able to identify the victims by figuring out that there was a pattern behind how Tiny.cc creates short URLs. That pattern, as research fellow Adam Hulcoop explained to me, "was chronological." So, starting from the links sent to Satter, the researchers were able to guess other links created around the same time. It's impossible to know why the hackers keep relying on services like Bitly or Tiny.cc, which end up exposing some of their operations—although months later. One explanation could be that their phishing campaigns are highly automated, given that they target thousands of people. So, as Hulcoop put it, they need a modular phishing infrastructure where every element can be modified if needed, as "an insurance policy of sorts" and they use third party services "to try and balance the need for OpSec [operational security, or the practice of keeping operations secret] with the ability to operate at scale." "The construction of the Tiny.cc shortcodes pointing to TinyURL shortcodes, which ultimately point to phishing sites on different servers. This modularity is likely by design so that the operator can change up the individual components, servers, redirectors, etc., and only abandon the pieces that are burned," he said in an online chat. "The more layers you have, the more flexible you can be." Subscribe to Science Solved It, Motherboard's new show about the greatest mysteries that were solved by science.

Next: All PayPal accounts were 1 click away from hijacking by Lisa Vaas 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Remember back in 2013, when Ticketmaster – the world’s largest online ticket retailer – decided to stop torturing people’s eyeballs by making them decipher blobs of melted characters in order to prove that they’re human? Likewise, Google’s now too stabbing a fork into CAPTCHA, the aggravating test that’s supposed to determine if we’re robots or scripts used by spammers or other online misdeed-doers, or if we are instead real, live, warm-blooded simians. CAPTCHA came out of Carnegie Mellon University and stands for “Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart”. The tests are designed to be hard for robots, easy for humans. They typically consist of typing letters and/or digits from a distorted image. Or, as the case may be, messages to go pleasure yourself. Or, then again, mathematical problems that make your brain bleed. Ten years into using CAPTCHA to keep robots from engaging in dirty tricks online, the “supposed to weed out bots” has now turned into “utterly stink at weeding out bots”. That’s because advances in Artificial Intelligence have resulted in robot creations that are now able to solve even the most difficult variant of distorted text with 99.8% accuracy, according to Google’s recent research. Not that Google’s going to stop testing site visitors to weed out bots, mind you. Rather, as it announced on Wednesday, Google’s going to move away from asking users to read blobby text and type it into a box, as it’s been doing, like this:  And instead will simply ask us, “Are you a robot?” with what it’s calling the “No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA” API, like so: Asking us to check off a box saying that “I am not a robot” will be an effective way of determining whether or not we’re robots because humans move their cursors in a humanlike way. Specifically, the difference between bot and human can be revealed in clues as subtle as how a user (or a bot) moves a mouse in the brief moments before clicking the “I am not a robot” button, according to Vinay Shet, the product manager for Google’s Captcha team. Without realizing it, humans also drop clues that can establish whether we’re automated or not: IP addresses and cookies show our movements elsewhere on the Web and can help prove that we’re not a bad actor. Wired quotes Shet: All of this gives us a model of how a human behaves It's a whole bag of cues that make this hard to spoof for a bot. He said that there are other variables that will help make the determination, but those have to be kept secret, lest botmasters figure out how to work around them and once again learn how to slip past Google’s filters. Google’s been integrating automated bot-detection into its CAPTCHAs since at least 2013. In October 2013, Google revealed that it had developed what it called its Advanced Risk Analysis backend for reCAPTCHA to filter out bots. The backend doesn’t just look at whatever gobbledygook we type into the box. Rather, it observes our entire engagement with a CAPTCHA, from start to finish – before, during, and after we type into the box – to determine whether we’re carbon-based. On Valentine’s Day, Google gave us a taste of what reCAPTCHA can do, presenting us with chocolates and flowers and throbbing hearts – the first two of which were rendered in text that was simple (for humans) to read. It sounds great, but it’s not yet time to kiss the inscrutably distorted CAPTCHA blobs goodbye. Over the past week, Google’s tests on sites that use CAPTCHA have verified most humans, but it still missed quite a few. As Wired reports, about 60% of WordPress users and 80% of users at video game sales site Humble Bundle got past the CAPTCHA with only the simple checkbox. When Google’s Advanced Risk Analysis engine can’t figure out what we are with a mere click, it’s going to back up the test with a pop-up window that will present users with the same old distorted text we’ve been enduring for years. For mobile users, things haven’t gotten quite so simple as a single click. But when they face a CAPTCHA on their mobile phone or tablet, they’ll now have a much easier hurdle to leap: rather than having to type in text, they’ll be asked to select all the images that correspond with a clue image. Like Google says, it’s a lot easier to tap photos of cats or turkeys than to type in a line of text on a phone: And if you’re worried about the privacy implications of Google analyzing where your mouse moves on a page, Shet pointed out that Google will only be tracking your movements over the CAPTCHA widget when it appears on other sites, not on the entire page. This is how he put it to Wired: You don’t have to verify your identity to verify your humanity. Besides, as we’ve noted before, tracking movement is not just a Google thing. Facebook, Twitter, Gmail or any webpage can track everything you do and could be keylogging your every pointer movement or keystroke. Logging keystrokes is no super secret, privacy-sucking vampire sauce. It’s plain old Web 1.0. This is not news, but it’s certainly worth repeating: anybody with a website can capture what you type, as you type it, if they want to. The reality is that JavaScript, the language that makes this kind of monitoring possible, is both powerful and ubiquitous. It’s a fully featured programming language that can be embedded in web pages, and all browsers support it. It’s been around almost since the beginning of the web, and the web would be hurting without it, given the things it makes happen. Among the many features of the language are the abilities to track the position of your cursor, track your keystrokes and call “home” without refreshing the page or making any kind of visual display. Those aren’t intrinsically bad things. In fact, they’re enormously useful. Without those sort of capabilities sites like Facebook and Gmail would be almost unusable, searches wouldn’t auto-suggest and Google Docs wouldn’t save our bacon in the background. In the case of Google’s advances with reCAPTCHA, such an ability can stop a lot of bad bots from doing things that can be worse than the annoyance of having to endure typing in text from a blobby image. Think bots that harvest email addresses from contact or guestbook pages, site scrapers that grab the content of websites and re-use it without permission on automatically generated doorway pages, bots that take part in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, and more. I’ll take the kittens, please!

In the era where the mouse is becoming obsolete Google are going to rely on user mouse movements or clicks to define whether a person is human or not. There are some pretty big gaming communities that have been scripting human like mouse behavior for years. It’ll be interesting to see how this progresses.

Reply Paul Ducklin says: September 9, 2016 at 5:40 pm I thought a hamburger was called “a hamburger” in the US :-) By definition, of course, even in British English, a hamburger *is* a sandwich. At any rate, there seems to be no suggestion in any of the Oxford lexicons (British or American) that sandwiches can’t be circular. Two pieces of bread with an edible filling in between is all you need to pass the test. I guess the CAPTCHA folks were hoping a robot wouldn’t be able to handle the subtleties… Having said that, if you tried to order a hamburger by asking for “a sandwich” in Maccas, I think you would get, errrrrrrr, either a sandwich, served in the form of a square cut into two triangle, or a word from the security guard (depending on how strongly you argued the case, and whether it was after 1am).

I hate reCAPTCHA nevertheless. It’s based on assumptions that don’t work for the privacy and security conscious among us. First it’s embedded in an iframe. Something my content blocker will block by default. Second it’s heavily using scripts. Well, guess what … I have found myself solving more than half a dozen of these without being let in. And worse yet, when I resorted to solving the audio version there was a text that essentially told me I was a bot. Why thank you. So these CAPTCHAs literally fail at the one thing they are meant to achieve: tell computer and human apart. Wow. Just wow. Oh and the fact that many of these images where you have to guess are specific to the culture where they are taken doesn’t it make easier. Are traffic signs also street signs? Maybe in your native tongue they are, maybe they aren’t. Are churches buildings? According to reCAPTCHA not so much. Is this a lake or a river? How the heck am I supposed to know if you show me just one shoreline? Reply john says: April 12, 2017 at 7:00 am Craigslist, every single time. But somehow the bots took over the personals posting ads with absolutely no problem, and it’s impossible to flag those ads away. But then again, it is craigslist! Reply De'La Montana (@DeLaMontanafu) says: May 3, 2017 at 4:54 pm I would rather pay full price at the store than Search Craigslist and have to jump though those childish puzzles… Never again. I dont know what on earth they were thinking. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

 A new feature on Google Photos lets you hide the pictures you don't want people to see Avery Hartmans May 26, 2017, 10:41 AM 16,191 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google Photos is a great photo app, but it can save every photo you take — which isn't always a good thing. Google Google Photos users know the blessing and curse of the app's automatic backup feature.  One the one hand, it's a pain-free way of ensuring your photos have a more permanent home in the Google Cloud in case something should happen to your phone. On the other hand, it can be an embarrassing reminder of the silly selfie you took, text message conversation you screenshotted, or risqué picture you sent late at night. Most of us have experienced the mortifying moment of opening Google Photos on your desktop and seeing those images pop up in your feed.  Now, Google is rolling out a new feature that can help.  Called Archive, the feature is now available for both Android and iOS users as well as the desktop version of Google Photos, but was first spotted by 9to5 Google a few days ago. It's super-simple to use, and may make your life a lot easier.  For the pictures you want to save but don't necessarily want others to see, all you have to do is select them in your Google Photos app. Once they're selected, press the menu button on the upper right-hand side of the screen, and a button that says "Archive" will pop up at the bottom of the screen.  Google The photos will immediately disappear from your main feed, but they won't be permanently deleted. If you ever want to access them, go to the main menu button in Google Photos on the upper left-hand side of the screen, and you'll see a menu item that says Archive. Click on it, and all your photos will show up organized by date.  Google 9to5 Google notes that the photos will still appear in albums and show up in search results within the app, so the only way to avoid anyone seeing the photos is to delete them from the app for good — or never take them in the first place.

In terms of flow, ease of use, and intuitiveness, this is hands-down the best interface out of the ones we tested, it's also the only choice if you're full invested in the iTunes ecosystem, as media purchased there can't be played on non-Apple devices.</p><p>Part of tvOS's success as an interface is due to the Touch Remote that comes with any tvOS device. Swiping and tapping and gesturing on it feels just right. The little touches Apple has added-the animations as you move around, the movie-quality screensavers-all help as well. It's the kind of interface you just want to sit and play with.</p><p class="ad-promotions-container js_ad-promotion row ad-wide ad-top js_ad-promotion-mobile" data-mobile="true"><p class="ad-unit js_ad-unit ad-mobile ad-promotion js_ad-promotion"><p id="ad-container-85348306" class="ad-container js_ad-container js_ad-container-top" data-zone-type="MOBILE_PERMALINK_NATIVE"></p></p></p><p class="taboola-mobile-second hide-contents ad-mobile"><p class="ad-mobile-inner"><p class="ad-label proxima"><small class=" proxima">Sponsored</small></p><p class="taboola-mobile-article-carousel" id="taboola-mobile-article-carousel"></p><p class="ad-label-bottom"></p></p></p><p>It helps that there's stuff to do. While Apple was slow to embrace apps on the set top box, it's taken no time to build a strong bench of apps you're familiar with. Though tvOS is still missing some big names, including Spotify.

By Zack Whittaker for Zero Day | May 26, 2017 -- 15:00 GMT (08:00 PDT) | Topic: Security (Image: CNET/CBS Interactive) Ask almost any security expert, and they'll tell you switching on "unknown sources" on your Android phone or tablet is one of the worst things you can do for device security. But that's exactly what Amazon has asked its app store customers to do for years. Amazon won't say if Echo has been wiretapped Its transparency reports only includes data demands to its cloud-stored data. Read More The heart of the problem is Amazon's requirement to allow installations from "unknown sources" -- that is, any app or game that hasn't been carefully vetted by the Google Play app store. That's because while almost all of Amazon's apps are already in Google Play, the retail giant's own third-party app store, dubbed Underground, isn't allowed. Opening your Android phone or tablet up to apps and games outside Google's protective walled garden also makes your device infinitely more vulnerable to malware. And that's no secret. We're not even the only ones to notice it -- some noted the security issue back in 2015 when Amazon Underground first launched. When asked to comment, an Amazon spokesperson confirmed that Underground had since been installed on "millions" of Android devices. That's in part because some of Amazon's own apps for Android are only available through Amazon Underground, such as Amazon Prime Video -- the company's competitor to Netflix. The spokesperson added that "customers should take care only to download content from sources they trust, like Amazon." But it's not Amazon's app store that's the problem -- it's the giant hole you have to punch in Android's security to get it installed in the first place. (Screenshots: ZDNet/CBS Interactive) We spoke to several prominent security researchers and experts, and they all agreed that opening up "unknown sources" is a bad move for security. Joshua Drake, VP of Platform Research and Exploitation at Zimperium, who was credited with finding the Stagefright bug that affected millions of Android users, said that installing apps from unknown sources is "a significant source of malware in the Android ecosystem." Andrew Blaich, a security researcher at Lookout, agreed. He said: "By allowing unknown sources, a user is removing the first line of defense in stopping themselves from installing a malicious app that can be delivered from a number of sources, including malicious website links, phishing attempts and others of which we've seen happen in targeted attacks like ViperRat and other broader non-targeted attacks." Chester Wisniewski, principal research scientist at cybersecurity firm Sophos, said in an email: "There are a lot of nasty Android apps out there and only downloading apps from official sources is key to a safe mobile computing experience," he added. We could go on and on -- but you get the idea. The battle for access to app stores isn't new. Because mobile device and software makers like Apple and Google get to dictate the terms to who can and can't access their platforms, competitors like Amazon will resort to begging their customers to essentially forego some security for access to its own app store. And while Android has always been the more open platform for apps and games compared to iPhones and iPads, which have built a reputation for security thanks to Apple's strict app store requirements and code checking, that is soon set to change. Drake added in his email that Google's upcoming Android O will allow third-party app stores without requiring blanket access to the whole phone, effectively making it harder for malware to install. When reached, Google wouldn't comment on the record. Amazon's app store currently has 800,000 free apps, thanks to the company's incentive to developers to submit their apps. The company said last month that though it's shutting down its namesake developer program, which allows the millions of Amazon Underground users to download apps and games for free, the app store itself is "not going away" any time soon. Given the security risks, your best bet is to uninstall the app -- pronto -- and switch off "unknown sources." Anything else is putting you at risk.

Language Gap For Travelers Advertising Doc Portrait PDF Landscape PDF Doc EMail Share Facebook LinkedIn Twitter Available to Premium & Purple Members A new feature will eliminate the need for using Google Translate or a phrasebook to read reviews in a foreign language Lauren Kirkwood 25 may 2017 A new Google feature aims to make life easier for travelers navigating countries in which they’re not familiar with the language. The next time you’re in Rome or Madrid and want to know if a local restaurant is worth a visit, simply open up Google Maps or Google Search, find the eatery’s profile and read the reviews—which will be automatically translated into your native tongue from the foreign language in which they were originally written. The feature eliminates the need to copy and paste reviews into Google Translate or a third-party app, allowing eager sightseers to get on with their vacation with less hassle.

Taiwo Kola-Ogunlade, Google’s Communications and Public Affairs Manager for Anglophone West Africa made this known in a statement in Lagos on Thursday. He said that in the week under review, terms ranging from the passing of State House correspondent for Channels TV Chukwuma Onuekwusi, and two other issues captured Nigerians attention. He listed the remaining two as the recent passing of Sir Roger Moore (James Bond – 007) and Henry Onyekuru’s possible move to Arsenal also trended on Google Nigeria search. He said that the Acting President, Prof. Yemi Osinbajo had expressed sadness over the news of the death of Chukwuma Onuekwusi, the Channels TV State House Correspondent. He said that the presidential spokesman, Mr Laolu Akande on Tuesday extended Mr. Osinbajo heartfelt condolences to the Onuekwusi family as well as Channels TV family on the sad passing of Onuekwusi. He said the Chairman of State House Press Corps, Ubale Musa, announced that Mr. Onuekusi died on Tuesday, May 23 at a private clinic in Abuja after battling an undisclosed illness. `|Google searches included: ‘chukwuma onuekwusi dead’, ‘chukwuma onuekwusi cause of death’, ‘state correspondent dead’ and ‘chukwuma onuekwusi’,” Mr. Kola-Ogunlade said. He said Ariana Grande fans were shocked by the recent Manchester bomb attack at her concert. The Google Manager said at least 22 people, including children, were reported dead and 59 injured in an explosion outside an Ariana Grande concert in Manchester, England on May 22 at approximately 10 p.m. According to him, many people around the world took to social media and other online platforms to show solidarity with the victims of what is seen as a terror attack. Mr. Kola-Ogunlade said Nigerians searched Google using search terms such as, ‘Manchester attack’, ‘ariana grande Manchester attack’, ‘Manchester bomb attack’ and ‘ariana grande Manchester’. He said more so, British actor, Roger Moore, who played super spy James Bond in the 007 movie franchise for over two decades, died from cancer on Tuesday, May 23, aged 89. He said that in a statement published on Twitter by his children had written: ”It is with a heavy heart that we must announce our loving father, Sir Roger Moore, has passed away today in Switzerland after a short but brave battle with cancer.” Mr. Kola-Ogunlade said fans of James Bond searched for: ‘roger moore dead’, ‘sir roger moore’, ‘sean connery’ and ‘james bond’. He said another issue that trended on Google search was Arsenal’s ‘open talks’ to sign Belgian football top-scorer Onyekuru for 6.8million pounds. He said the 19-year-old Nigerian had scored 20 goals this season and had attracted the attention of a number of clubs as a result. According to him, Everton, Southampton and West Brom are all believed to be interested in signing Onyekuru, and now Sky Sports is reporting that Arsenal has joined the race. “The clinical striker has a £6.8million release clause in his contract and has already turned down offers to stay in the Belgian league with Brugge and Anderlecht. “Nigerian soccer fans searched Google using search terms ‘arsenal transfer new’, ‘Henry Onyekuru youtube’, ‘arsenal news’, ” he said. Google Trends, launched in May, 2006, allows the public to see how popular search terms and their demography have been overtime on Google.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Reviews Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Microsoft’s Windows 10 S isn’t taking down Chromebooks just yet It's the hardware stupid -9 by Michael Allison  @al_ikw May 26, 2017 at 14:24 GMT16 hours ago Microsoft earlier revealed plans for yet another low-end optimised, sleek version of Windows 10 in order to take on ChromeOS. This isn’t the first version of Windows to take on Chromebooks, and it probably won’t be the last. Microsoft is also working on channelling Windows 10 Pro for ARM devices, so hardware manufacturers can make use of cheaper Qualcomm SOCs for their devices. Pundits, columnists and Windows 10 fans alike have declared that this will be Microsoft’s Chromebook killer. It’s not an unreasonable idea mind you, Microsoft’s Windows is undeniably more robust than Google’s Chrome OS by design, with the former being aimed at power users, and the latter being aimed at those who need just the bare essentials. Windows 10 S takes that robustness, adds a larger* library of native apps, easier manageability for educational users, and more.  Windows 10 S has an uphill climb to make, in schools, it’ll need to overcome the 50% and growing dominance Google has. Outside schools? It has another problem. Simply put, its the hardware. Let’s be honest, ChromeOS can take on Windows 10 in ways that matter to general consumers. Most people’s computer usage can be boiled down to Microsoft Office, Email, and browsing the web with perhaps some Spotify. Chromebooks often offer all this in a nicer package than can their Windows counterparts. If a user wants more power, OEMs like Acer, Dell and HP will provide more powerful, beautiful Chromebooks for less than their Windows 10 counterparts. Take, for instance, Acer’s Chromebook 14 (2016) and Acer’s Swift 3 (2016). Both laptops offer a premium looking design, with a 14inch FullHD screen, full metal design, nice and wide trackpad and RAM from 4GB to 8GB. The Windows version of this will set you back about £600 – give or take depending on the store, the Chromebook? £279 for the 4GB of RAM version up to £400ish for the same specs as the Windows version. For any user whose most used PC app is Microsoft’s Edge or Google’s Chrome, the choice is clear. Similarly, If I look at the wider Windows 10 PC Market for an equivalent laptop, I’m met with cheap plastic laptops, with crappy battery and low-resolution displays. HP has come the closest with its Stream 14 ultraportable laptop, but performance, low-storage (for a Windows PC), and a poor display drag it down.  In the same manner, newly announced Windows 10 S PCs for the low-end aren’t anything special. They are more of the same type of cheap PCs that look like they fell out of the ugly tree and hit every stick on the way down. If Microsoft’s Windows 10 S doesn’t take off – like Windows 8 RT, Windows 8.1 with Bing, and Acer’s attempts at cloudbooks years ago, no one will proffer up reasons why they believe it didn’t do well, because they won’t really care.  An offhand remark in some thinkpiece somewhere might blame low sales or the Windows Store, but no one will really care. Windows 10 S’s Raison D’etre is lower priced, secure, streamlined PCs, in the end, it’ll be the hardware that it ships with that’ll be most important. Microsoft’s Windows 10 S is a powerful OS that can do a lot. The problem is, so is Google’s ChromeOS.In a market where PC sales are tanking, Chromebook sales continue to rise with manufacturers now making new and unique hardware for it. In contrast, Windows 10 S’s hardware choices for the low-end aren’t as good as the equivalent Chromebook versions, and that’s disappointing. Microsoft’s Surface Laptop might be an excellent laptop but its price removes it from consideration for many, and with the lower end lacking any desirable laptop Google’s Chromebooks still have an advantage. *Chromebooks will gain the ability to fully run Android apps in a desktop environment with freeform Windows this summer, removing the software library advantage.  Some links in the article may not be viewable as you are using an AdBlocker.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement HTC Link is a smartphone-based VR headset with 6 degrees of freedom (for HTC U11… in Japan) 05/25/2017 at 5:00 PM by Brad Linder Leave a Comment HTC makes smartphones. And HTC makes virtual reality systems. So you might think it would make sense for the company would develop its own phone-based VR headset to compete with Samsung’s Gear VR and Google’s Daydream View. And you’d be right, because HTC just introduced one. The new HTC Link headset is also one of the first phone-based VR headsets to support 6 degrees of freedom motion tracking, although that’s a feature that should be coming to upcoming Google Daydream devices (including one from HTC). But there are two reasons you might not actually be able to get your hands on an HTC Link anytime soon. First, the headset only supports a single phone: the recently launched HTC U11. Second, it will only be available in Japan, at least at launch. The HTC Link, which is not being associated with the HTC Vive brand in any way, will also feature a special Ghost In the Shell-themed VR experience, and according to a spec sheet, it seems that the system comes with a set of motion controllers and features a stereoscopic camera. Although it works with an HTC U11 smartphone, the HTC Link VR headset also seems to have its own built-in displays, with two 3.6 inch 1080 x 1200 pixel screens with a 90 Hz refresh rate and a 110 degree field of view. The headset features a 2,800 mAh battery, a USB TYpe-C port, a 3.5mm headphone jack, and the system comes with a set of earbuds.   via UploadVR and MoguraVR     Share this: Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Email Leave a Reply Be the First to Comment!

USA TODAY WUZHEN, China (AP) -- A computer beat China's top player of go, one of the last games machines have yet to master, for a second time Thursday in a competition authorities limited the Chinese public's ability to see. Ke Jie lost despite playing what Google's AlphaGo indicated was the best game any opponent has played against it, said Demis Hassabis, founder of the company that developed the program. AlphaGo defeated Ke, a 19-year-old prodigy, in their first game Tuesday during a forum organized by Google on artificial intelligence in Wuzhen, a town west of Shanghai. They play a final game Saturday. AlphaGo previously defeated European and South Korean champions, surprising players who had expected it to be at least a decade before computers could master the game. Go champion 'speechless' after 2nd loss to machine   Internet users outside China could watch this week's games live but Chinese censors blocked most mainland web users from seeing the Google site carrying the feed. None of China's dozens of video sites carried the live broadcasts but a recording of Tuesday's game was available the following night on one popular site, Youku.com. State media reports on the games have been brief, possibly reflecting Beijing's antipathy toward Google, which closed its China-based search engine in 2010 following a dispute over censorship and computer hacking. Google says 60 million people in China watched online when AlphaGo played South Korea's go champion in March 2016. The official response to the match, a major event for the worlds of go and artificial intelligence, reflects the conflict between the ruling Communist Party's technology ambitions and its insistence on controlling what its public can see, hear and read. The government encourages internet use for business and education but tries to block access to material considered subversive. The possible reason for suppressing coverage while allowing Google to organize the event was unclear. Censorship orders to Chinese media are officially secret and government officials refuse to confirm whether online material is blocked. Chinese Go player Ke Jie reacts as he plays a match against Google's artificial intelligence program, AlphaGo, during the Future of Go Summit in Wuzhen in eastern China's Zhejiang Province.  (Photo: AP) On Thursday, AlphaGo "thought that Ke Jie played perfectly" for the first 50 moves, Hassabis said at a news conference. "For the first roughly 100 moves, it is the closest game we have ever seen anyone play against the master version of AlphaGo," he said. Ke said the computer made unexpected moves after playing more methodically on Tuesday. "From the perspective of human beings, it stretched a little bit and I was surprised at some points," he said. "I also thought that I was very close to winning the match in the middle," Ke said. "I could feel my heart thumping. But maybe because I was too excited, I did some wrong or stupid moves. I guess that's the biggest weak point of human beings." Go players take turns putting white or black stones on a rectangular grid with 361 intersections, trying to capture territory and each other's pieces by surrounding them. The game is considered more difficult than chess for machines to master because the near-infinite number of possible positions requires intuition and flexibility. This week's games are taking place in a hall where Chinese leaders hold the annual World Internet Conference, an event attended by global internet companies. China has the world's biggest population of internet users, with some 730 million people online at the end of last year, according to government data. Censors block access to social media and video-sharing websites such as Facebook and YouTube. Internet companies are required to employ teams of censors to watch social media and remove banned material. Web surfers can get around online filters using virtual private networks, but Beijing has cracked down on use of those.

The feature has rolled out to Portugal, New Zealand, Finland, Belgium, South Africa, and the Netherlands, in addition to the aforementioned two countries. It’s currently unclear when exactly did the Alphabet-owned company expanded its support for promo codes, though the change likely happened at some point this week or it probably would have been caught sooner. The promo codes supported by the Google Play Store allow developers to issue free apps or in-app purchases (IAPs) to individuals and organizations without making any changes to their official listings. The codes can also be used to add funds to a Google Account, at least for the time being, though recent developments indicate that the Mountain View-based tech giant may completely eliminate the option of sending digital funds to other Google Play Store users. Furthermore, one Android user from Bulgaria claims that promo codes for the Google Play Store are also available in Bulgaria, though the Eastern European country currently isn’t listed by Google as being supported. If accurate, the report suggests that the Alphabet-owned company either isn’t updating its Google Play Store help pages in a timely manner or is currently testing the feature in certain countries prior to officially rolling it out. Given its usual development practices, the latter scenario seems more likely, though it remains to be seen whether the company clarifies the situation in any official capacity. As Android is one of Google’s flagship products and the Google Play Store serves as the entry point to nearly three million of Android apps, the Mountain View-based Internet giant is adamant to keep its digital marketplace updated on a regular basis. The Google Play Store is expected to receive a number of new features and tweaks in the coming months, in the run-up to the first stable release of Android O that’s scheduled to happen in the second half of the year, and more details on the matter will likely be available shortly.

Half the price of the Galaxy S8 and just as good, we review the Xiaomi Mi6. The best value flagship phone you can buy today, we review Xiaomi's Mi6 By Marie Brewis | 26 May 17 Specifications 5.15in full-HD (1920x1080, 428ppi) four-sided curved glass MIUI 8.2 (Android 6.0) 2.45GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 octa-core processor 653MHz Adreno 540 GPU 6GB LPDDR4 RAM See full specs Expert's Rating Price when reviewed £381.91 (64GB), £429.65 (128GB), US$479.99 (64GB), $539.99 (128GB) Best prices today Retailer Price Delivery   GearBest £381.91 (64GB), £429.65 (128GB) View Price comparision from , and manufacturers Xiaomi Mi6 review Wow. That’s what comes to mind when you consider Xiaomi’s new flagship Android phone for 2017. The Mi6 is around half the price of more familiar flagships such as the Galaxy S8, LG G6, Sony Xperia XZ Premium and HTC U11, but it’s just as fast, just as beautiful, and just as much a must-have for anyone serious about their smartphone tech. Also see: Best Chinese phones 2017 A clear contender for snatching the crown for best Chinese phone, the successor to the Mi5 and Mi5s takes on design aspects from the Mi Note 2, adds a dual-camera and forward-facing features such as USB-C audio, and tops it all off with faster performance than anything we’ve seen yet. While Samsung’s still debating whether to add a dual-camera or under-glass fingerprint scanner to its Galaxy line, Xiaomi’s already done it. And though it might lack the Quad-HD Infinity Display and curved-glass edges, the Xiaomi has a great screen and is a much more comfortable size to hold in one hand. How to buy the Xiaomi Mi6 in the UK The one drawback of the Xiaomi Mi6 is that, unlike those aforementioned rivals, it’s not available to buy directly from Xiaomi in the UK, nor from any of our major mobile operators. That means you’ll have to import it from China, and pay for the whole thing up front (though you can save some money with a SIM-only deal). The up side of that is you’ll pay nothing like as much for the Xiaomi Mi6 SIM-free as you would a flagship from the likes of Samsung, HTC, Sony and LG. You won’t get much change from £700 for those phones, but with the Mi6 you could almost buy two. It’s incredible to believe Xiaomi is able to offer such a great deal at what is in essence a mid-range price. Our photo black Xiaomi Mi6 is the ‘International’ edition with 6GB of RAM and 64GB of storage. There’s also a version with 128GB storage (neither support expansion via microSD, though few people would find themselves low on space at this capacity) and a ceramic model with the same 18K gold detailing as seen on the revolutionary Mi Mix. It was sent to us to review by GearBest, which is one of many Chinese companies offering to import tech to the UK and elsewhere. Pricing is just £381.91 ($479.99/438.16€) for 64GB and £429.65 ($539.99/492.93€) for 128GB, though you’ll need to also factor into your budget import duty. This is usually calculated at 20 percent of the value printed on the shipping paperwork, plus an admin fee of around £11. The Mi6 should ship between 1 and 3 June 2017, though how long it will take to arrive depends on the shipping option you select (a free service is available). Also see: Best Android phones 2017  We’ve reviewed many a Xiaomi phone sent to us by GearBest, and we’ve never experienced any issues. But we acknowledge that for some customers things can sometimes go wrong, and when they do you need to remember your rights are different when purchasing goods from outside the UK. We’ve outlined some of the things you need to consider in our Chinese tech buying advice. Something else to consider is that different cellular frequencies are used in different countries across the globe, and these Chinese models may not necessarily work in your country of residence. In the UK what we typically see with Xiaomi phones is that they don’t support the 800MHz/Band 20 frequency which is relied on by O2, Giffgaff, Sky Mobile and others for 4G connectivity. These customers will not receive anything faster than 3G connectivity without connecting to Wi-Fi, while customers of networks that support other 4G bands but also use 800MHz may find 4G coverage patchier than they have done previously. We’ve outlined how to tell whether a phone is supported by your network here. Another thing that can make Xiaomi phones a poor fit for UK customers is their lack of Google apps. This is not true of all Xiaomi devices, and wherever possible you should look to buy a ‘Global’ edition of a Xiaomi phone which will include access to the Google Play store and Google services out of the box. Some ‘International’ models also come with Google Play preinstalled, or allow you to install Google Services via the Mi App store. Sadly, the International version of the Mi6 we have here does not come preinstalled with Google apps, and there’s no obvious way to add them. We’ve read that this may have something to do with MIUI 8.0, a custom version of Android 6.0 Marshmallow that is preinstalled on the Mi6, and if it is then there’s hope there will soon be a fix. Of course we’ve found a workaround, but it is one that won’t appeal to less techy users. Something to keep in mind before you rush ahead and buy what looks to be the best-priced flagship of the year. Also see: Best mid-range phones 2017 How to add Google Services to Xiaomi Mi6 Full credit for this workaround goes to Jaasir, a Diamond Member of the MIUI community forums. • Download the necessary files (RAR; Zip), then extract them to your PC or laptop’s desktop. • Connect the Mi6 via a USB-C cable and open an Explorer window to view its contents (if you’re on a Mac use the Android File Transfer tool). • Browse to Internal storage, MIUI, Backup, AllBackup (create that folder if it doesn’t already exist) and drop the file here to copy its contents to the phone. • On the Mi6 open the Settings menu and go to Additional settings, Backup & reset, Local backups, then tap on the file you just added. • Tap Restore. • When the process has finished, restart the phone, then launch the Google Play store icon on the home screen. You should be prompted to enter your Google account details. Xiaomi Mi6 design and build It’s very rare (although not unknown - remember the LG G5 and the Google Pixel XL) for a company’s flagship to look anything short of amazing. And so it is with the mirror-finish Xiaomi Mi6, though this phone appeals for more than its basic good looks. The Mi6 is fitted with a 5.15in screen, features very slim screen bezels, and is just 7.5mm thick with almost slippery smooth, rounded edges at the rear that make it feel ever so comfortable in the hand. As manufacturers look to differentiate themselves on screen size and quality, with flagships that get larger with every new release, Xiaomi is sticking to its ground. This is a relatively compact phone that will be ideal for those customers who think the market is beginning to outgrow them. We still have yet to see a Quad-HD Xiaomi phone - this Mi6 has a full-HD panel with a 1920x1080 pixel resolution and a density of 428ppi - but Xiaomi is not alone. It’s funny that the company it is most often accused of copying, and one that is perhaps the biggest and best-known in the western world, also has no Quad-HD smartphone in its line-up. (Hint: Xiaomi is also known as China’s Apple.) We have to say we’re inclined to agree with Apple’s claims that you don’t need Quad-HD: though you absolutely can tell the difference between full- and Quad-HD, so don’t believe all that ‘Retina’ BS, the Mi6 is perfectly clear at this resolution. This is not a screen you’d find yourself complaining about. With increasing screen resolutions also comes increasing demands placed on the battery, of course, and this is a standout area for the Mi6, fitted as it is with a 3,350mAh cell that supports Quick Charge (but not wireless charging) and may even keep going two days. So the full-HD screen is a trade-off we’re more than happy to make - especially when that display is as bright (1- to 600 nits) and vibrant as this one, with great contrast, realistic colours and excellent viewing angles. Xiaomi claims the Mi6 has four-sided glass, which isn’t as amazing - or confusing - as it sounds. Really it means it is curved on the corners as well as the edges, and only slightly - we’re not talking curved in the same sense as we are with the Galaxy S8.

Both Google and Amazon have surged ahead, with the Google Assistant and Alexa landing in UK homes encased in gadgets known as 'smart speakers'. This new category of home automation lets you set timers, play music and even control other devices - just by yelling at them. But the success of Google Home and Amazon Echo has left Apple trailing in third place with just its popular iPhones and iPads listening out for commands. Amazon Alexa, Echo and the All-New Echo Dot Read More Apple's 'next big thing' could be a Siri-powered smart speaker to take on Amazon Echo and Google Home However, internet rumours are swirling that Tim Cook & Co have plans to join the fray with a new Siri-powered smart speaker. Here's what we know about it so far. Latest news According to KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, who has a track record of leaking accurate information on Apple products, there is an "over 50% chance" the new speaker will be unveiled at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) next month. The annual event, which Apple usually uses to introduce new software features to developers, is scheduled for June 5-9 . Read More WWDC 2017: Siri speaker to be unveiled alongside iOS 11 and macOS 10.13 at Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference Apple's Tim Cook holds up Brandon Moss' 100th career home run during the keynote speech at the Worldwide Developers Conference (Photo: TNS /Landov / Barcroft Media) Kuo added that the device will most likely start selling in the second half of 2017, in order to compete with the new Amazon Echo models expected to launch around that time. "We expect Apple's first home AI product will have excellent acoustics performance (one woofer + seven tweeters) and computing power (similar to iPhone 6/6S AP)," Kuo said in a research note obtained by MacRumors . Release date If analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is to be believed, then Apple could make its new product available in the second half of 2017. Apple has a long history of revealing its new iPhone models in September and launching them either straight away or in October. If the company is building a smart speaker, it may decide to combine distribution costs and launch it alongside the forthcoming iPhone 8 . Price Apple's pricing is likely to be influenced slightly by the £129 Google Home and £149 Amazon Echo . Current rumours suggest Apple's speaker will be priced higher than Amazon's in an effort to reach the premium end of the market. PC Advisor pegs the cost at potentially around £200. Read More Google’s virtual butler will obey your commands, from turning on music to ordering flowers Apple Music is Apple's music service which it could use with a smart speaker Interestingly, Apple-focused site 9to5Mac predicted back in January that Apple's speaker could come in at only $100. That would make it around £75 here in the UK - a price point that would immediately make it more attractive than its rivals. Design The clearest evidence yet that Apple is building a smart speaker comes from a patent that was granted on May 16, 2017. It describes a cylindrical new gadget with "radially deployed components" that could include lamps, displays, speakers, microphones or a range of different sensors. Another prolific Apple leaker, Sonny Dickson, has tweeted that the new speaker could be similar in appearance to a Mac Pro. Read More We're Siri-ous: Google launches it's voice-controlled Assistant on your iPhone (Photo: USPTO) He said it will have a concave top, built-in controls, and speaker meshing covering the majority of its surface. The device will run a variation of iOS, according to Dickson, and feature technology from its Beats range of audio equipment. Beats already makes a portable speaker called the Beats Pill, which pairs with a smartphone, tablet or computer over Bluetooth and boasts 12-hour battery life. Several design sketches were included with the patent application and could give an idea of what the speaker may look like. Features Industry watchers believe Apple's speaker will run a modified version of iOS with Siri as the interface. It will therefore be able to perform all the actions that Siri can currently do, including answering questions, playing music, reading the news, setting timers and controlling special connected devices. Read More Google I/O 2017 keynote LIVE: Tech giant to announce updates to Android, Home and Daydream at annual developer conference (Photo: Amazon) Apple will likely include its AirPlay technology - which means the streaming would be particularly stable. It could also allow users to access other Apple services like iTunes and Beats radio. Of particular interest is whether Apple would include a screen similar to the Amazon Echo Show . That would enable people to use FaceTime video chat from the same device. Ming Chi Kuo has stated there will be a touch "panel" on the front of the device, but stopped short of saying Apple will include a full touchscreen. When will we know more? With Apple's Worldwide Developer's Conference mere weeks away, it might not be long before we know more about this mysterious device. If the company doesn't reveal its finished product at the programmer-focused event, then it may well drop a few carefully placed hints instead. We'll keep this article updated with the latest news on Apple's rumoured Siri smart speaker.

However, a teardown of the apk does bring a few hints about what to expect in the future. There are clues about a couple of new saved destinations like the Home and Work slots that have become so useful, the first stirring of support for Android O's notification channels, a few new "promos" to get people interested in various features, and a very curious feature that might turn out to be a task list of sorts. As usual, we've got a link at the bottom to download this update to sideload if you're not interested in waiting for Google to deliver it to your device. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Saved locations for School and Gym If you find yourself regularly using the Home and Work saved locations for quick navigation, you'll enjoy this one. The Maps team is expanding the list to include two more common destinations: your gym and your school. <string name="GYM_LOCATION">Gym</string> <string name="SCHOOL_LOCATION">School</string> Since those two strings don't really include any specific telltale signs that they're intended to be default saved locations, I've included the two previously existing lines for Home and Work for comparison. It's pretty obvious that the naming convention matches up. <string name="HOME_LOCATION">Home</string> <string name="WORK_LOCATION">Work</string> There is also a newly added icon for education, which I would naturally assume will go with the School destination. There doesn't appear to be a similar icon dedicated to the Gym slot, but it's not as if Google can't easily color-fill the existing fitness icon. Nevertheless, this one missing icon might be a hint that Google won't make these new destination slots available until a future update includes the missing icon. These two new entries will obviously operate just like Home and Work for the purposes of navigation and quick route selection. And as always, users don't have to actually link these slots to real schools or gyms. I'm sure a lot of people will welcome this simple improvement because so many of us travel to more than just work and home in a typical day. The 'Other' Notification Channel I'll just make a quick mention of this topic since it's not really that interesting. Google Maps is going to have a notification channel on Android O titled "Other notifications." <string name="OTHER_NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL">Other notifications</string> I doubt this will be the only custom channel for Maps. After all, there are several subsections in Settings dedicated to each notification type, so we'll probably see the channel list grow a fair amount in the future. I would assume the Maps team is still trying to decide how to best organize the app's notifications. This "other" channel will probably become a placeholder for most of the notifications until they are organized into suitable channels. A few new prompts I normally skip changes that are meant to advertise existing features, but sometimes the focus of banners and notifications can give a little insight into the features and apps that may not be performing as well as expected or simply need user awareness. The latest Maps update includes three new promos. The first banner is for the Google Trips app. Launched around this time last year, Trips is basically an itinerary management app that's also intended for making local recommendations. Trips probably doesn't have a very substantial user base yet, so it's not hard to imagine why Google is trying to breathe a little more life into it. code <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_TITLE">Take your travel info with you</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_TITLE_WITH_AREA_NAME">Take your %1$s travel info with you</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_BODY">Reservations • Things to do • Day plans</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_DOWNLOAD_LINK">Get Google Trips app</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_DISMISS_LINK">No thanks</string> The next addition is intended to get users to try out the recently launched location sharing feature. It's pretty normal to show prompts to get users only newly released features, so there's nothing unusual about this one, but you can probably expect to see it in your navigation setup soon. code <string name="CAR_TI TLE_JOURNEY_SHARING">Share journey</string> <string name="JOURNEY_SHARING_PENDING_PROMPT_TEXT">Share your trip with %1$s</string> <string name="JOURNEY_SHARING_PENDING_PROMPT_TTS">Sharing your real-time location with %1$s until you arrive.</string> <string name="CAR_MENU_START_JOURNEY_SHARING">Share journey</string> <string name="CAR_MENU_STOP_JOURNEY_SHARING">Stop sharing</string> The final promotional banner will belong to the always familiar Local Guides program. As usual, it's going to encourage users to contribute to Maps for points. The one interesting oddity is that these strings have "v2" in their names. It's possible this just means they are for a new set of promos, or this might hint at a revised version of the points program. I would expect the former, but it's at least worth acknowledging the latter is possible. code <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_TITLE">Reach new Local Guides levels</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_TEXT">Now earn more points for your reviews, photos, edits, and adding new places.</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_GOTO_STATS">SEE YOUR LEVEL</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_OPEN_HELP">Learn more</string> A task list called "Nearby Need?" There's very little to go on for this topic, but it looks just weird enough that I suspect there's a feature brewing in there somewhere. A pair of new layouts were added with the name "nearby need," one of which defines the look of a list, and the other is for items in that list. There is also a single string with a related name and just the word "navigate" for text. <string name="NEARBY_NEED_NAVIGATE">Navigate</string> /layout/nearby_need_item.xml /layout/nearby_need.xml Based on this very limited amount of information, it does sound a little like a shopping list of sorts. Perhaps less like a grocery list and more like a list of chores or tasks – e.g. getting new tires on the car, picking up some materials for a weekend project, and buying new clothes. I would assume each item goes into a list and Google Maps will make it easy to navigate to the next nearest place where each of these things can be taken care of. I'm not actually sure if these are related, but there are also three new images to be found in the resources, and they certainly would fit with my theory. The first is for creating new tasks, the second is for completed tasks, and the final one is for "old" completed tasks. I suppose the old one might be for things a user did on previous days but hasn't removed from the list. This is all guesswork right now, but many people have been asking for ways to use Maps to get through chores, and this feels like the first hint of something like that. The one aspect that's not yet hinted at, but I certainly hope to see, is a feature that will sort tasks efficiently so people can choose the shortest (or fastest) route to get everything done. I'll keep watching and follow up when there are more developments.

They are used when you go to Your Contributions -> Check the Facts/Uncover Missing info. I think after all this time those two are still only for lvl 5 local guides... so yeah. Cody Toombs Right, the look of the images aren't new, but the files containing those images are. Or said more clearly, there are now multiple copies of those icons. mmark27 I sure would like there to be a "Work" and then a "Parking for Work" section for those that don't park right next to their office. Point being, if I want walking direction/estimations, give them from my office. If I want driving directions/estimations on time, know that I have to walk to my car, then drive from my parking location. The School addition will be good to finally have pop up automatically now though. Cody Toombs If you're not going to use all four slots for their intended purpose, you might just assign one of the others to be your work parking. Frankly, I would have liked these saved slots to have custom labels, since some people don't fit into this one shape. For example, I know somebody that has to travel to two different sites for the same job, and another friend that was enrolled in two different schools at the same time. It's not like one of these destinations can't go into the "Gym" slot, but it would be nice if the titles could make sense. mmark27 Right. I now have my "Work" location saved as my parking lot, which is silly, but it's the only way to get decent estimations. Your fix is what I'll be doing otherwise unless they fix it. The subtly though in this situation is El Goog knowing that the Work and Work Parking are linked existentially, so they can decipher where my body is and estimate from there, etc. Same can be said for Home and Home Parking if not directly on site. Would seem like Google's apartment-city-dwelling-first mentality would be more amenable to this off the bat. I agree that we should be able to have free labels on places and also as many places as we can stomach estimations/notifications on time to. Google knows where I am at all times....make it actually useful, guys. henleyb I work from home and Google would keep asking me to set my work address which is of course the same as my home address, it was a small but annoying thing. :) Austin Spangrud Sure would be nice if maps got integrated assistant into it. None of the commands and home commands that I have integrate with the Voice button in maps. Oh and In b4 where's my speed limit pop up Cody Toombs Speed limits are still limited geographically. Since I was in the Bay Area last week, I finally saw them pop up for the first time on my phone and in Android Auto. Funny enough, I now have a Speed Limit toggle in settings on one phone, but nowhere else :/ And now I'm probably not going to see the speed limits again for a long time. Paul_Werner Yeah and we used to have them and they disappeared. At least it did for me here in the Milwaukee, WI area. Same for when I travel to Chicago Nicholas Matranga Finally, it was so annoying to have to save my school address as my work address just to get commute updates. mike shwilly Grow up Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez Finally, Im glad that we can save more pinned-saved choices other than the usual Home and Work, although I would prefer to customize them on my own in the same manner we customize the saved list. I could make a really good use of few in my mind like Church, Work2, University, etc. Jon Xuereb Couldn't you use this school one for University Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez I used the word University just an example, the point is that it would be great to customize those pinned saves using our own creations. Paul_Werner I can't wait to see that "nearby need" implemented. Your guesswork on it sounds like it could be a really useful feature. h4rr4r Why are these static names? Why can't I add random strings and assign them saved locations? Ken Vincent what ever happened to speed limits? I thought that was on the verge of being a thing more then a year ago. UKTK8 "In the coming weeks" Meaning whenever Google d#$% well pleases. Jon Xuereb Lawyers I'm assuming dmo580 Yet Waze and other GPS apps have no issues. How about just displaying my current speed? Ken Vincent Not only that, but google provides speed limits as a service. I would imagine that is where Waze gets their speed limit info. https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/roads/speed-limits Jon Xuereb Because Google Maps is exponentially larger in terms of user base, and google is a bigger target for lawsuits Ken Vincent Waze is wholly owned by Google. They are not even an Alphabet company, they are Google. Jon Xuereb Still the size of the userbase affects the their risk assessment icyhotmike why not just let us add "Saved" locations such as Home and Work and whatever else we want? Damn Google in control of everything. makapav My God the Google apps and ecosystem are becoming such a clusterfuck with no sources of truth for data points. All the information is spread across random places. Richard Oldroyd I do use home a lot but for the others like gym I save as a contact and nav just as quick. Richard Oldroyd I'd love maps to display my current speed and advise what the speed limit is. Obviously they would have to add a warning saying they can not be held responsible for displaying an incorrect speed limit. I'd also like to see us be able to choose what is displayed underneath where they show destination time and miles to go, it would be useful to see arrival times at all stops not just the one you are currently naving to.

How Terrorists Slip Beheading Videos Past YouTube’s Censors Other jihadi propaganda on the video-sharing platform may be visually more low-key, but are just as insidious in their own ways. There is a grim bit in comedian Dave Chappelle's new Netflix special about clicking "don't like" on an Islamic State beheading video. "How is this guy cutting peoples' heads off on YouTube?" Chappelle asks, noting the absurdity of it. Don't like. Click. In reality, reports of extremist content littering YouTube aren't new. But when hundreds of major advertisers began suspending contracts with YouTube and Google in recent months, boycotting the massive video-sharing platform over concerns with such explicit content, things got a lot more real. Google services—namely YouTube—are the most plentiful and important links used by terrorist organizations to disseminate their propaganda. And despite all of YouTube's efforts to keep them out thus far, such groups still manage to sneak their media onto its servers. The Current State of YouTube The amount of YouTube and other Google links created to push terrorist content is hard to overstate. Take one IS recruitment video, "And You Will be Superior," one of many released amid the snowballing boycott. The 35-minute video, released on March 18, urges people of all ages to join IS by featuring suicide bombers from different walks of life—a doctor, a disabled fighter, and a young child—describing their lives before footage of their respective suicide operations. Image: SITE When IS releases a video like this, an array of pro-IS media groups—translators, promoters, social media leaders, link-creators—immediately get to work in pushing it out across the internet. One very important, but not widely known media group, The Upload Knights (or Fursan al-Rafa in Arabic), plays a major role in the dissemination of these releases by creating hundreds of links to them across various streaming and file-sharing sites on a daily basis. The importance of YouTube to The Upload Knights and other terrorist media groups is clear as day. During a two-day span following the release of "And You Will be Superior," The Upload Knights distributed the video and its promotional banner with 136 unique links from Google services alone: 69 for YouTube, 54 for Google Drive, and 13 for Google Photos. Keep in mind, that was just one video, and just one media group. In the 10 days between March 8 and 18—the time span leading to the aforementioned video's release—The Upload Knights channel posted 515 links to Google services: 328 for YouTube, 148 for Google Drive, and 39 for Google Photos. YouTube is equally important for al Qaeda (AQ) and its affiliates. Note the way in which al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula's (AQAP) primary media channel prioritizes YouTube above all other forms of video dissemination. Releasing a May 3 video on clashes with Security Belt Forces in Yemen, the channel forwarded the video via three links: two of which to compilations of over 130 links on two pasting services, and one being a YouTube link. AQAP releasing a video on Telegram. Image: SITE Other jihadi videos on YouTube may be visually more low-key, but are just as insidious in their own ways. YouTube contains a library for speeches by extremist clerics like Anwar al-Awlaki, a deceased American citizen whom many terrorists have praised as a formative influence in their radicalization. As a teenage female IS recruit from Colorado once answered in an online Q&A platform, when asked what she does when she can't sleep at night: "Watch lectures on youtube and stay on twitter." And it's not just jihadist content plaguing YouTube's servers. Violently racist and bigoted videos like those featuring "Moonman," a white supremacist meme originated from old McDonald's advertising, show Jews and other minorities being shot while exclaiming "death camps for blacks" and "fascism's back." (To see just how easy they are to find, enter the word "Moonman" into YouTube's search bar.) Simply put, advertisers' concerns are not unfounded. Terrorists' Methods of Exploiting YouTube It would be unfair to say YouTube hasn't done anything to stop terrorist media from reaching its servers. Per YouTube's policy on terrorist-related content: YouTube strictly prohibits content intended to recruit for terrorist organizations, incite violence, celebrate terrorist attacks or otherwise promote acts of terrorism. We also do not permit foreign terrorist organizations to use YouTube. Content intended to document events connected to terrorist acts or news reporting on terrorist activities may be allowed on the site with sufficient context and intent. However, graphic or controversial footage may be subject to age-restrictions or a warning screen. To this point, YouTube has made it easy for users to flag policy-violating content and worked toward implementing automated solutions for detecting terrorist content. However, as I've stated before, terrorist propaganda comprises a lot more than the gory execution videos which detection technologies may seek to find. And, just as troublingly, terrorist groups have repeatedly found ways to bypass unwanted attention from non-supporting users and administrators. For instance, in order to prevent users from flagging explicit or inflammatory extremist videos, terrorist media groups and disseminators like The Upload Knights and AQ's As-Sahab Media Foundation often label YouTube videos as "unlisted," meaning that the videos cannot be searched—only accessed if you are given the link. This feature works well to keep a video somewhat contained to supporters and prospects. They are also just as easy as any other link to find on the messaging service Telegram, though, after which they can be further disseminated on social media. IS video (left) and AQAP video (right) uploaded to YouTube and marked as unlisted. Image: SITE Terrorist groups also upload videos that are not the actual videos they are advertised to be. Instead, audio plays over a still image with a message at the bottom directing users to alternative links provided in the description section. Take an April 26 video from IS' Ninawa Province for example: Image in the video reads, "The link is in the video description," where another YouTube link is provided. Image: SITE In the comments section of this YouTube upload, which was eventually removed, were several more links, making the YouTube page look a lot like a password-protected jihadi forum or private Telegram chat group: Image: SITE Toward Better Solutions Terrorist groups are brand-focused by their very nature. Thus, releases by these organizations consistently bare recurring elements, including hashtags, phrases, and watermarks. For instance, videos by IS' 'Amaq News Agency consistently open with the same animation, as shown in the following screenshots taken from YouTube: Image: SITE Media by AQ and its affiliates likewise contain the same types of watermarks. For example, the following screenshots show recurring opening and closings of videos by AQAP: Image: SITE YouTube already uses precisely the type of technology that could recognize much of these elements on its servers as such. So, if the company can recognize copyright-infringing material and other policy-violating content, then why can't it do so for propaganda from a group like IS or AQ? Also noteworthy is that when YouTube removes a video from a terrorist media group like The Upload Knights, it doesn't always remove the channel that posted it, allowing the group and others like it to upload future videos more easily. Take an April 5 IS video from IS' Furat Province as an example. The following combined screenshots show the video's stats as it stood on YouTube with over 220 views prior to being taken down, and a thumbnail taken from Telegram, whereon it was widely disseminated. Image: SITE Despite being taken down, the YouTube channel that posted it is still active as of May 22, as shown in the following screenshot. Image: SITE Taking down these channels might at least offer somewhat more deterrence to terrorist groups. But by leaving them up, YouTube is already giving them a half-way head-start to upload the next terrorist release. In the wake of Monday's attack at Manchester Arena, for example, the Upload Knights Telegram channel began rapidly posting previously released IS videos threatening the West. Each video was posted with only five links, the first of which being to YouTube and Google Drive. Image: SITE There are plenty of such channels to go around on the platform. A search for The Upload Knights in Arabic shows an array of channels, complete with the Upload Knights name and logo: Image: SITE A lot of terrorist media groups also use uploading scripts like Rapidleech, which enable them to simultaneously upload content to multiple services, including YouTube, and easily repeat the process for each new piece of content. Anything seeming to be uploaded with such devices should at least be a red flag to those monitoring the platform for content deemed offensive, including extremist propaganda. Extremist groups' ongoing embrace of YouTube, and their investment in new ways to stay on it, signals a clear and troubling message: terrorists still feel like they have a grasp on the platform. Responding to advertisers concerns in March, Ronan Harris, Managing Director of Google UK, stated that the company knows it "must do more," while promising to "provide simpler, more robust ways to stop [advertisers'] ads from showing against controversial content." YouTube's issue with terrorist content is not just one of advertising revenue; it is one of safety. That said, we should all wish the video-sharing company and all other stake-holding information and communication technology platforms the best in countering extremist content on their servers, and hope to see these companies embrace new, adaptive solutions and partnerships in doing so. Maybe then would a joke about the absurdity of clicking "don't like" when confronted with a video of a terrorist "cutting peoples' heads off on YouTube" gradually lose relevancy. For now, Chappelle's bit is as potent as ever. As is often said about comedy, there's a dark, unsettling humor in it because it's true. Rita Katz, executive director of the SITE Intelligence Group, has infiltrated terrorist fronts undercover, testified before Congress and in terrorism trials, and personally briefed officials at the White House, as well as investigators in the Departments of Justice, Treasury, and Homeland Security.

Now, Google is trying to change that with the unveiling of a new attribution offering called Google Attribution. Here's what marketers need to know about it. It aims to answer the question, "Is my marketing working?" Marketers can slice and dice their campaign results in any number of ways but at the end of the day, marketers ask themselves a simple question: "Is my marketing working?" Google says that Google Attribution is designed to answer that specific question and boldly claims that "for the first time, [it will be] possible for every marketer to measure the impact of their marketing across devices and across channels." Google says it solves a number of major attribution challenges Marketers love the concept of attribution, but making it work in the real world has proven difficult. Google says that Google Attribution will address a number of the biggest attribution challenges, including difficulty of use, cross-device tracking and ad tool integration. It is integrated with other Google offerings In terms of integration, it's no surprise that Google has integrated Google Attribution with its ads and analytics products. According to Google, Attribution "takes in data across AdWords, Google Analytics and DoubleClick Search without any additional tagging," and "results are immediately available for reporting, updating bids or moving budget between channels." It uses machine learning to enable data-driven attribution As one of the world's most innovate tech companies, Google has invested significantly in machine learning and Google Attribution uses some of the company's machine learning tech to enable data-driven attribution. What is that? The company explains: Data-driven attribution uses machine learning to determine how much credit to assign to each step in the consumer journey -- from the first time they engage with your brand for early research down to the final click before purchase. It analyzes your account's unique conversion patterns, comparing the paths of customers who convert to those who don’t, so you get results that accurately represent your business. For marketers still relying on last-click attribution, the data-driven attribution model could provide a beneficial new perspective that helps them allocate marketing spend more wisely. Google is making a big push to track offline store sales Google Attribution will give marketers access to store sales measurement at the device and campaign levels. Marketers whose companies collect email information at the point-of-sale can import store sales data into Google AdWords, but Google isn't stopping there. To track offline sales more broadly, Google has established relationships with firms that it says give it access to data for 70% of credit and debit card transactions in the United States. Google will use this data to aggregate and anonymize store sales and provide it to marketers even if they don't report sales data to Google. There are privacy concerns Not surprising, the fact that Google has partnered with firms giving it access to data for billions of credit card transaction has caused numerous observers to speak out about the privacy implications of Google Attribution. To counter privacy concerns, Google says its partnerships give it access to spending data only, not transaction details like products purchased, and the search giant revealed that it developed a "new, custom encryption technology that ensures users' data remains private, secure, and anonymous." Whether that is enough to allay fears that Google is collecting too much data remains to be seen. It is free Last year, Google unveiled Google Attribution 360, a paid attribution solution, that targets large marketers. The newly announced Google Attribution platform, on the other hand, will be free, making it an attractive option for marketers at small and mid-sized businesses already using Google's ad services. Some marketers are skeptical On paper, there's a lot to like about Google Attribution, but some marketers are already expressing skepticism about the offering.  As Jason Beckerman, the CEO of Unified, which operates a business intelligence platform, told Digiday, "there’s no real separation of church and state." He elaborated: If [Google's] competitors end up having higher return on ad spend, it could put Google in a tough spot. Google wants to become one-stop shop for marketers and own their marketing. It has got too much skin in the game. While such concerns are not without merit, given that a significant percentage of every new dollar directed to digital ad spend is going to Google, it would appear that many marketers have already decided to make themselves dependent on Google. For these marketers, adopting tools like Google Attribution might not require such a huge leap of faith, especially if they see it as an improvement over their existing attribution efforts.

B) It will most probably not know how much you spend in other marketing channels. Other than Google properties, I mean. So at the end of the day, you still won't be able to tell the ROI of what are you doing and won't be able to find the optimal marketing split. As far as I know Roivenue.com is the only tool that does that. about 12 hours ago Comment

Google Maps v9.54 prepares to add saved locations for your school and gym, notification channels, and what looks like a task list [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 6:22am PDTMay 26, 2017 35 Plus 1 on G+ 54 Share on Facebook 50 Share on Twitter Total Shares139 APK Teardown Applications Downloads What's Really New Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 Saved locations for School and Gym 1.2 The 'Other' Notification Channel 1.3 A few new prompts 1.4 A task list called "Nearby Need?" 2 Download An update to Google Maps v9.54 began rolling out to users through the beta channel yesterday, but it doesn't appear to have any visible changes going live quite yet. However, a teardown of the apk does bring a few hints about what to expect in the future. There are clues about a couple of new saved destinations like the Home and Work slots that have become so useful, the first stirring of support for Android O's notification channels, a few new "promos" to get people interested in various features, and a very curious feature that might turn out to be a task list of sorts. As usual, we've got a link at the bottom to download this update to sideload if you're not interested in waiting for Google to deliver it to your device. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Saved locations for School and Gym If you find yourself regularly using the Home and Work saved locations for quick navigation, you'll enjoy this one. The Maps team is expanding the list to include two more common destinations: your gym and your school. <string name="GYM_LOCATION">Gym</string> <string name="SCHOOL_LOCATION">School</string> Since those two strings don't really include any specific telltale signs that they're intended to be default saved locations, I've included the two previously existing lines for Home and Work for comparison. It's pretty obvious that the naming convention matches up. <string name="HOME_LOCATION">Home</string> <string name="WORK_LOCATION">Work</string> There is also a newly added icon for education, which I would naturally assume will go with the School destination. There doesn't appear to be a similar icon dedicated to the Gym slot, but it's not as if Google can't easily color-fill the existing fitness icon. Nevertheless, this one missing icon might be a hint that Google won't make these new destination slots available until a future update includes the missing icon. These two new entries will obviously operate just like Home and Work for the purposes of navigation and quick route selection. And as always, users don't have to actually link these slots to real schools or gyms. I'm sure a lot of people will welcome this simple improvement because so many of us travel to more than just work and home in a typical day. The 'Other' Notification Channel I'll just make a quick mention of this topic since it's not really that interesting. Google Maps is going to have a notification channel on Android O titled "Other notifications." <string name="OTHER_NOTIFICATION_CHANNEL">Other notifications</string> I doubt this will be the only custom channel for Maps. After all, there are several subsections in Settings dedicated to each notification type, so we'll probably see the channel list grow a fair amount in the future. I would assume the Maps team is still trying to decide how to best organize the app's notifications. This "other" channel will probably become a placeholder for most of the notifications until they are organized into suitable channels. A few new prompts I normally skip changes that are meant to advertise existing features, but sometimes the focus of banners and notifications can give a little insight into the features and apps that may not be performing as well as expected or simply need user awareness. The latest Maps update includes three new promos. The first banner is for the Google Trips app. Launched around this time last year, Trips is basically an itinerary management app that's also intended for making local recommendations. Trips probably doesn't have a very substantial user base yet, so it's not hard to imagine why Google is trying to breathe a little more life into it. code <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_TITLE">Take your travel info with you</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_TITLE_WITH_AREA_NAME">Take your %1$s travel info with you</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_BODY">Reservations • Things to do • Day plans</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_DOWNLOAD_LINK">Get Google Trips app</string> <string name="OFFLINE_MAPS_TRIPS_APP_BANNER_DISMISS_LINK">No thanks</string> The next addition is intended to get users to try out the recently launched location sharing feature. It's pretty normal to show prompts to get users only newly released features, so there's nothing unusual about this one, but you can probably expect to see it in your navigation setup soon. code <string name="CAR_TI TLE_JOURNEY_SHARING">Share journey</string> <string name="JOURNEY_SHARING_PENDING_PROMPT_TEXT">Share your trip with %1$s</string> <string name="JOURNEY_SHARING_PENDING_PROMPT_TTS">Sharing your real-time location with %1$s until you arrive.</string> <string name="CAR_MENU_START_JOURNEY_SHARING">Share journey</string> <string name="CAR_MENU_STOP_JOURNEY_SHARING">Stop sharing</string> The final promotional banner will belong to the always familiar Local Guides program. As usual, it's going to encourage users to contribute to Maps for points. The one interesting oddity is that these strings have "v2" in their names. It's possible this just means they are for a new set of promos, or this might hint at a revised version of the points program. I would expect the former, but it's at least worth acknowledging the latter is possible. code <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_TITLE">Reach new Local Guides levels</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_TEXT">Now earn more points for your reviews, photos, edits, and adding new places.</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_GOTO_STATS">SEE YOUR LEVEL</string> <string name="POINTS_V2_PROMO_OPEN_HELP">Learn more</string> A task list called "Nearby Need?" There's very little to go on for this topic, but it looks just weird enough that I suspect there's a feature brewing in there somewhere. A pair of new layouts were added with the name "nearby need," one of which defines the look of a list, and the other is for items in that list. There is also a single string with a related name and just the word "navigate" for text. <string name="NEARBY_NEED_NAVIGATE">Navigate</string> /layout/nearby_need_item.xml /layout/nearby_need.xml Based on this very limited amount of information, it does sound a little like a shopping list of sorts. Perhaps less like a grocery list and more like a list of chores or tasks – e.g. getting new tires on the car, picking up some materials for a weekend project, and buying new clothes. I would assume each item goes into a list and Google Maps will make it easy to navigate to the next nearest place where each of these things can be taken care of. I'm not actually sure if these are related, but there are also three new images to be found in the resources, and they certainly would fit with my theory. The first is for creating new tasks, the second is for completed tasks, and the final one is for "old" completed tasks. I suppose the old one might be for things a user did on previous days but hasn't removed from the list. This is all guesswork right now, but many people have been asking for ways to use Maps to get through chores, and this feels like the first hint of something like that. The one aspect that's not yet hinted at, but I certainly hope to see, is a feature that will sort tasks efficiently so people can choose the shortest (or fastest) route to get everything done. I'll keep watching and follow up when there are more developments. Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

They are used when you go to Your Contributions -> Check the Facts/Uncover Missing info. I think after all this time those two are still only for lvl 5 local guides... so yeah. Cody Toombs Right, the look of the images aren't new, but the files containing those images are. Or said more clearly, there are now multiple copies of those icons. mmark27 I sure would like there to be a "Work" and then a "Parking for Work" section for those that don't park right next to their office. Point being, if I want walking direction/estimations, give them from my office. If I want driving directions/estimations on time, know that I have to walk to my car, then drive from my parking location. The School addition will be good to finally have pop up automatically now though. Cody Toombs If you're not going to use all four slots for their intended purpose, you might just assign one of the others to be your work parking. Frankly, I would have liked these saved slots to have custom labels, since some people don't fit into this one shape. For example, I know somebody that has to travel to two different sites for the same job, and another friend that was enrolled in two different schools at the same time. It's not like one of these destinations can't go into the "Gym" slot, but it would be nice if the titles could make sense. mmark27 Right. I now have my "Work" location saved as my parking lot, which is silly, but it's the only way to get decent estimations. Your fix is what I'll be doing otherwise unless they fix it. The subtly though in this situation is El Goog knowing that the Work and Work Parking are linked existentially, so they can decipher where my body is and estimate from there, etc. Same can be said for Home and Home Parking if not directly on site. Would seem like Google's apartment-city-dwelling-first mentality would be more amenable to this off the bat. I agree that we should be able to have free labels on places and also as many places as we can stomach estimations/notifications on time to. Google knows where I am at all times....make it actually useful, guys. henleyb I work from home and Google would keep asking me to set my work address which is of course the same as my home address, it was a small but annoying thing. :) Austin Spangrud Sure would be nice if maps got integrated assistant into it. None of the commands and home commands that I have integrate with the Voice button in maps. Oh and In b4 where's my speed limit pop up Cody Toombs Speed limits are still limited geographically. Since I was in the Bay Area last week, I finally saw them pop up for the first time on my phone and in Android Auto. Funny enough, I now have a Speed Limit toggle in settings on one phone, but nowhere else :/ And now I'm probably not going to see the speed limits again for a long time. Paul_Werner Yeah and we used to have them and they disappeared. At least it did for me here in the Milwaukee, WI area. Same for when I travel to Chicago Nicholas Matranga Finally, it was so annoying to have to save my school address as my work address just to get commute updates. mike shwilly Grow up Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez Finally, Im glad that we can save more pinned-saved choices other than the usual Home and Work, although I would prefer to customize them on my own in the same manner we customize the saved list. I could make a really good use of few in my mind like Church, Work2, University, etc. Jon Xuereb Couldn't you use this school one for University Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez I used the word University just an example, the point is that it would be great to customize those pinned saves using our own creations. Paul_Werner I can't wait to see that "nearby need" implemented. Your guesswork on it sounds like it could be a really useful feature. h4rr4r Why are these static names? Why can't I add random strings and assign them saved locations? Ken Vincent what ever happened to speed limits? I thought that was on the verge of being a thing more then a year ago. UKTK8 "In the coming weeks" Meaning whenever Google d#$% well pleases. Jon Xuereb Lawyers I'm assuming dmo580 Yet Waze and other GPS apps have no issues. How about just displaying my current speed? Ken Vincent Not only that, but google provides speed limits as a service. I would imagine that is where Waze gets their speed limit info. https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/roads/speed-limits Jon Xuereb Because Google Maps is exponentially larger in terms of user base, and google is a bigger target for lawsuits Ken Vincent Waze is wholly owned by Google. They are not even an Alphabet company, they are Google. Jon Xuereb Still the size of the userbase affects the their risk assessment icyhotmike why not just let us add "Saved" locations such as Home and Work and whatever else we want? Damn Google in control of everything. makapav My God the Google apps and ecosystem are becoming such a clusterfuck with no sources of truth for data points. All the information is spread across random places. Richard Oldroyd I do use home a lot but for the others like gym I save as a contact and nav just as quick. Richard Oldroyd I'd love maps to display my current speed and advise what the speed limit is. Obviously they would have to add a warning saying they can not be held responsible for displaying an incorrect speed limit. I'd also like to see us be able to choose what is displayed underneath where they show destination time and miles to go, it would be useful to see arrival times at all stops not just the one you are currently naving to.

Highs Great camera Squeezable sides Slick performance Good battery life Lows No 3.5mm audio jack Bulky body DT Editors' Rating 8.0 DT Recommended Product Scores Explained Home > Product Reviews > Phone Reviews > HTC U11 review By Simon Hill Posted on 05.26.17 Research Center: HTC U11 After the disappointing, incremental updates of the One M8 and M9, last year’s HTC 10 showed that the Taiwanese company still has ambitions in the smartphone market. The phone was deservedly popular with reviewers, but sadly failed to ignite public excitement. This year’s HTC U11 is a much more dramatic departure from past flagships like the HTC 10, switching brushed aluminum for an eye-catching liquid-glass finish wrapped around a powerful, squeezable smartphone that offers tempting features. We think it’s excellent competition against flagships like the LG G6 and the Samsung Galaxy S8 thanks to a stellar camera, and fluid performance. Let’s dive in. Beautiful, but big The most noticeable feature of the HTC U11 is its liquid-glass surface. The U11 is one of the shiniest phones we’ve ever handled, and you really do need to see it in person to get an idea of how the refractive minerals baked into the glass change color as you tilt the phone. The eye-catching red U11 changes to gold, the white shows all the colors of the rainbow, and the black has a subtle hint of green. Our silver review unit is more of a light blue, but there is also a darker blue option. HTC’s glass doesn’t just look good, it also curves slightly –on the front and back — to seamlessly blend into an aluminum frame. It’s very comfortable to hold, and the rear finish feels more like plastic in the hand than glass, because it’s not cold to the touch. The immediately obvious downside to an almost mirrored back is that it picks up grubby fingerprints and smudges. If you want to maintain its good looks, carry a microfiber cloth in your pocket, and be prepared to polish. The next most visible feature is the U11’s size — this phone is big. The U11 has a 5.5-inch display, but the front has a spacious edges above and below. Even compared to last year’s Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge, which also has a 5.5-inch display, the U11 feels big. Put it next to the impossibly slim Galaxy S8, which packs a larger 5.8-inch display, and the U11 feels monstrous. It would be fair to say that HTC is not yet onboard with the bezel-less trend, or the new, longer 18:9 screen format that LG introduced with the G6. This could be a difficult obstacle for HTC to overcome, because, unlike Samsung and LG, the company does not have its own display division. From the front, the U11 looks undeniably dated and the S8 and G6 are much easier to manage one-handed The HTC U11 has a Super LCD 5 screen with a resolution of 2560 x 1440 pixels, which offers a sharp 590 pixels-per-inch. It’s comfortable to read on for long periods, and games and movies look good. The brightness is limited, however, which can be a problem in direct sunlight. The HTC U11 is silky smooth and lightning fast. It’s debatable how important the elongated screen and tiny bezels are, but the lack of anything special in this department is certainly a weak point for the U11. Below the screen there’s a recessed, glass fingerprint sensor. It’s usually fast and responsive, but we did find that it was triggered by our palm accidentally, more often than we’d have liked, and it occasionally took a couple of tries to unlock. The fingerprint sensor is flanked by capacitive touch buttons for back and recent apps. They only light up when pressed and there’s vibration feedback. Look at the bottom edge and you’ll see that HTC has also made the switch to USB Type-C. You won’t find a 3.5mm audio jack on this phone, but HTC has provided USB Type-C earphones and an adapter in the box. Lightning fast Using the HTC U11 is silky smooth and lightning fast. Navigating around, jumping in and out of apps, and gaming are hitch-free. That shouldn’t come as much of a surprise, considering the U11 is packing a Snapdragon 835 backed by 4GB of RAM. We played Injustice 2, Super Mario Run, and Asphalt Extreme, and didn’t encounter any performance issues at all. This phone is a dream for gaming. The Snapdragon 835 is Qualcomm’s current top of the line and it offers significant performance and efficiency boosts over previous chips. It debuted in the Galaxy S8, but you won’t find it in many other phones just yet — a boon for HTC. When we ran the benchmarks on our HTC U11, the scores were impressive: 3DMark SlingShot Extreme: 3,631 AnTuTu: 175,748 Geekbench 4: 1,926 single core; 6,493 multi core For comparison, the S8 scored 2,052, 155,253, and 1,762 single core, 5,723 multi core in the same tests, respectively, whereas the G6 (which has the older Snapdragon 821) scored 2,102 in 3D Mark, and 135,032 in AnTuTu. The vast majority of Android phones we’ve owned have exhibited some increased sluggishness over time, so we’ll be interested to see if the U11 slows down. Right now, it’s one of the fastest phones we’ve ever used, and it has more than enough power for most people. If you’re wondering about storage, the base model offers an ample 64GB with room for expansion via a MicroSD card slot. Squeeze me One of the headline features for the HTC U11 is called Edge Sense and it allows you to squeeze the bottom edges of the handset to perform a variety of shortcuts, such as launching the camera, and snapping a photo. You can also configure it to launch Google Assistant or Amazon’s Alexa, turn on Wi-Fi or the flashlight, record your voice, or launch any other app of your choice. It’s easy to set up and you’re prompted to try it out when you first turn on your U11. There are sensors running down each side of the phone that start below the power button. You can set the force you’re comfortable using, and vibration feedback as well as an onscreen animation will let you know it’s working. If you find you’re activating it accidentally, you can re-calibrate it to require more force. If you enable advanced mode, you can set one action for a short squeeze and a different one for a squeeze and hold. This takes a little practice to master. By default, one squeeze will launch the camera and you can squeeze again to snap a photo. This may sound like a bit of a gimmick, but it’s actually a step forward towards a button-less phone design. HTC is trying to ease us gently into the idea with Edge Sense, and we expect further developments in this direction if it proves popular. We had doubts about its usefulness to begin with, but there are situations where Edge Sense works nicely. The default camera launch is a quick shortcut and the ability to squeeze again to capture a photo, coupled with the reflective back, means you can easily use the rear camera for superior selfies. It also works when the U11’s screen, or your hands, are wet. If you live somewhere cold and use gloves, then we can see Edge Sense coming in handy once more. It’s not an earth-shattering feature, but it’s interesting, and it’s nice to see HTC is still innovating. As smartphones lose the bezels and buttons, we are going to need new ways of interacting with them and squeezing feels like a natural gesture. Android and Sense UI The HTC U11 runs Android 7.1.1 with the Sense user interface on top. It’s not too far away from stock Android, and it will be instantly accessible for anyone who has used Android before. HTC is mostly content to employ Google’s suite of apps instead of doubling up with inferior versions of its own, as some Android manufacturers unfortunately still insist on doing. Sense Companion is better than expected, but it’s not a reason to buy the phone. Sense Companion is the most noticeable HTC addition here. It’s another AI assistant (which debuted on the HTC U Ultra), but don’t worry, because you can still long press the fingerprint sensor to launch Google Assistant. Sense Companion doesn’t compete as a voice assistant — it’s like a layer on your smartphone that learns by snooping on your activity (if you choose to allow it), and then offers up suggestions you might like. AI helpers are often of dubious helpfulness, but much depends on what you expect. During our time with the U11, the Sense Companion reminded us to dress for rain when it was wet, it optimized a few apps to boost battery life, and it recommended some nearby eateries for lunch. It also tracks your activity, providing a weekly step count report, highlights points of interest when you’re out and about, and gives you traffic updates that might impact your commute. It’s more useful than Google Now with preemptive suggestions, because it pops up over apps as a Facebook Messenger-like chat head. It’s better than expected, but it’s not a reason to buy the phone. Plenty of stamina With a battery capacity of 3,000mAh — the same size as the battery in the Galaxy S8 — we expected standard day-long performance, but we’ve been pleasantly surprised. The HTC U11 has no trouble lasting past bedtime, even with heavy use. Much depends on which apps and games you use, signal strength in your area, and a few other factors, but the U11 seems to have good battery life. On average, it lasts more than a day — we ended a day of average use with about 40 percent remaining. Speaking of charging, the U11 supports Qualcomm’s Quick Charge 3.0 technology. It juices up fast when the battery is low, but then slows down as it approaches capacity. To give an example, this morning it took half an hour to go from 22 percent to 69 percent, but another hour to reach 100 percent. We’re a little disappointed that there’s no support for wireless charging, like you’ll find in the S8. Camera is a contender Everyone wants a great camera in their smartphone, but it has not been a strong point for HTC over the last few years. That may all be about to change with the U11. This is an excellent camera that gets consistently good results in a variety of different environments and conditions. We’ve really enjoyed our time with it so far. Early indications that HTC might have got the camera right came from news that DxO Mark awarded it a score of 90, the highest score it has ever given a smartphone camera. For reference, the Google Pixel scored 89, the Galaxy S8 scored 88. and the iPhone 7 scored 86. The HTC U11 has a 12-megapixel main camera with a large f/1.7 aperture, with Optical Image Stabilization, a dual LED flash, and HDR Boost. Photographers will appreciate the Pro mode with RAW format support. During our testing in auto mode, we found quickly pointing and shooting with the U11 camera resulted in pleasingly great shots more often than not. It’s very fast to focus, captures a real depth of detail with very little noise, and the colors are vibrant, but realistic. In sunny conditions, most photos turned out great, and low-light performance is equally impressive. There’s inevitably some blooming with bright lights, but the U11 compares favorably with other smartphone cameras. It’s great for close-ups, too, capturing microscopic details with a solid bokeh effect blurring the background. The front-facing camera is rated at 16 megapixels with an f/2.0 aperture, HDR Boost support, and 1080p video recording. It’s ideal for video calls and capable of capturing detailed selfies, although we preferred the results when we used the squeeze function to snap selfies with the main camera. Wired for sound We were glad to find BoomSound speakers in the HTC U11, though the main speaker is bottom facing — we occasionally had to readjust our fingers to avoid covering it up. The volume and quality is good — for a phone – in fact, it’s one of the loudest phones we’ve ever tested. Call quality and clarity is also solid. HTC U11 Compared To Nexus 6 HTC One Remix Huawei Ascend Mate 2 Samsung Galaxy S5 Active LG G Flex LG Optimus G Pro LG Lucid 2 Motorola Droid Razr HD Sony Xperia P LG Optimus 4X HD HTC One S Samsung Galaxy S II Motorola Droid Bionic Motorola Photon 4G Google Nexus S The U11 comes with a pair of fairly comfortable USonic earphones with active noise cancellation in the box with your U11. We were really impressed with the noise cancellation. When music plays, it drowns out the vast majority of background sound from your environment. Movies and TV shows are a lot more immersive with the earphones, too. Price, availability, and warranty You can pre-order the unlocked HTC U11 now from HTC or Amazon for $650. You can also pick it up from Sprint on a two-year contract at $29 per month. It will start shipping on June 9. The HTC U11 comes with a standard limited 2-year warranty that covers manufacturing defects and faulty parts or components, but not accidents. The phone is IP67-rated, which is good because you’re not covered for water damage. Sadly, the U11 is not covered by HTC’s Uh-Oh Protection, which offers a free replacement for cracked screens or water damage when you buy your phone directly from HTC. Our Take We’re conflicted on the HTC U11 design. The liquid glass finish is gorgeous and the build quality is generally high, but fingerprint smudges quickly spoil it. The U11 also feels big, with an average display that has too much border around it. Under the hood, the U11 offers unsurpassed speed and fluidity. The camera is one of the best we’ve used, the audio quality is above average, and we’re satisfied with the battery life. Squeezability is in its infancy, but it’s useful at times and points the way to a possible button-free future. Is there a better alternative? The most popular Android smartphone right now is the Samsung Galaxy S8 and there’s little doubt it outclasses the U11 in the style department, but it will cost you at least $100 more. The identically priced LG G6 is an even closer competitor. It’s not as powerful as the U11, but it has a great wide-angle lens and that new 18:9 screen format. If you’re willing to wait, the OnePlus 5 is likely to offer cutting edge specs for a lower price this summer. How long will it last? The HTC U11 should comfortably last you two years, maybe three. It has the latest flavor of Android with Google Assistant onboard, and HTC’s president of smartphones, Chialin Chang, has confirmed that the handset will be updated with at least the next two major Android versions. It also has the cutting-edge Snapdragon 835 inside, which is Qualcomm’s top chip right now. Based on our testing the U11 is powerful enough to satisfy your every whim for the foreseeable future. Should you buy it? Yes. If you value substance over style, the HTC U11 is easy to recommend. It’s lightning fast, it delivers compelling audio quality, the camera gets excellent results with no fiddling required, and the battery life is solid. Sense Companion complements Google Assistant and Alexa nicely, and Edge Sense is the innovative cherry on top.

Ke Jie’s “horrible experience” against Google’s latest AI experiment was withheld from live broadcast by state censors. As reported by the China Digital Times, the censorship notice dictates that “Regarding the go match between Ke Jie and AlphaGo, no website, without exception, may carry a livestream.” If a livestream had been announced in advance, the notice demanded that the announcement be immediately withdrawn. Go is a 2,000-year-old pastime that has remained largely unchanged from its earliest historic iterations. Competence in playing has been considered a sort of status symbol for countless generations, and the potential for a computer to unseat Ke Jie seems to have been enough to unsettle Chinese censors. The Go champion was himself put off by AlphaGo’s uncanny prowess, saying “I feel like his game is more and more like the ‘Go god.'” He vowed never to play against AlphaGo again — a stark contrast to the bravado of his “Bring it on!” enthusiasm following AlphaGo’s 4-1 victory against South Korean Grandmaster Lee Sedol. Regardless of the government’s wishes, sites like bilibili.com skirted the ban by recreating the game, move by move, on their own Go boards. Meanwhile, Google’s DeepMind YouTube channel has the matches available for interested viewers outside of China. AlphaGo is part of the DeepMind AI project acquired by Google in 2014. It is partially self-taught, having played millions of games against itself in order to master the strategic complexity of the ancient game.

Google now tracks your credit card purchases and connects them to its online profile of you May, 26 2017 Author: Thema Newsroom The search giant wants to know how online ads translate into offline sales Related Use of credit cards in retail food rises in Greece,… Travel hacking tips to help you be a jetsetting ninja… Google’s new ability to match people’s offline credit card purchases to their online lives is a stunning display of surveillance capitalism in action. The capability, which Google unveiled this week, allows the company to connect the dots between the ads that it shows its users and what they end up actually buying. This is a crucial link for Google’s business that, for all of the company’s inventiveness, remains a matter of attracting users to its predominantly free services, collecting user data, and leveraging that data to sell advertising. If Google can show that someone who saw an ad for a furniture store in Google Maps, say, then went and made a big purchase at that store, the store’s owner is much more likely to run more ads. Of course, Google has been able to track your location using Google Maps for a long time. Since 2014, it has used that information to provide advertisers with information on how often people visit their stores. But store visits aren’t purchases, so, as Google said in a blog post on its new service for marketers, it has partnered with “third parties” that give them access to 70 percent of all credit and debit card purchases. So, if you buy stuff with a card, there’s a less than one-in-three chance that Google doesn’t know about it. Google has talked a bit about the lengths it goes to in order to preserve user privacy. A piece in the Washington Post on the new service has the following: Google executives say they are using complex, patent-pending mathematical formulas to protect the privacy of consumers when they match a Google user with a shopper who makes a purchase in a brick-and-mortar store. The mathematical formulas convert people’s names and other purchase information, including the time stamp, location, and the amount of the purchase, into anonymous strings of numbers. The formulas make it impossible for Google to know the identity of the real-world shoppers, and for the retailers to know the identities of Google’s users, said company executives, who called the process “double-blind” encryption. The companies know only that a certain number of matches have been made. In addition, Google does not know what products people bought. Beyond that, us regular folks pretty much have to take it on faith that this system works. Given how few “anonymous” data points are required to identify an individual from credit card data, it’s hard to believe that linking people’s behavior on services as diverse as Gmail, YouTube, Google Maps, and others to offline buying habits couldn’t result in someone’s privacy being compromised, especially if it ever fell into the hands of hackers. But let’s not single Google out. For one thing, we users do willingly hand our personal data over to Google—that’s part of the service agreement (whether we have consented to let credit card companies hand our purchase records over in this way is potentially another matter). And for another, Google isn’t alone: Facebook is engaged in essentially the same practice of marrying online information with our offline lives. So, you know, everyone’s doing it.

At Google I/O 2017, a number of new features were announced for Photos, including suggested sharing based on who's in a certain photo. But for that to work, Google needs to figure out who is who, and now the Photos web app is asking users to identify what they look like. Upon visiting photos.google.com, you may be welcomed by the above screen. Google already uses machine learning wizardry to match faces to people, so all you have to do is select which face is yours. Once you do that, you'll be able to search for "me" in the Photos search to find pictures of yourself. According to a recent teardown, this option should appear at some point in the Photos app as well, but it didn't for me. Presumably, this will be far more useful once the other features announced at Google I/O show up. Let us know in the comments if you have received the pop-up.

I got the pop up just the other day. I can search for "me" in addition to others such as my daughter's name. John Doe I did but for some reason it shows a photo of me from over 6 years ago even though I have plenty of recent photos LoL Corbin Davenport Yep, my picture was an awful photo of me from several years ago. John Doe I was able to change it by going to people then clicking on the picture and even when you choose a picture with a lot of people in it figures out which one is you and zooms in...creepy bozzykid It doesn't matter what photo you choose of yourself. The rest are all linked to you anyways. This isn't replacing your profile pic. John Doe No but some photos it has not figured out its me or at least when I click on me it doesn't show all the pictures of me but it is good enough to find pictures of me when I was a child which is crazy because I changed a lot. Stakoman Is this US only? would be great if you guys made a "how to enable face recognition google photos" post Suicide_Note Use a US VPN to start using the face recognition. Once you get things setup, you can stop using the VPN, though face recognition should still work. rndusrnm479461 You can use a VPN (get tunnelbear cause it's free) for Android, then clear cache, open photos and enable grouping of faces in the settings. Then you can disable VPN. I did this about a year ago and I've had it ever since without any problem both on Android and on the web. bozzykid I believe it uses one of the firsts photos you have stored. It has already linked the rest to you anyways. Régis Knechtel Not always, apparently, cause it used a recent photo for me. I think it's random. Brendapdaniels Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Defenestratus No. Régis Knechtel "his option should appear at some point in the Photos app as well" It asked to chose my face me today in the android app, while I was setting up a new phone. jcopernicus I accidentally closed the prompt...how to I get it back? Corbin Davenport On the web, go to Settings -> Group similar faces, and there should be an option to pick your face. Yatin No, I'm from India Drakenoid Yes, I'm also from India. Naga Sridhar I am from India too, but are you in India? myssi Pop-up recieved, I'm from Pakistan. Tomáš Petrík And I guess we will be left out in the EU, again :/ Indefinite Implosion I'm in NL and got it a few days ago? A day or two after the announcement maybe (crunch time, so days are a blur). I didn't tip because it doesn't do anything right now so hardly seems worthy of a post. roberto.elena Do you already have "group similar faces" activated? If yes, then you will get this update. Tomáš Petrík No, it is disabled for accounts registered in the EU due to some stupid privacy ruling of the EU. roberto.elena I know, but you can activate it using a VPN (or at least that was possible when they launched Google Photos). Once it's activated, you don't need the VPN anymore, and you get all updates related to face recognition features. Nelson Not correct. I'm in Europe and by using Opera VPN plus Google Photos cache clear the feature appeared Suicide_Note Use a US VPN and you can join the party. Tomáš Petrík It's not about VPN this time. Accounts registered in the EU have facial recognition disabled due to some stupid privacy ruling of the EU. Jens Törnblad That's why you activate the feature with a VPN. Suicide_Note Ah, okay. I wasn't aware of that. Definitely sucks. rndusrnm479461 Get tunnelbear for Android. Choose a US vpn. Clear Google Photos cache -> open it -> enable grouping of faces in the settings. You only have to do this once. I did it a year ago and it has worked ever since on all my devices. Tomáš Petrík It's not about VPN this time, though. Accounts registered in the EU have facial recognition disabled due to some stupid privacy ruling of the EU. rndusrnm479461 Really? I registered mine in EU in ~2008 and activated face grouping in early 2016 without problems. henleyb I got it a day or two ago. Was an old photo but searching for 'me' did bring up correct photos for me so that's something. Looking forward to the sharing stuff next. :) Suicide_Note Haven't seen this popup yet, but on a related note, photo books have gone live for me in the Photos app. Fresh360 My coworker purchased an iPhone 7+ yesterday and I was setting up her apps and when I installed Photos this option actually popped up. I immediately went to my S7 to see did I have it and nothing. Joao Letelier Ummm... I have been able to search for "me" since last year on the photos app on my phone. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6ec05347bcd3f095b697a97df58508cf28a8d34b7fc289baa308796bc81cf2b3.jpg Deeco Skynet. slowly, but surely...

Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger Just over 20 years ago was the first time a computer beat a human world champion in a chess match, when IBM’s Deep Blue supercomputer beat Gary Kasparov in a narrow victory of 3½ games to 2½. Just under a decade later, machines were deemed to have conquered the game of chess when Deep Fritz, a piece of software running on a desktop PC, beat 2006 world champion Vladimir Kramnik. Now the ability of computers to take on humanity has taken a step further by mastering the far more complex board game Go, with Google’s AlphaGo program beating world number one Ke Jie twice in a best-of-three series. This signifcant milestone shows just how far computers have come in the past 20 years. DeepBlue’s victory at chess showed machines could rapidly process huge amounts of information, paving the way for the big data revolution we see today. But AlphaGo’s triumph represents the development of real artificial intelligence by a machine that can recognise patterns and learn the best way to respond to them. What’s more, it may signify a new evolution in AI, where computers not only learn how to beat us but can start to teach us as well. Go is considered one of the world’s most complex board games. Like chess, it’s a game of strategy but it also has several key differences that make it much harder for a computer to play. The rules are relatively simple but the strategies involved to play the game are highly complex. It is also much harder to calculate the end position and winner in the game of Go. But is it art? Wu Hong/EPA It has a larger board (a 19x19 grid rather than an 8x8 one) and an unlimited number of pieces, so there are many more ways that the board can be arranged. Whereas chess pieces start in set positions and can each make a limited number of moves each turn, Go starts with a blank board and players can place a piece in any of the 361 free spaces. Each game takes on average twice as many turns as chess and there are six times as many legal move options per turn. Each of these features means you can’t build a Go program using the same techniques as for chess machines. These tend to use a “brute force” approach of analysing the potential of large numbers of possible moves to select the best one. Feng-Hsiung Hsu, one of the key contributors to the DeepBlue team, argued in 2007 that applying this strategy to Go would require a million-fold increase in processing speed over DeepBlue so a computer could analyse 100 trillion positions per second. Learning new moves The strategy used by AlphaGo’s creators at Google subsidiary DeepMind was to create an artificial intelligence program that could learn how to identify favourable moves from useless ones. This meant it wouldn’t have to analyse all the possible moves that could be made at each turn. In preparation for its first match against professional Go player Lee Sedol, AlphaGo analysed around 300m moves made by professional Go players. It then used what are called deep learning and reinforcement learning techniques to develop its own ability to identify favourable moves. Ke Jie: ‘Bet it can’t dance like this though.’ Wu Hong/EPA But this wasn’t enough to enable AlphaGo to defeat highly ranked human players. The software was run on custom microchips specifically designed for machine learning, known as tensor processing units (TPUs), to support very large numbers of computations. This seems similar to the approach used by the designers of DeepBlue, who also developed custom chips for high-volume computation. The stark difference, however, is that DeepBlue’s chips could only be used for playing chess. AlphaGo’s chips run Google’s general-purpose AI framework, Tensorflow, and are also used to power other Google services such as Street View and optimisation tasks in the firm’s data centres. Lesson for us all The other thing that has changed since DeepBlue’s victory is the respect that humans have for their computer opponents. When playing chess computers, it was common for the human players to adopt so-called anti-computer tactics. This involves making conservative moves to prevent the computer from evaluating positions effectively. In his first match against AlphaGo, however, Ke Jie, adopted tactics that had previously been used by his opponent to beat it at its own game. Although this attempt failed, it demonstrates a change in approach for leading human players taking on computers. Instead of trying to stifle the machine, they have begun trying to learn from how it played in the past. In fact, the machine has already influenced the professional game of Go, with grandmasters adopting AlphaGo’s strategy during their tournament matches. This machine has taught humanity something new about a game it has been playing for over 2,500 years, liberating us from the experience of millennia. ‘I don’t like this lesson.’ Wu Hong/EPA What then might the future hold for the AI behind AlphaGo? The success of DeepBlue triggered rapid developments that have directly impacted the techniques applied in big data processing. The benefit of the technology used to implement AlphaGo is that it can already be applied to other problems that require pattern identification. For example, the same techniques have been applied to the detection of cancer and to create robots that can learn to do things like open doors, among many other applications. The underlying framework used in AlphaGo, Google’s TensorFlow, has been made freely available for developers and researchers to build new machine-learning programs using standard computer hardware. More excitingly, combining it with the many computers available through the internet cloud creates the promise of delivering machine-learning supercomputing. When this technology matures then the potential will exist for the creation of self-taught machines in wide-ranging roles that can support complex decision-making tasks. Of course, what may be even more profound are the social impacts of having machines that not only teach themselves but teach us in the process.

Google on Thursday unveiled Data GIF Maker, an online tool designed to make it easier to display relative interest between two topics based on data gleaned from Google's own Internet search trends or other data sources. As explained in a blog post by Simon Rogers, a data editor at Google News Lab, reporters can build data GIFs—short graphical clips from animations and videos—based on Google Search Trends or other data sources. Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter. GIFs, which stands for Graphics Interchange Format, often pop up as the cat video clips that have invaded your Facebook (fb) and Twitter (twtr) feeds. But they can be much more informational if used to illustrate simple data comparisons. Related: Copyright Law Behind a $600 Million Startup and Millennials’ Favorite Form of Expression To demonstrate relative search interest between two topics, reporters can use the Google Trends explore tool to get a figure representing average search interest over time in each topic. The users can then enter those numbers into the GIF maker, add some explanatory text for the each number, and hit a button to generate an exportable GIF that can be embedded in their stories. In his blog, Rogers used a "Peanut Butter" versus "Jelly" comparison to illustrate the tool. Having a sweet tooth, we used "Vanilla" versus "Chocolate" and got this: Google  The tool easy to use and suits simple comparisons between just two terms. However, it does take some time to generate a high-resolution GIF. It's likely Google will add the ability to compare more than two things going forward.

The zeppelin-like craft will be nearly 200 metres (656ft) long and will come to a personal cost of $100 million - $150 million (£77 million - £116 million), reports say. Brin wants to use the vast airship to deliver humanitarian supplies to remote locations while also serving as luxury 'air yacht' for friends and family. Scroll down for video The zeppelin-like craft will come to a personal cost of $100 million - $150 million (£77 million - £116 million), to Google co-founder Sergey Brin (pictured), reports say THE SECRET CRAFT The airship is likely to be nearly 200 meters (656ft) long It is being built in a giant hangar on a Nasa airfield away from the eyes of the public It will deliver supplies and food on humanitarian missions to remote areas It may also serve as a luxury 'air yacht' for Sergey Brin to use privately The project's price tag at $100 million (£77 million) to $150 million (£116 million) It will be funded entirely by Sergey Brin. 'Sergey is pretty innovative and forward looking,' said Igor Pasternak, an airship designer who was involved in the construction of the airship which is currently hidden in a giant hangar. 'Trucks are only as good as your roads, trains can only go where you have rails, and planes need airports. Airships can deliver from point A to point Z without stopping anywhere in between', he said, writes the Guardian. The airship will have internal gas bladders to keep it buoyant and can land in almost any terrain, sources say. The airship is hidden inside Hangar 2 at the Nasa Ames Research Centre in Silicon Valley. Insiders say Brin decided to build his airship around three years ago after visiting Ames regularly. The craft takes up much of the vast hangar where it is being built. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Forget wind turbines: Giant KITES flying 300 metres in the...

Share this article Share 46 shares 'Sorry, I don't have anything to say about this topic right now', Brin wrote in an email when asked for comment by Bloomberg last month.  Alan Weston, who previously led Nasa's Ames programmes is leading the project and has spoken about the possibility of airships carrying freight. 'New airship technologies have the promise to reduce the cost of moving things per ton-mile by up to an order of magnitude', he said in a 2013 interview. Sources say that Brin was inspired by old photos of the USS Macon, a lighter-than-air rigid airship that was the Navy's last flying aircraft carrier, used in the 1930s. It was operated by the US Navy and served as a 'flying aircraft carrier' THE USS MACON  The USS Macon crashed off the coast of California eighty years ago. The Macon was operated by the US Navy and served as a 'flying aircraft carrier,' designed to carry five biplanes for scouting and training.  It was returning to Mountain View, California in February 1935 when it ran into a storm off Point Sur. Wind shear caused structural damage, puncturing gas cells and then a leak. The damage meant the 785-foot airship gently floated down into Monterey Bay off Point Sur in California, taking around 20 minutes to settle. 'A larger airship can reduce costs a lot more than a smaller ship, but there's design of a class of vehicles that can lift up to 500 tons that could be actually more fuel-efficient than even a truck', he added. With these airships the overall lift of the vehicle is equivalent to the weight of air displaced by the helium. 'And as you change that, you can control the amount of buoyancy that the vehicle has', said Mr Weston, who did not respond to Bloomberg's request for comment. Sources say that Brin was inspired by old photos of the USS Macon, a lighter-than-air rigid airship that was the Navy's last flying aircraft carrier, used in the 1930s. The airship crashed off the coast of California eighty years ago when it was caught in a storm over Port Sur, California, killing two crew members. The Macon was operated by the US Navy and served as a 'flying aircraft carrier,' designed to carry five biplanes for scouting and training. The dirigible had been damaged in a previous incident in the mountains above Arizona.

MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe. It features 24 hours of battery life and claims to be a 'mini-disco on the move'. But does it live up to the claim? Samsung's Galaxy S8: A hefty price tag and a dumb personal assistant Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning, but its $100 price hike is hard to swallow. Overall the S8 is for those who want elegance - and are willing to pay for it. Affordable, robust and surprisingly responsive: Samsung's Galaxy A5 With the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 having been pushed back, South Korea-based Samsung has plugged the gap with the Samsung Galaxy A5, a high-end device with a mid-range price tag. Is it really worth paying £280 for Nintendo's Switch? MailOnline's verdict While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan.

The company mentioned that it has third-party partnerships, which can capture approximately 70% of credit and debit card transactions in the United States. However, Google did not furnish more details on how the new service works or what it is analyzing records of debit and credit cards, as indicated by this Washington Post report. The publication added that the company has developed “a new, custom encryption technology that ensures users’ data remains private, secure, and anonymous.” Google’s algorithms will mask people’s names, purchase information, timestamp, and location into anonymous strings of numbers, MIT Technology Review said. Note that Google has been able to track location for years through Google Maps and in 2014, it started a marketing service where it told advertisers information on how often people visit a store. The latest tool is blurring the line between the physical and online world. This will allow marketers to measure in-store revenue along with store visits which were thrown up by  Search results and Shopping ads. If a business collects email information at the point of sale for their loyalty programme, the business can add transactions into Google AdWords or through a third-party partner to show more targeted advertising. YES Bank-Cashkaro tie-up  Advertisement Note that in India, private sector lender YES Bank partnered with cashback and coupon site Cashkaro which does something similar to what Google is attempting. Through the partnership, YES Bank will send card customers personalized offers and targeted deals based on their shopping patterns. YES Bank builds the profile of a customer for marketing while Cashkaro does the initial targeting where retailers can set parameters on what kind of demographic they would like to attract. The parameters can include age, location, spending patterns, etc. YES Bank will send promotions to cards/customers which match the parameters.   00 Related #Advertising #Google #Internet #Marketing #Mobile Related Exclusive: SVG Media buys Komli Media’s India business Twitter launches video ad tool First View in India & APAC Mobile Marketing Association appoints PepsiCo’s D Shivakumar as India chairman Updated: Biting in the Facebook mobile pie, Google looks to buy InMobi: report Komli Media spins off RevX as a separate company; RevX raises $4M Times Internet’s Spotlight to offer content solutions for marketers < Previous Tata to buy back NTT Docomo’s 26% stake in TTSL; legal tussle ends Daily Newsletter Sponsored All Introducing our Digital Payments in India Report: Demonetization Edition – #Ad Why the Indian startup scenario needs an event like STARup 2017 – #Ad Take your venture to the next level with Conquest 2017! – #Ad 5th SpicyIP Fellowship 2017-18: Applications Close on March 10 – #Ad Final call for #NAMApolicy: Fake News, Rumors & Online Content Regulation, 22nd Feb, Delhi – #ad More in Advertising Google will be able to collect cards purchase information and link it to a profile AIM listed mobile ad-tech firm Taptica enters India Zee Entertainment domestic ad revenue grows by 8.1% to Rs794.4 crores in Q4-17 YES Bank and Cashkaro launch personalised cashbacks; How it works Times Internet’s Gulshan Verma on Colombia Audience Network’s approach to competition, data sharing Digital Jobs Hiring Marketing Manager & Executive in Pune Require Hardware Engineer For Cashgate Scandal Malawi Compositor Executive – Social media marketing Area Sales Manager Comments Anand: I have decided I will close my bank account give...

[Update: False alert] Google says gifting in the Play Store is "Infeasible," marks it as "Won't Fix" in the Issue Tracker Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 4:14am PDTMay 26, 2017 13 Plus 1 on G+ 61 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares117 Google News Update 1: 2017/05/26 5:03am PDT False alert. Issue was closed in 2013 because it was submitted to the wrong tracker. You know how almost every app or software store lets you buy apps and gift them to someone else? Well, you better put your dreams of ever doing that on Android to rest. Or burying them under 10 feet of disappointment. Someone at Google recently took a look at the Issue Tracker, saw the issue labeled "Implement Gifts within Android Market," which has been added back in 2010 when the Play Store was still the Android Market and which has gathered over 1100 stars and hundreds of comments from users requesting app gifting, and decided to be the bearer of bad news because you know what, this is "infeasible" and Google "won't fix" it. But the writing has been on the wall for a few days; we could have seen it coming if we had been playing closer attention. Credit gifting disappeared from the US Play Store on May 16, and then the support page for Google Play gift cards and promo codes was updated on May 17 to replace the "Google Play credit gifts" section with "Google Play book gifts." That change clearly shows that credit gifting was completely gone, not a glitch, and that from now on, you can only gift music and books, but definitely not credit. Above: Pre-May 17. Below: Current support page. Put 1 and 1 together and you understand that the future of gifting or buying someone credit on Google Play is grim. You better kill your dreams of purchasing apps/games for your friends or employees, gifting a niece or nephew some Play credit for new games educational apps, or encouraging your parents to use a certain app by buying it for them. I still can't wrap my head around the fact that Google, the behemoth that can make AI understand every word I say and predict the news I want to read and the traffic on my way to work, is saying that app gifting is "Infeasible" when other app stores have clearly managed to make it feasible. I'm sure there's a reason, but I can't think of any that would be unsurmountable for Google but not for others, or any that would apply to apps and games but not to books and music. The latter traditionally carry a lot more licensing and legislative limits than apps/games. As a consolation, you can turn to Google Play gift cards and Family Sharing in the countries where they're available to share or send apps and games to others. Update 1: 2017/05/26 5:03am PDT False alert. Issue was closed in 2013 because it was submitted to the wrong tracker. I apologize for the false alert. It looks like the issue was actually marked as "Infeasible" back in 2013 because it was posted to the wrong issue tracker and couldn't be fixed by the AOSP team but had to be submitted to the Google Product Forums instead. The issue has just picked up a lot of comments recently, which brought it to the attention of our tipster and thus our inbox, and with the recent disappearance of the Play credit gifting option, we incorrectly assumed there was a link there. What remains true though is that credit gifting is completely gone and you can only send music and books now. There's no proof that app/game gifting wouldn't make an appearance at some point, so I suppose there's a silver lining somewhere.

Rita El Khoury Yup, as shown in the screenshots, Books and Music gifting is available. But credit buying for others or gifting apps/games is now a dead dream. FaultException It was marked infeasible because it was on the wrong issue tracker, and it was back in 2013, not recently at all. See comment #108 on the issue where it was marked. Suicide_Note Not a big deal, really. demarcmj Agree. Low tech is better... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/276e854598d2a91aa3a795a84e4ecbec4f4f587c8e3da3c55b968c90ad4ec402.jpg Kristian Ivanov https://gfycat.com/RevolvingEdibleCivet h4rr4r Totally wrong article actually. This issue tracker is not for the play store. Thomas Gladdines If I ever had to implement gifting apps I would make it an in app purchase and then simply show a 100% off coupon.

Nicholas Conrad Witty comment status: won't fix. Kristian Ivanov It was going to be awesome though, it involved old people, polar bears and a skateboard...oh well, at some point in the future when this is in the news again I'll post it :c Daniel But there's a good reason for it, it's not just that Google is evil: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36916787#comment108 Status: Won't Fix (Infeasible) This report applies to a mobile Google application or service, and the issue tracker where you reported it specializes in issues within the Open Source source code of the Android platform. We are not able to provide support for Google products in this issue tracker. Please report this issue in the appropriate Google Product Forum at https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/en/ God of chaos It all makes sense now! demarcmj Reading!?! What is this sorcery? Rita El Khoury Ugh... My ctrl+F skills failed me, I admit. Also my little knowledge of how the Issue Tracker works. I could see when or why it was marked as Infeasible so I incorrectly assumed it was now, when the comments flared up again. Nicholas Conrad Don't get down on yourself Rita, we all have days like this at work. Even knowing the premise of the article was mistaken, I'd rather read it again than another JRE video summary article. Rita El Khoury Thanks... I guess?! demarcmj The issue tracker is partly at fault. If you hover over the resolution in that side panel, the mouse turns to the finger like it's a link... but clicking on it doesn't do anything. You would think it would take you to the resolution post for more details. But nope. Rita El Khoury Exactly. I was thinking there's something wrong with Chrome or my connection and restarted it, but clicking wouldn't take me anywhere, so I was like... well, seems like this doesn't show an explanation. demarcmj Doesn't work in Firefox or IE either (haven't tried it in Edge, or whatever they're calling the Windows 10 browser). Do they have an issue tracker for the issue tracker? Mark R. Andrachek, Jr. No. But they might have a product forum. Which nobody at google will ever check, and some "community volunteer" will suggest your reboot your PC. Rita El Khoury Arghhhhh... You're right. Many of us here at AndroidPolice looked at this and we failed to see that it was marked as Infeasible in 2013. I'll edit the post to ad that info. In our defense, many of us at AP looked at this tip and thought the status change was new, especially with the way comments were flaring up on it in the past day and with all the changes to Google Play credit gifting. Daniel No problem! :) Thanks for adding the info FaultException It wasn't marked as infeasble recently, it was marked in 2013, because it's the wrong forum (the tracker is for AOSP/Android itself) See comment #108: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36916787#comment108 demarcmj Yup... and most of the comments since then are people bickering about not wanting to receive emails every time someone comments on the issue. Real productive thread they have going on over there [eyeroll] Zomby2D I'm guilty of contributing to the email pollution. I had the issue starred but I haven't been getting email notifications for the longest time from this. I don't even remember noticing that it had been closed all that time ago. I just started receiving notifications again last week and figured that the ticket being closed was the reason why people were suddenly complaining. Having the reason for closing it lost in the sea of comments didn't help. Rita El Khoury Right. Fixing the post to reflect that. Dennis Ulijn I can also see the fact that people buy 100 apps with a stolen credit card and sell them on the black market, like G2A or G2play. You talk about a lot of other stores doing this already, but the uplay and steam store have had a lot of problems with this and still have those problems, without a good way to combat it. Besides that, how will you solve the VAT system? Who pays? I can see how a lot of people want it, and of course i don't mind having the possibility, but there are more problems than 'just implement it'. Carson Saldanha I think it's due to security reasons but that sucks... h4rr4r Read the update! couldn't be fixed by the AOSP team but had to be submitted to the Google Product Forums instead. h4rr4r Good retraction, update! Rita El Khoury "because it was posted to the wrong issue tracker and couldn't be fixed by the AOSP team but had to be submitted to the Google Product Forums instead." Isn't that enough of an explanation? h4rr4r I was at first talking about just the update line. But on reading the full explanation I thought it was pretty good. Ideally the update line at the top would say something about why not when. Rita El Khoury That's an automatically truncated blurb that our WordPress theme does at the top. I'll manually change it to clarify that in a bit, I was just in a rush to update the post before we got more comments telling us how wrong we were. h4rr4r YAY! krazyfrog Apple has had App Store gifting for all content since years now and somehow it's "infeasible" for Google. 🙄 Rita El Khoury Refresh your page ;) Peter World Citizen I had seen people got fired for lesser mistakes. ;) Rita El Khoury We'd be firing half the AP team and Artem. Many of us looked at this and didn't notice. Guess the post I/O haziness hasn't dissipated yet. Mark R. Andrachek, Jr. Google's Issue Tracker recently got a re-vamp. They can control, I'm sure, what the closed states are for things in their own tracker. They really need to have a closed/won't fix state that indicates that the issue has been raised in the wrong venue going forward, if they want to keep the issue tracker limited to just AOSP. These kind of things keep coming up in the AOSP issue tracker and _will continue_ to come up in the AOSP tracker if nothing changes. They don't expose issue tracking for anything else. Finding these product forums at all, much less the right one, is an exercise in madness. And then when you do find them, they're typically staffed by unpaid community volunteers. Chances are high that nobody from Google will actually see your issue, much less respond. It's like shouting into the void. Funem They should just make it so you can purchase an item, then chose to install it or create a sort of promo code which you can then just give to someone to use. They could tie it in to the promo code system they have now. Until its claimed you could still retain the option to install it by using the code yourself. prwnd Dear Community, I suggested this and I apologise because I did not find it was changed in 2013.

Some of it should be diverted to a journalism fund. The Conversation Published 6:00 PM, May 25, 2017 Updated 6:00 PM, May 25, 2017 IMPRINT. Online giants Facebook and Google changed the way people consume information, and somewhere along the way, journalism itself. Illustration by Nico Villarete/Rappler This article originally appeared in The Conversation - Australia edition. There was a fascinating moment towards the end of Wednesday's hearings of the Senate Inquiry into the Future of Public Interest Journalism. Journalist Michael West was at the stand. West’s experience is in many ways emblematic. Once a marquee investigator for Fairfax Media with multiple scoops to his name, West was made redundant in one of Fairfax’s seemingly endless rounds of job shedding in recent years. He used his redundancy cheque to found a startup, MichaelWest.com.au, and took a position as an adjunct professor at the University of Sydney. West has long been a dogged investigator of corporate excess. He pointed out to the hearing that articles he and Neil Chenoweth wrote while at Fairfax several years ago had led directly to a Senate inquiry into corporate tax avoidance. The findings of that inquiry – that multinationals like Google and Apple were sending most of their Australian revenues offshore, and paying just cents in the dollar in tax – resulted in tighter laws for global corporations hiding profits in offshore accounts. “As a result of that, in the budget last week, [Treasurer] Scott Morrison said that they were expecting $2.9 billion rather than $2 billion, as originally anticipated, from just seven companies,” West said. "So, as a result of political action from the Senate and public interest journalism, there is a billion dollars cash – bang!" West added that sources in the Australian Tax Office (ATO) told him that “there are behavioural changes in the way that multinational companies are regarding this issue of how aggressive they can be on the tax front” and that the ATO is “expecting billions of dollars to flow from that”. Committee member Senator Nick Xenophon then quipped: "If only you got one-tenth of one per cent of that, Mr. West." Public interest journalism is important for many reasons, including the vital role it plays in holding the powerful to account. But few would have predicted it would play such an instrumental role in plugging Australia’s leaky company tax base. The senate inquiry comes at an important time. With Fairfax Media at play in the stock market and yet more redundancies at the big newspaper publisher announced, for-profit journalism in Australia has never seemed so vulnerable. The market dominance of the two US tech giants Google and Facebook is such that they constitute an effective duopoly on online Australian media. These two companies now control the majority of the eyeballs of ordinary Australians. A single graph from market research firm Nielsen best illustrates this. DOMINANCE CHART. Facebook and Google dominate the online consumption of Australians. Graph shows sessions per person plotted against active reach; circle size indicates unique audience. Illustration from Nielsen Digital Ratings, March 2017 You can see that Facebook and Google have reached almost total saturation of the Australian audience in terms of “active reach” (the percentage of people accessing a particular site or platform). Not only do they have the two largest audiences, but they also soak up the most time spent online. Google’s true size is actually obscured by the fact that its subsidiary YouTube is broken out; YouTube and Facebook are ranked one and two for streaming in Australia. When it comes to advertising, the duopoly is just as entrenched. A tweet by analyst Jason Kint went viral in late 2016. He estimated that Facebook and Google’s collective share of global digital advertising revenue was about 70%. All the growth in advertising revenue is being captured by the two duopolists; astonishingly, ad revenue outside the twin giants was actually falling. Given that advertising is increasingly digital and online, the two companies have quickly established market dominance. Digital Ad Revenues Grow 19% Year-Over-Year in First Half of 2016, Hitting Landmark High of $32.7 Billion https://t.co/Tegqz2G1JM— iab (@iab) November 1, 2016 Australian regulators have been slow to react. While Google is finally beginning to pay a meaningful amount of company tax here, there is apparently no appetite amongst competition or media regulators to come to grips with the digital duopoly. After the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission's (ACCC) embarassing defeat in the High Court in its 2013 case against Google over whether its sponsored links constituted misleading and deceptive conduct, there has been no further attempt to address the company’s market power. When it comes to media regulation, the touch is even lighter. The majority of the content streamed in Australia through YouTube and Netflix is foreign; the Turnbull government has no plans to implement local content quotas on digital streaming. Communications Minister Mitch Fifield has just announced a sweeping deregulation of the existing, weak media policy regime. Google and Facebook are also increasingly important in the distribution of news. The US presidential election and the British referendum on leaving Europe were both marked by massive digital advertising campaigns, often from parties outside the democratic process, that sought to directly influence the outcome. The flap over “fake news” has been dismissed by some as merely the latest example of an eternal phenomenon. That would seem to underestimate the problem. The rise of Facebook and Google as aggregators has made it much easier than before to mimic the appearance and feel of legitimate news sites to produce authentic-looking, hyper-partisan news fakery. A BuzzFeed investigation in 2016 found that “fake news” was shared more widely than real news in the last month of the US presidential election campaign. While some was authored by Macedonian teenagers, much was politically motivated and funded by unknown sources. FACTUAL FIGURES. BuzzFeed analysis of Facebook news pages, mainstream, left and right-leaning categories. Right Wing News has more followers than any of the mainstream pages, and according to Buzzfeed produces 10% ‘mostly false’ reports (red bar). Chart by BuzzFeed News. The Data & Society Research Institute has recently published an authoritative report concluding that "the spread of false or misleading information is having real and negative effects on the public consumption of news." What can be done? As the inquiry heard this week, advertising once paid for muscular news organisations in the private sector. It doesn’t any more. The dominance of the aggregators now poses a real challenge to the continued existence of a robust fourth estate, outside of publicly funded media. Still, while regulators have failed to keep up with the rapid pace of industry change, there are models available to address the current malaise. The future of public-interest journalism and the question of what to do about Google and Facebook have been examined in detail in previous government inquiries. In 2011 and 2012, the Gillard government commissioned the Independent Media Inquiry, chaired by Ray Finkelstein, and the Convergence Review, chaired by Glen Boreham. In the feverish atmosphere of the late Gillard government, neither report gained any political traction. Hardly any of their recommendations were taken up. That’s a shame, because they included some valuable suggestions. Local content quotas for free-to-air television are set at 55% in prime time. Rather than impose quotas on overseas digital media companies, Boreham suggested the idea of a “converged content production fund” – partly funded by a levy on them. It could support a range of journalism funding pools, just as the Australia Council or Screen Australia currently distribute funding for particular goals. (It could support, for instance, programs for investigative journalism, grants to news publishers, funding for community newsrooms, and so on). Finkelstein’s inquiry recommended the government consider a public interest journalism fund that would directly subsidize news organisations to conduct investigative journalism. He argued: "The subsidy could be defined as a percentage of the wage bill of dedicated investigative journalism units established by publishers. It would be paid annually on the basis of eligible payroll cost in the preceding year." We don’t need to reinvent the wheel. We could levy Google and Facebook say, 25% of their domestic advertising revenue and redirect this to fund Australian journalism and other content. Doing so would take Australia towards a more European model of media regulation and subsidy, in which the state plays a prominent role in feeding the hand that bites it. Countries like France and Norway directly fund for-profit media companies, and yet still maintain media diversity and freedom of expression. Norway’s recent bipartisan Commission of Media Diversity, for instance, recommended direct subsidies and tax breaks for newspapers and broadcasters, as well as grants to online media and investigative journalists. While many journalists remain understandably uncomfortable about state funding of the private media, such an outcome may be preferable to the current trend towards declining trust, vanishing scrutiny and fewer and fewer paid jobs in journalism. – Rappler.com Filed under:Google•digital advertising•digital advertising giants•journalism fund.•online advertising•online giants advertising•online journalism•Facebook HOW DOES THIS STORY MAKE YOU FEEL?

The company has managed to reach this number in about two years of its official launch. Apart from providing free unlimited cloud storage, the app comes with machine learning features making it far more intuitive than most photo management apps. At the recent Google I/O developer conference, Google had announced a new update for Photos which includes a bunch of new features. One of them is a social feature called Suggested Sharing. This is step ahead of Google’s facial recognition mechanisms that have been around for a while. The app can now suggest which photo(s) you should share with your friends and family. The feature is similar to the one on Facebook’s standalone private sharing app, Moments. The Photos app will be able to identify the contacts that are in your photos and will then prompt you to share your photos with them. This notification also pops up shortly after you take a photo and once you respond, it automatically shares the photo with the people that it has identified. In case they don’t have the Google Photos app, it can send an SMS notification. With the ‘Shared Libraries’ feature users can automatically share all or a certain selection of photos with specified people. Once you turn this setting on, it will automatically share photos with the designated contacts. If you don’t want to share all of your pictures, you can choose to turn on a feature which will only share photos containing a particular contact. Lastly, the Photos app will suggest some of your best shots and offer you to get them printed as a photo books. The 7-inch softcover or a 9-inch hardcover book each of which can have about 40 photos selected by the app. The softcover will cost $9.99 (Rs 650 approx) and the hardcover will cost $19.99 (Rs 1,300 approx). By default it will come with 20 pages and each additional page will cost an extra $0.35 (Rs 23 approx) for softcover books, and $0.65 (Rs 43 approx) on hardcover books.

The image above illustrates just one attack vector, clickjacking – where the user thinks they are okaying one thing while invisibly okaying something else. For illustrative purposes, the researchers have made the real action visible behind the overlay, but in real use (seen in the video below) the permission box would be invisible to the user … These attacks allow a malicious app to completely control the UI feedback loop and take over the device — without giving the user a chance to notice the malicious activity. These attacks only require two permissions that, in case the app is installed from the Play Store, the user does not need to explicitly grant and for which she is not even notified. Our user study indicates that these attacks are practical. These attacks affect all recent versions of Android (including the latest version, Android 7.1.2), and they are yet to be fixed. The researchers from UC Santa Barbara and Georgia Tech disclosed their detailed findings to Google. Engadget reports a Google spokesperson stating that an update prevents the installation of the apps. We’ve been in close touch with the researchers and, as always, we appreciate their efforts to help keep our users safer. We have updated Google Play Protect — our security services on all Android devices with Google Play — to detect and prevent the installation of these apps. Prior to this report, we had already built new security protections into Android O that will further strengthen our protection from these issues, moving forward. However, the researcher say that Google’s fix is only a partial one. Google implemented a partial fix (only on Android 7.1.2): “on top” overlays do not appear anymore whenever an app’s permission list is shown. However, this is only used for “normal” permissions, and not for “special” permissions, such as “draw on top” and a11y. This is problematic: since the “clickjacking → a11y” is still possible, a malicious app can use the “Phone Unlocking (while keeping the screen off) attack” to enable these permissions while keeping the screen off, thus making the silent installation of a God-mode app still practical. The team says that all the attacks described remain practical. Ben Lovejoy @benlovejoy Guides Android Breaking news for Android. Get the latest on apps, carriers, devices, and more!

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE There is no rocket science if you wish to be an expert in the world of content marketing, but how is the question? Yes, we all know and promote the thought content is the king, but apart from this, there are several other factors which can make your content marketing campaign, a success. It is evident that Googles ranking algorithm has made many once successful SEO practices have become irrelevant. Googles attacks against traditional SEO methods have closed many mediocre content marketing institutions. Gone are the days when search engine optimisation meant stuff a keyword in the title, subheaders, alt tags, slug, meta-description, and body of an article, and you successfully land your content on the first page of Google. It has also been noticed commonly content marketers dive haphazardly in the execution part with a minimal groundwork on making the strategy. 2017 is a year where content marketing is predicted to play a larger role in digital marketing initiatives than ever before. There are some general guidelines that will genuinely help you to put your strategy in place and maintain the momentum effectively. 1) A great content bank and dedicated content creators All the efforts of creating a good marketing strategy go in vain if you do not give the desired attention to your content bank and fail to hire someone who is a seasoned professional in content creation. The person should understand your thrust and nerve to create the capturing content. 2) Video content will be more relevant Video content platforms like Instagram, Snapchat, and YouTube will continue to remain successful, and video content will grow in importance as part of a companys content marketing plan. Live streaming features by Facebook will also continue to be in vogue. Video content is also great for boosting UX metrics. 3) No end to reading and research As a content creating company it is mandatory to be an avid reader and spend much of your time in reading on different platforms of social media, message boards, blogs, review sitesanywhere potential leads could be hanging out onlineand follow closely to understand what theyre talking about and what content is being sold to us. The success of content marketing lies in engaging with your audience. This avid research can help you set the tone of your content from time to time. 4) Put in joint efforts while brainstorming A single mind can only crop up or think of ideas and concepts to an extent. Then why not make your team sit together and do a collective brainstorming to generate a wide array of ideas. It is a centre stage act that creative brainstorming should take place to solve a significant internal or external challenge. It has its advantage as when you get your team together to collaborate and creatively solve a problem; there are many positive things that come about. It is seen that teammates are more open to sharing ideas to one & another and seeking advice on individual projects during a brainstorming session & it improves the teams ability to think outside the box. 5) The distribution pattern Sending mass emails are not enough these days, you have to market them as well. People consume information in so many ways that if you create content for only one channel or in a single format, you will miss a large chunk of your potential audience. Follow the drill of creating content for every channel with a strategy through which you will be communicating with your audience. Every platform has its uniqueness and serves different audiences depending on the factors like age, gender, demography, education, etc. Multiple channels and their content formats are different and must be handled carefully as they are unique in strengths and limitations. You can be a winner if you thoroughly understand the features of every channel and the dos and donts to be followed. To conclude, create better and unique content and be effective in presenting it timely to your audience. Be alert and proactive for any last minute redemptions or breaking the big story in no seconds. http://www.mavcommgroup.com   Contact Info nitesh awasthi Mavcomm Consulting Pvt. Ltd.

[Update: False alert] Google says gifting in the Play Store is "Infeasible," marks it as "Won't Fix" in the Issue Tracker Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 4:14am PDTMay 26, 2017 13 Plus 1 on G+ 61 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares117 Google News Update 1: 2017/05/26 5:03am PDT False alert. Issue was closed in 2013 because it was submitted to the wrong tracker. You know how almost every app or software store lets you buy apps and gift them to someone else? Well, you better put your dreams of ever doing that on Android to rest. Or burying them under 10 feet of disappointment. Someone at Google recently took a look at the Issue Tracker, saw the issue labeled "Implement Gifts within Android Market," which has been added back in 2010 when the Play Store was still the Android Market and which has gathered over 1100 stars and hundreds of comments from users requesting app gifting, and decided to be the bearer of bad news because you know what, this is "infeasible" and Google "won't fix" it. But the writing has been on the wall for a few days; we could have seen it coming if we had been playing closer attention. Credit gifting disappeared from the US Play Store on May 16, and then the support page for Google Play gift cards and promo codes was updated on May 17 to replace the "Google Play credit gifts" section with "Google Play book gifts." That change clearly shows that credit gifting was completely gone, not a glitch, and that from now on, you can only gift music and books, but definitely not credit. Above: Pre-May 17. Below: Current support page. Put 1 and 1 together and you understand that the future of gifting or buying someone credit on Google Play is grim. You better kill your dreams of purchasing apps/games for your friends or employees, gifting a niece or nephew some Play credit for new games educational apps, or encouraging your parents to use a certain app by buying it for them. I still can't wrap my head around the fact that Google, the behemoth that can make AI understand every word I say and predict the news I want to read and the traffic on my way to work, is saying that app gifting is "Infeasible" when other app stores have clearly managed to make it feasible. I'm sure there's a reason, but I can't think of any that would be unsurmountable for Google but not for others, or any that would apply to apps and games but not to books and music. The latter traditionally carry a lot more licensing and legislative limits than apps/games. As a consolation, you can turn to Google Play gift cards and Family Sharing in the countries where they're available to share or send apps and games to others. Update 1: 2017/05/26 5:03am PDT False alert. Issue was closed in 2013 because it was submitted to the wrong tracker. I apologize for the false alert. It looks like the issue was actually marked as "Infeasible" back in 2013 because it was posted to the wrong issue tracker and couldn't be fixed by the AOSP team but had to be submitted to the Google Product Forums instead. The issue has just picked up a lot of comments recently, which brought it to the attention of our tipster and thus our inbox, and with the recent disappearance of the Play credit gifting option, we incorrectly assumed there was a link there. What remains true though is that credit gifting is completely gone and you can only send music and books now. There's no proof that app/game gifting wouldn't make an appearance at some point, so I suppose there's a silver lining somewhere.

Rita El Khoury Yup, as shown in the screenshots, Books and Music gifting is available. But credit buying for others or gifting apps/games is now a dead dream. FaultException It was marked infeasible because it was on the wrong issue tracker, and it was back in 2013, not recently at all. See comment #108 on the issue where it was marked. Suicide_Note Not a big deal, really. demarcmj Agree. Low tech is better... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/276e854598d2a91aa3a795a84e4ecbec4f4f587c8e3da3c55b968c90ad4ec402.jpg Kristian Ivanov https://gfycat.com/RevolvingEdibleCivet h4rr4r Totally wrong article actually. This issue tracker is not for the play store. Thomas Gladdines If I ever had to implement gifting apps I would make it an in app purchase and then simply show a 100% off coupon. Dirk Google's New Logo Leaked https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d76f12396d72e618315517d469ee19d7f2a28065b296266f029594216b2e0728.png Kristian Ivanov I was thinking of posting a really witty comment about this, but the disappointment level was so low that I kind'a don't feel it's worth the effort. Nicholas Conrad Witty comment status: won't fix. Kristian Ivanov It was going to be awesome though, it involved old people, polar bears and a skateboard...oh well, at some point in the future when this is in the news again I'll post it :c Daniel But there's a good reason for it, it's not just that Google is evil: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36916787#comment108 Status: Won't Fix (Infeasible) This report applies to a mobile Google application or service, and the issue tracker where you reported it specializes in issues within the Open Source source code of the Android platform. We are not able to provide support for Google products in this issue tracker. Please report this issue in the appropriate Google Product Forum at https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/en/ God of chaos It all makes sense now! demarcmj Reading!?! What is this sorcery? Rita El Khoury Ugh... My ctrl+F skills failed me, I admit. Also my little knowledge of how the Issue Tracker works. I could see when or why it was marked as Infeasible so I incorrectly assumed it was now, when the comments flared up again. Nicholas Conrad Don't get down on yourself Rita, we all have days like this at work. Even knowing the premise of the article was mistaken, I'd rather read it again than another JRE video summary article. Rita El Khoury Thanks... I guess?! demarcmj The issue tracker is partly at fault. If you hover over the resolution in that side panel, the mouse turns to the finger like it's a link... but clicking on it doesn't do anything. You would think it would take you to the resolution post for more details. But nope. Rita El Khoury Exactly. I was thinking there's something wrong with Chrome or my connection and restarted it, but clicking wouldn't take me anywhere, so I was like... well, seems like this doesn't show an explanation. demarcmj Doesn't work in Firefox or IE either (haven't tried it in Edge, or whatever they're calling the Windows 10 browser). Do they have an issue tracker for the issue tracker? Mark R. Andrachek, Jr. No. But they might have a product forum. Which nobody at google will ever check, and some "community volunteer" will suggest your reboot your PC. Rita El Khoury Arghhhhh... You're right. Many of us here at AndroidPolice looked at this and we failed to see that it was marked as Infeasible in 2013. I'll edit the post to ad that info. In our defense, many of us at AP looked at this tip and thought the status change was new, especially with the way comments were flaring up on it in the past day and with all the changes to Google Play credit gifting. Daniel No problem! :) Thanks for adding the info FaultException It wasn't marked as infeasble recently, it was marked in 2013, because it's the wrong forum (the tracker is for AOSP/Android itself) See comment #108: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36916787#comment108 demarcmj Yup... and most of the comments since then are people bickering about not wanting to receive emails every time someone comments on the issue. Real productive thread they have going on over there [eyeroll] Zomby2D I'm guilty of contributing to the email pollution. I had the issue starred but I haven't been getting email notifications for the longest time from this. I don't even remember noticing that it had been closed all that time ago. I just started receiving notifications again last week and figured that the ticket being closed was the reason why people were suddenly complaining. Having the reason for closing it lost in the sea of comments didn't help. Rita El Khoury Right. Fixing the post to reflect that. Dennis Ulijn I can also see the fact that people buy 100 apps with a stolen credit card and sell them on the black market, like G2A or G2play. You talk about a lot of other stores doing this already, but the uplay and steam store have had a lot of problems with this and still have those problems, without a good way to combat it. Besides that, how will you solve the VAT system? Who pays? I can see how a lot of people want it, and of course i don't mind having the possibility, but there are more problems than 'just implement it'. Carson Saldanha I think it's due to security reasons but that sucks... h4rr4r Read the update! couldn't be fixed by the AOSP team but had to be submitted to the Google Product Forums instead. h4rr4r Good retraction, update! Rita El Khoury "because it was posted to the wrong issue tracker and couldn't be fixed by the AOSP team but had to be submitted to the Google Product Forums instead." Isn't that enough of an explanation? h4rr4r I was at first talking about just the update line. But on reading the full explanation I thought it was pretty good. Ideally the update line at the top would say something about why not when. Rita El Khoury That's an automatically truncated blurb that our WordPress theme does at the top. I'll manually change it to clarify that in a bit, I was just in a rush to update the post before we got more comments telling us how wrong we were. h4rr4r YAY! krazyfrog Apple has had App Store gifting for all content since years now and somehow it's "infeasible" for Google. 🙄 Rita El Khoury Refresh your page ;) Peter World Citizen I had seen people got fired for lesser mistakes. ;) Rita El Khoury We'd be firing half the AP team and Artem. Many of us looked at this and didn't notice. Guess the post I/O haziness hasn't dissipated yet. Mark R. Andrachek, Jr. Google's Issue Tracker recently got a re-vamp. They can control, I'm sure, what the closed states are for things in their own tracker. They really need to have a closed/won't fix state that indicates that the issue has been raised in the wrong venue going forward, if they want to keep the issue tracker limited to just AOSP. These kind of things keep coming up in the AOSP issue tracker and _will continue_ to come up in the AOSP tracker if nothing changes. They don't expose issue tracking for anything else. Finding these product forums at all, much less the right one, is an exercise in madness. And then when you do find them, they're typically staffed by unpaid community volunteers. Chances are high that nobody from Google will actually see your issue, much less respond. It's like shouting into the void. Funem They should just make it so you can purchase an item, then chose to install it or create a sort of promo code which you can then just give to someone to use. They could tie it in to the promo code system they have now. Until its claimed you could still retain the option to install it by using the code yourself. prwnd Dear Community, I suggested this and I apologise because I did not find it was changed in 2013.

World Trademark Review Login Reset password Toggle navigation Home Home Magazine Blog Market intelligence Top TM lawyers WTR 300 Research Legal updates Events Directory Media adidas, Amazon and Apple team members head up list of the world’s leading corporate trademark professionals 26 May 17 < Back to Blogs Trevor Little Last week, World Trademark Review published the WTR 300: The World’s Leading Corporate Trademark Professionals. The list was generated from a community led research project designed to identify the individuals deemed to be the leading lights of the industry. Amongst the companies with the most trademark team members included are those from adidas, Amazon, Apple, Google, Mars, Red Bull and Sky. The publication is available here to World Trademark Review subscribers. To arrive at the list, we ran a four-month campaign to elicit nominations from the community. We specifically asked for nominations for individuals performing trademark-related duties to the highest standards, adding true value to their organisations and exemplifying the qualities that other counsel should aspire to. Only individuals who received multiple nominations from outside of their own organisation were long-listed for consideration. Our team then approached qualifying individuals for supporting information and references before deciding on the final list. As a result, many nominees did not receive the requisite number of nominations or make it through the rigorous vetting process (the full methodology is available here). Analysing the list, the brands with most individuals listed include adidas, Amazon, Apple, Google, Louis Vuitton, LVMH, Mars, Netflix, Red Bull and Sky. Overall, adidas boasts the largest number, with the iconic German sporting goods company having senior executives from China, the US and across Europe included. The tech industry is also well-represented in the top 10 - and that Google, Apple and Amazon boast deep trademark expertise is no great surprise. They have recently been named the world’s three most valuable brands, and protecting this key corporate asset is rightly front of mind. Similarly, for those in the fashion and clothing world, such as Louis Vuitton and adidas, brand integrity is key to success, and the need to fight infringers and copycats necessitates canny trademark strategies. A notable company in the top ten is Netflix. The media giant has been strengthening its trademark bench of late, as it seeks to ensure that the brand’s innovative onward march into content creation and delivery continues unabated. In our recent Global Trademark Benchmarking Survey, we found that trademark teams are, in many instances, under pressure, under-funded and under-appreciated – with a quarter reporting that their budgets had been cut in 2016. However, their work is critical to corporate performance and the WTR 300: The World’s Leading Corporate Trademark Professionals is designed shine a light on the often unsung heroes of the business world. We cannot promise that every corporate trademark counsel who deserves to be described as a world-class industry leader has made it into this publication. However, those that are listed certainly deserve to be. If you disagree with our opinion, we would like to hear from you. We would also encourage you to make nominations for those who have not made this year’s edition when we embark on the next round of research later in the year. The full list is available now to World Trademark Review subscribers here.

Apps iPhone Apps iPad Apps Mac Apps Apple TV Apps Apple Watch Apps The Best Apps Tutorials Jailbreak Jailbreak Tweaks Jailbreak Guide Unlock Guide Deals Latest Deals Devices iPhone iPad Mac Apple Watch Apple TV More Download Wallpapers iPhone Photography Expert Tips Podcasts You can now order photo books and archive images on Google Photos Christian Zibreg on May 26, 2017 0 At its annual developers conference earlier in the month, Google announced three new features for its Photos app: automatically curated albums, photo books and sharing suggestions. Today, the company pushed an update to its Photos app for iOS, Android and the web, bringing support for ordering printed photo books comprised of your best photographs. You can make a photo book in minutes with automatic photo curation and easy customization. Photo books To order a printed photo book, select the images you’d like to fill your album with. Google’s machine learning picks the best shots for your, removing duplicates and poor quality images. In fact, the app will even offer personalized suggestions for photo books, like your trip to the Grand Canyon, time with family during the holidays, your puppy and so forth. You can order a seven-inch square softcover book for $10 a piece or its nine-inch hardcover version for twice as much. Each has twenty pages though you can buy additional pages if you’d like: Softcover—$0.35 per additional page Hardcover—$0.65 per additional page Photo books are currently available to users in the US only. However, the search company has made promises to bring them to more countries soon. Google photo books key highlights: Quickly find your best shots— Start from an album or search for a person, place or thing. Then, Google Photos can automatically pick out your best photos—helping you save time. Perfect your book in minutes—Easily move around your photos, add a book title and tweak your cover design. Beautifully crafted for you—Just choose a size and get started on your phone or computer. Photo books are made in the USA from premium, responsibly sourced materials. Apple’s Photos app supports photo books, too. As a matter of fact, ordering photo books has been part of the now phased-out iPhoto app for almost a decade. Archive photos Aside from photo books, today’s update includes the Archive feature. Chances are your photo library includes not only your selfies, food shots and cherished memories, but the more mundane pictures as well, like recipes, receipts, scanned documents and so forth. Now you can move images to the app’s new Archive section to tidy up your photo grid. To get started, simply select a few photos you’d like to archive, tap the Menu icon and choose Archive from the popup menu. This simply moves the selected photos to your archive rather than delete them. Any archived images and videos remain visible in search and albums. Aside from the image archival feature and photo books, this update includes performance improvements and reduces the amount of on-device storage space used by the app. Tagged: App Store Apps App Updates Apple Apps Google Google+ Photos iPad iPhone iPod Touch News Photos MORE FROM iDB Google Photos launching automatically curated albums, photo books & sharing suggestions Google Photos picks up auto white balance editing feature in latest update Google Photos for iOS gains Live Photos stabilization feature Featured Latest Daily Deals: Memorial Day Edition The best 4K monitors Minority Report, World War Z and other iTunes movies on sale right now iPhone 7 and 7 Plus get a stable jailbreak on iOS 10.1.1 with extra_recipe+yaluX Jailbreak tweaks of the week: ClassicFolders 2, MaskedHotspotPass, Pigeon, & more… Daily Deals: Memorial Day Edition Apple developing dedicated AI chip for future devices The best 4K monitors How to post images to Instagram via mobile web iPhone 8 to switch from 16:9 to 18:9 display—here’s what this means for you Jailbreak News extra_recipe+yaluX reaches Beta 3: now with Substrate Customize the Camera app with SmartCameraShutter LaunchInSafeMode lets you selectively launch apps without being affected by tweaks Pin important notes at the top of the Notes app with Thumbtack iPhone 7 and 7 Plus get a stable jailbreak on iOS 10.1.1 with extra_recipe+yaluX Apps How to post images to Instagram via mobile web You can now order photo books and archive images on Google Photos Instagram Direct now lets you send links and images in landscape and portrait orientations Apple’s free app of the week: klocki You can now drag and drop files on iPad between Readdle’s productivity apps Accessories The best 4K monitors Apple releases AirPods firmware 3.7.2 Upcoming HomeKit support will let you voice-control your Ikea smart lighting Check out Nike’s four new Sports bands for Apple Watch Claimed cases for 10.5″ and 12.9″ iPad Pro suggest rear microphone and stereo speakers Deals Digital Design with Adobe Bundle for $31 Koofr 100GB Storage Plan Subscriptions for $29 PapaGo Dash Cams for $124 Newsletter Get updates directly into your inbox.

[Update: False alert] Google says gifting in the Play Store is "Infeasible," marks it as "Won't Fix" in the Issue Tracker Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 4:14am PDTMay 26, 2017 13 Plus 1 on G+ 61 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares117 Google News Update 1: 2017/05/26 5:03am PDT False alert. Issue was closed in 2013 because it was submitted to the wrong tracker. You know how almost every app or software store lets you buy apps and gift them to someone else? Well, you better put your dreams of ever doing that on Android to rest. Or burying them under 10 feet of disappointment. Someone at Google recently took a look at the Issue Tracker, saw the issue labeled "Implement Gifts within Android Market," which has been added back in 2010 when the Play Store was still the Android Market and which has gathered over 1100 stars and hundreds of comments from users requesting app gifting, and decided to be the bearer of bad news because you know what, this is "infeasible" and Google "won't fix" it. But the writing has been on the wall for a few days; we could have seen it coming if we had been playing closer attention. Credit gifting disappeared from the US Play Store on May 16, and then the support page for Google Play gift cards and promo codes was updated on May 17 to replace the "Google Play credit gifts" section with "Google Play book gifts." That change clearly shows that credit gifting was completely gone, not a glitch, and that from now on, you can only gift music and books, but definitely not credit. Above: Pre-May 17. Below: Current support page. Put 1 and 1 together and you understand that the future of gifting or buying someone credit on Google Play is grim. You better kill your dreams of purchasing apps/games for your friends or employees, gifting a niece or nephew some Play credit for new games educational apps, or encouraging your parents to use a certain app by buying it for them. I still can't wrap my head around the fact that Google, the behemoth that can make AI understand every word I say and predict the news I want to read and the traffic on my way to work, is saying that app gifting is "Infeasible" when other app stores have clearly managed to make it feasible. I'm sure there's a reason, but I can't think of any that would be unsurmountable for Google but not for others, or any that would apply to apps and games but not to books and music. The latter traditionally carry a lot more licensing and legislative limits than apps/games. As a consolation, you can turn to Google Play gift cards and Family Sharing in the countries where they're available to share or send apps and games to others. Update 1: 2017/05/26 5:03am PDT False alert. Issue was closed in 2013 because it was submitted to the wrong tracker. I apologize for the false alert. It looks like the issue was actually marked as "Infeasible" back in 2013 because it was posted to the wrong issue tracker and couldn't be fixed by the AOSP team but had to be submitted to the Google Product Forums instead. The issue has just picked up a lot of comments recently, which brought it to the attention of our tipster and thus our inbox, and with the recent disappearance of the Play credit gifting option, we incorrectly assumed there was a link there. What remains true though is that credit gifting is completely gone and you can only send music and books now. There's no proof that app/game gifting wouldn't make an appearance at some point, so I suppose there's a silver lining somewhere.

Rita El Khoury Yup, as shown in the screenshots, Books and Music gifting is available. But credit buying for others or gifting apps/games is now a dead dream. FaultException It was marked infeasible because it was on the wrong issue tracker, and it was back in 2013, not recently at all. See comment #108 on the issue where it was marked. Suicide_Note Not a big deal, really. demarcmj Agree. Low tech is better... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/276e854598d2a91aa3a795a84e4ecbec4f4f587c8e3da3c55b968c90ad4ec402.jpg Kristian Ivanov https://gfycat.com/RevolvingEdibleCivet h4rr4r Totally wrong article actually. This issue tracker is not for the play store. Thomas Gladdines If I ever had to implement gifting apps I would make it an in app purchase and then simply show a 100% off coupon. Dirk Google's New Logo Leaked https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/d76f12396d72e618315517d469ee19d7f2a28065b296266f029594216b2e0728.png Kristian Ivanov I was thinking of posting a really witty comment about this, but the disappointment level was so low that I kind'a don't feel it's worth the effort. Nicholas Conrad Witty comment status: won't fix. Kristian Ivanov It was going to be awesome though, it involved old people, polar bears and a skateboard...oh well, at some point in the future when this is in the news again I'll post it :c Daniel But there's a good reason for it, it's not just that Google is evil: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36916787#comment108 Status: Won't Fix (Infeasible) This report applies to a mobile Google application or service, and the issue tracker where you reported it specializes in issues within the Open Source source code of the Android platform. We are not able to provide support for Google products in this issue tracker. Please report this issue in the appropriate Google Product Forum at https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!forum/en/ God of chaos It all makes sense now! demarcmj Reading!?! What is this sorcery? Rita El Khoury Ugh... My ctrl+F skills failed me, I admit. Also my little knowledge of how the Issue Tracker works. I could see when or why it was marked as Infeasible so I incorrectly assumed it was now, when the comments flared up again. Nicholas Conrad Don't get down on yourself Rita, we all have days like this at work. Even knowing the premise of the article was mistaken, I'd rather read it again than another JRE video summary article. Rita El Khoury Thanks... I guess?! demarcmj The issue tracker is partly at fault. If you hover over the resolution in that side panel, the mouse turns to the finger like it's a link... but clicking on it doesn't do anything. You would think it would take you to the resolution post for more details. But nope. Rita El Khoury Exactly. I was thinking there's something wrong with Chrome or my connection and restarted it, but clicking wouldn't take me anywhere, so I was like... well, seems like this doesn't show an explanation. demarcmj Doesn't work in Firefox or IE either (haven't tried it in Edge, or whatever they're calling the Windows 10 browser). Do they have an issue tracker for the issue tracker? Mark R. Andrachek, Jr. No. But they might have a product forum. Which nobody at google will ever check, and some "community volunteer" will suggest your reboot your PC. Rita El Khoury Arghhhhh... You're right. Many of us here at AndroidPolice looked at this and we failed to see that it was marked as Infeasible in 2013. I'll edit the post to ad that info. In our defense, many of us at AP looked at this tip and thought the status change was new, especially with the way comments were flaring up on it in the past day and with all the changes to Google Play credit gifting. Daniel No problem! :) Thanks for adding the info FaultException It wasn't marked as infeasble recently, it was marked in 2013, because it's the wrong forum (the tracker is for AOSP/Android itself) See comment #108: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36916787#comment108 demarcmj Yup... and most of the comments since then are people bickering about not wanting to receive emails every time someone comments on the issue. Real productive thread they have going on over there [eyeroll] Zomby2D I'm guilty of contributing to the email pollution. I had the issue starred but I haven't been getting email notifications for the longest time from this. I don't even remember noticing that it had been closed all that time ago. I just started receiving notifications again last week and figured that the ticket being closed was the reason why people were suddenly complaining. Having the reason for closing it lost in the sea of comments didn't help. Rita El Khoury Right. Fixing the post to reflect that. Dennis Ulijn I can also see the fact that people buy 100 apps with a stolen credit card and sell them on the black market, like G2A or G2play. You talk about a lot of other stores doing this already, but the uplay and steam store have had a lot of problems with this and still have those problems, without a good way to combat it. Besides that, how will you solve the VAT system? Who pays? I can see how a lot of people want it, and of course i don't mind having the possibility, but there are more problems than 'just implement it'. Carson Saldanha I think it's due to security reasons but that sucks... h4rr4r Read the update! couldn't be fixed by the AOSP team but had to be submitted to the Google Product Forums instead. h4rr4r Good retraction, update! Rita El Khoury "because it was posted to the wrong issue tracker and couldn't be fixed by the AOSP team but had to be submitted to the Google Product Forums instead." Isn't that enough of an explanation? h4rr4r I was at first talking about just the update line. But on reading the full explanation I thought it was pretty good. Ideally the update line at the top would say something about why not when. Rita El Khoury That's an automatically truncated blurb that our WordPress theme does at the top. I'll manually change it to clarify that in a bit, I was just in a rush to update the post before we got more comments telling us how wrong we were. h4rr4r YAY! krazyfrog Apple has had App Store gifting for all content since years now and somehow it's "infeasible" for Google. 🙄 Rita El Khoury Refresh your page ;) Peter World Citizen I had seen people got fired for lesser mistakes. ;) Rita El Khoury We'd be firing half the AP team and Artem. Many of us looked at this and didn't notice. Guess the post I/O haziness hasn't dissipated yet. Mark R. Andrachek, Jr. Google's Issue Tracker recently got a re-vamp. They can control, I'm sure, what the closed states are for things in their own tracker. They really need to have a closed/won't fix state that indicates that the issue has been raised in the wrong venue going forward, if they want to keep the issue tracker limited to just AOSP. These kind of things keep coming up in the AOSP issue tracker and _will continue_ to come up in the AOSP tracker if nothing changes. They don't expose issue tracking for anything else. Finding these product forums at all, much less the right one, is an exercise in madness. And then when you do find them, they're typically staffed by unpaid community volunteers. Chances are high that nobody from Google will actually see your issue, much less respond. It's like shouting into the void. Funem They should just make it so you can purchase an item, then chose to install it or create a sort of promo code which you can then just give to someone to use. They could tie it in to the promo code system they have now. Until its claimed you could still retain the option to install it by using the code yourself. prwnd Dear Community, I suggested this and I apologise because I did not find it was changed in 2013.

Starting May 31st, T-Mobile will kick off its #GetOutoftheRed promotion to help Verizon customers switch to T-Mo. Verizon customers in good standing with their carrier can get their iPhone or Google Pixel paid off by T-Mobile when they switch to T-Mobile and sign up for T-Mobile One, and they can keep their existing device. The phones that qualify for this promotion include the iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, Google Pixel, and Google Pixel XL. T-Mobile says that these devices were selected because “phones need certain software to be globally compatible, and some phones don’t yet have that software.” Magenta does say that it’s working with unspecified device makers to make more phones compatible with this promotion. Additionally, Verizon customers switching to T-Mobile must add T-Mo’s Premium Device Protection Plus insurance plan to their device to qualify. This insurance plan costs $15 per month and includes protection against loss, theft, and accidental damage, McAfee ID Protection, McAfee Content Protection, and other features. T-Mobile says that it’ll pay Verizon customers that take advantage of this promotion with a digital prepaid MasterCard card that typically arrives within 15 days. While this #GetOutoftheRed promotion is focused on Verizon customers (because VZW phones are unlocked), T-Mobile is doing something for AT&T and Sprint subscribers, too. Starting on May 31st, AT&T and Sprint customers can switch to T-Mobile and get their existing device paid off when they buy a new phone from T-Mobile on EIP. And unlike Carrier Freedom, those customers won’t be forced to trade in their existing device. Finally, T-Mobile says that starting tomorrow, May 25th, T-Mobile One customers with at least two voice lines can get two additional lines of service for the price of one. The cost of the second line will be offset by a bill credit.

(J²) Right… I’d found that the system doesn’t consistently apply these. TylerCameron Yeah their billng process it’s horrible Steve_NYC So true. I actually considered moving to the T-Mobile One Plan even though it would have cost me more money, just to get away from the insanity of their bill credit process. I finally got things straightened out, but I am sure it will be a problem in the future. It’s gotten to the point that I think it’s deliberate. Mike I had a free line from November that I had to call in every month. to get credit. They finally fixed it to be automatic this month. best part I got extra bill credits for months since last November and my bill is now negative so I didn’t have to make a payment this month. Al William So in order to get the free line, you need to have at least a total of 4 voice lines? Corey Jalette You need to have 2 voice lines to get this promo, which you get 2 lines for the price of 1. So in total you end up woth 4 lines, 1st 2 have to be voice, the 2 you’re adding could be whatever you want. So if you’re on the 2/100 plan right now if you add 2 tablets it would be 120 a month (20 per tablet but 1 is free) or if you add 2 voice lines it would be 140 (40 for adding a 3rd line then 4th is free) Al William Thanks for the clarification! So minimum 2 voice lines and the other 2 could be voice or data. I just wish they get rid of these bill credits. Sometimes it’s such a nightmare. Corey Jalette It can be yes but that’s how pretty much everything is done. Just like they had a free line deal in march it’s listed on my account as a free line on us but I still get the charge on my bill, but it’s auto credited. The only time it wasn’t was the first month because I added it before the end of the billing cycle. Cost $49 but they also credited my account manually that one time. Haven’t had an issue since. AWasserberg7 This article mentions Magenta. What *is* Magenta? Is that some cute term of affection for T-Mobile? kev2684 Are you serious? It’s their brand color. VZW = Red AT&T = Blue T-Mobile = Magenta Sprint = Yellow Nobody Special Cricket (umm, green) lol Genecio MetroPCS= Purple Black&Orange= Boost The Waz Just confirmed by T-Force that if you have a 2 for 100 plus a “this ones on us promo” giving you total 3 lines, you will lose your free line if you take advantage of the promotion of 2 for 1 tomorrow. They stated that they have to move you to a different Tmobile One plan….makes no sense since there is only 1 plan…… Corey Jalette This is ONLY if you’re adding a voice line people. If you’re adding tablet/smartwatch/mobile Internet plans that doesn’t affect your phone plan promo of 2/100. Corey Jalette Add 2 tablets with unlimited data on your plan for $20/month. They frequently have a free tablet promo with qualifying data plan. Snatch those up and you’re golden. The Waz Yes this will affect both. IF you have the 2 for 100 and the “this one is on us” free line….you will lose both promotions…confirmed with t force and John directly. Andrew Singleton the reason is that you’re on a 2-line promotional plan paying $20 less than everyone else, and you’ve added a line. since you’re unable to add another line on that plan, you are forced to switch to a 3+ line plan, and that will cause activation-related discounts to drop. Corey below is correct, because internet lines (tablet, watch, syncup drive) are their own rate plan and don’t affect your voice configuration. J Gerard Yeah! Let’s switch to T-MOBILE because we want to not be able to make phone calls half the time, and not have a signal to look something up when we actually need it. Oh yeah, and to not be able to upload pictures of something fun that we’re doing until we’re at home connected to WiFi later that night or the next day. Before any of you “magenta” fans TRIES to defend them… I’ve been a Verizon customer for about 12 years except for 6 months last year, when I switched because of crappy TMobile’s cheap prices and convincing (misleading) advertising. It was HORRIBLE. I used to get pissed and call them to ask why I could never get a signal. After 6 months, I finally admitted to myself that it was a ridiculous mistake and switched back to The Red! NEVER any issues with Verizon’s service. Never. “Magenta” is only good at talking a big game. If anyone’s thinking about switching to T-Mobile, DON’T DO IT. They are the worst. Go to any other carrier. Doesn’t have to be Verizon. kev2684 It’s all about location, location, location. Just because your area is bad, doesn’t mean everybody will have the same problem as you. J Gerard … EXCEPT that I live in a city. Oh, and Verizon’s coverage is flawless here. I happen to also know (through friends) that AT&T and Sprint are good here, too. Oh, but it’s all about location, location, location. Weak argument. T-Mobile just sucks! There’s a reason it’s so CHEAP! Austin8480 … OK JGerard. Next time, PLEASE use all capital letters to truly get YOUR point across. What I find PATHETIC is that you are a die hard Verizon turd in a TMobile blog. Oh wait, I meant Verizon TURD. Forgot to emphasize that. NOBODY in this room gives a flying —- about your opinion because you slummed it for 6 months and went to Magenta and it was as big of a mistake as…well, I will let you figure it out. J Gerard You were so busy typing a 3rd grade level post that you forgot to make a point. Here’s one for you: T-Mobile is inferior to almost all other carriers. Austin8480 If T-Mobile is so inferior, why are you even giving this blog the time of day. Are you upset that no kids want to hop in your van and eat your chocolate, so you are going to take out your frustrations on the inferior wireless network? thepanttherlady *Tip* Starbursts don’t melt :D theseanteam The hate is strong in this one. Those six months must have really scarred you or something. When you say almost all other carriers, which ones are you referring to? There are only four major carriers after all. And actually, that argument about location is a pretty strong one. T-Mobile’s network is the fastest in many locations, but can be really poor (or even non-existent) in others. The same can be said about everyone–including Verizon. Every carrier has their strong and weak areas. For someone to deny such would have to either be 1) ignorant 2) biased beyond belief or 3) troll. yankeesusa Yea, it still amazes me that people complain about coverage and then lump everyone else in america as having the same coverage, like we all live in the same area. Oh well. People never learn. I’m just happy tmobile works for me and that my data speeds are the highest iv’e ever had. At my house i’m getting close to 100megs almost every time. But hey i guess that’s not good enough for some. thepanttherlady I moved to Crestline a couple of weeks ago. No service. :'( kev2684 I had to google where that is lol :D Yeah it’s rural Ohio but I suppose Band 12 is coming? I’ve seen sightings on Band 12 in Jacksonville, FL lately as well as other parts of the country it’s currently not available. They’re probably working on it at the moment. thepanttherlady Sorry, I should have been more specific. It’s Crestline, CA. I made the same mistake when I called a county office but only Googled Crestline. Guy was really confused as they don’t have my address there. Took me a minute to figure out he was in Ohio. LOL kev2684 You’re literally live in a mountain! Views must be spectacular! thepanttherlady Some of them really are. :) Zacamandapio Verizon here we gooooooo. By the way, we went to Lake Gregory. :) thepanttherlady I’m literally 7 minutes from there. Went there 2 weekends ago to check it out. Water level is a little on the low side. Met a couple that same night that said they’d drained it for some reason and cited “water politics” because I guess the locals aren’t happy about it. Drove up from the Hesperia side this past Saturday and got to see Lake Silverwood. Will have to check it out this summer. Nice drive but hated seeing so many dead trees. :( ETA: I had to get Frontier (Verizon) internet so I could actually use my cell phone. What really sucks is: 1. I literally just got a hotspot through T-Mobile a month ago when they were offering another free line. It’s unusable. 2. I now HAVE to buy phones that have WiFi calling. Blah! thepanttherlady From the day we moved in 5/7: http://imgur.com/UQHsBZF http://imgur.com/t9Z64Q3 http://imgur.com/tm7ReiU And the lake :) http://imgur.com/1YUxwV9 http://imgur.com/tnGMcoq http://imgur.com/zhY16YK http://imgur.com/eaXr58H http://imgur.com/JO9BHJW Sharti24 Who will you be switching to? thepanttherlady I’m not switching. Yet anyway. I lose service 1/2 way up (or down) the mountain so I’ll probably have to get a very cheap pre-paid service/phone for emergencies in case I break down. Not all turnouts have a call box. I still work in Orange County and T-Mobile works fine most places I go. If it starts to be a problem then I’ll have to consider my options. Sharti24 Have tmobile send you a range extender. Not the one you plug into the internet but the one that has two boxes that boosts signal Berzerker Yeah, if you live in Bumblefuck, Montana, don’t switch. Greg Piller Shoot, I just signed up in Montana for TMO. Guess I’m “bumblefucked” lol. I have traveled to every state and been in EVERY U.S. major city multiple times living in every timezone and 11 states. My goodness you have a warped idea of “crap state”. Montana is paradise partner. You have to be from either NYC or California with that f’ed up mentality. He is right & not just in “crap” places but a lot of places like Chicago, IL where I was born and raised. Verizon & AT&T ARE better, Considerably better now in most places but TMO is gaining on them quickly & may reach parity in a few years. When THAT happens if TMO is still competitive, one would have to be a lunatic to stay with AT&T or Verizon. Berzerker …lol. I never said Montana was a “crap state.” It’s the easiest thing to think of when you think of wilderness where you won’t have service for miles. I could have picked a bunch of states, but Montana has, IIRC, the smallest habitation of humans to state ratio, behind Alaska of course. Easy target. Greg Piller To me 4 lines for $120 with TMO is enough of a savings to ditch AT&T. Verizon & AT&T and some of their customers can be arrogant & I think John Legere is one helluva CEO. I can pick up a burner sim with AT&T’s Cricket when I travel a bit and use it until TMO improves in Montana & then it’s sianara to ATT. Happy to be back with TMO. I was formerly a customer since the Voicestream days but when I moved west couldn’t keep them. Their coverage improvement in Montana & the nation as a whole with him at the helm has been nothing short of INCREDIBLE. I hope if the Sprint deal happens Legere is retained as CEO. mreveryphone Hummm… I travel the country for my job and I rarely have issues with T-Mobile… Is it perfect?? No… But no carrier is.. Verizon worked out for you, that’s great. T-Mobile works for millions, that’s also great. But this butt hurt rant is ridiculous and pure comedy! J Gerard “butt hurt rant” is kind of a dumb way to describe what I’m saying. But, I’ll consider the source, eh? Do you know ANYONE who thinks that T is better than V? Nope. So, the difference between us is that I choose to have a better service and I’m willing to pay a little more for it. You are cheap, and you’re willing to have an inferior service because it’s cheaper. That’s it. You know Verizon is better than T-Mobile Francisco Peña Anyone switching carriers should NEVER just switch without taking advantage of the initial return period. I was with VZW for yrs myself. Loved it, with my UDP that was grandfathered. Even went through one wave of price hikes to stay. Then the wife wanted a non-feature phone, and the price hike for her would have boosted out then $108 monthly payment, to $160 once we got a basic data plan, her line access fee (joke) and a new phone. So I looked into TMo. I purposely bought a phone the yr before that worked with Tmo and VZW (moto X DE) and signed up for one line of TMo, switched my Moto to Tmo and reactivated an older LTE phone I had back on VZW. Then I went around for a week doing speed tests everywhere I went. Stuck in traffic? speed test. Both side by side on the seat. Mall? yup, side by side in my hands. Work? yup. Home? yup. I hated VZW at work because my Moto could never get a signal inside the building, which caused my battery to die quickly each day. TMo? got a strong signal. Home, both were weak, but about the same. Driveway? same. So after 10 days, I went in to TMo and switched. Got 2 new phones (had a deal on G4s then) and was spending $140 for 2 lines/10GB each (was the $100/2L/10GB deal) with those phones. Has it been perfect? no. Has it been enough to switch back? no. After some finagling, got a $70 plan with 6GB each for 2 lines. Then have gotten a free line on top of that.. so now I pay $130 for 3 lines, with 6GB each (two don’t come close, mine has Stash so I’m good) and 2 new G6 phones. So for the price, its awesome. Can I deal with some poor service on the outskirts of town? sure. Oh, that Moto X? got it on the 3rd line… theseanteam I don’t think anyone has ever claimed that T-Mobile has better coverage than Verizon, but the point is it has the same quality of coverage in many places. Where I live, T-Mobile has equal coverage and faster speeds. It might not be like that for you, as everyone’s experience will vary. I’m sure if others suffered with bad service, they would switch carriers as well. But your superiority complex is just silly. mreveryphone I know plenty of people that think T-Mobile is better than VW… And I know people that think the opposite, it depends where you live. The service was inferior for you but not for me by any means… I appreciate the cheap name calling, I’ll be cheap all day if it means saving money but getting better service FOR ME… I’ve had service in buildings where others on VW had 0, I’ve smoked people on VW in data speeds tests so I’ll be cheap all day long!! Lol Vazaha There’s an unwritten agreement when you join T-Mobile that you will refrain from living in or going to crappy places. If you live in a decent place T-Mobile is fine. If T-Mobile sucks in your area, you know why :). Vazaha But seriously, I’m always envious of ATT and V when I go to crap places. tranceformer978 Why are you going to crap places? Melissa Cardenas Well what the hell are you doing on this website then? This is a T-Mobile forum obviously most people on here have T-Mobile and they Happy with it so they ain’t gonna listen to you . T-Mobile did not work in my old house so i had Verizon. Now in my new house Verizon don’t work at all and i had to get T-Mobile again because T-Mobile works here fine , So no carrier is perfect. It all depends on location!! J Gerard I get tech news alerts on my phone and things like this come up sometimes and I click on them. I believe that’s allowed! Apparently, what’s not allowed here is proper grammar and punctuation. I almost had to have your post translated in order to read it, but I figured it out eventually. Where did you go to school? Melissa Cardenas What ever im in a hurry and didn’t have time to spell check .But seriously don’t change the subject i don’t get why people like you come talk trash on a T-Mobile forum. ?? Makes no sense haha . And what ever im PRETTY sure you understood fine what i wrote in my first comment. Bull that you almost had to get it translated. Omar Boyer Melisa hes just being an idiot haha i understood perfectly well your first post. And i see they gave u some thumbs up on that first post so others also understood you no need to translate it . Ignore this lowlife with nothing to do. If he wants to stop making an Azz out of himself he should just block the notifications he gets from here. Melissa Cardenas i have better things to worry about ;) omar. And like you said he should just turn off notifications from here then. Eric Harlow Don’t give J Gerard the satisfaction in getting a reaction out of you and allow him to control the situation don’t dumb down to his level Eric Harlow Get off Melissa Cardenas butt about grammar here. This is a forum! Not a college message board or an college English Composition course. T-mobile has improved drastically within the last 3 years. T-mobile works for me out here in San Diego and in my future home in Missoula, Montana. I have mental disabilities that I got serving in The US Navy for twenty years and I dislike your comments towards Melissa Cardenas. This is a T-mobile fan website to discuss peacefully about T-mobile, so get your BIG RED DUMB AND DUMBER ASS OUT OF HERE. Andrew Addison You just made my night with that bomb diggity comment towards that boozo the snow clown filled with stuffy nose, trying to come off as English weirdo professor correcting people on their grammar fool there Bro. Is this guy here serious right now? He had no reason to talk down to someone like that and also talk down on the finest company/carrier, advising everyone to stay away from the best carrier/company which that one being T-Mobile-MetroPCS. We will forever be way Better in USA than any other carrier would have been. Eric Harlow OOH REALLY!!! HOW AWESOME!! Glad I made your night! Haze1nut English is a 3rd language for me, behind French and Portuguese. Correct my grammar for me, will you. It obviously makes you feel superior. Ascertion You think everyone that switches to T-Mobile can’t “Make calls half of the time”? You’re out of your mind! Tony Chen agreed, t mobile has gained millions of customers each quarter. if the drop calls were so bad why would t mobile gain 100% of new customers agaIN? another blockbuster quarter by t mobile. moonoverparma Funny, I’ve never had a problem. Nobody Special Several years ago i had a verizon phone (when the iphone’s came out they were the only one that were selling them with unlimited data at that time) and i had T-Mobile flip phone that i was using to make international calls. I have to admit, Verizon was more reliable than T-Mobile during my cell phone usage. I chose T-mobile over Verizon because of many reasons…. but it was never due to their coverage, because their coverage was horrible… but since then their coverage has improved. But i switched primarily due to the inexpensive international calls. That was a deal breaker for me, i was content with the terrible coverage with anticipation that they would improve their service. and with Verizon i was paying around $89 dollars for unlimited data and text and 450 minutes of voice calls. my tmobile line (from what i can remember) was around $78 dollars for unlimited talk and text and data. But fastforward to today, I have 5 Unlimited Everything (data/text/voice) lines with unlimited international calling (mobile+landlines) and international text for a low cost of $110 plus taxes and fees. Believe me i checked, Verizon or AT&T have nothing in comparison to what i have with T-Mobile. And i am not bashing you or Verizon at all, Verizon does have a more reliable coverage area but in the end i sided with T-Mobile over Verizon. If Verizon ever came up with incredible deals like T-Mobile has been doing almost every month i wouldnt turn down a great opportunity. RECAP: Verizon “Better Coverage” T-Mobile “Better Prices” It all boils down to what are you comfortable with. Im comfortable with crappy coverage. And My T-Mobile calls do drop often, but what i do is (i press redial) GOTCHA :) Gust OK so here’s the deal. In the morning when you wake up if you have T-Mobile you have to get up take a shower have breakfast shave go outside of your house in other to make a phone call. If you have AT&T or Verizon in the morning when you wake up you can reach for your cell phone and make a phone call. It is that simple. But you know what I have T-Mobile because over one year it saves me about $200 as compared to AT&T or Verizon. So I put up with the crap! Timothy Poplaski T-Mobile supports WiFi calling. You don’t have home WiFi? DM725 How do you not have wifi calling enabled? Maybe you need to buy a phone from the last 2 years… (My Motorola Nexus 6 Supported Wifi Calling….) Phone Guy All lies. So funny, yet sad. yankeesusa LOL, not everyone lives where you live and have bad coverage with tmobile. 4 years ago i would have never used tmobile, now i no longer have sprint and got rid of my verizon line because tmobile is great for me where i live and work. I just recently drove across florida,georgia,nc and tennesse and had no issues. I was able to test it side by side with an att phone and the whole time both phones had coverage except up in the smokies near newfound gap where no one has signal. Don’t lump everyone in the same pile just because it doesn’t work for you. DM725 LoL, where the hell do you live? eanfoso The only one after verizon is at&t because we know that sprint and us cellular sucks more than t mobile Andrew Singleton T-Mobile has the lowest churn rate (people trying it and leaving) of all carriers. Could you please explain why? J Gerard Ha! Oh, I promise you I don’t feel like an idiot surrounded by people who work themselves up into a breathless rant trying to defend a crappy service. gmo8492 Crappy for who exactly, churn has gone down to record lows and T-Mobile has over 73 million subs, so if it doesn’t work out you can switch. Brad C It’s not for everyone, but has worked damn well for me for 12yrs.. I *actually* tried Verizon a few months ago, and came back after two weeks after awful LTE performance JG You’re cracking me up reading your comments! I have TMo and put up with their spotty coverage because I’m paying less per month staying with them. I can admit that. There is alot I enjoy about TMo, but dropped calls and dead zones IS a reality. I have a band 12 phone in metro PHX. Not sure why others feel the need to berail someone who doesn’t agree with them just for argument’s sake. Timothy Poplaski Because you aren’t saying, “Bad coverage in PHX”, you’re saying “Bad coverage”. I can drive for at least an hour in any direction and have solid coverage. It all depends on where you live, and you’re phone. Even phones with band 12 won’t all have the same results because some phones get better reception than others. So, I won’t even argue about coverage in PHX. Never been there, likely never will, so it just doesn’t matter to me. My excellent coverage probably doesn’t matter to you. It’s all about where you use your phone. navi harriram Dude you could of tested the network out on a $10 weekly plan or $3 daily. You don’t buy cell phone service every day so do the work. The sales rep just wants a commission check so they’ll say anything to get you to switch. That’s why I don’t work for wireless companies anymore. Too much bull to deal with yankeesusa Not everyone is defending a company that may or may not work depending on where you live. But many people actually do research and pick a company that specifically works for your needs depending on your area. I had verizon and sprint before tmobile and i have never ever gotten the speeds i get now not to mention i have great coverage ‘WHERE I LIVE”, YOU SEE, that’s the important thing, i researched and made sure it worked for me. I don’t just blindly select a company just because their commercial says so. Screamin That’s strange because T-Mobile has been #1 in customer service AND satisfaction for well over 2 years now… and yes, that includes coverage. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) I am thinking about switching to Verizon due to poor coverage. In San Diego area I get one to bars. I moved from Minnesota and T-mobile coverage in MN is excellent there with all bars. In San Diego it’s very poor in some areas. When iPhone 8 is release I am switching to Verizon. I love T-mobile plans but coverage in my area is poor. Sharti24 Agreed. On base (32nd street) forget about tmobile coverage. sprint excels on 32nd. go over to corando island its even worse! just throw your phone over board. no tmobile coverage on the air base at all. im using an iphone 6s Band 12 which is deployed in SD yankeesusa I agree, if in your area tmobile is not good and is affecting productivity or just not letting you use your phone to its fullest your’e better off changing. I have great coverage where I live and work and when i travel over 99% of the time i have no issues. But i got my wife on cricket which is att so for the times where tmobile may not get signal i have the att towers just in case. I’m on an old grandfathered single line plan that allows work discount so i’m keeping as long as i can. Screamin Sometimes it’s not always the cell coverage causing the issue, but the phone itself, especially if it’s an older device that supports fewer cell bands. With T-Mobile’s latest acquirement of spectrum you can expect a huge improvement in cell signal, both in range and structure penetration, within the year. Of course you can switch if you want, but they’re only going to get better. They’ve more than doubled the coverage in the past 2 years and have just as much coverage as Verizon with a network that’s actually futureproof unlike the other guys. DM725 Agreed, I know people that don’t realize they are using a phone without band 12, that doesn’t have wifi calling or Volte support, and has an extremely weak antenna. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) My phone is iPhone 7 and not an old device: Andrew Singleton if you hold an iphone 7 next to a galaxy s8, the s8 will have more bars every time. that’s due to a more powerful signal on galaxies and the fact that bars don’t mean anything with low-frequency spectrum. Patel Nisha You couldn’t pay me to use a iPhone . And why would I switch Verizon to T-unmobile. So I can have a sub par data connection with hardly any coverage…. Andrew Why are you on TmoNews, then? Andrew Addison Lol I was just thinking the exact same thing. Lol DM725 I’m sorry you live in a place that T-Mobile doesn’t prioritize. Here in NY, we have no such issues. Andrew Singleton the offer is also good for pixels, and you don’t know anything about the network. in 1 year, verizon will wish it had t-mobile’s network.

[Update: False alert] Google says gifting in the Play Store is "Infeasible," marks it as "Won't Fix" in the Issue Tracker Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 4:14am PDTMay 26, 2017 13 Plus 1 on G+ 61 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares117 Google News Update 1: 2017/05/26 5:03am PDT False alert. Issue was closed in 2013 because it was submitted to the wrong tracker. You know how almost every app or software store lets you buy apps and gift them to someone else? Well, you better put your dreams of ever doing that on Android to rest. Or burying them under 10 feet of disappointment. Someone at Google recently took a look at the Issue Tracker, saw the issue labeled "Implement Gifts within Android Market," which has been added back in 2010 when the Play Store was still the Android Market and which has gathered over 1100 stars and hundreds of comments from users requesting app gifting, and decided to be the bearer of bad news because you know what, this is "infeasible" and Google "won't fix" it. But the writing has been on the wall for a few days; we could have seen it coming if we had been playing closer attention. Credit gifting disappeared from the US Play Store on May 16, and then the support page for Google Play gift cards and promo codes was updated on May 17 to replace the "Google Play credit gifts" section with "Google Play book gifts." That change clearly shows that credit gifting was completely gone, not a glitch, and that from now on, you can only gift music and books, but definitely not credit. Above: Pre-May 17. Below: Current support page. Put 1 and 1 together and you understand that the future of gifting or buying someone credit on Google Play is grim. You better kill your dreams of purchasing apps/games for your friends or employees, gifting a niece or nephew some Play credit for new games educational apps, or encouraging your parents to use a certain app by buying it for them. I still can't wrap my head around the fact that Google, the behemoth that can make AI understand every word I say and predict the news I want to read and the traffic on my way to work, is saying that app gifting is "Infeasible" when other app stores have clearly managed to make it feasible. I'm sure there's a reason, but I can't think of any that would be unsurmountable for Google but not for others, or any that would apply to apps and games but not to books and music. The latter traditionally carry a lot more licensing and legislative limits than apps/games. As a consolation, you can turn to Google Play gift cards and Family Sharing in the countries where they're available to share or send apps and games to others. Update 1: 2017/05/26 5:03am PDT False alert. Issue was closed in 2013 because it was submitted to the wrong tracker. I apologize for the false alert. It looks like the issue was actually marked as "Infeasible" back in 2013 because it was posted to the wrong issue tracker and couldn't be fixed by the AOSP team but had to be submitted to the Google Product Forums instead. The issue has just picked up a lot of comments recently, which brought it to the attention of our tipster and thus our inbox, and with the recent disappearance of the Play credit gifting option, we incorrectly assumed there was a link there. What remains true though is that credit gifting is completely gone and you can only send music and books now. There's no proof that app/game gifting wouldn't make an appearance at some point, so I suppose there's a silver lining somewhere.

Rita El Khoury Yup, as shown in the screenshots, Books and Music gifting is available. But credit buying for others or gifting apps/games is now a dead dream. FaultException It was marked infeasible because it was on the wrong issue tracker, and it was back in 2013, not recently at all. See comment #108 on the issue where it was marked. Suicide_Note Not a big deal, really. demarcmj Agree. Low tech is better... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/276e854598d2a91aa3a795a84e4ecbec4f4f587c8e3da3c55b968c90ad4ec402.jpg Kristian Ivanov https://gfycat.com/RevolvingEdibleCivet h4rr4r Totally wrong article actually. This issue tracker is not for the play store. Thomas Gladdines If I ever had to implement gifting apps I would make it an in app purchase and then simply show a 100% off coupon.

Nicholas Conrad Witty comment status: won't fix. Kristian Ivanov It was going to be awesome though, it involved old people, polar bears and a skateboard...oh well, at some point in the future when this is in the news again I'll post it :c Daniel But there's a good reason for it, it's not just that Google is evil: https://issuetracker.google.com/issues/36916787#comment108 Status: Won't Fix (Infeasible) This report applies to a mobile Google application or service, and the issue tracker where you reported it specializes in issues within the Open Source source code of the Android platform. We are not able to provide support for Google products in this issue tracker.

[Update: False alert] Google says gifting in the Play Store is "Infeasible," marks it as "Won't Fix" in the Issue Tracker Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 4:14am PDTMay 26, 2017 13 Plus 1 on G+ 61 Share on Facebook 43 Share on Twitter Total Shares117 Google News Update 1: 2017/05/26 5:03am PDT False alert. Issue was closed in 2013 because it was submitted to the wrong tracker. You know how almost every app or software store lets you buy apps and gift them to someone else? Well, you better put your dreams of ever doing that on Android to rest. Or burying them under 10 feet of disappointment. Someone at Google recently took a look at the Issue Tracker, saw the issue labeled "Implement Gifts within Android Market," which has been added back in 2010 when the Play Store was still the Android Market and which has gathered over 1100 stars and hundreds of comments from users requesting app gifting, and decided to be the bearer of bad news because you know what, this is "infeasible" and Google "won't fix" it. But the writing has been on the wall for a few days; we could have seen it coming if we had been playing closer attention. Credit gifting disappeared from the US Play Store on May 16, and then the support page for Google Play gift cards and promo codes was updated on May 17 to replace the "Google Play credit gifts" section with "Google Play book gifts." That change clearly shows that credit gifting was completely gone, not a glitch, and that from now on, you can only gift music and books, but definitely not credit. Above: Pre-May 17. Below: Current support page. Put 1 and 1 together and you understand that the future of gifting or buying someone credit on Google Play is grim. You better kill your dreams of purchasing apps/games for your friends or employees, gifting a niece or nephew some Play credit for new games educational apps, or encouraging your parents to use a certain app by buying it for them. I still can't wrap my head around the fact that Google, the behemoth that can make AI understand every word I say and predict the news I want to read and the traffic on my way to work, is saying that app gifting is "Infeasible" when other app stores have clearly managed to make it feasible. I'm sure there's a reason, but I can't think of any that would be unsurmountable for Google but not for others, or any that would apply to apps and games but not to books and music. The latter traditionally carry a lot more licensing and legislative limits than apps/games. As a consolation, you can turn to Google Play gift cards and Family Sharing in the countries where they're available to share or send apps and games to others. Update 1: 2017/05/26 5:03am PDT False alert. Issue was closed in 2013 because it was submitted to the wrong tracker. I apologize for the false alert. It looks like the issue was actually marked as "Infeasible" back in 2013 because it was posted to the wrong issue tracker and couldn't be fixed by the AOSP team but had to be submitted to the Google Product Forums instead. The issue has just picked up a lot of comments recently, which brought it to the attention of our tipster and thus our inbox, and with the recent disappearance of the Play credit gifting option, we incorrectly assumed there was a link there. What remains true though is that credit gifting is completely gone and you can only send music and books now. There's no proof that app/game gifting wouldn't make an appearance at some point, so I suppose there's a silver lining somewhere.

Rita El Khoury Yup, as shown in the screenshots, Books and Music gifting is available. But credit buying for others or gifting apps/games is now a dead dream.
