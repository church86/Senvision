[Minority Report] Google and Coca-Cola may target personalized ads at you - in real life Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/10 11:27am PDTMay 10, 2017 20 Plus 1 on G+ 38 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares102 News Videos Google and Coca-Cola's partnership effort for in-store advertising displays looks to be bearing fruit. The advertising system uses DoubleClick's preference and tracking data combined with Google's Beacon Platform to serve up targeted ads by pulling data from passing smartphones. With that info, displays are able to select content based on your preferences in the form of advertisements specifically targeted to passersby. In a recent grocery store pilot program the Minority Report-style ads performed quite very well. This isn't actually that new. It was discussed at a few places in the last couple months since the details were revealed at Google's conference. But, it seems to have quite effectively flown under the radar for that time, considering how cool it is. Coca-Cola made a detailed post about it on one of their social promotion sites in April as well, in which they talked about the potential environments for these tracking signage systems, like movie theaters and other Retail venues than just grocery stores. Google's partnership with Coca-Cola for this system has been discussed off-and-on for a few years. Back at the National Automatic Merchandising Association's OneShow in 2016 Google talked about the potential as applied to vending machines, and said that Google and Coca-Cola were working together on Bluetooth beacons for vending, but this is the first time I've actually gotten to see what it looks like and how it performs. Coca-Cola's Greg Chambers, at Google's recent Cloud Next Conference, said that it has been experimenting with small tests into proximity marketing since at least 2015 when they first started working with Google on a prototype. The two companies tested things with a pilot for the system in 250 Albertson's grocery stores, in which Coca-Cola saw some incredible results. There was a one year ROI on Coca-Cola products displayed by the system, and a spillover effect from so-called "category-lift," in the form of a total one-month ROI for all nearby soda products — i.e., this system sells a lot of soda for Coca-Cola and all other brands near it. There's no word yet on when or how Coca-Cola might roll this out to other stores, but given how positive the results were for the pilot tests, it is likely you'll see one someday at the end of the soda aisle in your local grocery. On a more technical note, I'm not sure exactly what sort of data is being sent to the displays by nearby phones or how it is taken. Allegedly the system uses Google's Eddystone beacons, which exchange information with nearby phones using Bluetooth low energy. This is the first time I've heard of Google's Beacon Platform actually being used, combined with DoubleClick's targeting advertising systems, to target people in the physical world. The privacy-conscious might express some concern at the potential of having your phone communicate your preferences to an in-store display, but I would hope and assume that any identifying information is stripped out. Either way, we're one step closer to this. Source: Digital Strategy Consulting Tags beacon platform beacons bluetooth low energy Coca-Cola Eddystone Targeted advertisements video subscribe ...

Anu6is Stop being absurd, how else would you know what you NEED? WesleySmalls Actually, you do. People require social interaction, it's a very strong part of our being. Humans generally don't like to be alone, and very much can't over longer periods of time. Because of this, people tend to follow each other's example in one way or another, advertising is just one of the many examples Ben Yeah, your phone communicating with a vending machine to give you personalised advertisements is not in any way 'social interaction'. WesleySmalls I did not say anything about that, it wasn't even remotely close, nor was the post I commented on. But of course, else you had to actually comment on my actual post, and realize that it's true that people follow other people Prezes Dyrektor But you are making it sound like advertising is indispensable in our lives. Well guess what, ads is the reason why I cut cable tv, they don't have those fancy adblockers. Ads is the reason I mostly listen to local academic radio without any. Etc. Ads and marketing are evil, and we are being manipulated every day. Now excuse me as I run to grab some sugar soda and candy.

Or are people going to start getting ads for the sex toys they have in their amazon cart? Bane✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ There's one way to find out. Add some (more) sex toys to your Amazon cart and then go grocery shopping! Ryne Hager I actually haven't seen one in my area yet, when I go out west in a month I'll see if I can drop by an Albertson's. Carlos Rodríguez So, you have sex toys in your cart, right? Ryne Hager Obviously not enough sex toys, if you're questioning that. Carlos Rodríguez “( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)” yochanan Albertson's are now all Safeway's, FYI. Ryne Hager Albertson's acquired Safeway back in 2015, indeed. yochanan Right, but it wasn't until fairly recently (at least in Northern CO) that Albertsons stores have been converted into Safeway's. Bane✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, I'm a blank slate to advertising. I might as well be a ghost. I block all ads, turn off all targeted options everywhere, and never click on any. I guess I'll have to turn off Bluetooth when I'm in stores now too. Fadakar lol if you think your record is clean you need to re-evaluate how seriously you want to take privacy. James F This. People underestimate how much of a digital footprint they leave, even if they do turn off everything. EowynCarter True. And if they are, they wouldn't show me ads for coca cola, I just don't like that. And sodas in general. Cakefish Agreed, if I have to endure advertising it might as well be about products that actually interest me. Bewear I am a fan of your picture edits, Ryne. Ryne Hager What a coincidence, I am also a fan of your work. I kept a Bewear in my party for most of Moon. Anu6is lol! Lord Argyris My party was boring. Two of them were from Gen I, and apart from my starter, only one other member was from Gen VII. Now really, Nintendo should get in on this whole Coke-Google partnership thing. Maybe put something in their 3DS games that ties into this advertising platform. "Oh, so you're raising a bunch of Fire-type Pokemon. I'll bet you're feeling pretty hot right about now. Know what would cool you right down? A nice, ice cold COKE." Ryne Hager I mean, with the launch event Munchlax and Munchlax/Snorlax available on the first island, who in their right mind didn't take a Gen I Snorlax to end game. Michael Oghia I came here just to give you a +1 for Hypno Toad. Steve Actually noticed this happening to me recently when near the vending machine at my job. Guessing the capabilities will be endless and more diverse when full-on set-ups are placed everywhere. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7ea9fde9939850ddee856f08d34c3e8a98a6c90461c779f049060ec4e655b8c6.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f87dc3afe5a1492c33e179552b9fcf3259d388ef4a1a6cfed7951d9612faeae6.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/da689e538e0681368f0ef1dac408a796aa111781564a9ded426c4639fbeab351.jpg F4LL0U7 Disabling Nearby will disable invasive ads, you say? Done! Morten Ulv Google usually have a way to opt out. james fuston https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPGgTy5YJ-g Ben Nothing better than a new way to sell people tooth-rotting, diabetes-causing sugar water. Nicholas Conrad *This* is the gateway to AR! Aing actual R; genius! abqnm Are these connected to the "Nearby" activity in Google Settings? (Which also interestingly enough at some point has earned the ability to add the Nearby activity directly to the homescreen. Don't know when it appeared as I don't open that screen often, but it's now an option in the overflow menu.) James F Beacons typically use Bluetooth. abqnm Yes, and Google's Nearby uses Bluetooth LE scanning and Play Services location. But with Google being a part of it, I'm asking if it is directly related to the Nearby function. I am not asking for how beacons typically work. MJ Double checked BT is off on my phone... The only time ever use it is when play music on a BT speaker which I don't do when grocery shopping. "With that info, displays are able to select content based on your preferences in the form of advertisements specifically targeted to passersby" How does these ads work exactly? I am not watching a 54min video. Dedren You don't need bluetooth on per say. It just uses that tech. I believe you will have to enable Nearby places, which is disabled by default but will probably be enabled by default in the future. MJ Nearby places will not be going on... F4LL0U7 I'm not sure they could develop an ad that's targeted enough to get me to buy Coke. F4LL0U7 I guess I might consider it if the vending machine held a family member hostage or something. James F I don't know if I should be concerned that you said *might* consider it.... F4LL0U7 What can I say, I'm just not very receptive to ads. Dedren What about Water, Sprite, SimplyOrange, Powerade, Minute Maid? Surely one of those you drink...all Coke. F4LL0U7 I mean, of course I drink water, but I get it from the filtered pitcher in my fridge. No to the others. Adrian quickest way to turn me off on a product. Bluetooth is only on in my car anyway so good luck with it. As soon as someone figures out how to spoof it and annoy people in public, it will go away. Max Johnson I thought it's been NFC and GPS all this time. At least from my Android Pay app. blindexecutioner I would literally break my phone if I got an ad as I walked by a pop machine (or whatever) if I couldn't opt out of it of course.. I would switch to iOS that day. If it happened on iOS I would stop using smart phones altogether. tehboogieman You could just turn off bluetooth. Or you know, there's your way rndusrnm479461 iOS also supports this same thing. rndusrnm479461 I've read the whole article and even watched some of that video and I still don't get it - what do your "preferences" affect in the ads? How will it affect what the ad displays? Does it just play the ad you're more likely to prefer from 5 different ads? I'm confused... Why is such system necessary for something simple like coke? Would make more sense for a bus stop ad or other kinds of billboards.

Some of these should be done now, and others will help if the unfortunate event happens and your G4 goes missing. One of the worst gut-wrenching feeling in the world is that of losing a smartphone. They are an essential part of most owners lives, not to mention usually hold tons of sensitive data. If your phone is lost or stolen, you’ll want to be prepared for the situation. When it comes to protecting or recovering your smartphone from loss or theft there are a few different options available for Android users. If you happen to lose your LG G4 you’ll want to have Google’s Android Device Manager installed to save the day. Read: How to Find a Lost Smartphone or Tablet Similar to Apple’s Find My iPhone, Google has its own option called the Android Device Manager that all users should know about. It has been available for quite a while, but last year it was finally updated to offer enough features worth talking about. Users can find a lost device inside their own home, or on the other side of the city. Read on for more details on how to find your lost LG G4. We’ve just passed two of the highest months of the year for smartphone theft, which happens to be April and May, and the chances of your new LG G4 getting lost or stolen is still somewhat high all summer long. People are out and about, hanging out at the pool, going shopping, school is out and more. People our outdoors more this time of year. If you value that brand new smartphone, you’ll want to be prepared in case of an incident. You’ll want to be protected year-round because finding a lost or stolen Android device can be a rather tough task, not to mention trying to secure all the important and often times sensitive information that’s on our smartphones these days. Android Device Manager isn’t talked about too often by Google, but it should be. It was updated back in 2013 with tons of features that makes it something everyone should install and setup, received a few new ones earlier this year, and below we’ll go over the benefits and how to do it. Read: 30 LG G4 Tips & Tricks The new Android Device Manager will let users locate their LG G4 and remotely wipe and delete all data and information if needed right from their home PC, laptop or tablet. There’s also a lock feature if you’d rather not wipe all your data, but clearing out your information may be the safest bet. Then Google added an option to make your device ring if you simply can’t find it, which is pretty neat. Instructions If an LG G4 is lost at home or a friends house the Android Device Manager can increase the volume to 100% and ring at full blast to help you find it, or even wipe out all of your user data and lock the screen if you fear it has been lost or stolen. These are essential to protect your information, so lets get started. To activate the LG G4 head to the Google Play Store and download the official Android Device Manager application. Not only will this application explain how the ADM works, let you setup the device it was just installed it on, but can also manage and access other devices right from this app on a mobile device. Meaning you can use this on your LG G Pad 8 to find your G4, or on any Android device to find any other Android smartphone or tablet. The image below is from an HTC One M8, but the same setup is required on the LG G4. Once installed users should open the app and learn about the Android Device Manager, and hit the “Setup Lock & Erase” button down below to get everything setup. It’s all self-explanatory and very easy to do, so don’t hesitate to complete this as soon as you get any new Android device. Users can also get started and all set up by going to www.google.com/android/devicemanager on your computer. This will instantly launch the ADM service which will let you scroll through your list of devices. Here is where you can name the LG G4 to something more personal, find its location, or wipe all data as we mentioned above. Scroll through the list if you have more than one device, and let the ADM do all the work. Find Your Lost LG G4 Using the ADM on another device, or from a PC you’ll navigate to the Android Device Manager page and track the LG G4. In my case above I’m looking for my Google Play Edition Galaxy S4, but you’ll be looking for the G4 (or any Android device for that matter) so simply find it from the dropdown menu. If you renamed it, look for that name. The Android Device Manager uses GPS and Wi-Fi to track the location, often times down to a few feet, and you’re all set. From here the GPS locate button will track the lost or stolen device for you. Google warns users to never try and retrieve a lost device themselves, and to contact the police. We’d have to agree. Bringing an officer of the law with you to try and retrieve a stolen smartphone is probably your best and safest bet. In our screenshot above the location isn’t extremely accurate, showing 24 meters, but that’s because I’m in a gated community and I usually have GPS disabled on my smartphone. For most users this will be deadly accurate, and you’ll find that LG G4 in a matter of seconds. This is also the same place where you can hit the “Ring” button to make some noise and find your lost G4 at home, or even wipe all your data if your fears come true and someone steals it. Read: How to Take a Screenshot on the LG G4 To sum things up all you need is the Android Device Manager installed on the LG G4, then you can use any other Android device or your desktop to find, retrieve, make it ring, wipe, or lock it. Whatever the case may be, Google has you covered. There’s also a new feature where any user that’s logged into their Gmail account can go into a browser like Google Chrome and type “Find My Phone” and it will automatically launch the Android Device Manager and find all devices connected to that account, and enable all the options mentioned and shown above. Hopefully no one needs to use the ADM to find a lost or stolen device, but if so, these steps are some of the best options available. 7 Responses 11/01/2015 verda g Reply It is a flip top phone- Lost How to stop payments on flip top!!!!!!

The new events functionality is available in the US at first, through the Google app for Android and iOS, as well as the Google Search mobile website. You can search for things such as "jazz concerts", "art events", and you'll get a special list filled with at-a-glance details about the upcoming events. You get additional options if you tap More events, and when you find something you like just tap on that and you'll be able to immediately buy tickets for it. It's also possible to look up things coming up on specific dates, using filters such as "today", "tomorrow", or "next week". If you want to go the opposite route and have everything thrown at you, just search for "events near me" and you'll be shown all the different options. As always with new Google features, it's unclear when or if you'll see this outside of the US.

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Google Search will now show you list of nearby events Google is making it easier for you to search for events that are happening near you. The company is adding a new feature to Search app and mobile web that will show list of all the local events happening near you. For example, when you search for “concerts this weekend” you will see a new Events tab at the top of your search results. Google will also allow you to filter the results by time periods. So you can search for events happening today, tomorrow, next week, next month and so on. If you search for “art events this weekend” Google Search will now show list of events happening around you. You will be able to see the details about each event like its title, date, time, and location. Tapping “more events” will expand the view to see additional dates, and you can tap again for more details or to buy tickets. Moreover, if you are not looking for anything specific, you can simply try typing “events near me” and Google Search will share a list of events what’s happening around the corner. Unfortunately, this feature is currently available only in the U.S as of now and there is no word about a global roll out. Google already shows you list of nearby restaurants, places nearby, cafes, restaurants and more in India. It will be great if it also rolls out the local events feature in the country as we do have several interesting events happening around us almost daily.

Photos Videos Topics Live PAK 169/2 (69) - WI (Yet to bat) Home India Mumbai Delhi World Business Technology Sports IPL Entertainment Bollywood Hollywood Television Lifestyle Education & Careers TRENDING# Kapil Mishra Emmanuel Macron Narendra Modi Exam results 2017 Bahubali 2 News Technology News Google promises Android O beta ‘soon,' just few days ahead of I/O developer conference Shares15 Thu, 11 May 2017-10:29am , Mumbai , AFP It hasn't yet been given a snack-based moniker, but Android O already has a logo. After making a first version available to developers at the end of March 2017, Google is gearing up to offer owners of Nexus (latest generations) and Pixel devices a first beta edition of the upcoming version of its Android mobile operating system. Google says that the beta testing phase for Android Nougat has now ended and that a beta version of Android O will be available soon. The Android beta website will be updated soon when the Android O beta program begins. While Android O is expected to be officially unveiled at the Google I/O conference, held at the Shoreline Ampitheatre in Mountain View, California, May 17-19, 2017, many of its new features have already been seen in the version currently being tested by developers. For starters, Google promises to boost device battery life with Android O by restricting the activity of applications running in the background, making them more power-efficient and less battery-draining. A new autofill function will be able to store data such as usernames, passwords, addresses or credit card details and automatically fill out forms. Plus, the update brings "Picture in Picture" (PiP) display capabilities for watching a video while using other apps alongside. Android O overhauls notifications too, allowing developers to create themed notification channels, grouping alerts from various apps so users can decide which ones they receive. In general, users will have greater control over notifications and which ones they want to see displayed onscreen. The number of notifications per app will also be displayed, as in iOS. Another visual change comes in the form of adaptive icons, matching the icon style to a user's particular version of Android, with more rounded or square icon designs in the various manufacturer interfaces. This latest version of Android is expected to land in Google's latest Pixel smartphones before progressively rolling out from fall this year. Google is yet to announce which sweet snack will lend its name to the latest OS. After Android KitKat, Lollipop, Marshmallow and Nougat, could it be time for an Android Oreo?

The Play Store adopts new app and notification icons with v7.8.16 [APK Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/10 6:25pm PDTMay 10, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 168 Share on Facebook 59 Share on Twitter Total Shares286 Applications Downloads News Google never stops changing things up. A new version of the Play Store app is rolling out to users and it comes with a new icons for the app launcher and notifications. They're simple cosmetic adjustments, but these are the types of things you can't help but notice as soon as they're on your screen. Left: Old version. Right: New version. The new app icon leaves behind the last remnants of the shopping bag icon that came along when Google still called this the Android Market. It is now just the Google Play logo with no other ornamentation. It's worth noting that the round icon variant hasn't changed, so it still looks like the Google Play logo on a dinner plate. Above: Old version. Below: New version. The notification icons have also gone through a little facelift. These also trade away the tote bag motif for the Google Play triangle, but slightly adjusted with the checkmark extending beyond the lines. The notification icons come in different colors for each of the content stores (e.g. apps, books, movies). The notification icon for stacked updates – when more than one app is installed or updated – is no longer a stack of blocks, it's just the same triangle app icon used with single installs. We're still looking for more changes in this update, but it's starting to look like this may be it. If you don't want to wait for Google to send this update out to you, grab it from the APK Mirror link below. Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

They are going to change play Store soon too lol Total Insecurity How do you know that? boop Unless you mean the name, the app just got another design update. sbeaulieu Isn't that the same icon from a couple of years ago? Tom Westrick We've always been at war with Eastasia 4Ui812 Looks like I'll have to wait until it gets pushed. Apkmirrior won't let me download it (I don't turn off my ad blocker for anyone :-) Gjorgi Lazarovski You can download even with the adblocker on. You just need to wait like 10 sec for the download button to show up. sklatigre Can confirm Richard Branches The play store icon on google chrome is still the old one, they should update it as well... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/bca1aca3fd5b60e08fcd507e7c39b67f23f70ed0e4ff417bcf62881906f7106a.png Тарас Мукин Chrome apps were announced to be removed soon. Don't think they are going to bother. Richard Branches You're right about that, but they still will be available on Chrome OS so why not update it anyway?... Tom Westrick If they wait long enough it'll just be back to that logo C64 Thank god / satan (choose your preference) for icon packs Konrad Krawczuk Icon packs are always kinda problem to me. If you have a few without icon from icon pack you must always fight with inconsistency. Jose Romero Google IO can't come sooner. Devin Studios Looks kinda boring compared to the old icon. Breathless So wait what happened to circles?... Cody Toombs Circles are there on the Pixel and in any other situation where the round icons are chosen. The triangle icon shows up on everything else. Anton Kuznetsov Triangles is the new circles burkett375 Since they love to A/B test, make 7 different message apps, etc....they should make 3 competing app stores/markets/hubs Ben Godfrey Don't give them any "good" ideas ;) Sumeet Deshmukh People who paid a lot of money to Google aren't getting these icon updates, the pixel guys mattcoz Because our icons already dropped the shopping bag, no need for an update. Sumeet Deshmukh I was a little sarcastical, I love my pixel (styled rom on my Nexus 5 (not x) Victor Stuber ya, but we got crappy white circles around all our icons. It sucks Leon I like my circles personally. sklatigre Gonna miss the shopping bag notification, kinda liked it. Margaritas Ante Porcos Google is a mess in everything. Berkay Anyone else dislike both the circled icon and just the icon by itself? I prefer the shopping bag... It looks the best IMO. Thomas I loved the Android Market icon. Made so much sense Jesse Kawell Once you see that notification icon "checkmark" ✅ as a 3D post lying down at an angle, you can never unsee it. BoFiS Aww, that's sad, and almost unrecognizable now since I still call mine "Market" on my homescreen... Branko Proof that Google lost the plot. reCoded So, the circle icon is the same I guess? Anton Kuznetsov This localization of 'update all' button text is awful https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/57e6791db8965bf1e13f4f50e3b6b5b303644e9c3f1660799bf9896ed1ef57b3.png YuCMi Jesus christ Google. What sin did the previous icon commit? Was it too old for you guys? Grey Very ugly and hard to understand. Not intuitive at all. But I guess that's Google 2017! Lawstorant Looks generic af.

Arundhuti Dasgupta & Urvi Malvania find out how brands are rethinking digital marketing plans to accommodate this. IMAGE: According to a study by Google and KPMG India, native language users take faster to online shopping and are more willing to rely on digital media for entertainment than English users. Image used for representational purpose only. Photograph: Shailesh Andrade/Reuters.   Over the next five years, nine out of 10 new users of the Internet from India will be language users says a study by Google and KPMG India (Indian languages: Defining India's Internet). Not only is the number of language users set to grow faster than English users over the next five years, these users are more likely to lead a more active digital life. They take faster to online shopping and are more willing to rely on digital media for entertainment.  The number of customers accessing online retail sites in a language other than English will grow nearly four times while those using digital payment gateways will more than triple the report says.   No brand can thus ignore the growing voice of the native digital consumer on the Internet. Last week, Google began offering its services in nine Indian languages with keyboard support for 11 more. Making the announcement, Rajan Anandan, vice president, India & Southeast Asia, Google had said, "The most important aspect of making the web more useful and meaningful for all of India is to make India's internet more representative of the India we live in."  Currently, there are 234 million language users as compared to 175 million English users on the Internet. In 2011, there were 42 million language and 68 million English users. Not only are the many languages spoken in the country crowding out English users online, their numbers are set to grow even faster. By 2021, language users are expected to grow at 18 per cent CAGR (compound annual growth rate) to 536 million. In the same period, English-language users are likely to grow by a mere three per cent CAGR to reach 199 million. Already a bunch of e-tailers, mobile wallets and entertainment platforms are following a multiple language policy to cater to the diverse needs and challenges of this community. Both Amazon Prime Video and Netflix have focussed on localisation through language subtitles. The latter has also developed software called Hermes to help better and speedier subtitling of its content. Dish TV took localisation a step further with the introduction of its second brand Zing, which focussed on regional customers beyond the metros. So, for each state the brand is present in, the packaging, both physical and for the channel, is skewed towards regional language viewers. For example, in Kerala, the instructions and manual for the set top box are provided in Malayalam instead of only English and Hindi and the base pack for customers of the state, will feature channels in the language of the state, rather than Hindi or English entertainment and news channels. According to the report, digital entertainment is sought out by 167 million language Internet users today and is expected to grow to 392 million users by 2021. India outshines US in internet user base  In the next five years, language users are expected to account for 75 per cent of India's Internet user base. Apart from Hindi, which will account for 38 per cent of the total users on the Internet in five years, Marathi, Bengali, Tamil and Telugu will comprise 30 per cent of the total. E-commerce players like BookMyShow, PayTM have extended the interface language to Hindi and several other languages on the web and mobile. The number of language users accessing digital payments gateways is expected to go up from 28 per cent today to 43 per cent in 2021, thus limiting the potential of an English-only platform to 57 per cent of total Internet users. More than 75 per cent of Indian language Internet users said they preferred using mobile wallets over bank promoted websites and apps.   The study offers interesting insights into the nature of language usage too; 68 per cent Internet users consider local language digital content to be more reliable than English. Ninety-nine per cent of language users access the Internet through their mobile devices while the overall share of people using the mobile for Internet is 78 per cent. For language users, online government services will see the maximum growth in usage, growing at a CAGR of 33 per cent over the next five years. E-tailing, digital classifieds and digital payments are the second fastest category in terms of adoption. E-tailing is currently accessed by 42 million language users. It will grow to 165 million by 2021. The category most shopped online is consumer electronics for such users, not fashion and lifestyle, groceries or home care. The report says that this could be because there is not enough product information and cataloguing in Indian languages by these brands. Almost 44 per cent of language users have said they feel challenged by product descriptions and customer reviews in English. While awareness of e-tailing is high, language and comfort are two big roadblocks to adoption. Over 50 per cent of offline shoppers said they would try e-tailing sites and apps if provided with end-to-end language interface. The majority count exclusivity, product range and convenience as benefits of e-tailing; 90 per cent said they do not see cash backs and discounts as key benefits. Almost 25 per cent of language users said problems at the payments stage led to drop outs. Clearly, to gain their share of the wallet, brands will have to bring down the language barriers online.

TL;DR: There is a popular mantra amongst developers that goes like this write, test and deploy. In this tutorial, I’ll show you how to deploy your PHP apps to different cloud server platforms such as Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, Heroku, IBM Bluemix, and others. Introduction to Cloud Servers Cloud servers are basically virtual servers that run within a cloud computing environment. There are various benefits to hosting and deploying your applications in the cloud. They are: Economically efficient. You have the freedom to modify the server software to your needs. Cloud servers scale very well. Stability and security. In fact, many companies have moved their infrastructure to the cloud in order to reduce cost and complexity. It’s a great option for small, mid-sized, and enterprise scale businesses. If you write a lot of tutorials and do POCs (Proof-of-concepts) like me, it’s also a great choice for you! A generic PHP application involves the common LAMP (Linux, Apache, Mysql and PHP) stack. Linux: The operating system that runs the other software packages. Apache: The web server that runs the PHP code. A popular alternative software is Nginx. MySQL: The database. A popular alternative software is PostgreSQL. PHP: The server-side language for building the application. For a crash course on LAMP / MAMP / WAMP, see this premium resource. Now let’s cover how to deploy PHP applications to several cloud server platforms. Heroku Heroku is a cloud platform that helps you deploy and host your applications the modern way. It does all the heavy-lifting for you. Let’s quickly take a look at how to deploy and maintain a PHP application on heroku. PHP Heroku Architecture If you don’t have an account, go ahead and create one on heroku.com. Then go ahead and install the heroku cli. Once you have that installed, clone this simple starwars PHP application. Heroku runs your PHP app in a dyno, a smart container which provides a modern stack with your choice of web server (Apache or Nginx) and runtime (PHP or HHVM). Make sure you follow these steps below: Create a .env file from .env.example. You need to have an account with Auth0. Go to your Auth0 Dashboard and click the “create a new client” button. Name your new app and select “Regular Web Applications”. In the Settings for your new Auth0 client app, add http://localhost:8000 to the Allowed Callback URLs. Copy out your client id, client secret, domain and callback url. Ensure you assign them to the right variables in your .env file. We have a composer.json file which contains the list of packages that the application needs. Go ahead and run composer install on your local machine to install these packages. Not familiar with Composer? This video might help. Go ahead and run the app. The app should be running like so: Landing page Logged In User Awesome! Our app works locally. Time to deploy! The first thing we’ll do is to add a Procfile to the root directory of our app. Create a new file called Procfile without any file extension and add this: web: vendor/bin/heroku-php-apache2
 A Procfile is a text file in the root directory of your application that defines process types and explicitly declares what command should be executed to start your app on heroku. If you are interested in using Nginx as the web server, then the content of your Procfile would be: web: vendor/bin/heroku-php-nginx
 Now that you have added the Procfile, go ahead and upload the project to GitHub or Bitbucket. Mine is starwazapp. Head over to dashboard.heroku.com/apps and create a new app like so: Create a new app from the dashboard Give it a name like so: Give app a name Choose a deployment method. In our case, we’ll use GitHub like so: Connect to GitHub The reason for choosing GitHub is to make the development and maintenance process very smooth. Developers can work on new features using the git workflow. Now, type the name of the repo in the circled area and click Search. Heroku will search for your repo under your GitHub account and display it like so Search for repo Click on connect like so Click on the connect button Heroku will connect the repo like so Connected Project Scroll down a bit. This is the interesting part. Heroku allows you to enable automatic deploys with the push of a button. It also gives you an option to wait for your continuous integration process to pass before deploying to production. In a real world app, you’ll have a test suite for your codebase. A developers’ code runs against the test suite. If it passes, the code will be pushed to production. Click to enable automatic deploys. We don’t have any CI service, so we don’t need to enable that option. Now, let’s deploy the master branch. Note: You can have other branches and specify which branch you want for production. In our case, the master branch is the production branch. Click on the Deploy branch. Heroku will scan through your composer.lock file, install the necessary packages, and deploy! Deploy finally Click the View button to check out your app. Error 500 Ooops! We are experiencing a 500 error. Aha, we haven’t set any environment variables yet. Locally, we had a .env file. On Heroku, there is no .env file, but there is a way to set environment variables. Go to Settings in your dashboard and add them as config variables like so: Oh, one more thing! The new callback url in my case is http://starwazapp.herokuapp.com. Make sure you add your new callback url to the Allowed Callback URLs in your Auth0 dashboard. Your app should be live & working now! Live App Make a small change Let’s make a small change to our app and see how effortlessly it deploys it to production. Open index.php and change the content of the <p> tag from Heard you don't want to migrate to PHP 7? Dare us! to Star Wars - The Awakening!. Commit and push to your master branch. Now, go to the Activity tab of your Heroku Dashboard and notice the build. Reload your app and you’ll see the difference. Build Succeeded New version Database, Caching & Cron Jobs Let’s quickly talk about how to handle the database, caching, and cron jobs. On Heroku, you can use ClearDB and Postgres with PHP. Add ClearDB to your app like so: heroku addons:create cleardb:ignite
 This command provisions a new ClearDB database and returns the URL that the app will use to access it. All you need to do is add it to your app as an environment variable and parse it in your app’s config like so: ClearDB is a powerful, fault tolerant database-as-a-service in the cloud for your MySQL powered applications. <?php
$url = parse_url(getenv("CLEARDB_DATABASE_URL"));

$server = $url["host"];
$username = $url["user"];
$password = $url["pass"];
$db = substr($url["path"], 1);

$conn = new mysqli($server, $username, $password, $db);
?>
 using mysqli You can tweak that to suit the PDO style. Add Postgres to your app like so: heroku addons:create heroku-postgresql:hobby-dev
 Head over to the addons, and you’ll see other kinds of databases that you can use with your PHP app. Heroku provides an array of addons for caching, from memcache, to fastly , to ironcache, and others. You can check out how to use memcache with PHP on Heroku here. Finally, you can use the Heroku Scheduler for running jobs on your app at scheduled time intervals. Google Cloud The Google Cloud platform is a giant and trusted cloud platform that a lot of companies all over the world have adopted in deploying and hosting their apps. Your apps will be running on the same infrastructure that powers all of Google’s products. What other form of confidence do you need to assure you that your application will scale well enough to serve your thousands and millions of users easily? Google Cloud offers different options for hosting PHP apps. The platform offers App Engine (Fully managed), Compute Engine (Scalable VMs) and Container Engine (Kubernetes Clusters). In our case, we’ll use App Engine. It abstracts the infrastructure away. Let’s jump into deploying our famous Star Wars app to Google App Engine. When using Google App Engine, you can choose the Standard or Flexible environment. The latter, like the name implies, allows you to install any PHP extension that works on Debian Linux, has a configurable Nginx web server, writable filesystem, latest PHP versions and allows you to run deployment scripts using composer.json. We’ll use the flexible environment. Go ahead and create a new project. Click on Create, give the project a name, select the region you’d like to serve your app in, and enable billing. Note: You won’t be charged without your permission. Now, download the Google SDK and install the Google Cloud tools. Installing Google SDK Running gcloud Go ahead and create an app.yaml file in the root of our project like so: app.yaml runtime: php
env: flex
 So, our .env file has been pushed to Google Cloud. An alternative to using that is to add the environment variables to the app.yaml file like so: ...
env_variables:
  # The values here will override those in ".env". This is useful for
  # production-specific configuration. However, feel free to set these
  # values in ".env" instead if you prefer.
  APP_LOG: errorlog
 Now, deploy your application from your console by running gcloud app deploy. Grab the URL, in my case it is https://starwars-166515.appspot.com/, and add to Allowed Origins(CORS) and Allowed Callback URLs in your Auth0 dashboard. Also add the URL to AUTH0_CALLBACK_URL in your .env file. Run gcloud app deploy again to provision a new version of the app. Check out your app now. It should be live like so: Live App Database, Caching & Cron Jobs Google Cloud provides a Cloud SQL Instance platform. Check out how to configure, connect and create MySQL instances for your app here. You can also use phpMyAdmin on Google App Engine. Google App Engine includes implementations of the standard Memcache and Memcached APIs. Check out how to use Memcache in your app on Google Cloud. The App Engine Cron Service allows you to configure regularly scheduled tasks that operate at defined times or regular intervals. Check out how to schedule cron jobs and use task queues with PHP on Google Cloud. It’s relatively easy to deploy Laravel, Symfony and WordPress apps to the Google Cloud Platform. IBM BlueMix IBM Bluemix allows you to easily configure, deploy and scale on a powerful, high performance global cloud infrastructure. Let’s jump into deploying our famous Star Wars app to IBM Bluemix. Sign up on Bluemix like so: Signup on Bluemix Note: The Bluemix platform offers a 30-day free trial so you have a chance to try deploying your own application before handing over your credit card details. Go ahead and create an organization and space. I named my space prod. Now, go ahead and install the Cloud Foundry CLI. Once you have done that, log in from your terminal like so: cf api https://api.ng.bluemix.net/
cf login
 Log in to Bluemix The next step is to create a manifest.yml file in the root directory of the app. The manifest.yml file includes basic information about your app, such as the name, how much memory to allocate for each instance, and the route. Our manifest file should look like this: ---
applications:
  - name: starwarsapp
    memory: 512M
    instances: 1
    host: starwarsapp
 You can also explicitly specify the buildpack in the manifest file. Thankfully, Cloud Foundry automatically detects which buildpack is required when you push an app. Buildpacks provide framework and runtime support for your applications. Buildpacks typically examine user-provided artefacts to determine what dependencies to download and how to configure applications to communicate with bound services. Finally, deploy your app by running the following command like so: cf push <yourapp>
 <yourapp> has to be a unique name. Starting Deploy Ending Deploy Try to run the app now. In my case, the url is starwarsapp.mybluemix.net. Oops, a 500 error. We haven’t loaded our environment variables yet. How do we do that with Bluemix? You can either use the Cloud Foundry CLI or the Bluemix user interface to set environment variables. Let’s use the Bluemix user interface. So, follow the steps below: Open the Bluemix dashboard. Click on the app. You’ll be redirected to another page with more details about the app. Select Runtime from the left panel. Now, click on Environment variables Scroll down and click the Add button to add the environment variables like so Click the Save button. Once you do that, your app will restart automatically. Now grab the URL, in my case it is https://starwarsapp.mybluemix.net/, and add it to Allowed Origins(CORS) and Allowed Callback URLs in your Auth0 dashboard. Now check out your app – it should be live! Database, Caching & Cron Jobs Cloud Foundry provides the ability to create services. IBM Bluemix offers the Cloudant NoSQL database (the Bluemix name for CouchDB). You can use the cf tool to create database services like so: cf create-service cloudantNoSQLDB Lite starwarsapp
 IBM Bluemix also offers the ClearDB MySQL service. So, you can use the cf tool to create one like so: cf create-service cleardb spark starwarsapp
 They offer MongoDB, PostgreSQL, and RethinkDB. You can always use the Cloud Foundry tool to check out a lot of things such as logs, environment variables, etc. like so: cf logs --recent yourapp – Shows the logs of your app. cf env yourapp – Shows the environment variables associated with your app. cf marketplace – Shows all the services that Bluemix has to offer. IBM Bluemix also offers Redis Cloud, a fully-managed cloud service for hosting and running your Redis dataset in BlueMix in a highly-available and scalable manner. IBM Bluemix provides the Workload Scheduler service. This service allows you to integrate your application with the capability to schedule workflows. Far beyond cron, exploit job scheduling within and outside Bluemix. Easily create workflows in your application to run on a regular basis, at a specific time, on events (for example, when a file is deleted or updated), according to your needs. You can either use the Workload Scheduler User Interface or use the APIs. Get started with Scheduling Jobs here. Also, here is how to deploy your Laravel app on IBM Bluemix. Microsoft Azure Microsoft Azure is another massive cloud platform that allows you to scale your apps easily. Let’s get started with deploying our Star Wars app on Azure. With Microsoft Azure, you can deploy via: FTP. Syncing with a cloud folder. Local Git. Cloud based source control service such as GitHub or Bitbucket. In our case, we’ll set up deployment with Git. First, create an account with Microsoft Azure. Dashboard Click on New on the left panel. Click See all just next to Marketplace. Click Web + SQL, then go ahead and create. You’ll be prompted to select an offer for the type of subscription you are comfortable with. I chose Free Trial. With that, you’ll be given a $200 Azure Credit. Give your app a name, then create an SQL database. Well, it’s not needed for our app but for some reason Azure forces you to create it. Create a new app Now that our app has been created, click on App Services by the left panel to see your app. New app Click on the app, choose Deployment options, then click on GitHub. Authorize access to your repo, choose the project and branch. In my case, I have an azure branch. That’s the branch I’ll use for deploying my code to the Azure platform. Check out the deployment notifications. Now, browse to http://[yoursitename].azurewebsites.net. In my case, it is http://starwarzapp.azurewebsites.net. Oops!, there is an HTTP 500 error. What’s happening? Okay, we need to set the environment variables again. Go to your app in App Services, click on Application Settings, and then add the environment variables to the right. Now grab the app URL, in my case it is http://starwarzapp.azurewebsites.net/ and add to Allowed Origins(CORS) and Allowed Callback URLs in your Auth0 dashboard. By default, azure deployment doesn’t do anything with our composer.json or composer.lock file. So, no package is getting installed. Now go back to App Services, click on your app, then go to Development Tools and select Extension. Choose the Composer extension and agree to the legal conditions. Now, make a little change to your app and push again to GitHub. You should see it deploying like so: Now check out your app again. It should be live and working! Database, Caching & Cron Jobs Microsoft Azure offers Azure Redis Cache. It is based on the popular open source Redis cache. It’s easy to create and use like so: Click New > Data + Storage > Redis Cache. Enter the name of the cache, select the region and create it. Check out the documentation on how to use it. For scheduling and running tasks, Azure offers a Scheduler. It allows you to: Call services inside or outside of Azure. Run jobs on any schedule. Use Azure Storage queues for long-running or offline jobs. Invoke Azure Service Bus queues. Check out how to create and manage jobs using the Scheduler. We already talked a little about setting up a database while we were deploying our app, but let’s quickly look at how to set up a MySQL database. Log into the Azure Portal. Click New in the left panel of the dashboard. Choose Data + Storage in the Marketplace, then select MySQL database. Go ahead and configure your new MySQL database. Enter a name, choose your subscription, location and fill the required fields. Create! Connect to the database. Laravel developers can easily configure a MySQL database for their apps on Azure. Amazon Web Services More companies use AWS (Amazon Web Services) for storing all sorts of data ranging from images and mp3 files to videos than any other cloud platform. In fact, a lot of organizations like Uber, Spotify, or Salesforce use Amazon Web Services completely – for hosting, deployment, and infrastructure. AWS has a ton of developer products. The service we’ll use for deploying our famous StarWars app is Amazon Elastic Beanstalk. Let’s get started. Sign up for an AWS account if you don’t have one. Head over to Elastic Beanstalk console. Create a new app. Click on create web server. Create the webserver environment. Upload your code. Elastic Beanstalk requires that you upload a zip file of your codebase. You can manually zip it up, but I prefer to do that from my terminal like so: zip ../starwarsapp.zip -r * .[^.]* Now, upload it to AWS like so: Check availability for the app URL. Mine looks like this: The next page allows us to configure a database Instance. Our app doesn’t require one, so we can skip this. This step allows us to modify our configuration details. The default one is okay for our app. Now, add your environment variables like so: Now grab the URL, in my case it is http://starwarzapp.us-west-2.elasticbeanstalk.com and add to Allowed Origins(CORS) and Allowed Callback URLs in your Auth0 dashboard. Ensure that you add it as an environment variable in Elastic Beanstalk too. Add Permission like so: Review the information before launching. Launch. Live app Check out how to deploy: A Laravel app to Elastic Beanstalk. A CakePHP app to Elastic Beanstalk. A Symfony2 app to Elastic Beanstalk. A WordPress website to Elastic Beanstalk. A Drupal website to Elastic Beanstalk. Database, Caching and Cron Jobs You can use an Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS) DB instance to store data gathered and modified by your application. The database can be attached to your environment and managed by Elastic Beanstalk, or created and managed externally. Check out how to easily add a DB instance to your app. For caching, Amazon Web Services offers ElastiCache. It is a web service that makes it easy to deploy, operate, and scale an in-memory data store or cache in the cloud. Amazon ElastiCache supports two open-source in-memory engines: Redis. Memcached. Amazon ElastiCache automatically detects and replaces failed nodes, reducing the overhead associated with self-managed infrastructures and provides a resilient system that mitigates the risk of overloaded databases, which slow down websites and increase application load times. Through integration with Amazon CloudWatch, Amazon ElastiCache provides enhanced visibility into key performance metrics associated with your Redis or Memcached nodes. Companies like AirBnb, Healthguru, PlaceIQ and Tokyo Data Network use ElastiCache for caching at multiple layers spanning HTML fragments, results of expensive DB queries, ephemeral session data, and search results. Check out how to install the ElastiCache Cluster Client for PHP here. Here is an excellent post on building a PHP visitor counter with ElastiCache and Elastic Beanstalk You can set up a cron job on Elastic Beanstalk. Learn how to run cron jobs on Amazon Web Services(AWS) Elastic Beanstalk. Laravel Forge Laravel Forge , created by Taylor Otwell is a platform that helps you deploy and launch your application in minutes. It does the heavy-lifting for you. Forge takes care of provisioning your servers on popular cloud hosting providers such as Linode, Digital Ocean and AWS. It was initially built for Laravel apps, but now it has support for virtually any PHP application. Laravel Forge Laravel Forge allows you to easily do the following, apart from provisioning servers: It integrates with LetsEncrypt to generate Free SSL Certificates for your apps. Easily manage jobs and queues. Collaboration with your team by sharing your server’s management dashboard with co-workers. Matt Stauffer has an amazing post on deploying your first Laravel app to Forge. James Fairhurst also has a great guide on using Laravel Forge to setup an AWS Server. The most popular educational PHP platform, laracasts.com has a series on server management with Forge. And of course, we mention it in our Laravel course, and also cover it in in-depth tutorials like these.

SitePoint Readers Get Up To 65% OFF Now More from this author 13 of the Best WordPress Magazine Themes How to Integrate APM and Log Management: Loggly and New Relic Ever since Google started taking HTTPS into consideration as a ranking factor in 2014, people have slowly been switching their sites over to use encrypted connections. This can be one reason to set up SSL to secure WordPress – SEO. However, as of January 2017, Google made things a bit more serious by having Chrome indicate that sites which still use HTTP are insecure. When a site uses a form that gathers potentially private user data, such as login credentials, there’s an even more stringent notification showing that the site is not secure. These notifications are still in a gray color, but it probably won’t take long before we start seeing the red notification messages for all of these situations. These red messages are already visible when there is, in fact, an SSL certificate in place, but it can’t be verified. And it isn’t just Chrome — browsers like Safari, Internet Explorer and Firefox all have similar ways of showing the security, or the lack of security, on a site. An added benefit is having your site served over HTTPS is that you can make use of HTTP/2, for which SSL is a requirement. So there’s no better time than now to make the switch. In this article I will show you three ways to get the green padlock: Using CloudFlare to secure your site with a generic SSL certificate the easy way. Using Let’s Encrypt to get domain level encryption. Getting an Extended Validation SSL to achieve the highest level of certificate, wíth your business name shown instead of just the “Secure” notice. Securing WordPress the Easy Way: CloudFlare SSL Using CloudFlare to secure your site is the easiest way to do it, but it does have some caveats. Kray Mitchell did a great tutorial on how to install CloudFlare, along with its Universal SSL feature. The process is very simple: Sign up for CloudFlare, change the DNS of your site to activate CloudFlare, and turn on “Flexible SSL” in the “Crypto” section. To make it even easier, you can have CloudFlare overwrite links to non-secure URLs with the HTTPS version to prevent mixed content warnings. You do this by turning on “Automatic HTTPS Rewrites,” at the bottom of the “Crypto” section. If you install the CloudFlare WordPress plugin you can specify some of the required settings from within the WP admin. Additionally it helps to overcome an infinite loop that’s triggered sometimes when changing the URL structure to HTTPS, by modifying the header. The plugin is also the easiest way to setup Server Push, which is one of the main benefits of HTTP/2. It is really that simple! But there are two important points to acknowledge: Flexible SSL only encrypts traffic between the browser and CloudFlare. This means the traffic between CloudFlare and your site (on the origin server) is unencrypted, which still leaves room for a “Man-in-the-Middle” attack. This method also isn’t allowed when you’re using forms to sensitive information like credit card data or passwords. To be clear: You can’t use this method for e-commerce sites. CloudFlare is using a shared SSL certificate, which means that your visitors won’t be able to verify it’s really you behind the scenes. Even though most visitors won’t go through the effort of checking a certificate, it’s still something to keep in mind. Again, when it comes to becoming PCI compliant for e-commerce (maintaining an SSL certificate is one of the steps), this isn’t allowed. CloudFlare also offers “Full” and “Full (Strict)” SSL protection. The latter also validates the certificate on the origin server, which at least mitigates the first point above. However, it is still a shared certificate. For $5 per month, you can order a dedicated certificate, but there are cheaper ways to do this; for example, using Let’s Encrypt, which is covered later in this post. CloudFlare Flexible SSL is a simple way to get your site secure, but, as you’ve seen here, it gives a bit of a false sense of security. While this will prevent any punishment Google can come up with, it won’t always be the best way to actually secure your site and its visitors. But, for a basic informational site, this will do the trick. Domain Validation for Free: Let’s Encrypt Let’s Encrypt is a non-profit certificate authority where you can get a free Domain Validation SSL certificate. This means you will be issued a certificate for your own domain name, instead of a shared SSL. And because of the growing support of many large and medium sized hosting providers, the steps to implement it and create a more secure WordPress site are growing less difficult. On a mission to make the web more secure, Let’s Encrypt has automated the process of issuing certificates at the domain level, which is the lowest level of protection. There’s a manual route to get the certificate yourself. Or you could ask your host to assist you. Most hosting providers are willing to provide an SSL certificate installation for free, or for just a nominal fee. The easiest way is to find a host which offers Let’s Encrypt support. With Let’s Encrypt certificates, you have to keep in mind that they expire every 90 days. In their Why 90 Days post, the organization explains that the main reason they do this is because it limits damage from key compromise, and mis-issuance. They also think it encourages automation, which many supported providers have in place. While their reasons are valid, it requires you to either ensure your certificate is automatically renewed, whether by your hosting provider or by a process that you have set up, or to do this manually yourself every 90 days. If not, you’ll still end up with the dreaded “insecure” message. WordPress hosts like WPEngine, Dreamhost, and SiteGround either have this automation already in place, or instructions on to have their support handle it for you. Most decent hosts shouldn’t charge you for the Let’s Encrypt certificate or the installation. Dealing with Mixed Content There’s one caveat, though, which you will also experience with the EV certificates covered later in this post. Unlike with CloudFlare, you have to make sure yourself that all resources are loaded over HTTPS. If not, you will see the dreaded mixed content notification. This results in images and CSS scripts not being loaded, which means your layout will be messed up. The most important thing to do is changing the WordPress address to the HTTPS version, as this will change most files and images to be loaded over HTTPS right away, if you use relative paths to call them. You can’t always spot straight away that you’re serving mixed content. In some cases, the padlock just won’t turn green, where in other cases it does. This has mostly to do with your browser cache. Sometimes a site may display a secure notice, but the developer console in Chrome shows otherwise. Luckily, the security tab of the console is very helpful in tracing these issues. In this example, it was all a matter of changing the WordPress URL to the proper HTTPS version, after which it was all green. Another issue can be the use of absolute URLs for images, which might still be served over HTTP. There are various ways to solve this: Change the URLs in the database manually from HTTP to HTTPS or to relative URLs. Use a plugin to change the links, such as the SSL Insecure Content Fixer. Go through all of your images one by one, to make their paths relative. If you use a CDN, make sure to have that changed to SSL, or else you will still be serving insecure files. The Ultimate Solution: Extended Validation Extended Validation (EV) certificates, rather than just showing “Secure”, display your business name, indicating that you’ve gone through a process to validate that your business is, in fact, what you say it is. An EV certificate provides the highest level of security because both the domain used and the organization behind it are vetted. It’s also backed by a warranty which compensates the end user, should the site owner (you) have obtained the certificate on fraudulent pretenses, and something goes wrong. While this warranty won’t benefit you directly, it helps to assure your visitor that you are trustworthy. In addition, the added vanity effect this certificate has is great. For example, on mobile Safari: So how you get an EV SSL certificate? Well, it certainly requires more effort and paperwork than with CloudFlare and Let’s Encrypt, as it isn’t called “extended validation” for nothing! The following steps are involved: Ordering the certificate Documents: This typically involves a signed agreement to request the certificate, identify the requester, and for the legal warranties. Verification of business documents: The paperwork about the business. Verification behind the scenes: The CA will do research to verify information about your business, and about you. Verification by phone: Both for the certificate requester and for the business contact. My Experience With Extended Validation I ordered an extended validation certificate for a website of mine, and the process went relatively smoothly. I’ve briefly documented the required steps here to give you an inside look into the process. Step 1: Ordering the Certificate Domain validation is part of the whole process, and NameCheap has a few steps in place to set this up, after which Comodo takes over. I ordered a Comodo EV SSL certificate, which you can get at most larger registrars, as well directly from Comodo. Step 2: Signed Documents I first needed to sign a certificate request by hand, which was followed up by a more extensive certificate subscriber agreement. The first form was used to identify both my company and me, as well as the domain involved. This is also where I needed to fill in my Assumed Name (Let’s Grind Some Coffee), to be used instead of my business name. Next up was up 8-page subscriber agreement, which is used to cover the all the legal implications that come with a certificate. Both forms are used in step 4, where I had to verify myself, the application, and my business by phone. While this document isn’t something to worry about, it is used to set the boundaries for certification fraud. All documents had to be printed, signed, scanned, and sent back. Step 3: Verification of Business Documents As my business was incorporated in the Netherlands, the Comodo verification team didn’t have access to the local Chamber of Commerce register. I had to send in an extract of my registration, which was a digitally signed document. Important note about Assumed Names: If you intend to use an Assumed Name, it’s important that you have this name registered as a trade name prior to your EV application. If you don’t have a trade name registered, you can’t have an Assumed Name in your certificate. Step 4: Verification Behind the Scenes I don’t know all the actions which were performed as a part of their verification, of course. However, investigators can check social profiles, such as LinkedIn, use tools like Google Maps to check the physical location of your company, or potentially even send someone to the listed address to check it out. As both I and my company were easy to find on the internet, this step didn’t cause any real delay, but depending on the circumstances, it could take longer than it did in my case. Step 5: Verification by Phone The final step was for them to call me to verify my request, business details and domain name, and actually speak to me. The call lasted a few minutes, where I had to answer a few verification questions like “Are you Jacco Blankenspoor?“, “For which domain name are you requesting this certificate?“. The agent confirmed everything was correct, and that I would receive my certificate within a day. A few hours later, I received the mail containing both my certificate, as well as a Comodo Trust logo to display on my site. The whole process requires quite a bit of paperwork. If you’re just interested in getting a regular SSL certificate, with just the green padlock and not your business name, any regular domain validated SSL certificate will do. In either case, once you have it, all you have to do then is get it uploaded to your hosting environment, which you can check your host’s support are for instructions on doing. Conclusion Whether you get a basic Domain Validation certification or go full-on with an Extended Validation certification to have your business name displayed, it’s now easier than it ever was before to build a secure WordPress site, and make your users feel safe. In the end, it comes down to this: A CloudFlare certificate is the most convenient process of all. It will do, but given all of its downsides, this wouldn’t be my preferred choice. If you’re looking for basic security, a free Let’s Encrypt certificate will do and shouldn’t be too much of a hassle to get up and running. Also, it will keep Google off your back about your site being insecure. If maximum security and maximum customer peace of mind is what you’re after, an EV certificate is what you need. If you have any questions, please let me know in the comments, where I am happy to help.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) Cloud, Featured, Google Google Launches Its First Cloud Data Centers in AWS’s Virginia Backyard by Yevgeniy Sverdlik  on May 10, 2017 Add Your Comments Tweet Google has brought online its first cloud data centers in Northern Virginia, the largest data center market in the US and one of the largest in the world, as well as the location of the biggest cloud availability region of Amazon Web Services, whose business Google Cloud Platform is going after with a vengeance (and $10 billion in annual data center spend). While AWS remains far ahead its rivals in terms of market share, Microsoft, Google, IBM, Alibaba, and Oracle all reported faster cloud revenue growth in this year’s first quarter than did Amazon. Northern Virginia has seen the snowball effect of data centers’ clustering tendencies play out more than most other regions around the world. Hyper-scale cloud companies have all flocked to the region in recent years to take advantage of all the interconnection opportunities there, and data center developers have been racing to build in the region to satisfy the demand.

Google launching cloud data centers in this big internet nerve center means customer applications serving Northeastern and Mid-Atlantic regions will see big latency improvements if they host their cloud apps and data there, GCP product manager Dave Stiver wrote in a blog post announcing the launch Wednesday: “Our performance testing shows 25%–85% reductions in RTT latency when serving customers in Washington DC, New York, Boston, Montreal, and Toronto compared to using our Iowa or South Carolina regions.” The Alphabet subsidiary has been spending billions on new cloud data centers to support its enterprise business as it races to bulk up the list of physical infrastructure locations it can offer customers. Urs Hölzle, the company’s senior VP for technical infrastructure, said in March that it had been investing about $10 billion in capital annually on this infrastructure push. See also: Cloud Giants Disagree on Future of Corporate Data Centers Google launched three availability zones in Northern Virginia, which means three data centers, each with its own physical infrastructure (although not necessarily in three separate buildings). Google usually launches multiple data centers within a region, each hosting a separate availability zone for intra-regional redundancy. Some regions launch with two zones, but the goal is to eventually have at least three per region. Northern Virginia is Google’s fourth availability region in the US and seventh worldwide. The company has announced plans to launch cloud data centers in Montreal, California, and São Paulo, as well as four European regions, and three in Asia Pacific.

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS US Edition Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending Buying Guides iPhone 8 Samsung Galaxy S8 Surface Laptop Samsung Galaxy Note 8 Project Scorpio VPN News Upgrade your Street View: Google picks the best cameras for 360-degree snaps Upgrade your Street View: Google picks the best cameras for 360-degree snaps By Andrew London Cameras   Create your own Street View experiences Shares Google has released a certification for 360-degree cameras that will be able to create content for its Street View platform. There are currently 20 cameras that are due for release in 2017 that will meet the new standard. What this will mean is that you will now be able to create visual ‘experiences’ that you can share to the Google platform. According to the press release, it will be as simple as connecting a certified camera to a phone with the Street View app, and Google does all “the heavy lifting of connecting each frame of your video into a traditional, interactive Street View experience”. In the press release, Street View’s Product Manager Charles Armstrong talks about being “eager to invite my family who lives on the other side of the globe to wander through my local farmers market” but finding the still photos he took fell short of the real experience. With the new Street View app, he could create a 360-degree experience for them. Ready to roll At present, the vast majority of content on the platform is created by Google, with its Street View cars and backpack rigs. While the ability to more easily share your own images on the platform will certainly make Street View more useful (and probably more fun) we do wonder whether this is a shrewd way of Google getting its users to do its work for it. There are four different classifications: mobile ready, auto ready, VR ready and workflow ready. Mobile ready is probably going to be the most useful to the average user, allowing people to shoot and upload content directly from their phone. Auto ready is for capturing footage from vehicles, and if the press release is anything to go by, vehicle has pretty loose parameters, possibly including bikes and horses.   VR ready and workflow are the two more professional certifications, for cameras with geometric sensors for rendering a VR experience and for publishing tools respectively.  For the range of supported cameras and software, as well as which category they fit into, check out this image from Google: Hands on: Samsung Gear 360 2017 review Related news Apple Siri Speaker release date, news and rumors The best free alternative to iTunes 2017 Samsung may be making its own Bixby-equipped Amazon Echo rival Huawei P11: what we want to see See more Cameras news Tech deals, prizes and latest news Get the best tech deals, reviews, product advice, competitions, unmissable tech news and more!

Make Save Borrow Grow Live More Deals The Smartest Virtual Assistant — Alexa, Cortana, Google or Siri? Karla Bowsher May 10, 2017 Photo by Zapp2Photo / Shutterstock.com The Smartest Virtual Assistant — Alexa, Cortana, Google or Siri? 0 If you’re like many folks, you own a device with an interactive assistant or you’ve considered buying one. After all, Amazon says it sold millions of Alexa devices last year alone. The technology behind such devices is commonly referred to as a “personal assistant” or “virtual assistant,” and often described as “intelligent.” Stone Temple Consulting Corp., a marketing agency, recently set out to determine which assistant is the most intelligent. Before we get into the findings, though, let’s take a look at the four assistants that were tested. Intelligent personal assistants Alexa is the assistant within various devices sold by Amazon, including the voice-activated Echo and Echo Dot. Last year, Google introduced its Alexa competitor, the Google Assistant, which comes with Google Home, a voice-activated speaker. Perhaps the best-known intelligent personal assistant is Apple’s Siri, available on certain Apple devices. Microsoft’s Cortana, available on certain Microsoft devices, is Siri’s equivalent for Windows. Stone Temple Consulting notes that all four of these assistants can help take actions, like ordering flowers or booking a flight, on your behalf. That capability was not tested, though. Comparing intelligence Stone Temple Consulting tested the four assistants’ smarts from a knowledge perspective. The agency collected 5,000 questions “about everyday factual knowledge,” posed them to each assistant, and examined their responses. For example, the agency looked at how often the assistants responded verbally to a question, how often they answered correctly and completely, how often they didn’t understand the question, and how often they gave a wrong answer. Stone Temple Consulting concluded that Google “has the clear lead in terms of overall smarts” but noted that Microsoft’s Cortana is “pressing quite hard to close the gap, and has made great strides in the last three years.” Amazon’s Alexa and Apple’s Siri are limited in terms of smarts because they aren’t as good at systematically scouring the internet for responses to supplement their knowledge bases. Note that Google and Microsoft are tech companies that offer internet search engines — Google Search and Bing, respectively — while Amazon and Apple are not. Do you own a device with an intelligent personal assistant, or are you considering one? Let us know which one and why — comment below or on our Facebook page.

The Play Store adopts new app and notification icons with v7.8.16 [APK Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/10 6:25pm PDTMay 10, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 168 Share on Facebook 59 Share on Twitter Total Shares286 Applications Downloads News Google never stops changing things up. A new version of the Play Store app is rolling out to users and it comes with a new icons for the app launcher and notifications. They're simple cosmetic adjustments, but these are the types of things you can't help but notice as soon as they're on your screen. Left: Old version. Right: New version. The new app icon leaves behind the last remnants of the shopping bag icon that came along when Google still called this the Android Market. It is now just the Google Play logo with no other ornamentation. It's worth noting that the round icon variant hasn't changed, so it still looks like the Google Play logo on a dinner plate. Above: Old version. Below: New version. The notification icons have also gone through a little facelift. These also trade away the tote bag motif for the Google Play triangle, but slightly adjusted with the checkmark extending beyond the lines. The notification icons come in different colors for each of the content stores (e.g. apps, books, movies). The notification icon for stacked updates – when more than one app is installed or updated – is no longer a stack of blocks, it's just the same triangle app icon used with single installs. We're still looking for more changes in this update, but it's starting to look like this may be it. If you don't want to wait for Google to send this update out to you, grab it from the APK Mirror link below. Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

They are going to change play Store soon too lol Total Insecurity How do you know that? boop Unless you mean the name, the app just got another design update. sbeaulieu Isn't that the same icon from a couple of years ago? Tom Westrick We've always been at war with Eastasia 4Ui812 Looks like I'll have to wait until it gets pushed. Apkmirrior won't let me download it (I don't turn off my ad blocker for anyone :-) Gjorgi Lazarovski You can download even with the adblocker on. You just need to wait like 10 sec for the download button to show up. sklatigre Can confirm Richard Branches The play store icon on google chrome is still the old one, they should update it as well... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/bca1aca3fd5b60e08fcd507e7c39b67f23f70ed0e4ff417bcf62881906f7106a.png Тарас Мукин Chrome apps were announced to be removed soon. Don't think they are going to bother. Richard Branches You're right about that, but they still will be available on Chrome OS so why not update it anyway?... Tom Westrick If they wait long enough it'll just be back to that logo C64 Thank god / satan (choose your preference) for icon packs Konrad Krawczuk Icon packs are always kinda problem to me. If you have a few without icon from icon pack you must always fight with inconsistency. Jose Romero Google IO can't come sooner. Devin Studios Looks kinda boring compared to the old icon. Breathless So wait what happened to circles?... Cody Toombs Circles are there on the Pixel and in any other situation where the round icons are chosen. The triangle icon shows up on everything else. Anton Kuznetsov Triangles is the new circles burkett375 Since they love to A/B test, make 7 different message apps, etc....they should make 3 competing app stores/markets/hubs Ben Godfrey Don't give them any "good" ideas ;) Sumeet Deshmukh People who paid a lot of money to Google aren't getting these icon updates, the pixel guys mattcoz Because our icons already dropped the shopping bag, no need for an update. Sumeet Deshmukh I was a little sarcastical, I love my pixel (styled rom on my Nexus 5 (not x) Victor Stuber ya, but we got crappy white circles around all our icons. It sucks Leon I like my circles personally. sklatigre Gonna miss the shopping bag notification, kinda liked it. Margaritas Ante Porcos Google is a mess in everything. Berkay Anyone else dislike both the circled icon and just the icon by itself? I prefer the shopping bag... It looks the best IMO. Thomas I loved the Android Market icon. Made so much sense Jesse Kawell Once you see that notification icon "checkmark" ✅ as a 3D post lying down at an angle, you can never unsee it. BoFiS Aww, that's sad, and almost unrecognizable now since I still call mine "Market" on my homescreen... Branko Proof that Google lost the plot. reCoded So, the circle icon is the same I guess? Anton Kuznetsov This localization of 'update all' button text is awful https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/57e6791db8965bf1e13f4f50e3b6b5b303644e9c3f1660799bf9896ed1ef57b3.png YuCMi Jesus christ Google. What sin did the previous icon commit? Was it too old for you guys? Grey Very ugly and hard to understand. Not intuitive at all. But I guess that's Google 2017! Lawstorant Looks generic af.

At least eight civilians were killed on both sides in fighting that began when a Pakistani census team accompanied by soldiers visited disputed villages along the southern border on Friday. Load Error Pakistan inherited its 2,400-kilometre (1,500-mile) border with its western neighbour when it gained independence from Britain in 1947, but Afghanistan has never formally recognised it. And while official Afghan maps reflect the so-called "Durand Line", many nationalists believe the true border of their country ends at the River Indus that runs though Pakistan and gave India its name. "Officials from the geological survey departments of the two countries will conduct a survey, and they will also make use of Google Maps," said a senior Pakistani security source in Islamabad who requested anonymity. Abdul Razeq, the police chief of Afghanistan's Kandahar province, added: "After negotiations, both sides have agreed that a geological survey should be conducted. "Technical teams of both countries will use GPS and Google Maps as well as other means to get the answer." Internet firm Google complies with local laws in certain countries that compel it to show borders in line with national demands. For instance, its Indian site shows the entirety of disputed Kashmir as controlled by India. In Pakistan, however, the site shows the internationally recognised de facto border, the Line of Control, marked with a dotted line to denote it is disputed. In 2010 Google was embroiled in a Central American border dispute that saw two neighbouring countries dispatch troops and heavily armed police to their joint border. The incident happened after a Nicaraguan commander cited Google's version of the border map in an interview with Costa Rican newspaper La Nacion to justify a raid on a disputed area of Costa Rica. Google later said it had made a mistake and corrected its map to reflect one sanctioned by the US State Department. Pakistan last year began trying to harden the traditionally soft border with Afghanistan through trenching and fencing, but its efforts were met with hostility from Kabul. Ethnic Pashtuns living in the region have traditionally paid it little heed. Villages straddling the frontier have mosques and houses with one door in Pakistan and another in Afghanistan. Pakistani forces on Sunday elevated their rhetoric when they said they had also killed "more than 50 soldiers" in last week's border clashes - a claim quickly rejected by Kabul, which said it lost two soldiers.

Subscribe to Ubergizmo on Youtube With the launch of Google Cardboard and Daydream, it is no secret that Google is interested in pursuing virtual reality (VR). We’ve seen the company make some headway in that regards, and it looks like they’re taking things even further as they have announced that they have acquired VR developers Owlchemy Labs. For those unfamiliar with Owlchemy Labs, they are the company behind VR games/apps such as Job Simulator and Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality, which is based on the popular cartoon TV series Rick and Morty. One of the signatures of the developers is their hand tracking in which they attempt to closely mimic the use of real hands in VR, making users feel like those are their real hands. In a post on their website, Owlchemy Labs wrote, “Over those years, we learned that Owlchemy, at its core, cares deeply about a few key things: building quality multi-platform games, solving tough problems with a small but absurdly talented team, sharing our learnings with the community, and Austin’s famous tacos. Now, as we look to the future with Google by our side, we couldn’t be happier. Our plan to build awesome things will continue forward stronger than ever.” The developer also stated that despite being acquired by Google, they will continue to develop VR content for other platforms, such as the HTC Vive, Oculus Touch, and PlayStation VR, so fret not if you were worried about Google suddenly making it an exclusive.

A currently unpatched exploit in the Android operating system means almost 40% of users are vulnerable to screen-hijacking apps, but it is unlikely to be fixed until the summer. The bug, which was first spotted by researchers at Check Point, is caused by a development oversight in Android permissions, which in the past required users to manually grant downloaded applications the ability to display content on top of other app panes. However following complaints from users who found it difficult to manually whitelist each app, the Android 6.0.1 'Marshmallow' update made this process automatic, which was good news for legitimate apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. It appears that fix has meant apps hiding malicious codes are able to bypass security also being automatically granted the same access, specifically the 'SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW' permission. According to Google's own statistics, the vulnerability will be active on close to 40% of all Android devices.  "As a temporary solution, Google applied a patch in Android version 6.0.1 that allows the Play Store app to grant run-time permissions, which are later used to grant SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW permission to apps installed from the app store," the Check Point research team explained in a blog post. "This means that a malicious app downloaded directly from the app store will be automatically granted this dangerous permission." This permission is particularly dangerous as it allows an app to display over any other app, without notifying the user. This means apps are able to display fraudulent adverts or links to content hosting malicious code, which are heavily used in banking Trojans. "It can also be used by ransomware to create a persistent on-top screen that will prevent non-technical users from accessing their devices," explained the team. This particular permissions exploit is used by 74% of all ransomware, 57% of adware and 14% of banker malware, according to the report, clearly demonstrating that this is a widespread tactic in the wild. What's worrying is that Google has stated that a fix will be available in time for the release of Android O, which isn't expected until late summer. In the meantime, Check Point has urged users to beware of dodgy-looking apps and to check the comments left by other users. Although the Play Store is able to police the apps being uploaded to its platform, malicious content is repeatedly bypassing security checks. Check Point recently disclosed the discovery of a new malware strain hidden inside game guides hosted on the Play Store, thought to have infected close to two million Android devices over the past seven months.   This article originally appeared at itpro.co.uk Related Articles Half of Android devices failed to get security updates last year 10 ways to harden the security on your Android phone Android tops 2016 vulnerability list - security industry says "meh!"

By: AFP | Kandahar | Published:May 11, 2017 8:10 am Pakistan and Afghanistan plan to use Google Maps to help settle a border dispute that led to deadly clashes last week, officials from both sides said on Monday. At least eight civilians were killed on both sides in fighting that began when a Pakistani census team accompanied by soldiers visited disputed villages along the southern border on Friday. Pakistan inherited its 2,400-kilometre (1,500-mile) border with its western neighbour when it gained independence from Britain in 1947, but Afghanistan has never formally recognised it. And while official Afghan maps reflect the so-called “Durand Line”, many nationalists believe the true border of their country ends at the River Indus that runs though Pakistan and gave India its name. “Officials from the geological survey departments of the two countries will conduct a survey, and they will also make use of Google Maps,” said a senior Pakistani security source in Islamabad who requested anonymity. Abdul Razeq, the police chief of Afghanistan’s Kandahar province, added: “After negotiations, both sides have agreed that a geological survey should be conducted. “Technical teams of both countries will use GPS and Google Maps as well as other means to get the answer.” Internet firm Google complies with local laws in certain countries that compel it to show borders in line with national demands. For instance, its Indian site shows the entirety of disputed Kashmir as controlled by India. In Pakistan, however, the site shows the internationally recognised de facto border, the Line of Control, marked with a dotted line to denote it is disputed. In 2010 Google was embroiled in a Central American border dispute that saw two neighbouring countries dispatch troops and heavily armed police to their joint border. The incident happened after a Nicaraguan commander cited Google’s version of the border map in an interview with Costa Rican newspaper La Nacion to justify a raid on a disputed area of Costa Rica. Google later said it had made a mistake and corrected its map to reflect one sanctioned by the US State Department. Pakistan last year began trying to harden the traditionally soft border with Afghanistan through trenching and fencing, but its efforts were met with hostility from Kabul. Ethnic Pashtuns living in the region have traditionally paid it little heed. Villages straddling the frontier have mosques and houses with one door in Pakistan and another in Afghanistan. Pakistani forces on Sunday elevated their rhetoric when they said they had also killed “more than 50 soldiers” in last week’s border clashes – a claim quickly rejected by Kabul, which said it lost two soldiers.

The Play Store adopts new app and notification icons with v7.8.16 [APK Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/10 6:25pm PDTMay 10, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 168 Share on Facebook 59 Share on Twitter Total Shares286 Applications Downloads News Google never stops changing things up. A new version of the Play Store app is rolling out to users and it comes with a new icons for the app launcher and notifications. They're simple cosmetic adjustments, but these are the types of things you can't help but notice as soon as they're on your screen. Left: Old version. Right: New version. The new app icon leaves behind the last remnants of the shopping bag icon that came along when Google still called this the Android Market. It is now just the Google Play logo with no other ornamentation. It's worth noting that the round icon variant hasn't changed, so it still looks like the Google Play logo on a dinner plate. Above: Old version. Below: New version. The notification icons have also gone through a little facelift. These also trade away the tote bag motif for the Google Play triangle, but slightly adjusted with the checkmark extending beyond the lines. The notification icons come in different colors for each of the content stores (e.g. apps, books, movies). The notification icon for stacked updates – when more than one app is installed or updated – is no longer a stack of blocks, it's just the same triangle app icon used with single installs. We're still looking for more changes in this update, but it's starting to look like this may be it. If you don't want to wait for Google to send this update out to you, grab it from the APK Mirror link below. Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

Tom Westrick We've always been at war with Eastasia 4Ui812 Looks like I'll have to wait until it gets pushed. Apkmirrior won't let me download it (I don't turn off my ad blocker for anyone :-) Gjorgi Lazarovski You can download even with the adblocker on.

Don't think they are going to bother. Richard Branches You're right about that, but they still will be available on Chrome OS so why not update it anyway?... Tom Westrick If they wait long enough it'll just be back to that logo C64 Thank god / satan (choose your preference) for icon packs Konrad Krawczuk Icon packs are always kinda problem to me. If you have a few without icon from icon pack you must always fight with inconsistency. Jose Romero Google IO can't come sooner. Devin Studios Looks kinda boring compared to the old icon. Breathless So wait what happened to circles?... Cody Toombs Circles are there on the Pixel and in any other situation where the round icons are chosen. The triangle icon shows up on everything else. Anton Kuznetsov Triangles is the new circles burkett375 Since they love to A/B test, make 7 different message apps, etc....they should make 3 competing app stores/markets/hubs Ben Godfrey Don't give them any "good" ideas ;) Sumeet Deshmukh People who paid a lot of money to Google aren't getting these icon updates, the pixel guys mattcoz Because our icons already dropped the shopping bag, no need for an update. Sumeet Deshmukh I was a little sarcastical, I love my pixel (styled rom on my Nexus 5 (not x) Victor Stuber ya, but we got crappy white circles around all our icons. It sucks Leon I like my circles personally. sklatigre Gonna miss the shopping bag notification, kinda liked it. Margaritas Ante Porcos Google is a mess in everything. Berkay Anyone else dislike both the circled icon and just the icon by itself? I prefer the shopping bag... It looks the best IMO. Thomas I loved the Android Market icon. Made so much sense Jesse Kawell Once you see that notification icon "checkmark" ✅ as a 3D post lying down at an angle, you can never unsee it. BoFiS Aww, that's sad, and almost unrecognizable now since I still call mine "Market" on my homescreen... Branko Proof that Google lost the plot. reCoded So, the circle icon is the same I guess? Anton Kuznetsov This localization of 'update all' button text is awful https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/57e6791db8965bf1e13f4f50e3b6b5b303644e9c3f1660799bf9896ed1ef57b3.png YuCMi Jesus christ Google. What sin did the previous icon commit? Was it too old for you guys? Grey Very ugly and hard to understand. Not intuitive at all. But I guess that's Google 2017! Lawstorant Looks generic af.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 11 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Google Street View Used to Find “Lost” 1930s-era British Cycleways Historian uses CIA-funded technology to find buried and lost transport infrastructure. Fantastic fusion of historical knowledge with digital tech” — Robin Lovelace, Institute for Transport Studies, Leeds University, England. NEWCASTLE UPON TYNE, TYNE AND WEAR, UNITED KINGDOM, May 10, 2017 /EINPresswire.com/ — A British historian has used the spin-off from an American military mapping project to discover nearly 300 miles of “lost” cycleways in the UK. These cycleways were installed beside English, Welsh, Scottish and Irish roads between 1934 and 1940, but were abandoned after the Second World War. Many were surfaced with red concrete, protected cyclists with curbs and extended for many miles. They were commissioned by the British government’s Ministry of Transport and were built on both sides of the arterial roads constructed in the 1930s. Author and historian Carlton Reid used archive sources to identify the likely locations for the cycleways, and then confirmed their existence with Google Street View. “From the comfort of my desk I’ve been able to back-up my hunches by zooming in to the images provided by the Street View cameras,” said Reid, who is funding further researches with a crowd-funding campaign. “Some of the 1930s-era cycleways I’ve identified are either fully or partially buried, but most are above ground, in full view but they are not recognized for what they are, which is innovative-for-the-time cycle-specific infrastructure that’s more than 80-years-old,” said Reid. “The cycleways have been wide and often curb-protected since they were built, but it was quickly forgotten when and who they were built for,” he added. “I’ve visited some of these cycleways in-the-flesh but the advent of open-access online imagery has meant it’s quicker and cheaper to discover them from my desk.” Google Street View is an off-shoot from Google Earth, the descendant of EarthViewer, a CIA-funded project that was used by the US military in war zones from the late 1990s onwards. Google acquired EarthViewer in 2004 and rebranded it as Google Earth in 2005. Archeologists often use Google Earth – and other open-access satellite-imagery services – to find hidden hill-forts and even buried treasure, but this is the first time the satellite and street-level imagery has been used to discover hidden-in-plain-sight 1930s-era cycleways. Reid has partnered with a London-based urban planner to bring back to life perhaps hundreds of miles of these forgotten cycleways. John Dales of Urban Movement will take Reid’s historical research and use it to show local and national authorities that there’s often plenty of space for cycling – because the space was allocated many years previously. Cycle advocacy organizations often campaign for the sort of cycleways common in the Netherlands, and what Reid’s project is showing is that the British Ministry of Transport worked with its Dutch equivalent in the 1930s to create just such a Dutch-style system. Reid discovered the extent of the 1930s-era cycleway network during the research for a cycle history book to be published next month. “Bike Boom” (Island Press, Washington, DC, June 2017) contains information on the 1930s-era cycleways with the Kickstarter campaign enabling him to continue his research work. Environmental geographer Robin Lovelace said the project was a “fantastic fusion of historical knowledge with digital tech.” Lovelace, a Leeds University academic who works for the Institute for Transport Studies, added that reviving the 1930s cycleways could lead to a “more sustainable transport future.” Gold-medal-winning Olympian Chris Boardman of membership organization British Cycling has described Reid’s Kickstarter campaign as a “marvelous proposal” adding that it “could recover some of our lost past and give normal people the opportunity to change the way they travel, in safety.” Some of the cycleways Reid has digitally uncovered extend for a few miles either side of the suburban arterial roads built in the 1930s, but he has also identified residential cycleways (they are often now treated as “private roads” with cars parked on them). Archive maps show that the 18-mile Southend Arterial Road from Gallows Corner in Romford, near London, to Southend once had cycleways along its full length (they were known as “cycle tracks” at the time) and this cycleway linked in to others in the area. “Let’s rescue Britain’s forgotten 1930s protected cycleways” was launched on Kickstarter on 25th April and exceeded its $9,000 target within three days. 429 backers have so far pledged $15,500. The campaign ends on 25th May. NOTES Carlton Reid is the Newcastle-based executive editor of trade magazine BikeBiz.com and author of “Roads Were Not Built for Cars” (Island Press, Washington, DC, 2015).

The Play Store adopts new app and notification icons with v7.8.16 [APK Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/10 6:25pm PDTMay 10, 2017 59 Plus 1 on G+ 168 Share on Facebook 59 Share on Twitter Total Shares286 Applications Downloads News Google never stops changing things up. A new version of the Play Store app is rolling out to users and it comes with a new icons for the app launcher and notifications. They're simple cosmetic adjustments, but these are the types of things you can't help but notice as soon as they're on your screen. Left: Old version. Right: New version. The new app icon leaves behind the last remnants of the shopping bag icon that came along when Google still called this the Android Market. It is now just the Google Play logo with no other ornamentation. It's worth noting that the round icon variant hasn't changed, so it still looks like the Google Play logo on a dinner plate. Above: Old version. Below: New version. The notification icons have also gone through a little facelift. These also trade away the tote bag motif for the Google Play triangle, but slightly adjusted with the checkmark extending beyond the lines. The notification icons come in different colors for each of the content stores (e.g. apps, books, movies). The notification icon for stacked updates – when more than one app is installed or updated – is no longer a stack of blocks, it's just the same triangle app icon used with single installs. We're still looking for more changes in this update, but it's starting to look like this may be it. If you don't want to wait for Google to send this update out to you, grab it from the APK Mirror link below. Download The APK is signed by Google and upgrades your existing app. The cryptographic signature guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Rather than wait for Google to push this download to your devices, which can take days, download and install it just like any other APK.

They are going to change play Store soon too lol Total Insecurity How do you know that? boop Unless you mean the name, the app just got another design update. sbeaulieu Isn't that the same icon from a couple of years ago? Tom Westrick We've always been at war with Eastasia 4Ui812 Looks like I'll have to wait until it gets pushed. Apkmirrior won't let me download it (I don't turn off my ad blocker for anyone :-) Gjorgi Lazarovski You can download even with the adblocker on. You just need to wait like 10 sec for the download button to show up. sklatigre Can confirm Richard Branches The play store icon on google chrome is still the old one, they should update it as well... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/bca1aca3fd5b60e08fcd507e7c39b67f23f70ed0e4ff417bcf62881906f7106a.png Тарас Мукин Chrome apps were announced to be removed soon. Don't think they are going to bother. Richard Branches You're right about that, but they still will be available on Chrome OS so why not update it anyway?... Tom Westrick If they wait long enough it'll just be back to that logo C64 Thank god / satan (choose your preference) for icon packs Konrad Krawczuk Icon packs are always kinda problem to me. If you have a few without icon from icon pack you must always fight with inconsistency. Jose Romero Google IO can't come sooner. Devin Studios Looks kinda boring compared to the old icon. Breathless So wait what happened to circles?... Cody Toombs Circles are there on the Pixel and in any other situation where the round icons are chosen. The triangle icon shows up on everything else. Anton Kuznetsov Triangles is the new circles burkett375 Since they love to A/B test, make 7 different message apps, etc....they should make 3 competing app stores/markets/hubs Ben Godfrey Don't give them any "good" ideas ;) Sumeet Deshmukh People who paid a lot of money to Google aren't getting these icon updates, the pixel guys mattcoz Because our icons already dropped the shopping bag, no need for an update. Sumeet Deshmukh I was a little sarcastical, I love my pixel (styled rom on my Nexus 5 (not x) Victor Stuber ya, but we got crappy white circles around all our icons. It sucks Leon I like my circles personally. sklatigre Gonna miss the shopping bag notification, kinda liked it. Margaritas Ante Porcos Google is a mess in everything. Berkay Anyone else dislike both the circled icon and just the icon by itself? I prefer the shopping bag... It looks the best IMO. Thomas I loved the Android Market icon. Made so much sense Jesse Kawell Once you see that notification icon "checkmark" ✅ as a 3D post lying down at an angle, you can never unsee it. BoFiS Aww, that's sad, and almost unrecognizable now since I still call mine "Market" on my homescreen... Branko Proof that Google lost the plot. reCoded So, the circle icon is the same I guess? Anton Kuznetsov This localization of 'update all' button text is awful https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/57e6791db8965bf1e13f4f50e3b6b5b303644e9c3f1660799bf9896ed1ef57b3.png YuCMi Jesus christ Google. What sin did the previous icon commit? Was it too old for you guys? Grey Very ugly and hard to understand. Not intuitive at all. But I guess that's Google 2017! Lawstorant Looks generic af.

Owlchemy Labs, makers of Job Simulator and Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality, joins Google Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/10 5:18pm PDTMay 10, 2017 10 Plus 1 on G+ 12 Share on Facebook 30 Share on Twitter Total Shares52 Games Google News Videos Google and Owlchemy Labs are ready to get schwifty together, as the one has now eaten the other like so many Pac-Man dots on the field of VR games. Both companies made their coordinated announcements earlier today. Google has been expanding their VR efforts pretty aggressively recently, so it's not too surprising. Although Owlchemy has produced Android games in the past, as of yet none of their VR works have been for the platform. There is no doubt that in the nascent market of virtual reality games, Owlchemy is one of the better names to have risen. They're quick and prolific, having produced Job Simulator as a launch title for the Oculus and HTC Vive, as well as following the success up quickly with Rick and Morty: virtual Rick-ality. The studio claims, following a test of the DK1, they vowed never to look back to boring flat-screen games again, and their efforts in the genre have resulted in immediate recognition and praise. Alas, that the above Rick and Morty game is not for Android. Owlchemy Labs' products are among the best (and funniest) out there, so I don't think it's any surprise Google would have expressed an interest if they wanted to buy a VR content producer. The folks over at Owlchemy are very excited about the deal. I hope that the extra resources from being a part of the great Googopoly result in more good VR times for us as consumers. Let's hope we can see some of their games ported over to Daydream. Wubba lubba dub dub.

The 7-inch screen on the new Echo Show enables the speaker to supplement voice responses with visuals and other information displays, similar to the Echolike features on the Fire tablets and Fire TV streaming devices. Amazon’s Echo Show has touch screen and video-calling capabilities as it competes with Google's efforts at bringing ‘smarts’ to the home. The device goes on sale June 28. AMAZON.COM Enlarge That could mean extended weather forecasts or music lyrics to go with the song to which you’re listening. You can also call up cooking tutorials on YouTube, hands-free, while making dinner. You can make video calls with other Echo Show devices or the Alexa app for iPhones and Android phones. Two previous models, the original Echo and the smaller Echo Dot, will get audio-calling only, as they lack screens and cameras. Video and audio calls will be free. The Echo Show, which goes on sale on June 28 for $230, is the priciest Echo yet. The market for voice-assisted speakers is small but growing. The research firm eMarketer expects usage of such speakers to more than double this year, with nearly 36 million Americans using such a device at least once a month by year’s end. Amazon’s Echo is expected to continue its dominance, with a share of nearly 71 percent, though eMarketer expects Google’s Home speaker to cut into that share over time. A few weeks ago, Google Home got the ability to recognize individuals within a family by voice, allowing for more precise recommendations and ad targeting. So far, Amazon doesn’t have a comparable voice-recognition feature. On the other hand, Google Home doesn’t have a screen or video calling. All Echo devices can respond to voice requests for weather, news, music, and other tasks. The original device, simply called Echo, is on sale for $150. The speaker on the $50 Echo Dot isn’t as good, as it’s meant to be used with speakers you may already own. The $130 Amazon Tap is a battery-powered version. Two weeks ago, Amazon unveiled the Echo Look, a device focused on offering fashion advice. It’s available by invitation only for $200. Neither the Look nor the Tap will handle calls.

Arend Hintze, Michigan State University Updated 8:42 pm, Wednesday, May 10, 2017 Arend Hintze, Michigan State University (THE CONVERSATION) Way back in the 1980s, a schoolteacher challenged me to write a computer program that played tic-tac-toe. I failed miserably. But just a couple of weeks ago, I explained to one of my computer science graduate students how to solve tic-tac-toe using the so-called “Minimax algorithm,” and it took us about an hour to write a program to do it. Certainly my coding skills have improved over the years, but computer science has come a long way too. What seemed impossible just a couple of decades ago is startlingly easy today. In 1997, people were stunned when a chess-playing IBM computer named Deep Blue beat international grandmaster Garry Kasparov in a six-game match. In 2015, Google revealed that its DeepMind system had mastered several 1980s-era video games, including teaching itself a crucial winning strategy in “Breakout.” In 2016, Google’s AlphaGo system beat a top-ranked Go player in a five-game tournament. The quest for technological systems that can beat humans at games continues. In late May, AlphaGo will take on Ke Jie, the best player in the world, among other opponents at the Future of Go Summit in Wuzhen, China. With increasing computing power, and improved engineering, computers can beat humans even at games we thought relied on human intuition, wit, deception or bluffing – like poker. I recently saw a video in which volleyball players practice their serves and spikes against robot-controlled rubber arms trying to block the shots. One lesson is clear: When machines play to win, human effort is futile. This can be great: We want a perfect AI to drive our cars, and a tireless system looking for signs of cancer in X-rays. But when it comes to play, we don’t want to lose. Fortunately, AI can make games more fun, and perhaps even endlessly enjoyable. Latest news videos Today’s game designers – who write releases that earn more than a blockbuster movie – see a problem: Creating an unbeatable artificial intelligence system is pointless. Nobody wants to play a game they have no chance of winning. But people do want to play games that are immersive, complex and surprising. Even today’s best games become stale after a person plays for a while. The ideal game will engage players by adapting and reacting in ways that keep the game interesting, maybe forever. So when we’re designing artificial intelligence systems, we should look not to the triumphant Deep Blues and AlphaGos of the world, but rather to the overwhelming success of massively multiplayer online games like “World of Warcraft.” These sorts of games are graphically well-designed, but their key attraction is interaction. It seems as if most people are not drawn to extremely difficult logical puzzles like chess and Go, but rather to meaningful connections and communities. The real challenge with these massively multi-player online games is not whether they can be beaten by intelligence (human or artificial), but rather how to keep the experience of playing them fresh and new every time. At present, game environments allow people lots of possible interactions with other players. The roles in a dungeon raiding party are well-defined: Fighters take the damage, healers help them recover from their injuries and the fragile wizards cast spells from afar. Or think of “Portal 2,” a game focused entirely on collaborating robots puzzling their way through a maze of cognitive tests. Exploring these worlds together allows you to form common memories with your friends. But any changes to these environments or the underlying plots have to be made by human designers and developers. In the real world, changes happen naturally, without supervision, design or manual intervention. Players learn, and living things adapt. Some organisms even co-evolve, reacting to each other’s developments. (A similar phenomenon happens in a weapons technology arms race.) Computer games today lack that level of sophistication. And for that reason, I don’t believe developing an artificial intelligence that can play modern games will meaningfully advance AI research. A game worth playing is a game that is unpredictable because it adapts, a game that is ever novel because novelty is created by playing the game. Future games need to evolve. Their characters shouldn’t just react; they need to explore and learn to exploit weaknesses or cooperate and collaborate. Darwinian evolution and learning, we understand, are the drivers of all novelty on Earth. It could be what drives change in virtual environments as well. Evolution figured out how to create natural intelligence. Shouldn’t we, instead of trying to code our way to AI, just evolve AI instead? Several labs – including my own and that of my colleague Christoph Adami – are working on what is called “neuro-evolution.” In a computer, we simulate complex environments, like a road network or a biological ecosystem. We create virtual creatures and challenge them to evolve over hundreds of thousands of simulated generations. Evolution itself then develops the best drivers, or the best organisms at adapting to the conditions – those are the ones that survive. Today’s AlphaGo is beginning this process, learning by continuously playing games against itself, and by analyzing records of games played by top Go champions. But it does not learn while playing in the same way we do, experiencing unsupervised experimentation. And it doesn’t adapt to a particular opponent: For these computer players, the best move is the best move, regardless of an opponent’s style. Programs that learn from experience are the next step in AI. They would make computer games much more interesting, and enable robots to not only function better in the real world, but to adapt to it on the fly.

Tired of Twitter? Fed up with Facebook? This is a great time to completely eradicate yourself from social media. All of these online services let you scrub out your accounts if you want a cleaner, leaner life online. Even better, plenty of them let you export your data for safekeeping before you do. So you can always remember that time The Rock answered your desperate tweets or your roommate plastered your Facebook wall with photos of your dog. Here's how you can delete, and back up, accounts from most major social media services. Facebook Image: Screenshot Remember when Facebook was fun? It was around 2008. In any case, if you've had enough of advertisements and badly thought-out politics, you don't have to stick around — the option to sort-of delete your Facebook can be found on the settings page on the web. Click Security, then Edit next to Deactivate your account, then click the link that appears. That deactivates your account — it's not actually gone and you can jump back in to the social maelstrom at any time. If you do want to get rid of your account permanently, with no chance of coming back, then you actually need to head to this page and click Delete my account. You get a short grace period during which you can change your mind, then everything is scheduled to be wiped within 90 days. Facebook makes it very easy to get a copy of all your social networking activity before you go though. Head to the online settings page, then click General and Download a copy of your Facebook data (a password prompt appears to make sure you really are who you say you are). You get posts, photos, chat conversations and more, all in a handy HTML format you can view in your browser. Google Image: Screenshot Goodbye Google! If you've decided the time is right to sever all connections with Mountain View, you need to go to your account page on the web then click Delete your account or services. The next option lets you delete some parts of your Google account separately — like your Gmail or YouTube accounts — or get rid of everything at once. As you might expect, you need to enter your password along the way. If you choose to delete everything, you'll be given a list of all the stuff that's going to be wiped — from images in Google Photos to playlists in Google Play Music — and you can then click Delete account to confirm your choice. On each of these screens, you'll also see a link to download your data. Those data dump tools can also be accessed from the main account page by clicking Personal info & privacy then scrolling down to Download your data and selecting Create archive. The next screen lets you select which bits of data you want saving (Google Calendar appointments? Blogger posts?) and you can then choose a file archive type and delivery method (it can even be saved straight to your Google Drive if you decide to keep that one bit of Google). Twitter Image: Screenshot If you've had just about as much of Twitter as you can take, quitting the service is fairly straightforward. To get your data out before you get out, go to Twitter settings in your web browser, click Account and then Request your archive. When it's ready to download, you'll get an email alert — all your tweets are saved in a nicely formatted HTML archive so you can relive the good tweeting times. Still keen on leaving? Click Deactivate my account then confirm your choice on the next screen — this actually means delete, not just deactivate, but you do get a grace period of 30 days during which you can log back into your account and carry on as normal. If you're part of Twitter royalty and verified, you get 12 whole months to change your mind. Instagram Image: Screenshot To delete Instagram you need to head this page. Tell Instagram why you're going ("it's not you, it's me" maybe), enter your password, then click Permanently delete my account. If that's too much, you can temporarily disable your account by opening up your profile settings from the web then clicking Temporarily disable my account. There's no time limit to this, so you can pick up again whenever you like. As for getting your photos and videos out of Instagram, there's no easy, integrated "export all" option you can make use of. You either need to have been saving your Instagrams to your phone all along (it's the Save Original Photos switch in settings) or trust your account data to a third-party service like Instaport. Snapchat Image: Screenshot By its very nature, Snapchat doesn't leave much of a digital trail, though the app has become more inclined towards permanence in recent years. You can save your photos and videos to your phone (via Memories in the app settings), but you need to do this in advance — you can't bring your old snaps back. The option to delete your account isn't actually available in the app, so you need to head to accounts.snapchat.com in a web browser, log in, and then click Delete my account. Snapchat will check that you really, really want to go, and then you're done. If you change your mind, you've got 30 days to reactivate it. Yahoo Image: Screenshot If Yahoo's woes have convinced you that enough is enough as far as the once-great internet service goes, then you need to log into your account inside a web browser and then visit this special page — you'll be warned about the consequences of deleting your account (which... er... deletes all your data), then you need to click Terminate this Account to confirm. Unfortunately there's no quick and easy way to get all of your data out of Yahoo, but we're talking primarily emails here, which can be accessed via IMAP. If you plug the Yahoo Mail settings into your email client of choice, whether Gmail or Outlook, you can get all of your messages moved out and saved before pulling the plug on Yahoo.

Nothing quite beats seeing nothing but guitars, metal bands, The Rock, Schwarzenegger, and the lives of people I actually give a damn about, rather than the 650 odd people I was "Friends" with on Crackbook... Reply 0 TUALMASOK Guest Mar 7, 2017, 2:20pm You know you can remove those "friends", and even reduce the amount of content you see from you remaining "friends"? I went through a massive cull a few years back and stuck to the rules that I wanted less that 100 friends who had to be people that I actually interact with IRL, or whose input I actually value. It's great! No more clutter, and even when there is (mass posting sisters, fml) I just choose the option to not have their shite posted on my wall. I can go weeks without an annoying notification or message, and friend requests died down after people realised I didn't want to see them on my social media. Reply 0 ManualFunky @rickmyrundies Mar 8, 2017, 12:44am I know that, it was just easier to cull everyone, rather than sift through all the crap.

Yep, I did this when I began hosting my own email instead; 1. Via Thunderbird, I recreated the folder structure 2. cut/pasted all correspondences 3. activated forwarder and delete on source, and 4. nuked the Yahoo account, sorted. Cunningly and covertly, Yahoo have disabled forwarding in light of the bad publicity/hacking scandals, creating a mass exodus of users. Reply 0 Join the discussion!

In late May, AlphaGo will take on Ke Jie, the best player in the world, among other opponents at the Future of Go Summit in Wuzhen, China. With increasing computing power, and improved engineering, computers can beat humans even at games we thought relied on human intuition, wit, deception or bluffing – like poker. I recently saw a video in which volleyball players practice their serves and spikes against robot-controlled rubber arms trying to block the shots. One lesson is clear: When machines play to win, human effort is futile. Robots play volleyball. This can be great: We want a perfect AI to drive our cars, and a tireless system looking for signs of cancer in X-rays. But when it comes to play, we don’t want to lose. Fortunately, AI can make games more fun, and perhaps even endlessly enjoyable. Designing games that never get old Today’s game designers – who write releases that earn more than a blockbuster movie – see a problem: Creating an unbeatable artificial intelligence system is pointless. Nobody wants to play a game they have no chance of winning. But people do want to play games that are immersive, complex and surprising. Even today’s best games become stale after a person plays for a while. The ideal game will engage players by adapting and reacting in ways that keep the game interesting, maybe forever. So when we’re designing artificial intelligence systems, we should look not to the triumphant Deep Blues and AlphaGos of the world, but rather to the overwhelming success of massively multiplayer online games like “World of Warcraft.” These sorts of games are graphically well-designed, but their key attraction is interaction. It seems as if most people are not drawn to extremely difficult logical puzzles like chess and Go, but rather to meaningful connections and communities. The real challenge with these massively multi-player online games is not whether they can be beaten by intelligence (human or artificial), but rather how to keep the experience of playing them fresh and new every time. Change by design At present, game environments allow people lots of possible interactions with other players. The roles in a dungeon raiding party are well-defined: Fighters take the damage, healers help them recover from their injuries and the fragile wizards cast spells from afar. Or think of “Portal 2,” a game focused entirely on collaborating robots puzzling their way through a maze of cognitive tests. Exploring these worlds together allows you to form common memories with your friends. But any changes to these environments or the underlying plots have to be made by human designers and developers. In the real world, changes happen naturally, without supervision, design or manual intervention. Players learn, and living things adapt. Some organisms even co-evolve, reacting to each other’s developments. (A similar phenomenon happens in a weapons technology arms race.) Computer games today lack that level of sophistication. And for that reason, I don’t believe developing an artificial intelligence that can play modern games will meaningfully advance AI research. We crave evolution A game worth playing is a game that is unpredictable because it adapts, a game that is ever novel because novelty is created by playing the game. Future games need to evolve. Their characters shouldn’t just react; they need to explore and learn to exploit weaknesses or cooperate and collaborate. Darwinian evolution and learning, we understand, are the drivers of all novelty on Earth. It could be what drives change in virtual environments as well. Evolution figured out how to create natural intelligence. Shouldn’t we, instead of trying to code our way to AI, just evolve AI instead? Several labs – including my own and that of my colleague Christoph Adami – are working on what is called “neuro-evolution.” In a computer, we simulate complex environments, like a road network or a biological ecosystem. We create virtual creatures and challenge them to evolve over hundreds of thousands of simulated generations. Evolution itself then develops the best drivers, or the best organisms at adapting to the conditions – those are the ones that survive. A neuro-evolution learns to drive a car. Today’s AlphaGo is beginning this process, learning by continuously playing games against itself, and by analyzing records of games played by top Go champions. But it does not learn while playing in the same way we do, experiencing unsupervised experimentation. And it doesn’t adapt to a particular opponent: For these computer players, the best move is the best move, regardless of an opponent’s style. Programs that learn from experience are the next step in AI. They would make computer games much more interesting, and enable robots to not only function better in the real world, but to adapt to it on the fly.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Camarada lets you capture 3D videos with multiple smartphones By Rei Padla - May 10, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Ever since Google launched the Android Experiments program in 2015, we’ve seen and tried a number of creative mobile apps like that one that turns a phone into a 3D controller for VR and the Paper Planes app. Last year, Google opened the Android Experiments I/O Challenge with the winners being named during the I/O conference. One of the newest app that has already hit Google Play Store is Camarada. Listed as ‘Camarada 3D Camera, VR Camera’ on the Play Store, this one is more than just another camera app. The idea is that it links with another phones in the surrounding area so you can form camera arrays to record any event or the environment to come up with VR videos. With this app, you won’t need a separate gadget, action camera, or a specialized 360-degree shooter because you can capture and make your own virtual reality video just by using regular smartphones. You can easily record and share 3D videos with your friends. Of course, you can also record 2D videos and then render them in VR in Single-User mode. For two smartphones, the app can link devices automatically to record stereoscopic 3D videos in Dual-Phone mode. Camarada is also said to be the first mobile app in the world that can handle 3D or 360-degree videos with the Multi-Phone mode.

Microsoft’s device is called Invoke, and it uses the company’s Cortana voice interface coupled with Harman Kardon speakers. Invoke copies the form factor Amazon introduced with the Echo, and Google copied with Home. It’s a cylinder with speakers and microphones packed inside that looks surprisingly similar to the Echo, but also like a knock off. Microsoft and Harman Kardon team up for Invoke voice assistant You can stream music, perform Bing searches, control smart home devices, plus send and receive Skype calls. That last feature may turn out to be Invoke’s best selling point because it’s the only voice assistant on the market offering Skype support. Skype support is an interesting feature, especially since Amazon just launched Alexa Calling for its Echo lineup and Alexa smartphone app. Alexa Calling lets users make and receive calls through their Echo or Alexa app, but only with other people who have bought into the Echo ecosystem. Invoke comes as the in-home voice assistant market is heating up. Amazon’s Echo and Echo Dot are already on the market, Echo Look was just released, and Echo Show is coming next Month. Google Home is on the market now, and Apple is reportedly ready to unveil its Siri-based competitor at Worldwide Developer Conference in June. Echo Show includes a built-in display and video camera, and Apple’s Siri device may do the same. That seems fairly likely considering Phil Schiller commented recently on how these devices need a display to be truly useful. Amazon’s Echo costs US$149.99, and Google Home is priced at $114, so Microsoft—or more accurately, Harman Kardon, since that’s the name on the device—will likely shoot for the same range. You can’t, however, pick one up until this fall because that’s when it ships. Invoke has a “me, too” feel, which makes sense. Microsoft has a history of seeing where a market is heading and jumping in with its own product. Sometimes that works out, like with the Xbox, and sometimes not so much, like with the Zune. Amazon already has a strong head start in the voice assistant market, Google Home is is on store shelves, and Apple’s Siri device gaining interest even without an official announcements. That’s a tough crowd to compete with, but that isn’t stopping Microsoft from trying. The big question now is whether Microsoft has another Xbox on its hands, or the next Zune.

[Minority Report] Google and Coca-Cola may target personalized ads at you - in real life Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/10 11:27am PDTMay 10, 2017 20 Plus 1 on G+ 38 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares102 News Videos Google and Coca-Cola's partnership effort for in-store advertising displays looks to be bearing fruit. The advertising system uses DoubleClick's preference and tracking data combined with Google's Beacon Platform to serve up targeted ads by pulling data from passing smartphones. With that info, displays are able to select content based on your preferences in the form of advertisements specifically targeted to passersby. In a recent grocery store pilot program the Minority Report-style ads performed quite very well. This isn't actually that new. It was discussed at a few places in the last couple months since the details were revealed at Google's conference. But, it seems to have quite effectively flown under the radar for that time, considering how cool it is. Coca-Cola made a detailed post about it on one of their social promotion sites in April as well, in which they talked about the potential environments for these tracking signage systems, like movie theaters and other Retail venues than just grocery stores. Google's partnership with Coca-Cola for this system has been discussed off-and-on for a few years. Back at the National Automatic Merchandising Association's OneShow in 2016 Google talked about the potential as applied to vending machines, and said that Google and Coca-Cola were working together on Bluetooth beacons for vending, but this is the first time I've actually gotten to see what it looks like and how it performs. Coca-Cola's Greg Chambers, at Google's recent Cloud Next Conference, said that it has been experimenting with small tests into proximity marketing since at least 2015 when they first started working with Google on a prototype. The two companies tested things with a pilot for the system in 250 Albertson's grocery stores, in which Coca-Cola saw some incredible results. There was a one year ROI on Coca-Cola products displayed by the system, and a spillover effect from so-called "category-lift," in the form of a total one-month ROI for all nearby soda products — i.e., this system sells a lot of soda for Coca-Cola and all other brands near it. There's no word yet on when or how Coca-Cola might roll this out to other stores, but given how positive the results were for the pilot tests, it is likely you'll see one someday at the end of the soda aisle in your local grocery. On a more technical note, I'm not sure exactly what sort of data is being sent to the displays by nearby phones or how it is taken. Allegedly the system uses Google's Eddystone beacons, which exchange information with nearby phones using Bluetooth low energy. This is the first time I've heard of Google's Beacon Platform actually being used, combined with DoubleClick's targeting advertising systems, to target people in the physical world. The privacy-conscious might express some concern at the potential of having your phone communicate your preferences to an in-store display, but I would hope and assume that any identifying information is stripped out. Either way, we're one step closer to this. Source: Digital Strategy Consulting Tags beacon platform beacons bluetooth low energy Coca-Cola Eddystone Targeted advertisements video subscribe ...

Anu6is Stop being absurd, how else would you know what you NEED? WesleySmalls Actually, you do. People require social interaction, it's a very strong part of our being. Humans generally don't like to be alone, and very much can't over longer periods of time. Because of this, people tend to follow each other's example in one way or another, advertising is just one of the many examples Ben Yeah, your phone communicating with a vending machine to give you personalised advertisements is not in any way 'social interaction'. WesleySmalls I did not say anything about that, it wasn't even remotely close, nor was the post I commented on. But of course, else you had to actually comment on my actual post, and realize that it's true that people follow other people Prezes Dyrektor But you are making it sound like advertising is indispensable in our lives. Well guess what, ads is the reason why I cut cable tv, they don't have those fancy adblockers. Ads is the reason I mostly listen to local academic radio without any. Etc. Ads and marketing are evil, and we are being manipulated every day. Now excuse me as I run to grab some sugar soda and candy. Ryne Hager https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JKlSVNxLB-A Avishek GSkynet: Resistance is Futile https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/eceea630e7e43621ded725c3914bdc7a06d9b153943c3512fb6b0f0eeff75d71.png Bryan Does it just give a different Coke commercial based on my tastes? Or are people going to start getting ads for the sex toys they have in their amazon cart? Bane✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ There's one way to find out. Add some (more) sex toys to your Amazon cart and then go grocery shopping! Ryne Hager I actually haven't seen one in my area yet, when I go out west in a month I'll see if I can drop by an Albertson's. Carlos Rodríguez So, you have sex toys in your cart, right? Ryne Hager Obviously not enough sex toys, if you're questioning that. Carlos Rodríguez “( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)” yochanan Albertson's are now all Safeway's, FYI. Ryne Hager Albertson's acquired Safeway back in 2015, indeed. yochanan Right, but it wasn't until fairly recently (at least in Northern CO) that Albertsons stores have been converted into Safeway's. Bane✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, I'm a blank slate to advertising. I might as well be a ghost. I block all ads, turn off all targeted options everywhere, and never click on any. I guess I'll have to turn off Bluetooth when I'm in stores now too. Fadakar lol if you think your record is clean you need to re-evaluate how seriously you want to take privacy. James F This. People underestimate how much of a digital footprint they leave, even if they do turn off everything. EowynCarter True. And if they are, they wouldn't show me ads for coca cola, I just don't like that. And sodas in general. Cakefish Agreed, if I have to endure advertising it might as well be about products that actually interest me. Bewear I am a fan of your picture edits, Ryne. Ryne Hager What a coincidence, I am also a fan of your work. I kept a Bewear in my party for most of Moon. Anu6is lol! Lord Argyris My party was boring. Two of them were from Gen I, and apart from my starter, only one other member was from Gen VII. Now really, Nintendo should get in on this whole Coke-Google partnership thing. Maybe put something in their 3DS games that ties into this advertising platform. "Oh, so you're raising a bunch of Fire-type Pokemon. I'll bet you're feeling pretty hot right about now. Know what would cool you right down? A nice, ice cold COKE." Ryne Hager I mean, with the launch event Munchlax and Munchlax/Snorlax available on the first island, who in their right mind didn't take a Gen I Snorlax to end game. Michael Oghia I came here just to give you a +1 for Hypno Toad. Steve Actually noticed this happening to me recently when near the vending machine at my job. Guessing the capabilities will be endless and more diverse when full-on set-ups are placed everywhere. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7ea9fde9939850ddee856f08d34c3e8a98a6c90461c779f049060ec4e655b8c6.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f87dc3afe5a1492c33e179552b9fcf3259d388ef4a1a6cfed7951d9612faeae6.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/da689e538e0681368f0ef1dac408a796aa111781564a9ded426c4639fbeab351.jpg F4LL0U7 Disabling Nearby will disable invasive ads, you say? Done! Morten Ulv Google usually have a way to opt out. james fuston https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPGgTy5YJ-g Ben Nothing better than a new way to sell people tooth-rotting, diabetes-causing sugar water. Nicholas Conrad *This* is the gateway to AR! Aing actual R; genius! abqnm Are these connected to the "Nearby" activity in Google Settings? (Which also interestingly enough at some point has earned the ability to add the Nearby activity directly to the homescreen. Don't know when it appeared as I don't open that screen often, but it's now an option in the overflow menu.) James F Beacons typically use Bluetooth. abqnm Yes, and Google's Nearby uses Bluetooth LE scanning and Play Services location. But with Google being a part of it, I'm asking if it is directly related to the Nearby function. I am not asking for how beacons typically work. MJ Double checked BT is off on my phone... The only time ever use it is when play music on a BT speaker which I don't do when grocery shopping. "With that info, displays are able to select content based on your preferences in the form of advertisements specifically targeted to passersby" How does these ads work exactly? I am not watching a 54min video. Dedren You don't need bluetooth on per say. It just uses that tech. I believe you will have to enable Nearby places, which is disabled by default but will probably be enabled by default in the future. MJ Nearby places will not be going on... F4LL0U7 I'm not sure they could develop an ad that's targeted enough to get me to buy Coke. F4LL0U7 I guess I might consider it if the vending machine held a family member hostage or something. James F I don't know if I should be concerned that you said *might* consider it.... F4LL0U7 What can I say, I'm just not very receptive to ads. Dedren What about Water, Sprite, SimplyOrange, Powerade, Minute Maid? Surely one of those you drink...all Coke. F4LL0U7 I mean, of course I drink water, but I get it from the filtered pitcher in my fridge. No to the others. Adrian quickest way to turn me off on a product. Bluetooth is only on in my car anyway so good luck with it. As soon as someone figures out how to spoof it and annoy people in public, it will go away. Max Johnson I thought it's been NFC and GPS all this time. At least from my Android Pay app. blindexecutioner I would literally break my phone if I got an ad as I walked by a pop machine (or whatever) if I couldn't opt out of it of course.. I would switch to iOS that day. If it happened on iOS I would stop using smart phones altogether. tehboogieman You could just turn off bluetooth. Or you know, there's your way rndusrnm479461 iOS also supports this same thing. rndusrnm479461 I've read the whole article and even watched some of that video and I still don't get it - what do your "preferences" affect in the ads? How will it affect what the ad displays? Does it just play the ad you're more likely to prefer from 5 different ads? I'm confused... Why is such system necessary for something simple like coke? Would make more sense for a bus stop ad or other kinds of billboards.

Name: Subject: Message: Google’s new search widget promises to crank the speed up to 11 Newsby Jimmy Westenberg7 hours ago 3 114 34 If you are not familiar with Chrome Dev, it allows Google to play around with experimental Chrome features before making their debut in the stable Chrome app. Appropriately, this is where Google seems to be testing out a revamped search widget that looks to be significantly faster than the current version. If you want to give the widget a trial run, you will first need to download Chrome Dev from the Play Store. After doing so, go to your home screen to access your widgets, find Chrome Dev, and drag the widget to wherever you want. Aesthetically, you will notice how the widget now says “Search with Google” instead of just the Google logo on the left. See also: Chrome Dev is testing video casting improvements to Chromecast 2 weeks ago When you tap on the widget, it instantly launches a search in Chrome Dev, with the keyboard and auto-suggestions also immediately pulled up. This is a small, but welcome, change, since it speeds up the process of searching ever so slightly more than before. Even if it is a small change, it shows that search is still the heartbeat of Google’s business. This is why Google also spruced up its search app and mobile website to find events easier: Google wants you to search as painlessly and quickly as possible while making the process look halfway decent. The new search widget is still in its experimental stage, which is why it is limited to Chrome Dev version 60 for now. It will trickle down to the standard version of Chrome for those who do not want their mobile browser breaking on them, but it might take some time for it to do so.

India obsessions our picks latest popular like us on facebook follow us on twitter about us Atlas quartz index quartz app quartz quartz India quartz Africa Change your edition back to menu FISH OUT OF WATER Good luck with finding American engineers for the drudgery at companies like Infosys and Cognizant Written by Ananya Bhattacharya Obsession Borders 7 hours ago Quartz india Looking for locals. (AP Photo/Aijaz Rahi) Share Written by Ananya Bhattacharya Obsession Borders 7 hours ago Quartz india As the American dream sours for foreign workers, tech companies have their eyes peeled for local talent. Immigrant workers have long flocked to US tech companies, with nearly two-thirds of the H-1B visas in 2014 allocated to those in computer-related occupations. While IBM, Google, Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft are among the top contenders for the 85,000 new visas each year, the biggest beneficiaries of H-1Bs have traditionally been the Indian IT bigwigs like Infosys and Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) or American multinationals like Cognizant that outsource the majority of their jobs to India. Even before president Donald Trump signed an executive order to kickstart the much-discussed H-1B revamp on April 18, Indian IT firms were cutting back on visas requests by opening offshore and nearshore centers, automating parts of their business, and working remotely. Bengaluru-based Infosys said it would add 10,000 jobs in the US over the next two to four years. Cognizant, with most of its operations in Chennai, is said to be handing its Indian employees pink slips while it ups its US headcount. Last year, it hired 4,000 US citizens and residents. Azim Premji-led software giant Wipro expects to have half of its workforce comprise of US locals by June. Rival TCS reportedly has hiring programs in place at engineering campuses and the top-10 US business schools. While these companies may want to trade their Indian employees for those on American soil, a straight swap isn’t easy. They’re competing with Google and Facebook as well as startups like Uber and Airbnb. Moreover, American tech workers are fewer in number, are generally not as highly skilled, and cost more than their Indian counterparts. In 2015, there were nearly 10 times more US computing jobs open than there were students equipped with computer science degrees. Finding talent “There’s still a gap out there,” when it comes to skills, said Steve Ostrowski, director of corporate communications at non-profit IT trade association CompTIA. “Hundreds of thousands of jobs–core IT jobs—are advertised for and not filled.” Ostrowski says the problem is exacerbated by how rigid companies are in their hiring practices. Many won’t invest in the training necessary to make a hire viable. “Maybe you’ve found someone fitting the bill 80 to 90%, and can’t quite close the remaining 10%. What would be wrong in hiring such persons and skilling them up?” In the US, over 60% of the employers offer some form of undergraduate tuition reimbursement, according to a 2016 report by jobs site Indeed. However, subsidizing the education cost is only useful if students graduate with skills that serve the market’s needs. “For generations, high skill professions have relied on years of undergraduate and graduate education to qualify large swaths of their workforce,” the Indeed report says. “That model may not suit the reality of the labor market today and into the future.” To help close this gap, Infosys, which gets 62% of its revenue from North America, has trained 2,500 teachers and over 135,000 students through its Infosys Foundation. The foundation is also funding the training of over 1,000 public school teachers in computer science this summer. This may not be enough to provide the Indian IT firms with the talent they need. Many potential hires just don’t want to work for them. Dull work “If you were to sample 15 engineers and give them the option of working at an outsourcing company,” or a product-first tech company like, say, Apple, they will take the latter, says Harj Taggar, founder of tech recruitment portal Triplebyte. “The interest of doing the work is so much higher when you’re working for the product-first company.” At traditional software companies like Wipro and TCS, people are often left “building cookie cutter software for big companies,” he says. Companies could consider looking for talent outside of the saturated Bay Area and tap into tech hubs like Seattle, Austin, and Boston, or create their own elsewhere in the US. For instance, Snap has single-handedly been able to almost monopolize the top tech talent in its home base of Los Angeles because of its product-driven business model. However, that sort of lure doesn’t exist for Indian IT companies as their business models don’t inspire ingenuity. Not only is the job role dull, Tagger says, people’s careers can also stagnate at these conveyor belt-like services firms. “If they can offer individuals a chance to see solid career path (where they are) promoted after ‘X’ amount of time and (they) won’t be pigeonholed, they can find workers that fit the bill,” he says. Balancing bucks Money is also an obstacle. “When firms say they can’t find any workers, what they really mean is they can’t find any workers at the price they are willing to pay,” says John Horton, the assistant professor of information, operations and management sciences at New York University’s Stern School of Business. “Maybe you can get to the point where you can’t get anyone, no matter the price. But people can move. So even in those cases, it’s not really an insurmountable gap, so much as an unwillingness to pay enough to induce people to move.” Workers participating in the H-1B program have to earn at least $60,000 and most Indian tech firms hire at the rate, but “that’s way, way under market rate, particularly in the Bay Area,” Taggar says. The average tech sector wage in 2016 was $108,900 in 2016, according to the Cyberstates 2017 report (pdf). Consequently, if H-1B dependent employers hire outside the program they should anticipate a spike in costs and a drop on profits. Especially because, unlike H-1B workers whose visa status is tied to their employer, American nationals are free to move as and when they wish. Considering upwards of 60% of the revenues for India’s $150 billion IT sector come from North America, bringing local talent onboard is likely a strategy for Indian companies. Whether it’s sustainable is another question. “The political signal it sends is a good one. ‘We’re not here to steal all your jobs, we’re here to help Americans get skills they need’,” says Tagger. “But fundamentally, it is very hard to believe. Companies ultimately have to care about bottom lines.” Most Popular Simple math is why Elon Musk’s companies keep doing what others don’t even consider possible Read full story home our picks popular latest obsessions search
Features Reviews Phones Android iPhone Windows Phone Apps Computers Laptops Lenovo Tablets Windows Tutorials Events More Audio Crowfunding Design/Concepts Gadgets Gaming General Photo/Video Web Ubergizmo in French Ubergizmo in German Ubergizmo in Italian Ubergizmo in Spanish Google Search On Mobile Adds ‘Events’ Section By Tyler Lee on 05/10/2017 16:52 PDT Have you ever wanted to find out what kind of events are around you or in a city that you’re about to visit? Sure, there are social media platforms such as Facebook that can list events, but it seems that Google wants in on the action as well. The company has recently updated its Google Search on mobile to add an Events section during your search. According to Google, “Today on the Google app and mobile web in the U.S., doing a search for events brings up a clear summary of activities from sites from across the web like Eventbrite, Meetup and more, that might be just what you’re looking for. To try it, type in a quick search like, “jazz concerts in Austin,” or “art events this weekend” on your phone. With a single tap, you’ll see at-a-glance details about various options, like the event title, date and time, and location.” Users will be able to sort and filter the events based on different time periods, such as searching for events taking place today, tomorrow, or even next week. This will allow users to plan ahead for when they are about to visit a new city or country and are looking for something to do when they get there. It sounds like a nifty feature and if you’re an event planner who is trying to get their events listed on Google, you can check out these guidelines on how to go about doing so. Filed in Cellphones.

The collective of German publishers had sued Google, arguing that the tech giant has infringed on copyright protections by offering snippets of the publishers' articles in search results. Those snippets, according to VG Media, hurt the publishers' bottom line by sating potential readers' curiosity and violated a 2013 German law that requires compensation for those snippets of text. Yet on Tuesday a Berlin court raised some concerns with the law itself often known in English as the Ancillary Copyright for Press Publishers. The judge questioned whether Germany had properly notified the European Commission — the executive arm of the European Union — before enacting the regulation, suspending the case until the Court of Justice of the European Union could weigh in on whether the law is even valid. The issue hinges on an EU directive that requires member countries such as Germany to alert the organization about "any draft technical regulation prior to its adoption." Handelsblatt Global, a German business publication, explains why Germany decided not to notify the EU about the draft of this law: "While typically a formality, notification reviews of national laws by Brussels can take up to two years or more. In 2013, Germany did not submit the copyright law for notification, citing a Justice Ministry argument that the law's scope was so limited, it didn't fall under the E.U.'s notification requirement." The court proved skeptical about this reasoning, though its ruling did note that the publishers complaint is at least partially justified — without offering further explanation on this point. At any rate, Google applauded the decision, saying that it demonstrated the failings of the law. "Today's decision in Berlin highlights that there are still many contradictions and unanswered questions in the law of ancillary copyright for publishers," Google said in a statement quoted by PCWorld. "We've said many times that we don't want to fight legal battles with publishers," the statement continues. "We'd much rather work with them to drive traffic to their websites and apps, promote their brands, and support online journalism — and that's what we'll continue to do." Nieman Lab reported in 2014 that the law has had something of a rocky life in practice: "The law went into effect last August and, while some details still need to be ironed out in court, the controversial heart of it — whether search engines will pay money to publishers — has an uncertain future. Google has refused to pay fees to publish snippets from news sites, and instead asked German publishers last year to opt in if they want to be included in Google News search results, waiving their right to cash in on the use of their content according to the new law. To avoid paying the collection agency, VG Media, which represents the publishers that chose not to opt in, Google stopped showing snippets from their news articles on Oct. 23 [2014]. Shortly after that, the publishers in VG Media gave Google a license to restore snippets to their search results — for free. Berlin-based Axel Springer, one of Europe's largest publishers, announced on Nov. 5 [2014] that it had caved to Google's pressure after traffic to its websites from Google dropped by 40 percent and from Google News by 80 percent when snippets were left out of search results." If the law should be invalidated, a prospect that now looms over the case as it heads to the European court, the decision would not only represent a blow to the publishers who brought the case in the first place. It might also raise doubts about a proposed EU-wide directive that has some similar stipulations to the German copyright rule. Copyright 2017 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/.

News sign-up UK brands still harbour YouTube safety concerns News, 11 May 2017 Topics Brand safety LONDON: While some brands have resumed ads on video-sharing platform YouTube, a number of large UK brands remain unconvinced by the site, and parent company Google's assurances. Brands such as McDonald's and RBS have resumed buying ad space on Youtube, Marketing Week reports, but the majority are waiting for better guarantees before returning to the platform. "We are not going back [to Google or YouTube] until they have basically confirmed and solidified the guarantees and protection that are required not just for our brand but many others too," said Patrick Bousquet-Chavanne, executive director for marketing at M&S. The UK retail veteran noted the "sensitivity in the marketing community" surrounding The Times' investigation. Whilst he acknowledged the search giant's progress, he nevertheless felt that "they are not quite there yet." Similarly, Channel 4 marketing boss, Dan Brooke remains "extremely concerned" about the placement of the broadcaster's ads alongside "highly offensive material" on YouTube. "We have yet to receive adequate enough assurances from Google that it is a safe environment and until that time we will continue to take advantage of other platforms for our advertising," he added. Last month, Google announced that, amongst other measures, it was hiring the cross-platform measurement firm comScore to improve the independent brand safety of ads. The company has also imposed stricter rules on where ads appear, such as on videos with fewer than 10,000 views. David Wheldon, CMO at RBS, and president of the WFA, notes that Google "has responded well" to concerns over brand safety. Despite the return of RBS ads to the platform, the bank recognises that this is a "global advertising issue" and that Google must "be more cautious around where our brand goes." In addition to RBS' resumption of advertising on YouTube, QSR titan McDonald's confirmed that it had also returned "after assurances had been made." However, Wheldon observes that many colleagues are not entirely confident about YouTube's ability to fix the problem: an issue, he says, that will linger "until this digital duplicity stops."

[Minority Report] Google and Coca-Cola may target personalized ads at you - in real life Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/10 11:27am PDTMay 10, 2017 20 Plus 1 on G+ 38 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares102 News Videos Google and Coca-Cola's partnership effort for in-store advertising displays looks to be bearing fruit. The advertising system uses DoubleClick's preference and tracking data combined with Google's Beacon Platform to serve up targeted ads by pulling data from passing smartphones. With that info, displays are able to select content based on your preferences in the form of advertisements specifically targeted to passersby. In a recent grocery store pilot program the Minority Report-style ads performed quite very well. This isn't actually that new. It was discussed at a few places in the last couple months since the details were revealed at Google's conference. But, it seems to have quite effectively flown under the radar for that time, considering how cool it is. Coca-Cola made a detailed post about it on one of their social promotion sites in April as well, in which they talked about the potential environments for these tracking signage systems, like movie theaters and other Retail venues than just grocery stores. Google's partnership with Coca-Cola for this system has been discussed off-and-on for a few years. Back at the National Automatic Merchandising Association's OneShow in 2016 Google talked about the potential as applied to vending machines, and said that Google and Coca-Cola were working together on Bluetooth beacons for vending, but this is the first time I've actually gotten to see what it looks like and how it performs. Coca-Cola's Greg Chambers, at Google's recent Cloud Next Conference, said that it has been experimenting with small tests into proximity marketing since at least 2015 when they first started working with Google on a prototype. The two companies tested things with a pilot for the system in 250 Albertson's grocery stores, in which Coca-Cola saw some incredible results. There was a one year ROI on Coca-Cola products displayed by the system, and a spillover effect from so-called "category-lift," in the form of a total one-month ROI for all nearby soda products — i.e., this system sells a lot of soda for Coca-Cola and all other brands near it. There's no word yet on when or how Coca-Cola might roll this out to other stores, but given how positive the results were for the pilot tests, it is likely you'll see one someday at the end of the soda aisle in your local grocery. On a more technical note, I'm not sure exactly what sort of data is being sent to the displays by nearby phones or how it is taken. Allegedly the system uses Google's Eddystone beacons, which exchange information with nearby phones using Bluetooth low energy. This is the first time I've heard of Google's Beacon Platform actually being used, combined with DoubleClick's targeting advertising systems, to target people in the physical world. The privacy-conscious might express some concern at the potential of having your phone communicate your preferences to an in-store display, but I would hope and assume that any identifying information is stripped out. Either way, we're one step closer to this. Source: Digital Strategy Consulting Tags beacon platform beacons bluetooth low energy Coca-Cola Eddystone Targeted advertisements video subscribe ...

Anu6is Stop being absurd, how else would you know what you NEED? WesleySmalls Actually, you do. People require social interaction, it's a very strong part of our being. Humans generally don't like to be alone, and very much can't over longer periods of time. Because of this, people tend to follow each other's example in one way or another, advertising is just one of the many examples Ben Yeah, your phone communicating with a vending machine to give you personalised advertisements is not in any way 'social interaction'. WesleySmalls I did not say anything about that, it wasn't even remotely close, nor was the post I commented on. But of course, else you had to actually comment on my actual post, and realize that it's true that people follow other people Prezes Dyrektor But you are making it sound like advertising is indispensable in our lives. Well guess what, ads is the reason why I cut cable tv, they don't have those fancy adblockers. Ads is the reason I mostly listen to local academic radio without any. Etc. Ads and marketing are evil, and we are being manipulated every day. Now excuse me as I run to grab some sugar soda and candy.

Or are people going to start getting ads for the sex toys they have in their amazon cart? Bane✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ There's one way to find out. Add some (more) sex toys to your Amazon cart and then go grocery shopping! Ryne Hager I actually haven't seen one in my area yet, when I go out west in a month I'll see if I can drop by an Albertson's. Carlos Rodríguez So, you have sex toys in your cart, right? Ryne Hager Obviously not enough sex toys, if you're questioning that. Carlos Rodríguez “( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)” yochanan Albertson's are now all Safeway's, FYI. Ryne Hager Albertson's acquired Safeway back in 2015, indeed. yochanan Right, but it wasn't until fairly recently (at least in Northern CO) that Albertsons stores have been converted into Safeway's. Bane✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, I'm a blank slate to advertising. I might as well be a ghost. I block all ads, turn off all targeted options everywhere, and never click on any. I guess I'll have to turn off Bluetooth when I'm in stores now too. Fadakar lol if you think your record is clean you need to re-evaluate how seriously you want to take privacy. James F This. People underestimate how much of a digital footprint they leave, even if they do turn off everything. EowynCarter True. And if they are, they wouldn't show me ads for coca cola, I just don't like that. And sodas in general. Cakefish Agreed, if I have to endure advertising it might as well be about products that actually interest me. Bewear I am a fan of your picture edits, Ryne. Ryne Hager What a coincidence, I am also a fan of your work. I kept a Bewear in my party for most of Moon. Anu6is lol! Lord Argyris My party was boring. Two of them were from Gen I, and apart from my starter, only one other member was from Gen VII. Now really, Nintendo should get in on this whole Coke-Google partnership thing. Maybe put something in their 3DS games that ties into this advertising platform. "Oh, so you're raising a bunch of Fire-type Pokemon. I'll bet you're feeling pretty hot right about now. Know what would cool you right down? A nice, ice cold COKE." Ryne Hager I mean, with the launch event Munchlax and Munchlax/Snorlax available on the first island, who in their right mind didn't take a Gen I Snorlax to end game. Michael Oghia I came here just to give you a +1 for Hypno Toad. Steve Actually noticed this happening to me recently when near the vending machine at my job. Guessing the capabilities will be endless and more diverse when full-on set-ups are placed everywhere. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7ea9fde9939850ddee856f08d34c3e8a98a6c90461c779f049060ec4e655b8c6.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f87dc3afe5a1492c33e179552b9fcf3259d388ef4a1a6cfed7951d9612faeae6.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/da689e538e0681368f0ef1dac408a796aa111781564a9ded426c4639fbeab351.jpg F4LL0U7 Disabling Nearby will disable invasive ads, you say? Done! Morten Ulv Google usually have a way to opt out. james fuston https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPGgTy5YJ-g Ben Nothing better than a new way to sell people tooth-rotting, diabetes-causing sugar water. Nicholas Conrad *This* is the gateway to AR! Aing actual R; genius! abqnm Are these connected to the "Nearby" activity in Google Settings? (Which also interestingly enough at some point has earned the ability to add the Nearby activity directly to the homescreen. Don't know when it appeared as I don't open that screen often, but it's now an option in the overflow menu.) James F Beacons typically use Bluetooth. abqnm Yes, and Google's Nearby uses Bluetooth LE scanning and Play Services location. But with Google being a part of it, I'm asking if it is directly related to the Nearby function. I am not asking for how beacons typically work. MJ Double checked BT is off on my phone... The only time ever use it is when play music on a BT speaker which I don't do when grocery shopping. "With that info, displays are able to select content based on your preferences in the form of advertisements specifically targeted to passersby" How does these ads work exactly? I am not watching a 54min video. Dedren You don't need bluetooth on per say. It just uses that tech. I believe you will have to enable Nearby places, which is disabled by default but will probably be enabled by default in the future. MJ Nearby places will not be going on... F4LL0U7 I'm not sure they could develop an ad that's targeted enough to get me to buy Coke. F4LL0U7 I guess I might consider it if the vending machine held a family member hostage or something. James F I don't know if I should be concerned that you said *might* consider it.... F4LL0U7 What can I say, I'm just not very receptive to ads. Dedren What about Water, Sprite, SimplyOrange, Powerade, Minute Maid? Surely one of those you drink...all Coke. F4LL0U7 I mean, of course I drink water, but I get it from the filtered pitcher in my fridge. No to the others. Adrian quickest way to turn me off on a product. Bluetooth is only on in my car anyway so good luck with it. As soon as someone figures out how to spoof it and annoy people in public, it will go away. Max Johnson I thought it's been NFC and GPS all this time. At least from my Android Pay app. blindexecutioner I would literally break my phone if I got an ad as I walked by a pop machine (or whatever) if I couldn't opt out of it of course.. I would switch to iOS that day. If it happened on iOS I would stop using smart phones altogether. tehboogieman You could just turn off bluetooth. Or you know, there's your way rndusrnm479461 iOS also supports this same thing. rndusrnm479461 I've read the whole article and even watched some of that video and I still don't get it - what do your "preferences" affect in the ads? How will it affect what the ad displays? Does it just play the ad you're more likely to prefer from 5 different ads? I'm confused... Why is such system necessary for something simple like coke? Would make more sense for a bus stop ad or other kinds of billboards.

Google has slowly been making its way into people's social lives. Last year the firm launched a feature that uses real time data to you how busy a bar is.

Called Popular Times, it uses anonymized real time data to predict the number of people inside - and even makes a guess at how long they are likely to stay  Users can search any location by name and the Popular Times section will appear in Google or Google Maps, displaying the number of visitors inside – the firm is using anonymized data and searchers to estimate how many people are inside. Included in this real-time feature is the ability to know how long people are hanging out in the place at a time – it could be one hour, three hours or more. 'If you're playing host for the day, you can also check and see how long people typically stay at a given location,' Google said . 'That way you can plan your itinerary to the minute.'  The feature uses anonymized real time data to predict the number of people inside - and even makes a guess at how long they are likely to stay. Google will also tell you if the line for a book signing is long, which means you know if you will have time to grab a coffee on the way. Users can see just how many people are estimated to be there on any day of the week and updates to let you know if the establishment will be closed - Google is also using search history to formulate its calculations.  Read more: Google will tell you how crowded your favorite bar is in real time - The Verge Google Search will now help you find nearby events | TechCrunch Share or comment on this article e-mail 7 shares Most watched News videos Two men rescue a drenched kangaroo on the beach Numbers of deadly redback spiders increasing in New Zealand Security guard inappropriately touches female commuters on subway Heart-stopping moment school girl tries to catch falling child Surfer and his five-year-old son carve it up together Kayaker is chased by alligator in Mobile,Alabama bay Gang of six Sudanese teenagers charged into couple's bedroom News presenter breaks down as she reports on own show's cancellation Huge crane collapses during bridge construction in Italy Moment plumber jumps into water well to help prevent disruption Incredible moment FedEx and UPS have epic dance battle Bizarre Game of Thrones coverage for South Korea election Shops urged to offer free water to cut plastic bottles:...

MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe. It features 24 hours of battery life and claims to be a 'mini-disco on the move'. But does it live up to the claim? Samsung's Galaxy S8: A hefty price tag and a dumb personal assistant Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning, but its $100 price hike is hard to swallow. Overall the S8 is for those who want elegance - and are willing to pay for it. Affordable, robust and surprisingly responsive: Samsung's Galaxy A5 With the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 having been pushed back, South Korea-based Samsung has plugged the gap with the Samsung Galaxy A5, a high-end device with a mid-range price tag. Is it really worth paying £280 for Nintendo's Switch? MailOnline's verdict While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

I want to recap what the company tax plan does, from the explanatory memo. The government passed the cuts for small and medium businesses in the last sitting session. That section is costing the budget $29.8bn over a decade, according to the treasurer. The bill introduced this morning was a recommitment by the government that it plans to still try to legislate the cut for the big end of town. It says it would: progressively extend the lower 27.5% corporate tax rate to all corporate tax entities by the 2023-24 income year. The corporate tax rate will then be cut, for all corporate tax entities, to: • 27% for the 2024-25 income year • 26% for the 2025-26 income year • 25% for the 2026-27 income year and later income years. The original cost of the company tax plan for 2017-27 was $48.2bn, as revealed by Treasury officials after the budget last year. The cost, as revealed by Scott Morrison in question time, for 2018-28 is $65.4bn. Morrison told David Speers the reason for the large discrepancy for one more year is that the tax cut progressively ramps up. So the 2018-28 period contains more companies on the tax cut. So to extend the bill to the big end of town, as the government proposes, will cost the budget $35.6bn over the next decade.

They have been negotiating on Indigenous land use agreements since 2008. There are 126 Iluas now in question and it also puts in danger agreements signed for the past 25 years. Too many people are focusing on Adani and not the other 125 agreements, Mundine says. (The federal court decision puts Adani’s agreement with traditional owners in question.) The legislation change, he says, means that not every Indigenous land owner would have to sign off on land use agreements. He said needing all members’ agreement on land use agreements was like every local council decision requiring every council member to agree. It would be unworkable.

FILE - In this Wednesday, Nov. 30, 2016, file photo, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella speaks at the annual Microsoft shareholders meeting, in Bellevue, Wash. Microsoft says a half billion devices are now running Windows 10, its latest operating system. That's up from 400 million disclosed in September 2016, but far short of Microsoft's stated goal of 1 billion by 2018. Microsoft has already acknowledged it won't hit 1 billion in time. Getting halfway has taken nearly two years. (AP Photo/Elaine Thompson, File) tech Half-billion Windows 10 devices, but PC slump stunts growth Today 01:27 am JST 0 Comments By MICHAEL LIEDTKE SAN FRANCISCO Microsoft's latest version of Windows is faring better than its maligned predecessor, but the software's growth is still stunted by a shift away from personal computers. Windows 10 is now running on a half-billion devices nearly two years after its release, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella disclosed Wednesday during the software maker's annual conference for applications programmers. That figure is up from 400 million eight months ago, but far short of Microsoft's goal of putting Windows 10 on 1 billion devices by 2018. The Redmond, Washington, company had already acknowledged it won't reach that goal in time . Windows 10 represents a comeback for Microsoft after the colossal flop of Windows 8, whose ill-conceived designed deepened a decline in PC sales and contributed to the departure of Nadella's predecessor, Steve Ballmer. Although it has been easing recently, the PC slump still hasn't ended. People are increasingly connecting to digital services, checking email and performing other computing tasks on devices powered by Apple's iOS and Google's Android instead of Microsoft's Windows. That's one the prime reasons Microsoft has been eclipsed by both Apple and Google in the technology industry's pecking order after dominating throughout the 1990s. Microsoft tried to piggyback on the trend by expanding into smartphones, but those attempts have mostly flopped. It's the reason Microsoft cites for failing to meet its 1 billion goal in time. Its Surface tablet has done better, but even that product has hit rough patches. Microsoft blamed disappointing Surface sales for a revenue shortfall in its most recent years. As consumers have embraced smartphones, Microsoft increasingly is building its products with business and government agencies in mind, said Gartner analyst Ed Anderson. But Microsoft is still hoping to win over consumers with its digital servant, Cortana, a rival to Apple's Siri, Google's Assistant and Amazon's Alexa. Earlier this week, Microsoft unveiled an internet-connected speaker featuring Cortana in a partnership with Samsung's Harman Kardon. Microsoft also announced Wednesday that both Intel and HP plan to implant Cortana in upcoming devices, but didn't provide any further details. Microsoft encouraged programmers Wednesday to design applications that help Cortana do whatever people might want. Both Amazon's Echo and Google's Home devices are striving to do the same thing. © Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved.

Google Phone 9.0 prepares to add Android O's Notification Channels, picture messaging, post-call messages, and more [APK Teardown] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/05/02 5:00am PDTMay 2, 2017 76 Plus 1 on G+ 92 Share on Facebook 76 Share on Twitter Total Shares244 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Update 1: 2017/05/10 3:16pm PDT Official changelog posted Article Contents 1 Teardown 1.1 Notification Channels for Android O 1.2 Post-call messaging 1.3 Convenient picture messaging 1.4 Motorola "hidden menu" dialer codes 1.5 Cat and dog paws? 2 Download Late last week, an update to Google's Phone app began rolling out with no immediately obvious changes to the experience. While users don't have anything to play with quite yet, there are several interesting hints about what is to come in future releases. Hidden among the app's resources are signs of support for Android O's new Notification Channels feature, in-call picture messaging, post-call messaging, hidden menu codes for Motorola phones, and even some odd images of paws. Yes, seriously. Update 1: 2017/05/10 3:16pm PDT Official changelog posted Google posted a changelog for the Phone app's latest update with the addition of emergency location display and "call waiting improvements" making up the majority of the new features. Emergency location display Call waiting improvements (accept second call and end ongoing call) Bug fixes Needless to say, I wasn't going to test anything that may relate to emergency services, but I did try testing the call waiting function. There weren't any visible changes for me, so it's possible these are really under-the-hood improvements or something that doesn't work on my cell carriers. End of Update Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Notification Channels for Android O While it's a fairly small feature when compared to some of the improvements we've seen in many major OS updates, the Notification Channels brought to us by Android O are exciting. Most of Google's apps are still not implementing this addition to the API, but it's clearly in the works with the Phone app. While they don't appear to be fully implemented yet, names have been added to the latest apk update that describe six separate channels, including: Incoming calls, Ongoing calls, Missed calls, Voicemails, External calls, and Miscellaneous. <string name="notification_channel_incoming_call">Incoming calls</string> <string name="notification_channel_ongoing_call">Ongoing calls</string> <string name="notification_channel_missed_call">Missed calls</string> <string name="notification_channel_voicemail">Voicemails</string> <string name="notification_channel_external_call">External calls</string> <string name="notification_channel_misc">Miscellaneous</string> That's a pretty thorough list given the nature of the Phone app and the types of notifications it shows, especially since most users will probably never even see a couple of them. While the strings are there, only the standard Miscellaneous channel is visible in the notification settings screen for the Phone app. In all likelihood, the implementation probably wasn't complete when this update was built, so we can probably expect to see it in the next release, or possibly when the second developer preview image becomes available. Post-call messaging Receive a phone call today on almost any modern phone and you can probably tap or swipe something on the screen to reject it and immediately reply with a pre-written text message to say you're unavailable or will call back shortly. It can be a useful feature, even if it's just for those times when you're driving or stuck in a meeting. But what should the caller do if they don't get through? Leaving a voicemail is turning to be too cumbersome, so many people now send a text instead. New lines in this update suggest the same type of prepared text messages might be added for the caller, as well. There are a few new lines going into this feature, but three are the new, pre-written messages meant to convey varying degrees of importance. They are simple messages crafted to let the target of the call know that your needs are urgent, important but not time sensitive, or you just called to chat. <string name="post_call_add_message">Add message</string> <string name="post_call_message">Say why you called</string> <string name="post_call_message_1">This is urgent. Call me back.</string> <string name="post_call_message_2">Call me back when you have some time.</string> <string name="post_call_message_3">Not urgent, we can chat later.</string> <string name="post_call_message_sent">Message sent</string> There aren't any other clues to suggest how this feature will be presented to the caller or if a custom message can be written from the same screen, but it's likely this feature wasn't complete yet, either. Unless some clever tricks are necessary to make this feature smart, it seems like there probably won't have to be too much more work, so it may go live with the next update. Convenient picture messaging For many years, phone manufacturers have experimented with bringing certain features to the surface during calls so users don't have to spend too much time poking at their phone to do things that people are likely to need in the moment. One feature that has been popping up occasionally, even as far back as the days of dumb phones, was the ability to quickly take a picture and send it directly to the person in the same conversation. It looks like the same feature is probably destined for Google's Phone app. <string name="received_a_photo">Received a photo</string> <string name="sent_a_photo">Sent a photo</string> There are a few other strings possibly related to this feature, but the two above are the only ones that really matter. They represent the basic status messages to show a picture was sent or received. Again, it's not really clear if there are any clever features that make this a little smarter, but I have a hunch the Phone app will listen for messages containing images (I assume both MMS and RCS) and instead of making users switch to their messaging app, the photos will be shown automatically or with an on-screen button. Motorola "hidden menu" dialer codes Hacking around with a phone can be fun and enable a lot of powerful features, but it often involves a lot of secret methods that aren't intended for the public. Dialer codes have been used as one of the key methods for accessing special menus and functions. A long list of Motorola's dialer codes was included in the latest Phone update. Some of these are pretty old, but at least a few of them didn't turn up in any of my searches, so I thought some people might want to experiment with them. Disclaimer: Use of these dialer codes is done at your own risk. Some of these may damage your phone and/or void its warranty. You've been warned. If you want some information on many of these codes, you can find about 3/4 of them listed in this 2012 post by well-known security expert JCase. The behavior of the remaining codes is currently unknown and didn't turn up in my research. Only try them out if you know what you're doing and prepared for the possible consequences. code <string-array name="motorola_hidden_menu_key_sequence"> <item>\##66236#</item> <item>\##2539#</item> <item>\##786#</item> <item>\##72786#</item> <item>\##3282#</item> <item>\##33284#</item> <item>\##3424#</item> <item>\##564#</item> <item>\##4567257#</item> <item>\##873283#</item> <item>\##6343#</item> <item>\##27263#</item> <item>\##258#</item> <item>\##8422#</item> <item>\##4382#</item> </string-array> <string-array name="motorola_hidden_menu_key_pattern"> <item>\##[0-9]{6}#</item> </string-array> <string-array name="motorola_hidden_menu_key_pattern_intents"> <item>@string/motorola_hidden_menu_intent</item> </string-array> Cat and dog paws? Finally, a couple of quirky images were added to this update. A pair of paws, one belonging to a cat and the other to a dog, can now be found in the apk's resources. Note: Images were converted from webp to png. I'm not yet sure what they are used for, if they belong to an Easter egg, or maybe somebody at Google just wanted to make sure we were still watching. Both images have transparent backgrounds and look like they could be used for a simple animation where a paw reaches up to grab an object on the screen and drag it away. Whatever the case, ya gotta love the whimsy and humor.

Kieron Quinn http://i.imgur.com/y7tX9IY.png Nope, it's random Kieron Quinn I wonder if you can find what triggers the animation (if there is one) in the code, like the 0118 999 881 999 119 725 3 easter egg Rudresh did not do anything on my dialer Kieron Quinn It only works on the Google Phone app Andy J There is an IT Crowd easter egg?! 4Ui812 The Savannah cat . https://youtu.be/IVaiYSPn380 wickets any idea when O beta signup is opening? boop If imagine no sooner than I/O when they formally announce the update and walk through it's intended feature set. wickets google is soooo stingy with their beta's haha. I have it on my 6p, but on pixel SOL with the verizon version Lonerwithaboner420 Youve got O beta? How, I love to. wickets If you have a pixel or nexus just go to Google developers site and download Lonerwithaboner420 Thanks M Gordon "Only try them out if you know what you're and prepared for the possible consequences." Is there a mistake in there? Cody Toombs yep, I must have made a mistake in editing. Fixed it. Thanks KChristainsen Will this ever open up to non nexus devices? Gonzales Probably not. It would be nice for OEMs to give us a choice, but I doubt it will ever happen aRvInD Yes it will work, if you root, install GPhone as system app and make it default Phone app. Thats how I'm enjoying this on my Oneplus3...! DragoCubed Dog 🐅 and cat 🐈 paws. :3 awwwwww DynamikD That is definitely a tiger 🐅. DragoCubed I hate the Samsung emoji makapav I bet it will still not support sending call-reject text messages through Google Voice. Sigh... Kyle Salewski Yeah. Even hitting the Message button on a contact won't work. They really need to allow Voice to be the default SMS app makapav Well done bro. You're a fellow dedicated Google Voice user to figure that out and complain about it. I wanted to bring that use case here to my rant but figured probably no one else jumps through that hoop like me! ;-) Clearly Google has the laziest/clueless Android users on their team because some of these obvious use cases go unknown to them. chocolate_drizzle I think they should add seemless Google Duo integration by adding a video calling option in the app. What do you guys think? DynamikD I think you are on to something! 👍 bunchofpenguins Facetime does this where you can press a button and switch right to Facetime. I have been wanting this in Android forever. Chris My girlfriend and I enjoy using Duo all the time, so this would be perfect. But then Google would need to release their Phone app for all Android phones in the Play Store. Carson Saldanha No, they could just add support for it in their own. Andy J If the photo features are indeed for RCS (and sending photos while in a phone call is indeed a feature specifically detailed in the RCS spec) - then in the same way Messages is available to all Android phones, the phone app would also have to be on the store. And the Contacts app will probably go on too - because a key part of the RCS spec is that the phone address book will show which contacts have "enhanced messaging" available. Chris I hope so. I love the Google Dialer and Contacts but I have to use an old APK to get it to run on non Nexus or Pixel devices. Deeco Too logical for Google JG I could see where that could come in handy... However I'm not sure if Duo has picked up enough traction to really make it useful enough to integrate it into the dialer. If the recipient doesn't have Duo installed (as possibly would be the case the majority of the time - at least from personal experience) then a Duo video call button would just be extra clutter... Berni Hargrove But this is how you give it traction. Intuitively integrate it into a regularly used feature/app of the phone. The dialer is a perfect fit to help give Duo more relevance. Biga173rd Does this APK work with non pixel phones? Siddharth Nope except Nexus devices Biga173rd Thanks Cody Toombs It's meant for a few things people forget, but definitely not all phones. The full list should be: Pixel, Nexus, Android One, and Motorola. Carpentractor Ok, I have been experiencing a weird bug with my Pixel keypad while in call. Basically, the keypad gets smushed when accessing the keypad in call and it cuts off the letters ​under the numbers, which are sort of useful when spelling last names for extensions... It happened to me several updates ago and uninstalling all of the updates for the app and putting it back to how the phone came originally would fix that issue, but obviously take away any new features that have been added to the dialer. But, this time when I tried to uninstall the app updates, it didn't fix the issue! Everytime I see an update for the dialer, I get excited that they may have fixed it, but to no avail. My girlfriend has a Nexus 5X and she does not have the issue. I have attached a screenshot, please let me know if anyone has a solution or is even experiencing the issue. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/dd8b277825ef665ffa607ce2aa8b3a0004b8109cba32e68655dcd11afd7834ec.png DynamikD I, personally, have never experienced this and I have the same device as you. By any chance, are you running any 3rd party app(s) that also integrated into the dialer? Carpentractor I don't think so, I did have Skype installed at one point, but I did uninstall it. What kind of 3rd party apps might integrate with the dialer? I guess I can try to boot up in safe mode.... Rod What's your font size? Carpentractor Large. Carpentractor So, I changed my font back to default and it did solve the problem. Is there no way to have my font set to large and have the dialer format properly? My girlfriend has her font set to large with no issues on her 5x. This is whacky! Rod Have you changed the DPI? Carpentractor Not as far as anything beyond having my display size also set to large. Morenicano $5 says this will be a new messenger app by next year Richard Dennis and they will move half of Allo's features to it.. So you now need both apps... And hangouts is a new email app. Yuku Sugianto Why do Motorola codes appear on Google's Phone app? Probably the next Nexus/Pixel line phone will be made by Motorola, and Motorola service staff are already accustomed to those codes to diagnose problems. Cody Toombs Sorry to kill this theory, but Motorola has a arrangement with Google to use a lot of Google's first party apps. It's been in place basically since Google bought it and began shipping the Moto X with nearly stock AOSP with some product specific enhancements. As far as I am aware, all (or most?) Motorola phones use Google's Phone app. Even if that weren't the explanation, the Nexus 6 would be. I mean, a Moto-made Pixel could still happen, but these phone codes aren't evidence of that. Kevin Burton Could the "paws" be for sequence dialing? When a "pause" is entered you get a "paw" displayed on the phone? AintaDamnThingFunny I like the phone app. My only complaint is it's not the most intuitive thing on earth to try and answer/reject a call by swiping up/down. I routinely need 3 or 4 tries to get it.

Going forward, websites that are signed with a SHA-1 or SSL certification will be blocked from loading. The browser will display a warning about the website using an invalid certificate and advise users not to share sensitive information with the site. Read: Microsoft Defender Bug: How To Check If Windows Defender Is Up To Date The decision was buried in a list of updates and patches released by the company this week, including an emergency patch that fixed an exploit in Windows Defender that allowed an attacker to remotely execute malicious code through the anti-malware program. Microsoft will pull support for the hashing function immediately in both Edge and Internet Explorer, which brings the browsers up to speed with other browsers like Google Chrome and Firefox, which already had started the process of phasing out support for websites utilizing SHA-1 certificates. The move was inevitable, as SHA-1 has been considered obsolete by security experts for several years. Earlier this year, Google was able to successfully execute a collision attack on SHA-1 that effectively cracked the encryption algorithm, proving its vulnerability. The hashing function used to encrypt information generates a random string of characters that act as a digital fingerprint for plaintext information while making sure no one except the intended recipient is able to access the information. It was commonly used for login systems, which need to verify a password is correct without exposing the password. Read: What Is SHA-1? Google Cracked A Fundamental Part Of Web Encryption Because it’s very unlikely for hash values ever to be identical, it’s easy for a system to verify a hash value. But Google was able to create a collision, in which two different files produced the exact same hash value, enabling an attacker to distribute malicious files that share the same hash as a legitimate file. Google’s attack took a considerable amount of computing power. It required 9 quintillion SHA-1 computations in total, which required 6,500 years of CPU computation and 110 years of GPU computation to complete. A small-time attacker is not likely to have access to those kinds of resources, but it is conceivable that a malicious actor or organization could harness similar amounts of computing power to create such a collision, to devastating effect. For example, a collision attack launched in 2012 against the MD5 algorithm utilized state-sponsored malware known as Flame and was able to forge a Windows code-signing certificate and distribute itself through patches to millions of users. SHA-1 has now been proved vulnerable to a similar type of attack. While the collision that Google produced is less devastating than the one used by Flame, it is enough for cryptographers to deem the hash function unsafe. The move away from SHA-1 by many secure sites started in 2014. At the time, more than 90 percent of web encryption was still using the SHA-1 hashing function.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Computers Why Chrome will never be on the Windows Store or Windows 10 S Mike Wehner @MikeWehner May 10th, 2017 at 5:53 PM Share Tweet Last week, Microsoft finally announced its much-anticipated competitor to Google’s Chrome OS. It’s called Windows 10 S, and it’s essentially a stripped-down, streamlined version of the company’s desktop OS. It seems like a solid idea, but if there’s one thing about the new Windows “lite” that is giving would-be buyers pause, it’s the fact that only apps from the Windows Store can be installed on any device using the new operating system, and that means no third party browsers, like Google Chrome. So why doesn’t Google just make a Windows Store version of Chrome and make everyone happy? Unfortunately it’s not nearly that easy. Don't Miss: This is how Samsung will stop the Galaxy Note7R from exploding. As ZDNet points out, Microsoft’s restrictions and requirements for apps submitted to the Windows Store would essentially force Google to totally rewrite a new browser from the ground up. The issue stems from Microsoft’s requirement that all Windows-approved apps utilize the company’s own rendering engines. Microsoft describes the policy, and its impact on third party browsers, thusly: Windows Store apps that browse the web must use HTML and JavaScript engines provided by the Windows Platform. All Windows Store content is certified by Microsoft to help ensure a quality experience and keep your devices safer. With this policy, instated early this year, the browser a customer chooses in the Store will ensure the protections and safeguards of our Windows platform. If people would like to access apps from other stores and services, they can switch to Windows 10 Pro at any time. In short, even if Google — or Opera or Mozilla — repackaged their browsers in a way that would allow them to be installed via the Windows Store, the actual architecture of the apps would lead Microsoft to reject them outright. In the big picture, it makes sense for Microsoft to lock down what apps are used on its education-focused Windows spin-off and, like Chrome OS, preventing third party browsers in the name of convenience and security is probably a smart play. All that being said, it certainly doesn’t make Microsoft Edge any more appealing.

Skip to: Start of Article. Author: Davey Alba. Davey Alba Business Date of Publication: 05.10.17. 05.10.17 Time of Publication: 5:15 pm. 5:15 pm Snap Blows First Earnings—But That’s Not the Whole Story Wired Today Snap reported its first earnings as a public company, and it bombed. Snap’s stock market debut three months ago was the most valuable tech IPO in the US in two years, and certainly the most talked-about. Snap, after all, provides one of the few significant alternatives to the two giants of online advertising, Facebook and Google. If Snap can eke out some space in a field long dominated by this duopoly, that could mean more meaningful competition. ‘Snap is a niche platform. It’s not an alternative, but a complement.’ Brian Wieser, Pivotal Research But for the moment, the market isn’t optimistic. Snap reported revenue of $149.6 million in the first quarter of 2017, a significant gain from the $39 million it pulled in during the same period one year ago but below Wall Street’s expectations of $159 million. The Los Angeles-based company also added 8 million new daily users in the first three months of the year, a year-on-year growth of 36 percent, compared to 52 percent growth one year ago. Meanwhile, it lost a whopping $2 billion because of stock-based compensation during its February IPO—most notably, the $750 million awarded to CEO and founder Evan Spiegel for taking the company public. In after-hours trading, Snap’s stock plunged 20 percent—and by the looks of things, it could keep dropping. Needless to say, Snap’s long-term potential won’t be the story many investors will want to hear after these dismal numbers. But they should cut Snap some slack: Snap is like no other company at the moment, even taking Instagram’s aping of many of its features into account. “Snap is a niche platform,” says Brian Wieser, a media industry analyst at Pivotal Research. “It’s not an alternative, but a complement.” On an internet where fake news, crappy ads, and hate abound, Snap exerts tight control over what gets featured on its platform and how that content gets shared, an approach on which Snap has built a dedicated audience. It’s a business model far removed from Facebook and Google, both built on scale and the (very) long tail of online content. Three months isn’t long enough to tell for sure how Snap’s alternative approach will play out. Not Disappearing After all, not all earnings reports really offer meaningful insight into whether a company will succeed or spiral downward. Facebook shares dipped 12 percent after its first report in July 2012 following a less-than-stellar IPO. Today it’s valued at close to half-a-trillion dollars, making it the fifth largest company in the world by market cap. Twitter, by contrast, lost a quarter of its market value after its first report and never really rebounded. Based on revenue and growth so far, it’s understandable that investors would worry Snap is not looking like the next Facebook. For one, Snap is a money-loser—and not just the 2 billion it reported today. The company lost $514.6 million in 2016, well over the $372.9 million it lost in 2015, hardly a comforting trend. And its growth rate is slowing. After averaging more than 15 million new daily users in the first three quarters of 2016, it added just five million new daily users in the fourth quarter, the slowest quarter-over-quarter user growth it saw in two years, according to its pre-IPO filing. Today’s additional eight million users doesn’t exactly represent a strong rebound. More Snap Dan Runcie Snap’s IPO Made Its Employees Millionaires—Why Not DJ Khaled? Davey Alba Snap’s IPO Could Kill What Makes It Great David Pierce My Insane Adventure to Buy Snap’s New Spectacles David Pierce Time for Snap to Prove It’s Bigger Than Snapchat Based on these numbers, Snap’s struggle looks a lot like Twitter’s, which faced stagnant user growth over several consecutive quarters, making no shareholders happy. For investors in social media companies, the time always seems ripe to ask: Has the network reached its limits? Is the problem simply that no more new users will get Snap, the way so many just didn’t get Twitter? But those concerns don’t quite capture how well Snap may be positioned to capture more fundamental changes in the online advertising market in the years to come. Spending on digital advertising as a whole just surpassed television for the first time—$72.5 billion in the US in 2016, compared to TV’s $71.3 billion. “There is a structural shift away from TV advertising dollars to the internet,” says Christos Charalambous, a senior strategist at Edge Wealth Management and a Snap shareholder. At the same time, Snap as a medium offers TV-like qualities that could attract ad dollars from both pots of money. “Similar to television, Snap is an infinitely better platform than Facebook and Google for building brands,” says Jason Kint, CEO of publishing industry trade group Digital Content Next. “Facebook and Google’s duopoly is built off their data collection and direct marketing.” As such, Kint sees Google and Facebook ad formats as more competitive to classified ads or direct mail. What’s more, Snap is reportedly developing TV-like original content for its most engaged users. And media companies have scrambled to participate in its Discover section, a place in Snap’s app for publishing original stories (WIRED is one of them).Some publishers may even be making money on Snap, which could attract even more high-quality content to the platform. “Snap has done a masterful job of protecting the quality of the brands inside of Discover,” says Kint. “They understand and act like a media company unlike the engineers up north.” That willingness to be meticulous about quality and to be held accountable for the content that lives on its platform could set Snap apart from its larger, far more successful rivals. For so long, tech companies have dodged calling themselves media companies to avoid the responsibility of acting as an arbiter of content, perhaps in part out of the fear that quality control could stunt growth. Whatever happens to Snap shares tomorrow, the company may ultimately offer a case study in whether that assumption turns out to be right. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Name: Subject: Message: Google acquires VR developer behind Job Simulator and Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality Newsby Jimmy Westenberg9 hours ago 82 3 This post originally appeared on our sister site, VR Source. Google has made a major, and somewhat surprising, move in the VR gaming space. The company has acquired Austin, Texas-based Owlchemy Labs, the developer behind a number of acclaimed PC and console VR games like Job Simulator and more recently Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality. The specific financial terms of the deal were not disclosed. In August 2016, the company announced it had received $5 million in funding from a number of investment groups. See also: Rick and Morty Virtual Rick-ality Review In a blog post, Google stated that the Owlchemy Labs team will continue to work on creating new VR games and experiences across many different platforms. In its own announcement, Owlchemy confirmed it will keep making games for the  HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and PlayStation VR headsets. However, since the team is now part of Google, you can bet that it will also expand its work to include Google’s own VR platform, Daydream. Owlchemy Labs was founded in 2010 and since then it has released a number of games for PC, mobile, and console platforms, but has concentrated most of its work in the past few years in the VR space. Job Simulator, which launched in 2016, has received a ton of great reviews for its humor and gameplay, as it allows players to perform tasks as an “Auto Mechanic”, “Office Worker”, and more. The Rick and Morty game it developed for Adult Swim, based on the hit TV animated series, was just released a few weeks ago and has also received good reviews (our review here). Owlchemy Labs has not yet announced its next game project. News Jimmy Westenberg Lover of all things Android, Star Wars, dogs, coffee and music.

The company is doubling down on their commitment to the space with the acquisition of VR studio Owlchemy Labs. Nintendo Switch Founded in 2011, Owlchemy Labs is known for titles like Job Simulator and more recently Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality. At the moment, those games are available on full-featured platforms like Oculus, HTC Vive, and PlayStation VR, and not more mobile solutions. Google notes that the studio has set “a high bar for what engagement can be like in virtual worlds” with “thoughtful interactive experiences that are responsive, intuitive, and feel natural.” It appears that the Google is taking a similar approach to their purchase of Tilt Brush developers Skillman & Hackett in 2015, with Owlchemy Labs continuing to make titles for other platforms: Together, we’ll be working to create engaging, immersive games and developing new interaction models across many different platforms to continue bringing the best VR experiences to life. Other efforts for creating VR content at Google include Earth and YouTube. Just yesterday, the company announced a ‘Street View ready‘ certification program for cameras to ensure high-quality 360 imagery.

Owlchemy Labs made Snuggle Truck [Free] and Jack Lumber [Free] for mobile, eventually branching out early into the VR space, where they likely have the number-one selling VR game in Job Simulator. It's a lot of fun, and has been a launch title on the three major console/PC platforms: HTC Vive, PS VR, and Oculus. They also made the Rick and Morty VR game for Adult Swim: Subscribe to the TouchArcade YouTube channel The studio hit VR early and often, and now they're owned by Google, who are an underappreciated player in the VR world. After all, they made the Cardboard standard that countless VR headsets use, along with the intriguing Daydream VR platform. Owlchemy will continue to make content for other platforms, but I wouldn't be surprised to see their stuff come to Daydream, either. Here's an interesting question, though. Owlchemy has done really well in both selling VR content and raising money from investors to develop for VR. Maybe Google gave them a sacriligeous amount of money. But...what if they felt like it was the only plausible future for them? And if they felt like they had to do it, what does it say for the studios that want to do VR but might not have the kind of funding that Owlchemy did? A lot of entities with big money are seeing if there's a gold rush in VR. What happens if VR doesn't develop into a significant platform and the investments start running dry, with software sales having limited efficacy in keeping studios afloat?

Small won't fly on Steam/PC and consoles, but on mobile, why not? Google Cardboard is very practical for me, and I'm happy with performance even on my 3-year-old iPhone 6+!

In a post Wednesday, Google announced it has acquired developer Owlchemy Labs. Google’s official announcement said: "We care a lot about building and investing in compelling, high-quality and interactive virtual reality experiences, and have created many of our own — from YouTube, Street View and Photos on Daydream to Google Earth VR and Tilt Brush. And, we work with partners and support developers and creators outside of Google to help bring their ideas to VR. "Today, we're thrilled to welcome Owlchemy Labs to Google. They've created award-winning games like 'Job Simulator' and 'Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality,' which have really thoughtful interactive experiences that are responsive, intuitive and feel natural. They’ve helped set a high bar for what engagement can be like in virtual worlds, and do it all with a great sense of humor!" Read: Rick And Morty: Virtual Rick-ality Release Date Announced Owlchemy Labs is best known for titles including 2016’s Job Simulator, in which players explore several exaggerated versions of real-life jobs, and Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality, an adventure title based on the animated show Rick and Morty. The studio also has been one of the biggest success stories among early VR developers, clearing more than $3 million in sales for Job Simulator earlier this year. Owlchemy Labs will continue to work as a multiplatform developer and produce VR games for platforms, including the HTC Vive, Oculus Rift and PlayStation VR, but it’ll now have the support and backing of Google. Read: Google Hires SoundStage Developer For Virtual Reality Team In its own announcement, Owlchemy Labs said the studio is looking forward to working alongside Google to help produce and innovate in the VR games space. "This means Owlchemy will continue building high quality VR content for platforms like the HTC Vive, Oculus Touch, and PlayStation VR. This means continuing to focus on hand interactions and high quality user experiences, like with 'Job Simulator.' This means continuing our mission to build VR for everyone, and doing all of this as the same silly Owlchemy Labs you know and love. We are continuing to do all of this with even more support and focus on building awesome stuff. It’s incredibly exciting that Google and Owlchemy are so well aligned on our goals and vision for the future of VR." For Google, the Owlchemy move is its latest acquisition as the company looks to further bolster its roster of VR companies. Within the past few years, the search company has acquired individual developers like the teams behind titles Tilt Brush and SoundStage. It’s also made substantial developments in higher-end VR camera hardware and technology that’s aimed at the professional and creative community.

Samsung made a phone that I just told you was the best phone you could buy today. The Galaxy S8 (and S8+) still is, in my opinion. Nothing has changed on that front. It’s just not the phone for me. Even as iPhone-ish as this small Google Pixel is, with its ugly face and weird backside, it’s the Android phone that does the things I need it to in the best possible way.  Credit Google for their take on their own operating system (How silly does that sound?), but nothing beats Google’s version of Android. And to me, even with the prettiest pieces of tech on the planet staring me in the face, like what Samsung just delivered, those aren’t enough to get me to give up the cleanest, leanest, most efficient and up-to-date version of Android that is paired with a heck of a camera. NOTE: Prepare for nitpicky criticism. I said the S8 is the best phone for most of you because it is. However, I critique phones for a living and so I notice all the little annoying things that each manufacturer does and then share thoughts on those. This is a post about that and why the Pixel is still the phone I turn to because it gets some basic things right. If you aren’t prepared for an over-anal analysis of why Samsung’s software still mostly sucks, you might want to call it a day and skip this one. I touched on this a bit in my video review of the Galaxy S8, but there is a combination of things I do almost every time I pickup a phone that Samsung gets wrong, in my opinion. Yes, it starts with the fingerprint reader in many ways. I know, I know, here we go again on the fingerprint reader placement. But here’s the thing, I have to use it almost every time I grab a phone in order to get into my phone. If it’s in a terrible location that I still can’t find every single time after two weeks of use, I don’t think I’m overblowing this. So with the Galaxy S8, I’ve found that as I pickup my phone, I now have to think about how I’m going to unlock it, because the fingerprint reader is out of the question. That’s a sh*tty position to be in after spending 2-3 years using nothing but fingerprint readers on all phones, including those from Samsung. I just want to grab a phone and go without having to pause before getting to work. But my brain does all of the following: Is my Smart Lock working? Maybe, if I’m at home. Do I want to even attempt to line up my eyes or face to see if those slow unlock methods work? Hah, god no. Do I just give up on all of that and enter my damn pattern? Probably. But wait, is that a fingerprint reader I feel? Which. One. Do. I. Do. On the flip side, with my Google Pixel, I have a perfectly centered fingerprint reader on the back of the phone that unlocks my phone every time without the need for a sequence of thoughts over how the hell I’m going to check my email. Two steps: 1) grab phone; and 2) use conveniently placed fingerprint reader. That’s it! It doesn’t end there, though. The Always-on Display on the S8 is pretty worthless in terms of providing interactivity with the information it presents. While I like the little icons that tell me if I have notifications to take care of, they don’t do anything. If I want to see what they are, I can precisely double tap on the little virtual home button or squeeze the side button of the phone to wake the lock screen. That will at least show me some of their contents. However, if I want to then dive into a notification, with a secure lock screen enabled, Samsung then asks me for another “Swipe screen to open” gesture. Wtf is that? On my Pixel, as notifications roll in, I get a black-and-white preview of them that I can interact with through a single touch. If I miss that happening, a double tap anywhere (not just on a single button) on the screen then brings that UI back, which again, allows me easy interaction. From there, if I want to, I can get into notifications with a double tap (without an extra swipe up) and take care of my business. There are no extra barriers or swipes or precise taps or icons that tell me nothing. And of course Bixby is there. I’m not here to sh*t on Bixby because we don’t even know if it’ll be good or not until it gets voices capabilities, but Samsung, at least give me a toggle to turn it off if I don’t want to use it. That’s it! Keep killing all the legitimate remapping workarounds you want. That doesn’t bother me. But at least let me disable the button, so that accidental presses aren’t firing it up when I don’t want it to. Moving on and into the S8, there are other issues like that “Block Notifications” button that permanently sits right next to the “Clear All” button in the notification shade. Why on Earth is that there? I don’t even know what happens if I press it because it scares the hell out of me. I’m just assuming that if I do, I’ll have to hunt through the 1,027 settings on this phone to unblock the most important software piece of Android. Or what about the app switcher? Have you tried scrolling through it? It jumps from app-to-app by sliding the front-most app half off the screen. It’s impossible to figure out which app the system is trying to highlight or which one you are supposed to be touching. On my Pixel, Google drops down the app you were in (which makes sense because why would you want access to it in the app switcher?) and then lets you control the scroll to decide which app you want. It’s a free scroll from Google, while Samsung put in this jumpy thing that’s too sensitive to swipes and a pain to figure out. What I’m getting at, even if I’m being ridiculously nitpicky and precise, is that Samsung is overthinking all of this. Be advanced in cameras and audio and in the details you provide for battery life. But unlocking a phone shouldn’t take this much effort. I shouldn’t be presented with scary ass “BLOCK ALL THE THINGS” buttons in my notification area at all times. Stop messing with system functions that work fine, like the app switcher and how it scrolls. Don’t force Bixby on me. Give me a damn opt-out if I want. Finally, the Galaxy S8 certainly crushes the Google Pixel in terms of overall design and number of features. I’m not here to deny that at all. But I do have to admit that a part of me wonders how fragile the S8 is. It’s so pretty with all of that glass, that even as water and dust resistant as it is, I worry about drops and banging it on this or that. Not that the Pixel is by any means tough, it’s just that with its traditional bezel amount, my mind is a bit more at ease. Call that a weak excuse, but it’s what I immediately think when looking at the two side-by-side. In the end, when I compare the Galaxy S8 to the Pixel, those software items I mentioned drive me nuts, for sure. But the Pixel also still has a camera that is equally as good as the S8’s, battery life that’s basically on-par, and I know it’ll get updates every single month, along with the bigger software releases without having to wait 5 or 6 or 7 months. Phones these days are so good, that these little things actually make a difference now. They might not have in 2010, where we all just looked forward to the next powerhouse and dealt with the garbage software experience. Now, everyone’s camera is good, as are the performance and battery lives and designs, for the most part. The little things matter. Google’s Pixel gets them right for me. Post navigation Previous StoryPeriscope for Android Now Supports 360° Video Next StoryVerizon’s Wear24 Android Wear Watch Arrives Tomorrow, Here is a First Look at It ATAVU5 Totally agree with your assessment. Nice touch on the disclaimer at the beginning too. Atoqir Well tastes differ. I have nougat on my s6 with all the s8 stock apps except camera and for me it is the most pretty and most functional Android version I ever used. Everything is consistent looking and the addition by Samsung are very good. Also apps are very well optimizes. Chrome is really bad when you have used samsung browser with and adblock and PIP extension. Walka I don’t know why US phone users are obsessed with Google pixel blablabla. I wasted my money on the pixel and had to sell it for cheap. I’m in Africa. The phone looks damn ugly expecially from the front. On the software side it’s just stock Android and the display of ambient notification is just plain stupid compared to other Moto and the 1+3 I currently use. I always missed the ambient display on pixel cos there was no wave gesture ( WTF?). Samsung overdo things , yes, and that’s why the note 4 was my last Sammy phone. But if Google was Korean and Samsung American or any Western, you guys will be hailing the INNOVATION like how the iPhones are overhyped and the pixel wouldn’t have been a match at all. The s8 is the best phone on planet Earth now. Deal with it samster11 Agree 100%. Pixel (XL) is the best phone I’ve ever used. Excellent camera, battery and slick smooth UI. And Samsung continue to fragment the Android area with [email protected] like Bixby. Ryan Batty The GS8 is “the phone of things.” Samsung threw in the kitchen sink, but none of the features for me are must haves. Many of the features I don’t see as enhancing the user experience. The Pixel XL is a great phone that love using day to day. It does stuff without lag, I know I’m going to have the latest and greatest Android has to offer, and the camera is great. I honestly don’t need “stuff and things.” The biggest deal breaker for the S8 is the gimmick known as edge display. No reason for the curves. Keith Champion Scheduling a text is gone. One of my favorite features from Note 5. Cruiserdude I agree with this, nothing beats clean, “stock” Google Android from a performance and usability standpoint, and personally I find the aesthetic much more pleasing and cohesive as well. Ever since my first Android phone, a Samsung Droid Charge, got an experimental build of AOSP Ice Cream Sandwich, I have been hooked. Since then, on every device I have purchased I have immediately removed the manufacturer software and installed an available AOSP based rom of various origins. There was a time when I could choose top of the line hardware that I liked the best, which happened to be the Samsung Galaxy S line, and put something much closer to stock Google Android on it without issue. Since the S4s later updates, this has not been possible with Samsung devices since, and each one has been an increasingly beautiful slab until you unlock it, at which point it’s myriad redundant features, confusing UI, and disappointing performance immediately kill any desire the hardware may have incited. Last year I finally gave up my G3 and got a Nexus 5X, and despite its weaker specs on paper in every way, and numerous reports of slow performance, I have never been happier with a device. Finally I can just pick it up and use it, and it’s already setup exactly how I want it. The comparison to the iPhone is not a bad thing, it’s accurate. Many may not like the fruity device, but its simple, easy to use, almost never lags, provides an optimized, cohesive experience as the manufacturer intended, and is updated immediately to the latest versions. The Pixel only needs to make up ground in product lifespan (Apple devices are 5 years) while staying true to the Android ethos. Here’s hoping for a new Pixel with slimmer bezels, a better battery, and waterproof design by the time my Nexus5X finally kicks it. Major Sceptic Regarding durability of either device in a drop , glass by it’s very nature is always going to be a matter of luck whether it survives or not . I saw a reviewer stand a pixel xl up on a table …….. The device fell over on the perfectly flat table top on its back , not even being dropped but just falling over in its own height , and the glass on the back cracked in a big way . If your silly enough to not have a case or urethane skin on a device with delicate glass on it and drop it ……. well it’s all on you. Jer Having been a huge fan and loved every Note since the Note, it was with plenty of angst I had to move to a Pixel XL. Since then my better half got the S8+, so I have plenty of data to support my opinion. Begin by saying I use every productivity application to its fullest on these devices. I’m not out there tweedle beetling or instasnapping, but I am running a business on G suite, coordinating calendars, projects, tasks and singing /executing contracts while collaborating on all of the above in real time when I’m not in a position to use a laptop or equivalent. I have found that there is no comparison between the raw efficiencies of the Pixel and the lumbering mass of duplicative software on a Samsung. I can’t vouch for how devices compare with respect to many social networking apps, but I can say that for business and productivity the Pixel is remarkably responsive and efficient. There are a few bells and whistles I miss (e.g., scroll capture for easy copy and paste into a proposal is one among them), and I can’t stand the Pixel’s gargantuan bezels, but I’ve used the S8+ enough to decide I’m sticking with the Pixel… At least until the Note 8 arrives when we’ll also know more about the Pixel 2. Lee French Totally agree. I bought the S8 but sent it back after 3 days because my pixel XL was much better to use Arthur My biggest gripe is “Okay Google” not working with screen off on the s8. It really grinds my gears. Doomsday Samsung’s Os is fine. I don’t understand the hate besides the Bixby button. The main feature for me that gravitated me to the s8 versus the pixel is samsung pay. I love it. Kevin M. Great Article!!! As a prior owner of an S7, Note 4 , LG G5 along with my interaction with the S8 I definitely agree with this article. Both phones are great but some people don’t like to hear why someone hasn’t chosen the phone they have but each phone isn’t for everyone. Until getting my Lg G5 I never realized how convenient it was to have the fingerprint scanner on the back middle of the phone …it just feels natural. I think the S8 is a great looking phone and as usual it is feature packed. However every year I bought Samsung it was like a science project. I rooted some to enhance the Samsung bloat/ user experience. I bragged about many features however I realized that I only utilized a few. I was going to buy the note 7 and thought the iris scanner/ face unlock was so cool but after owning my Pixel all I need is my convienant placed fingerprint scanner and voice unlock with “ok Google”. I actually do a lot on my phone and the Google Pixel XL just seems to work well consistently. I never thought I would choose a phone without an SD slot but it has not been missed at all. Water resistance would be my only real complaint but Google user experience has won me over at this point. Jinxed The Samsung S8 is a total disappointment. Upgraded 5 phones in our household to S8’s only to have 2 cracked screens within 2 weeks! Incidental drops of less than 2 feet…thats all it took. Contacted Samsung to have the rep tell me some people have bad luck. Nothing wrong with my luck…they have a new product with defects beyond belief and agreed…the fingerprint scanner is useless! Stick with what you have people! Jon Langevin I’ve had the s8+ since launch, love it. I had trouble with fingerprint reader, but with a cover installed, I find the reader easily now. Also, iris detection works quite well. And I’m guessing you’re not using a smart watch? That can be used for smart lock as well… Douglass Price Owned an iPhone 6 plus 128gb, owned two Note 7’s. Had no choice but to buy a Pixel XL and I was pissed! Turned out to be a blessing in disguise. The Pixel XL is by far the best device I have ever owned. trevorsalienarms Just lol. First rule of comparing products on the internet: anything older and/or more obscure is always better. IP68, SD card, Samsung Pay. Those three features alone are worth more than any OCD based obsession over UI. You had to click a different menu? Oh the humanity. yummy I thought B+xby LIKED being sh*te on? Yeah, Bixby is a super freak, hes super freaky Inajet Same here, I just cannot see my self part with Pixel XL for the s8. I probably will though after the Pixel 2 XL comes out. heldadavid Why can’t Kellen just say it… he doesn’t like the S8. You’re in good company . The S8 is an unfinished , but stunning concept . Pixel and 3T are just better and smoother to use . Eric I love how I said on the DL show that the fingerprint reader on the S8 is in a terrible spot and will ruin the experience compared to the G6 and you guys argued with me. Now you say the same thing I did only with the Pixel instead. Hypocrisy at its best LOL! mac103 The screen edge distortion drives me nuts, that alone is a no buy for me, among all of your other points. Butane87 I agree completely. I have both devices. I use the S8 as my daily driver though simply for Samsung pay and the reward I get for using it. If Google would give me free Best buy gift cards for using Android pay then I’d change in a heartbeat. Brock Dawkins I agree with some parts, but the battery life plus the design of the s8 is just too good. I get zero lag, zero. browsing and watching videos on the s8 with next to no bezels is amazing. You are right about the app switcher though, Jesus. Pixel camera easily beats it too, even though the s8 camera is great and gets the job more than done. Jacob Svonavec My S8+ is cool but had to have the pixel launcher…I prefer stock for sure. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e498a93d9afb871c851f3ffe5e104ebf65cde934e6fa79eceef473179d70edde.png Lakagigar And this is how my Galaxy S8+ is looking with Nova Launcher Prime, DAB Light icon pack (not on Play Store) and Minimal Clock widget: https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B3F_Zi5tyeKCZ2JSMjFnX0NsMXM/view?usp=sharing Gekko Skins and Bloatware and Slow/No OS Updates kills it for me. MicroNix Wow, did you copy that from a 2010 post? Rod Still valid. Rick Yes you are bitching about minor, very minor shit/issues thereasoner They’re both great devices with advantages over the other and the best depending on your preferences. I’m loving my Pixel currently but I’d also love the S8, albeit for different reasons. Lakagigar Well, there are several reasons why the Galaxy S8+ (that i have now) is much better than the Pixel XL. 1. Galaxy S8+ is IP68 certified. 2. Galaxy S8+ does have a MicroSD card support. 3. Galaxy S8+ does have Bluetooth 5.0 that let’s you stream to 2 different Bluetooth devices at the same time. 4. Galaxy S8+ have a 6.2 inch screen while the Pixel XL only have a 5.5 inch screen. The Pixel XL looks like a fat hippo while both phones are in the same size. Galaxy S8+ has 84.0% screen-to-body ratio while the Pixel XL only have 71.2% screen-to-body ratio. 5. Galaxy S8+ have alot of nifty and nice features. Stock Android are way to barebone and boring. 6. Galaxy S8+ has an Iris-scanner and facial recognition. 7. Galaxy S8+ has Dual Pixel autofocus while the Pixel XL have a slow autofocus on the camera compared to the Galaxy S8+. 8. Galaxy S8+ has Gorilla Glass 5 while Pixel XL only have Gorilla GLass 4. 9. Galaxy S8+ has a waaaaay better internal DAC for listening to music via the 3.5mm headphone jack over what the Pixel XL has. 10. Galaxy S8+ has USB 3.1 Type-C while Pixel XL only have USB 3.0 Type-C. 11. Galaxy S8+ does have Samsung DeX (desktop experience support). 12. Galaxy S8+ has Qi/PMA fast wireless charging. 13. Galaxy S8+ has one of the best brightness and sun contrast ratio on the screen. 14. Galaxy S8+ has way better battery life than the Pixel XL, by far. I have pictures of my battery life on my Galaxy S8+ if you need evidence on that. So because of those things, i see no reasons why the Pixel XL would even come close to be as good as the Galaxy S8+ overall. StankyChikin I think that he already said that the S8 is better than the Pixel. Lakagigar Yeah he did. But i at least said why i wouldn’t choose the Pixel XL though 🙂 Douglass Price And the Pixel XL still destroys your phone in terms of operating system and camera, but cool story bro. tnt It doesn’t “destroy” the camera and you know that. And I get the operating system argument, but there’s definitely a counter-argument to be made for getting the bugs/kinks worked out (like bluetooth for example). Rod So, when does it get Android O? billy routh Android O will be just like every other version of Android. Adding features that was already available on a skinned version of Android. James I love Samsung Pay as well, which is why I just had to get at Gear S3 Frontier to go along with my Pixel. StankyChikin Would love to see the Pixel 2 have the G6 form factor. eric messenger This is the same argument that has been made against Samsung for years. Samsung makes great hardware but most of their software is just garbage, over engineered or complete unnecessary and redundant. I know Samsung pay is good and the camera app is good but get rid of everything else. Chris I had an S4 (work) and Nexus 5 (personal) at the same time, and I pretty much decided then that I’d never purchase a Samsung phone for myself if they kept going the same direction with their software. I’ve played with newer models (though not the S8 yet) and I have yet to change my mind. I was pretty upset with Google for the pricing of the Pixel XL, but I simply couldn’t find anything else that was as appealing software-wise. Sure, it’s got enormous bezels and is kind of weird looking, but I generally spend my time using the phone, not critiquing its design. And if an extra few hundred is what it takes to have a phone that doesn’t bend, boot loop, or have a battery that only lasts a year (see Nexus 6P, though mine only had one of those 3 issues), I guess it’s money well spent. SimplytheBest I went from a Nexus 6 to a S8+ (although I’ve been anti-Samsung since the S4) and I’m impressed. My only issue besides being scared to look at it too harshly, lest it shatter into 1000 pieces is that I didn’t get any type of promotional offer having spent nearly $850. I was a week late for the free Gear Vr and a week early for the current Netflix/64 gb memory card promotion and Samsung won’t relent. Therefore I have to return the phone to my carrier, reactivate my Nexus and repurchase the S8+ to be eligible. I’m not asking for a free phone, just something to ease the sting of the price tag. All that aside though the phone is amazing, I used Google Now as a launcher but switched to Nova Prime to recreate the look and feel of the Nexus 6, running stock Android (unlocked and rooted of course) and the S8+ looks and feels nearly identical, although much, much faster and smoother. The fingerprint sensor had me worried at first but having used a large phone like the Nexus has made the transition painless. I’ve registered 4 fingerprints (index and middle on both hands) and it feels almost natural after having the Nexus for so long. If you’re on the fence because of this, don’t let it dissuade you especially if you’re used to a super-sized phone. It’s become easier and easier the more I use it and honestly doesn’t require advanced finger gymnastics. roberthenderson Too expensive Should have a free extended warrant due to last year’s $hit show Not enough camera upgrade for the price Should have front speakers Screen ratio is too extreme (17:9 or even 18:9 would be less jarring) TouchWiz lag will hit within a couple of months & there won’t be a [email protected] thing you can do about it EXCEPT buy their next phone KleenDroid You are uninformed in your statement that there is nothing you can do about lag. Maybe what you meant to say is that there isn’t anything “you” know how to do to fix it. trevorsalienarms Pixel just as costly, but with a ton less features. Angryman82 To each his own. I had so many Bluetooth issues using a Pixel in my Ford that I simply gave up. The S8 is an awesome piece of tech, even with a few short comings. The Bluetooth is flawless. It’s lightning quick. Great battery life. Yeah, the fingerprint sensor sucks, but the iris scanner and facial recognition work fine. IMO, could not go back to a Pixel. Douglass Price It’s not because of the Pixel, it’s because you bought a Ford. Justin Martin Totally agree, and now that I have my LG Watch Sport, it’s the perfect match. I’m set on tech for a while. Defenestratus Funny – I’m the exact opposite. I was 100% on board the nexus train up until the Pixel dropped. For the price they were charging for that phone I just didn’t see the value proposition argument they were trying to make. Assistant was, and still is – a largely useless tool compared to the utility of google now – and the form factor, ridiculously small screensize, lack of key competitor features kept me away from the Pixel. I picked up an S8+ on release day and couldn’t be happier. Whereas my Nexus 6P couldn’t make it through the day without shutting itself down – my S8+ lasts 2 solid days before needing to be charged. The form factor is amazing – and when I pickup a another phone it just feels *old fashioned*. I’ve disabled some of the annoying samsung software features with package disabler and I’ve put the google launcher (not the stupid pixel one) on it so all is good. In the end, unlike on my Nexus 6P – things just *work* on the S8+. I don’t get stupid error messages saying “can’t connect to camera” anymore like I did on my nexus. My phone doesn’t randomly shut down. I get consistently amazing signal and download speeds that are unreal. Finally – I got my FREE Gear VR in the mail yesterday – and while it’s not a huge feature, its cool enough that I’ll be using it for plane trips and such. All in all I couldn’t be more pleased leaving the Google hardware ecosystem. Their software experience is never as smooth and polished as people proclaim it to be – and I’m honestly a bit tired of being a beta tester for Android. I’d rather wait for the bugs to get worked out and QA tested by Verizon for months before my phone is updated – I just want it to work. I realized that I just *didn’t care* about being on the latest version when the Nougat update came out with the fingerprint swipe gesture. I thought I had to have it. Then I got it on my 6P…. and then proceeded to never use it. Just like app shortcuts. Nifty little gimmick but totally not worthwhile sacrificing having a stable software experience to get. MicroNix How refreshing! I’d pit my S7 Edge against any Pixel or Nexus for up time without slow downs or issues. And my BT just works. Every time. I have NEVER experienced a random reboot, a shutdown at 20% battery, etc. This thing is bulletproof. Any time there is an article about a bug fix for a Nexus or Pixel you see everyone come out of the woodwork with their issues but any other article, especially ones that pit the Google phone against Samsung, Nexus/Pixel owners will swear up and down that they don’t experience any of the rampant issues….until the next bug fix article 🙂 trevorsalienarms This x1000. People love to claim that stock Android is this utopian world in which everything is always perfect all the time, but that’s just *not* the case. And as for getting updates first…it will never, ever be as important to me as having a device I actually like looking at and using. Ever. tnt “MY BLUETOOTH ACTUALLY FREAKIN WORKS IN MY CAR” – this alone has kept me away from the Pixel and other stock Android devices and likely won’t be going back any time soon. I would have to completely turn off/on my car to get it working right again when I had the Pixel as it would lock up the entire system – and this was three different Pixels and after a couple of updates that supposedly fixed them. We bitch and moan about carrier and oem delays on Android updates, but carriers and oems make basic functionality work when stock Android can’t. it’s me tim-cock. This article is shark bait for the pure android sharks of whom this site is infested with. Outside of here The difference is astonishing! And it’s not in the favor of the pixel. southerndinner I don’t think so. I like the S8 a lot more than Pixel but I still appreciate articles like this, he had detailed reasons and it was compelling enough to read the whole thing. Kregstrong Bought a Gs8+ on vzw,. Used it for a week, sent it back and back on my pixel XL one of the biggest things that bothered me that I never see mentioned is the scrolling on Galaxy phones, I think they tried to copy iPhone or something cause it just keeps gliding and most the time it semi chops, pixel has a nice brake in scrolling that I love, not sure why but that’s one of my biggest problems, and the unlock thing droidbeat Bravo! Well said. Matthew Yes, Kellex. I’m 100% with you Google makes the best version of Android. I had a S7 edge for about a week and went absolutely crazy with the TouchWiz OS. Why does Samsung feel the need to create every app that Google already has? Samsung pay = Google pay, Bixie = Google Assistant, Samsung messenger = Google messenger the list goes on and on… Development tools did not work properly on TouchWiz either, I use Bluetooth in the car a lot and the absolute Volume notification is a PITA! Most Android phones you can disable this feature by the simple click in development tools. But not on Samsung, the S7 totally ignored this feature and wouldn’t stick between reboots. Give me AOSP or give me death. Turb0wned Samsung pay does not equal “Google pay.” Samsung pay is by far the best model payment system in the world. Matthew Meh, I don’t use any NFC payment from my phone. Would rather have the protection from my actual card, read your terms and agreement most don’t coverage fraud if a third party app/system is used, plus I get 1% cash back on everything with my card and if I used Google pay or Samsung pay I don’t get this either. 0 for 2 luis yunda I get my 3x points on my chase card when I use Samsung Pay on the vending machines. PoisonApple31 Then problem lies with your card, not Samsung Pay. mcdonsco Really looking forward to the next pixel and I hear it’s supposed to be released earlier than last year’s so before October? David Wanless I went from a Nexus 6P to an S8, I really don’t know what the fuss is all about with the fingerprint reader. I now move my finger slightly more to the left… it’s still just as easy to use. Turb0wned Samsung Haters find anything at all to cry about. They became worst than the hardcore iPhone users. 30014 Pixel Haters find anything at all to cry about. They became worst than the hardcore iPhone users. There, fixed it for you. Defenestratus I went from the 6P to the S8+ and the fingerprint reader issue is only a problem for people who use a different phone every week. Within the first few tries my muscle memory had figured out where it was. Brian M Gray i wish the s8+ could be used on project fi Alex S I totally made a reddit post that featured the SAME complaint about the lock screen! How did they think it was passable to stick in a BLANK SCREEN that just says “swipe to unlock”. Samsung has come a long way but geezus if they aren’t dumb about UX sometimes. Defenestratus just turn off the always on screen. Bam. Fixed. Turb0wned Boy, if Samsung would have made a phone with no ip68, no SD Card, ugly design, no wireless charging, huge pointless bezels droidlife would have murdered them. If Apple didn’t have ip67 but the Pixel did, people would have murdered the iPhone. It’s all ok though, the Pixel gets a pass. Gjorgi Lazarovski Because Google did good with the software and the camera. Sometimes hardware just doesn’t matter if you want a great UX. The iPhone and the Pixel are a proof of that. Their hardware is downright boring compared to other phones out there. MicroNix Its the same story every year. No matter how ugly or problematic the Google phone may be, it always wins over Samsung at DL. Tim-o-tato Not for everyone here. I’m S8 > Pixel all day at this point. StankyChikin Form over Function FTW!!! cadtek91 Sure Samsung can do good hardware (worthwhile hardware now that the hardware navigation is gone) but they still cannot get the software right. Robert Schuman I seriously considered the G6 and the S8, but ended up sticking with my Pixel for pretty much the same reasons. OU812 Moto Z Play FTW! Steve Yobs yup! the best all around phone. camera is not a big deal for me coldcc Ha ha I sold my brother the Pixel XL to get the s8+. A week later he’s at a pool party got pushed in and bam RIP Pixel XL. He then realized why I said in these days why the hell didn’t Google make this damn Pixel water proof(resistant if you want to be literal). Rimtu Kahn Yes yes heard it before… a Samsung flagship is the best phone going but. It does everything right but small problem of being drastically slower than other flagships. It’s super fast but has slight annoying lags at times. It is only phone with smart pen that works but it blows up occasionally. Thanks reviewer for giving another braindead nonsensical review. Addison Seriously, “braindead”? “Nonsensical”? Have you read your comment? it’s me tim-cock. What an idiot. seattle tech The smart lock and iris mixed with fingerprint was causing issues. Turn it all off and just use fingerprint for a few days while remembering the location is around 11pm on the phone. Now it is second nature to me. Nova Launcher Orion I totally agree with all your points. Stock Android is the best by far. But this year I may change it up. I have a N6 and I just can’t go to a smaller screen. Note 8 is at the top of the list as of right now. Hopefully the rumors of Google making a third and even larger phone are true. I truly don’t want to leave stock… Google do something! Lol Orlando aka Pixel XL I downloaded pixel launcher, disabled samsung apps and I am loving life including my great better life…Overall, I have no regret at all with my decision buying the s8+ and I really like how light it is… CDavisyo I couldn’t agree more. Biometrics is a mess. I just wish the Bluetooth didn’t suck so badly on the pixel. Still a much better overall experience for me. Eric The Pixel is the phone I always wanted, but never got the opportunity to buy due to supply. I was ready to jump on it after returning my second Note 7, but it was out of stock then. I then moved on to other devices (phone whore), regularly keeping an eye on Pixel stock to get in on it. However, time passed and at this point, I just can’t justify paying full price for a phone that is now over 6 months old and buying used doesn’t interest me. Good_Ole_Pinocchio I actually like the AOD because it looks good lol, especially with some color on my clock. They should add a raise to waake though, or an option for the AOD to display for a short period of time when a new new notification comes in…. AND steal the Moto way of previewing Notifications… Then I’d be perfect Kellex B It does look pretty, but it needs some interactivity with icons and stuff that isn’t double tapping on mini icons and requiring extra swipes. Because it does look the best of all implementations. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Off Topic: I find it weird that people in the Facebook comments come read the article…then go back to comment on Facebook lol. Kellex B Honestly, never look at the FB comments. Maybe we should! Bane✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ The fingerprint scanner has no impact on me. I don’t use a secure lock screen. With the home button showing, I get double-tap-to-wake, the only thing missing for me on previous Samsung phones. Also, with adhell, I have an adblocking solution that I used to only be able to get with root and Adaway. I have a Pixel XL and I miss lift-to-wake and I agree on some of the software annoyances, but I still think the GS8 is the superior phone. Better screen, Samsung Pay, better ram management (barely). They are both great phones, but I won’t be putting my GS8+ down any time soon. At least not until Android O is released. JSo I was really close to getting an S8. But I think I’m just going to continue to wait for the next Pixel. The Android Beta program will help me get through the summer on my Nexus 5X Mr Mofo I’m still on my 6p and haven’t seen a phone compelling enough to jump ship. The One Plus 5 looks interesting Richter Atmosphere I think it’s interesting that Kellen and Tim named the OnePlus 3/T phone of the year, but they don’t seem to be using it anymore. Seems like they mention they use the Pixel more as daily drivers. I wasn’t one of the people who were upset that OnePlus won phone of the year. I’m just making an observation. Kellex B Have no regrets on that decision at all. Combination of software, hardware, and value there isn’t beat by anyone. But the camera on the Pixel is better (and I take a lot of photos) and I happen to own one or two, since I kind of need to for work heh. Might as well. NooSH i agree , despite the pixels flaws, at the end of the day it’s the software that the user interacts with the most , not the hardware.. and google own software on the pixels is unparalleled in user experience. Kellex B In a way, it’s like how iPhone users for years have said, “It just works.” I sort of feel that way about the Pixel. Justin Martin Totally agree Julian Coronado So as someone who is probably going to upgrade my smartphone in the next month, should I choose the S8 or Pixel? I know the Galaxy is brand new and my god the display is gorgeous, but I can’t get the Pixel experience out of my mind because it seems SO fluid coming from Google. I just hate how the Pixel is so expensive. But I really want it. Patrick Smithopolis Get the OnePlus 5. I think it’s being released next month. Kellex B That’s a tough call. New Pixel will be 5 months from now, but there is a OnePlus phone coming soon. And honestly, the S8 is a hell of a phone, it just has a bunch of little things that drive me nuts vs. the Pixel and its simpler approach. Alex S Moto Z Play! I bought that, then I’m gonna see what the offerings are like in a few months. Douglass Price Best phone I have ever owned. Suicide_Note The S8 is a better looking phone than the Pixel by a wife margin. No doubt about that. However, for me, the software trumps design, and Google nails it while Samsung can’t seem to get it quite right, even after all this time, such is why i stayed with my XL and didn’t grab an S8+. tnt Wife margin – I believe that’s a typo, but has some good buried meaning somewhere in there… 😉 Bane✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I guess it depends on how big your wife is. DanG very wide…lol Buck Well in that case, I’ll just keep on using my old one plus 3! Kellex B Not a bad idea at all! tztex I tried S8 for a half day and went back to my op3t. The fingerprint placement is so so bad that until you try it, you don’t realize how bad it is. Yea, I could use facial recognition, but that won’t help with my home security, bank, etc., that all use a fingerprint. That is a big miss in my opinion. To me, the main feature that impacts the majority of users is the awesomeness of the Samsung camera. The water resistant IP68 or whatever is a feature that vast majority of people care a less about, but it is a great Marketing gimmick. I went to Spurs game last night with someone who had S7 and was embarrassed about the quality of my pictures. Yes, we can nick pick all the geek stats, but the camera is the differentiator to the average bear, as it sure isn’t the bloated software. Maybe I have been running stock like ROMS for too long, but the amount of crap that immediately downloads is ridiculous. Oh and throw in a useless button for Bixby. Yes, it can be remapped but more hardware buttons in 2017….. The moved to the Apple model beginning with S4 and the company has done well. Kellex B MANU! Little turn back the clock action last night. Jealous you were there. Actually l like bezels Does facial recognition have its own secure enclave? joshua p. All good points…S8 plus screen and Samsung pay got me. Aaron T To each his own. I think you’re spot on with most of these complaint except always on display. Thing is, I could write just as lengthy a post on the things Samsung seems to do better than stock Android. For instance: closing all recent applications, why on stock do I have to scroll through all the open apps to get to “close all”? Why is there no battery percentage in the status bar without swiping down. Yes I know about the janky hard to see developer option. Why have to swipe down again to change brightness. Samsung let’s you put it there on 1 swipe. Stock finally has split window multi tasking but still prefer Samsung’s take on it with usability. On my pixel I couldn’t directly take a video without swiping the viewfinder. S8 is by no means perfect but it’s both better and worse just in different areas. Suicide_Note I have battery percentage in the status bar on my XL. No root, custom ROM, or flashing anything required. Kellex B 100% spot on with those complaints too heh. In fact, those thing drives me nuts about the Pixel as well, I guess just not as much as the Samsung stuff. Chris I literally never close all my recent applications. Why would you? It just means that they’re slower to start the next time, and it decreases your battery life because they have to load from scratch. Android manages running apps just fine. Let it. Also, you can swipe down with two fingers instead of swiping down twice. JoYu Closing Recent Apps – Shouldn’t need to do this as Chris says. With Samsung you may need to because of their tweaks. Brightness – Samsung sucks with auto brightness so you need easy access. Battery percentage – 100% agree. Split window – Do people use this on a phone, everything is so small 🙁 I will try it on my Wife’s Sammy later. Sounds like you like Samsung’s way of doing things, I prefer stock. But keep rocking the Samsung. Have fun! bobukcat Now if Motolovo would just make an unlocked flagship phone that isn’t so damned ugly I’d gladly go back to them. Suicide_Note Yeah, that’s not happening. Lenovo buying Moto was the penultimate nail in the coffin. Kellex B Moto is too busy ruining the Moto Z Play for round 2 by killing its best feature, battery life. bobukcat What can I say, I’m a dreamer! Jared Gauthier I wholeheartedly agree with this. While the S8 destroys the Pixel in terms of design, I spend my time actually using the phone and OS rather than staring at the shell. The overall user experience on the Pixel is better. That’s where it really counts (to me). Suicide_Note http://gif-finder.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Leonardo-DiCaprio-Cheers.gif BSweetness Same for me. After using the S8+ for a week, I got rid of it and went back to the Pixel XL. atl3630 Same here. My s8 plus is going back to Costco in the morning Major Sceptic We all like what we like , I’m not a pixel fan , but I do have a 6p ,g5, Galaxy note , and they all bring something to the table I like . The new trendy tall narrow form of the s8 and g6 does nothing for me though , I’m sure I could get used to it , be but I’d rather a full sized phone (g5 was my first littleun …… And last). Paul Hansen Bring back google play editions and omg the S8/S8+ would be utter magic. Don’t think Kellen would argue with me here 🙂 Jared Gauthier Except Samsung would still be in charge up the software. Even though it would be soft. They certainly wouldn’t optimize it like Google does with the Pixel. CapnShiner Then get the unlocked version, root it, and put an AOSP ROM on it. Josh LaCelle I’ll keep my Samsung S8 plus with superior battery life and design over the outdated Pixel. Suicide_Note Don’t forget to mention the outdated software you have on your S8+. Battery life is a wash between the two phones, though the S8 kills the Pixel in the design department. Josh LaCelle Hardly outdated… Pixel software is boring. Only thing going for pure Android is smoothness and speed. And it is not that much of a difference to get an outdated device for it. Kellex B Just curious, but what is it specifically about Samsung’s software you prefer? (Serious question too, not being a d*ck) Josh LaCelle Did I say I liked Samsung’s software? I just said pure Android is boring. But that is just my opinion. I like Samsung because they are the only ones offering the complete package right now – great battery, awesome camera, expandable storage, best display on any phone, Samsung Pay, and IP68. Those things trump the slight improvement in performance from a pure Android (ie. pixel) phone. Richard-Dina Bullard Don’t you drop it Zac S samsung pay >>>>>>>>>>> that alone is why I can’t convince myself to get any other type of phone it’s me tim-cock. Samsung pay>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>android pay any day. Plus there’s a bunch of Samsung app that I prefer and find more superior to Google’s. Performance and smoothness is a wash. calvin35 Samsung Pay, the Samsung browser, which in my opinion has the best UI of any browser, and the display are the main reasons why I only buy Samsung phones. Samsung pay is the main one though, I’ll never buy a phone that doesn’t have MST. I can’t imagine having to pull out my wallet every time I want to pay for something again. Android pay is completely inferior. MicroNix Samsung makes phones with features that people can use in their every day lives. Samsung Pay, Samsung Health (unless you live in a basement and don’t take care of yourself), themes to match any occasion, best displays, great battery life and yeah, you can use it around water without fear. I’ll admit, my S7 Edge only has the April security patch on it, but I absolutely like the way they wait before a patch goes out. After seeing what quick updates do to Nexus and Pixel phones sometimes, it makes me glad Samsung isn’t reckless like Google sometimes is and just shove something out there for the sake of keeping a schedule. southerndinner Not having Samsung Pay is a Pixel deal breaker for me. It’s so, so much better than Android Pay Justin Martin How is it better, seriously asking? I never used it, and I can’t imagine how different it could be? twiz0r because with MST you can use your phone to pay ALMOST everywhere you can swipe a card. I love it when someone says “oh we don’t have that here”….and then MAJIK – the look on people’s faces is priceless every….single…..time….. tnt You can use Samsung Pay at a normal debit/credit card reader thanks to MST: http://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00043865/ EP_2012 And if you watch the Phone buff speed tests the Pixel isn’t even a contender. Smoke and mirrors. Rod “Only thing” LOL roberthenderson Lemme know how that TouchWiz lag works out for you after a couple of months. My Nexus 6p camera (& all apps) still open without hesitation Matthew My Nexus 6 Shamu was snappier than the S7 edge. Lakagigar TouchWiz doesn’t exists anylonger as a UI or UX. When the Galaxy S7 phones got the Android 7.0 update, they got the Grace UX. Same with the Galaxy S6 phones later. So there was Grace UX up until Galaxy S8 and S8+ came out that has Samsung Experience. The only thing left with the TouchWiz name is the TouchWiz launcher itself. Duffman Who cares what it called when it sucks? Lakagigar It’s far far away from being bad. Samsung Experience on the Galaxy S8 and S8+ is actually one of the best UI / UX out there now between the different brands. Samsung have gone from mediocre UI / UX over to be the best at that now. steb0ne Tell that to the people on XDA and Reddit threads complaining about it lol! cadtek91 Changing the name doesn’t mean anything. Jon Langevin My Nexus 6 got laggy as well after 6 months… Douglass Price I’ll put my 6 month old Pixel XL up against your S8 plus any day of the week. Good_Ole_Pinocchio I agree 100% with the app switcher, they broke it. And even the double tap the switch button isn’t as smooth as any other device I’ve used this year (not just the pixel)…. I really Agee with most of what you’re saying…but for a sensible amout of storage the S8 is 100$ less than a pixel…without the latest hardware, most importantly zero IP rating. I thought about it but I just couldn’t justify it right now. I’ll put up with Samsung and the upsides if the S8 until the fall because it’s simply a cheaper buyin right now. Then I’ll wait for an IP68 Pixel from Google. Kellex B I should almost add a note to the post that says, “I’m still using the Pixel…until I run out of storage in a week.” Good_Ole_Pinocchio You have a 32GB? lol I couldn’t last 6 months with that Kellex B Yep 32GB. used 19 of 29GB. 😐 Suicide_Note I’m assuming there’s a lot of space that could be freed up by having Google Photos delete the pics and vids you have already safely backed up. Kellex B And kids games heh. tnt Kellen, where does the G6 fit into this for you? Also, you’re spot on with the unlocking experience on the S8. It simply takes too much thought now as opposed to be thoughtless before… Patrick Smithopolis I think you can infer where it fits in by the fact that he’s using the Pixel. tnt Definitely, just wanted some additional thoughts on it 🙂 Kellex B I like the G6 still too. Slow camera and the finicky fingerprint reader/power button bugged me. But I may take it for a fresh spin here in a bit, now that the S8 review is done and see if thoughts have changed. RazorSky After going Pixel, I can honestly say I don’t think I’ll ever go back to Samsung again. I don’t even care if the battery is better and the camera is better, I think the raw software of the pixel is perfect. I used to use Swiftkey and Textra and all of the awesome 3P stuff because Samsung sucked so bad. Now I use Gboard and Google Messenger because it is as good, but with faster performance. I came from a GS5>GS6 so maybe they jaded me against them. MadJoe I’d agree, and I see why you think so because you have a Pixel in hand, but because Google keeps playing games with the availability of a phone that’s over 6 months old they can go f’ themselves wrt the Pixel as far as I’m concerned. I don’t play artificial scarcity, and any thinking person wouldn’t either. Not with Apple, and certainly not with Google. Have enough for me to buy it when I want it, or shove it where the sun don’t shine. Kellex B I actually wonder if Google just doesn’t have enough pull in the supply chain for parts to be able to make enough phones. Report not long ago suggested their issue has been getting enough AMOLED panels. Either way, they screwed up. Pixel availability has been a disaster. MadJoe I wish I could believe that, but Google is just too flipping big and has all the resources in the world to get what they need. If there’s a holdup in the supply chain, it’s Google’s own fault for letting it happen in my opinion. Kellex B Could very well be. But consider that we may be overestimating their pull in phone manufacturing and/or wireless. Carriers still pass on them and their phones, even though they are Google. Audio This has been an issue since the Nexus 4 so there’s really no excuse anymore ck125 Google sucks with phones. It has been this way every time they try with a phone. Google has little pull with manufacturing because they are a services company first and a little hardware manufacturer second. Patrick Smithopolis Ever since I bought the Nexus 4 years ago I’ve always had a preference for phones that are close to stock. The S8 is just not for me. Sirx IDC what anyone says, Get-off-my-lawn Kellen = Best Kellen. Kellex B I may be in my 30s, but I’m a 75-year old grumpy ass at heart. Sirx Nothing wrong with yelling at (Samsung) clouds 😉 Guest Meh after customer service issues with Google (Nexus 6p and Pixels have defects, Pixel 128 GB stock) Crappy Samsung software experience (Updates, notification shade lag/buggy Always on Display, etc) The unimpressive soc Snapdragon 835 *at least on the Samsung S8+ I wonder what phone should come Q4 2017 Kellex B OnePlus’ next phone? bobukcat If I had been able to actually BUY a Pixel in the many months of trying I wouldn’t have needed to buy the S8 but Google and HTC can’t figure out the supply chain! Kellex B Yeah, that whole debacle about buying a Pixel has been something. Google seemed like they had a phone people wanted to buy for once, and they screwed up big time. DanG If they figured it out, maybe they could dethrone iPhone as the best selling smartphone? bose301s I really don’t like the curved screen, Pixel wins for me on that alone, throw in the quick updates etc and it’s not even that hard of a decision. Daniel Garcia Ohh Garmin Connect. I wonder if Kellex will be my friend? Kellex B Been on it for over a year and don’t think I have any Garmin friends yet. 🙁 alex drum https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rW9wdUcBMyE Ryan N Me reading the first sentence. https://media4.giphy.com/media/xSM46ernAUN3y/200w_s.gif Rajarshi Ghosh Pixel can be better than S8 in quite a few ways but people need to get into that to decide. Bezels come in the way. S8 takes the cake. Klaus T Please join me in a moment of silence for our soon-to-be-departed author. alex drum BRACE FOR IMPACT. Kellex B Lot of Pixel users around here I think. I may survive. Ryan N We got your back if sh*t goes down. Ha Michael Bassett What’s that ugly, huge bezel phone on the right? Kellex B Hah, right? mcdonsco And….we’re off! daJudge805 Oh boy. You done did it now. Kellex B ¯_(ツ)_/¯ We get asked a lot which phone we are using and why. This is why I’m using the Pixel. MicroNix This article is the same every year. Google phone wins, everything else loses. Its a default at DL that IMHO will never change. Paul Hansen There goes your opportunity at future review units 😛 Chilly O Shots fired!! Lucky Armpit I wouldn’t say “he’s done it now”. Anyone that gets upset at someone else because they like one inanimate object over another needs their head examined. I keep coming back here because of the unfiltered and unbiased reviews. Kellen stated his opinion that while he thinks the S8 is beautiful and well-executed, it’s just not for him as a daily driver. It’s an honest opinion, and if people don’t like it, there are plenty of other biased sites they can go read (I’m looking at you, BGR). I switched from a Nexus 6 to the S8. Are there things about stock Android I miss? Well, sure, but nothing that’s got me wanting to return the S8. And just because Kellen’s opinion is different than mine doesn’t make either one of us wrong. JBz007 I came from the Pixel XL and I enjoy the S8+ more in pretty much every way. People keep saying the Pixel is better but I just don’t see it. But different strokes for different folks. WRX I just can’t figure it out. Personally, I get a better signal, the apps are just as fast if not faster and I’ve gotten so use to the S 8 fingerprint sensor that I no longer have any trouble finding it. Some of those fast updates on my pixel actually made it worse for my personal use. Different strokes I guess. P. S. – I had terrible keyboard lag out of the box with my pixel Douglass Price You downgraded.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Features Androids in an Apple Land Features Androids in an Apple Land By Sameer Kotian - May 10, 2017 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet Ever feel like Androids are the “relative nobody talks about”? Granted, the Google search results are on par with Apple. The reality is the media darling has been and continues to be Apple. Phones are like automobiles. Once someone develops brand loyalty, be it to Apple or Android, they stay. Chances are, your Mom or Dad was a loyal Ford, General Motors, or Chrysler supporter. For decades. For the loyal Android customers, let’s take a short trip down memory lane. Once we have done that, a look will be taken at some of the latest apps that have received positive reviews. We will close with some insight into the creation of these apps. Historical Recap Android began its rise to prominence in 2005, when it was acquired by Google. In 2007, 5 months after Apple launched the iPhone, Android made the move from practical obscurity to national recognition. In those formidable early years, Google, and Android developers had a closet full of close to 100 different style phones, and they were developing software 1 phone at a time. A tedious process that would bear fruit in time. Look at where Android has landed today. The countless models that have been released. Take into consideration the fact that close to 1 billion Android devices have been sold. If that is not convincing enough, how about 1.5 million Android devices are activated daily. A Sampling of the Latest Android Apps Now, let’s fast-forward to 2017. Android apps come out on a daily basis. The market is flooded with them. Sorting through the sea of apps is a time-consuming process, better left to those with experience and knowledge. Joe Hindy is the “Android Authority app guy”, and he reviewed some of the best Android apps to be launched for April of 2017. Here is a sampling of them: – Microsoft To Do Need some help staying organized and tired of carrying around sheets of paper with your daily to-do list? To Do is the latest app offered up by Microsoft, and it’s simple in design and use. Even better, it syncs up between your PC and Android device – Podcast Go If you enjoy listening to a podcast from time to time, Podcast Go is a simple app to download and use. You will find a collection of over 300,000 podcasts available from various genres. The only potential drawback that one may experience is the presence of advertisements Creation of Apps The effort necessary to create and launch a new app is often taken for granted. What many fail to realize is the collaboration necessary between developers and operations personnel to make for a smooth process. The term DevOps is misunderstood by some. The purpose behind this “design” is to enable the development team to become self-sufficient, thereby improving the app creation process. What is certain is that industry leaders utilize popular DevOps tools to eliminate needless backtracking. It will be interesting to follow the competition between Apple and Android. As the Android apps flow out daily, remember the necessary effort put forth by the development teams to make our lives easier.

AUTOMATION DATA INFRASTRUCTURE INTERNET TRANSPORTATION PERSPECTIVES INSIGHTS GOVTECH.COM FutureStructure_Grey FutureStructure Self-Driving Startup Aurora Will Focus On Software, Not Hardware Aurora will develop a self-driving system that can work with cars from a number of companies. by David R. Baker, San Francisco Chronicle / May 10, 2017 Twitter/AINSweden (TNS) -- Few startups start out with the pedigree of Aurora Innovation. The self-driving car company’s founders are considered among the best engineers in their fast-growing field. Chris Urmson used to lead Google’s groundbreaking autonomous vehicle project, now known as Waymo. Sterling Anderson shepherded Tesla’s Autopilot system — which can steer cars at freeway speed — to its release in 2015. Machine-learning expert Drew Bagnell was one of the key engineers in Uber’s self-driving effort. RELATEDNew Tech Gives Aurora, Colo., Most Accurate Homeless Count YetAurora Innovation Joins Pittsburgh's Self-Driving Tech Industry They quietly formed Aurora in December and at first kept details of their venture under wraps. Tidbits of information, however, emerged when Tesla sued Aurora in January, accusing Anderson of stealing confidential data and encouraging other Tesla engineers to jump ship. Anderson called the suit meritless and said he stole nothing. That suit is behind them, after Tesla and Aurora reached a settlement last month with no admission of wrongdoing. The startup is now opening up about its plans. Aurora will develop a self-driving system that can work with cars from a number of companies, Urmson and Anderson say. The focus will be on software rather than hardware, although Aurora may work with partner firms to improve the sensors that autonomous vehicles need to see the world around them. The idea is to get self-driving cars on the road quickly, working in partnership with traditional automakers rather than designing and building cars from scratch. The young company has already had discussions with some automakers, Urmson said. “Having a technology is not particularly interesting if it’s not out there being used,” he said, in an interview at the company’s spartan Palo Alto headquarters. “We think we have some of the world’s best people and have some very good ideas about how to solve the driving part of it. We’d love to marry that up with people who really understand what it takes to build and ship vehicles.” Unlike some in the tech industry who consider the major automakers too slow, Urmson has great respect for car companies and their ability to build good, complicated products at a massive scale. “People talk about Silicon Valley and complexity and innovation,” he said. “Well, these guys are churning out this thing that comes off the line once every two minutes and runs for 15 years.” As the former head of Tesla’s Autopilot program, Anderson already has experience developing a technology, integrating it into cars and getting it into drivers’ hands. But he argues that he can have a wider impact with Aurora than with his former employer. “It was clear that a lot of the rest of the industry was not coming along as quickly as I would have liked,” Anderson said. “So this was about finding a way to accelerate that.” Aurora joins a crowded field of companies — global automakers and small startups alike — trying to perfect autonomous vehicles. And yet, while most of the public attention has focused on a few prominent names, such as Google and Uber, no one truly dominates the market, said Douglas Schmidt, associate chairman of computer science and engineering at Vanderbilt University. “It’s not like you’re trying to go in there and knock off an incumbent with an installed base,” he said. In addition, venture capitalists are eager to invest money in the field, Schmidt said. “This is a time to strike out on your own, because there’s a lot of potential upside and not much downside,” he said. Aurora has about $6 million in private funding and plans to raise its first round of venture backing soon, Urmson said. The company occupies a modest space next door to the General Motors Advanced Technology Silicon Valley Office off El Camino Real. (That’s a coincidence, Urmson said. It was the only available building Aurora could find in the area that had both office space and a garage.) More than most fields, autonomous vehicle research in the last decade has revolved around a relatively small clutch of talented engineers whose paths have often crossed. That’s certainly true for Anderson, Urmson and Bagnell. All three earned doctorates in robotics from powerhouse engineering schools: Carnegie Mellon University for Bagnell and Urmson, Massachusetts Institute of Technology for Anderson. Bagnell and Urmson collaborated on Carnegie Mellon’s team for the 2007 DARPA Urban Challenge, a robot-car race sponsored by a wing of the U.S. military. Urmson thought highly enough of Anderson’s work that he had him address the Google self-driving team while Anderson was still at MIT. Although Urmson counts his time at Google as “the best seven years of my life,” he decided last year that it was time for something new. He quit Google in August and spent several months talking to venture capitalists and others, trying to figure out his next step. When he decided to form a self-driving startup, Anderson was a logical partner. “I had a lot of respect for the work that was going on at Tesla, and I thought, hey, if I was going to go start something, and it was going to be in self-driving cars, wouldn’t it be great to have someone who seems like a great person and has experience actually launching stuff?” Urmson said. “There’s only a small group of people who have really carried this stuff for a long time, before it got very trendy and VC money was being thrown at it,” he said. Aurora has not yet started testing its system on public roads, but it has equipped a few Audi Q7s with sensors to gather data. The company does not want to get too tied to any one car or brand, however. “It’s important to us, for our own development, that the platform we’re building not be over-fit to one particular make or model,” Anderson said. While they want some flexibility in the system, Anderson and Urmson say their ultimate product will probably require a standard set of sensors and computing power. It will be up to automakers to integrate that into their vehicles. The race to develop self-driving cars has placed traditional automakers in an odd position. Many have in-house research programs working on autonomous vehicles. At the same time, they are forging partnerships with outside firms — many in the Bay Area — developing their own versions of the technology. And while each company, large and small, has its own software twists, all are writing programs to do essentially the same jobs — accurately perceive the world around the car and, based on that information, decide what to do next. So will each automaker eventually offer its own version of the same basic technology? Or will one system prove so superior that all others will fall away, with every car company leasing it? “We expect that there will be a handful of solutions, but probably not more than that,” Urmson said. ©2017 the San Francisco Chronicle Distributed by Tribune Content Agency, LLC.

image/svg+xml MAGAZINE EVENTS PAPERS TOPICS GOVTECH 100 NAVIGATOR SEARCH Data Why Big-Data Analysis of Police Activity is Inherently Biased A useful outcome depends not only on good mathematical analysis: It also needs good data. That’s where predictive policing often falls short. by William Isaac, Michigan State University and Andi Dixon, Columbia University / May 10, 2017 How does bad data affect predictive policing algorithms? Shutterstock In early 2017, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced a new initiative in the city’s ongoing battle with violent crime. The most common solutions to this sort of problem involve hiring more police officers or working more closely with community members. But Emanuel declared that the Chicago Police Department would expand its use of software, enabling what is called “predictive policing,” particularly in neighborhoods on the city’s south side. The Chicago police will use data and computer analysis to identify neighborhoods that are more likely to experience violent crime, assigning additional police patrols in those areas. In addition, the software will identify individual people who are expected to become – but have yet to be – victims or perpetrators of violent crimes. Officers may even be assigned to visit those people to warn them against committing a violent crime. Any attempt to curb the alarming rate of homicides in Chicago is laudable. But the city’s new effort seems to ignore evidence, including recent research from members of our policing study team at the Human Rights Data Analysis Group, that predictive policing tools reinforce, rather than reimagine, existing police practices. Their expanded use could lead to further targeting of communities or people of color. Working with available data RELATEDKeeping Bias Out of Big Data (And Other Key Considerations)Making Big Data Accessible Through Interactive VisualizationsTroopers Use ‘Big Data’ to Predict Crash Sites At its core, any predictive model or algorithm is a combination of data and a statistical process that seeks to identify patterns in the numbers. This can include looking at police data in hopes of learning about crime trends or recidivism. But a useful outcome depends not only on good mathematical analysis: It also needs good data. That’s where predictive policing often falls short. Machine-learning algorithms learn to make predictions by analyzing patterns in an initial training data set and then look for similar patterns in new data as they come in. If they learn the wrong signals from the data, the subsequent analysis will be lacking. This happened with a Google initiative called “Flu Trends,” which was launched in 2008 in hopes of using information about people’s online searches to spot disease outbreaks. Google’s systems would monitor users’ searches and identify locations where many people were researching various flu symptoms. In those places, the program would alert public health authorities that more people were about to come down with the flu. But the project failed to account for the potential for periodic changes in Google’s own search algorithm. In an early 2012 update, Google modified its search tool to suggest a diagnosis when users searched for terms like “cough” or “fever.” On its own, this change increased the number of searches for flu-related terms. But Google Flu Trends interpreted the data as predicting a flu outbreak twice as big as federal public health officials expected and far larger than what actually happened. Criminal justice data are biased The failure of the Google Flu Trends system was a result of one kind of flawed data – information biased by factors other than what was being measured. It’s much harder to identify bias in criminal justice prediction models. In part, this is because police data aren’t collected uniformly, and in part it’s because what data police track reflect longstanding institutional biases along income, race and gender lines. While police data often are described as representing “crime,” that’s not quite accurate. Crime itself is a largely hidden social phenomenon that happens anywhere a person violates a law. What are called “crime data” usually tabulate specific events that aren’t necessarily lawbreaking – like a 911 call – or that are influenced by existing police priorities, like arrests of people suspected of particular types of crime, or reports of incidents seen when patrolling a particular neighborhood. Neighborhoods with lots of police calls aren’t necessarily the same places the most crime is happening. They are, rather, where the most police attention is – though where that attention focuses can often be biased by gender and racial factors. It’s not possible to remove the bias Some researchers have argued that machine learning algorithms can address systemic biases by designing “neutral” models that don’t take into account sensitive variables like race or gender. But while it may seem possible in hypothetical situations, it doesn’t appear to be the case in real life. Our recent study, by Human Rights Data Analysis Group’s Kristian Lum and William Isaac, found that predictive policing vendor PredPol’s purportedly race-neutral algorithm targeted black neighborhoods at roughly twice the rate of white neighborhoods when trained on historical drug crime data from Oakland, California. We found similar results when analyzing the data by income group, with low-income communities targeted at disproportionately higher rates compared to high-income neighborhoods. But estimates – created from public health surveys and population models – suggest illicit drug use in Oakland is roughly equal across racial and income groups. If the algorithm were truly race-neutral, it would spread drug-fighting police attention evenly across the city. Similar evidence of racial bias was found by ProPublica’s investigative reporters when they looked at COMPAS, an algorithm predicting a person’s risk of committing a crime, used in bail and sentencing decisions in Broward County, Florida, and elsewhere around the country. These systems learn only what they are presented with; if those data are biased, their learning can’t help but be biased too. Fixing this problem is not a matter of just doing more advanced mathematical or statistical calculations. Rather, it will require rethinking how police agencies collect and analyze data, and how they train their staff to use data on the job. Understanding the biases to improve the data Using predictive analytics in the real world is challenging, particularly when trying to craft government policies to minimize harm to vulnerable populations. We do not believe that police departments should stop using analytics or data-driven approaches to reducing crime. Rather, police should work to understand the biases and limitations inherent in their data. In our view, police departments – and all agencies that use predictive algorithms – should make their systems transparent to public scrutiny. This should start with community members and police departments discussing policing priorities and measures of police performance. That way any software the police use can be programmed to reflect the community’s values and concerns. Ensuring transparency It is not enough to claim or assume an algorithm is unbiased just because it is computerized and uses data: A lack of bias must be proven by evaluating the algorithm’s performance itself. Police agencies should get independent experts or human rights groups to perform regular audits of the algorithms and the data they process. Much like the annual financial reviews large companies do, these examinations can ensure the input data are valid and are analyzed properly to avoid discrimination. If a company wants to claim its algorithm is proprietary and should be kept secret, it should still be required to offer robust testing environments so outside experts can examine its performance. Further, police departments that use algorithms to make predictions about individuals, like Chicago’s Strategic Subject List does, should have policies similar to a new European Union regulation requiring human-understandable explanations of computer algorithms’ decisions. And no agency or company should be allowed to discriminate against people who have been identified by predictive policing. Used correctly, predictive policing can be used to address the complex factors underlying crime trends. For example, rather than stepping up patrols, Toronto and other cities in Canada are using predictive modeling to connect residents to local social services. By improving the quality of data cities collect, and analyzing the information with more transparent and inclusive processes, cities can build safer communities, rather than cracking down harder on areas that are already struggling.

[Minority Report] Google and Coca-Cola may target personalized ads at you - in real life Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/10 11:27am PDTMay 10, 2017 20 Plus 1 on G+ 38 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares102 News Videos Google and Coca-Cola's partnership effort for in-store advertising displays looks to be bearing fruit. The advertising system uses DoubleClick's preference and tracking data combined with Google's Beacon Platform to serve up targeted ads by pulling data from passing smartphones. With that info, displays are able to select content based on your preferences in the form of advertisements specifically targeted to passersby. In a recent grocery store pilot program the Minority Report-style ads performed quite very well. This isn't actually that new. It was discussed at a few places in the last couple months since the details were revealed at Google's conference. But, it seems to have quite effectively flown under the radar for that time, considering how cool it is. Coca-Cola made a detailed post about it on one of their social promotion sites in April as well, in which they talked about the potential environments for these tracking signage systems, like movie theaters and other Retail venues than just grocery stores. Google's partnership with Coca-Cola for this system has been discussed off-and-on for a few years. Back at the National Automatic Merchandising Association's OneShow in 2016 Google talked about the potential as applied to vending machines, and said that Google and Coca-Cola were working together on Bluetooth beacons for vending, but this is the first time I've actually gotten to see what it looks like and how it performs. Coca-Cola's Greg Chambers, at Google's recent Cloud Next Conference, said that it has been experimenting with small tests into proximity marketing since at least 2015 when they first started working with Google on a prototype. The two companies tested things with a pilot for the system in 250 Albertson's grocery stores, in which Coca-Cola saw some incredible results. There was a one year ROI on Coca-Cola products displayed by the system, and a spillover effect from so-called "category-lift," in the form of a total one-month ROI for all nearby soda products — i.e., this system sells a lot of soda for Coca-Cola and all other brands near it. There's no word yet on when or how Coca-Cola might roll this out to other stores, but given how positive the results were for the pilot tests, it is likely you'll see one someday at the end of the soda aisle in your local grocery. On a more technical note, I'm not sure exactly what sort of data is being sent to the displays by nearby phones or how it is taken. Allegedly the system uses Google's Eddystone beacons, which exchange information with nearby phones using Bluetooth low energy. This is the first time I've heard of Google's Beacon Platform actually being used, combined with DoubleClick's targeting advertising systems, to target people in the physical world. The privacy-conscious might express some concern at the potential of having your phone communicate your preferences to an in-store display, but I would hope and assume that any identifying information is stripped out. Either way, we're one step closer to this. Source: Digital Strategy Consulting Tags beacon platform beacons bluetooth low energy Coca-Cola Eddystone Targeted advertisements video subscribe ...

Anu6is Stop being absurd, how else would you know what you NEED? WesleySmalls Actually, you do. People require social interaction, it's a very strong part of our being. Humans generally don't like to be alone, and very much can't over longer periods of time. Because of this, people tend to follow each other's example in one way or another, advertising is just one of the many examples Ben Yeah, your phone communicating with a vending machine to give you personalised advertisements is not in any way 'social interaction'. WesleySmalls I did not say anything about that, it wasn't even remotely close, nor was the post I commented on. But of course, else you had to actually comment on my actual post, and realize that it's true that people follow other people Prezes Dyrektor But you are making it sound like advertising is indispensable in our lives. Well guess what, ads is the reason why I cut cable tv, they don't have those fancy adblockers. Ads is the reason I mostly listen to local academic radio without any. Etc. Ads and marketing are evil, and we are being manipulated every day. Now excuse me as I run to grab some sugar soda and candy.

Or are people going to start getting ads for the sex toys they have in their amazon cart? Bane✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ There's one way to find out. Add some (more) sex toys to your Amazon cart and then go grocery shopping! Ryne Hager I actually haven't seen one in my area yet, when I go out west in a month I'll see if I can drop by an Albertson's. Carlos Rodríguez So, you have sex toys in your cart, right? Ryne Hager Obviously not enough sex toys, if you're questioning that. Carlos Rodríguez “( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)” yochanan Albertson's are now all Safeway's, FYI. Ryne Hager Albertson's acquired Safeway back in 2015, indeed. yochanan Right, but it wasn't until fairly recently (at least in Northern CO) that Albertsons stores have been converted into Safeway's. Bane✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, I'm a blank slate to advertising. I might as well be a ghost. I block all ads, turn off all targeted options everywhere, and never click on any. I guess I'll have to turn off Bluetooth when I'm in stores now too. Fadakar lol if you think your record is clean you need to re-evaluate how seriously you want to take privacy. James F This. People underestimate how much of a digital footprint they leave, even if they do turn off everything. EowynCarter True. And if they are, they wouldn't show me ads for coca cola, I just don't like that. And sodas in general. Cakefish Agreed, if I have to endure advertising it might as well be about products that actually interest me. Bewear I am a fan of your picture edits, Ryne. Ryne Hager What a coincidence, I am also a fan of your work. I kept a Bewear in my party for most of Moon. Anu6is lol! Lord Argyris My party was boring. Two of them were from Gen I, and apart from my starter, only one other member was from Gen VII. Now really, Nintendo should get in on this whole Coke-Google partnership thing. Maybe put something in their 3DS games that ties into this advertising platform. "Oh, so you're raising a bunch of Fire-type Pokemon. I'll bet you're feeling pretty hot right about now. Know what would cool you right down? A nice, ice cold COKE." Ryne Hager I mean, with the launch event Munchlax and Munchlax/Snorlax available on the first island, who in their right mind didn't take a Gen I Snorlax to end game. Michael Oghia I came here just to give you a +1 for Hypno Toad. Steve Actually noticed this happening to me recently when near the vending machine at my job. Guessing the capabilities will be endless and more diverse when full-on set-ups are placed everywhere. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7ea9fde9939850ddee856f08d34c3e8a98a6c90461c779f049060ec4e655b8c6.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f87dc3afe5a1492c33e179552b9fcf3259d388ef4a1a6cfed7951d9612faeae6.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/da689e538e0681368f0ef1dac408a796aa111781564a9ded426c4639fbeab351.jpg F4LL0U7 Disabling Nearby will disable invasive ads, you say? Done! Morten Ulv Google usually have a way to opt out. james fuston https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPGgTy5YJ-g Ben Nothing better than a new way to sell people tooth-rotting, diabetes-causing sugar water. Nicholas Conrad *This* is the gateway to AR! Aing actual R; genius! abqnm Are these connected to the "Nearby" activity in Google Settings? (Which also interestingly enough at some point has earned the ability to add the Nearby activity directly to the homescreen. Don't know when it appeared as I don't open that screen often, but it's now an option in the overflow menu.) James F Beacons typically use Bluetooth. abqnm Yes, and Google's Nearby uses Bluetooth LE scanning and Play Services location. But with Google being a part of it, I'm asking if it is directly related to the Nearby function. I am not asking for how beacons typically work. MJ Double checked BT is off on my phone... The only time ever use it is when play music on a BT speaker which I don't do when grocery shopping. "With that info, displays are able to select content based on your preferences in the form of advertisements specifically targeted to passersby" How does these ads work exactly? I am not watching a 54min video. Dedren You don't need bluetooth on per say. It just uses that tech. I believe you will have to enable Nearby places, which is disabled by default but will probably be enabled by default in the future. MJ Nearby places will not be going on... F4LL0U7 I'm not sure they could develop an ad that's targeted enough to get me to buy Coke. F4LL0U7 I guess I might consider it if the vending machine held a family member hostage or something. James F I don't know if I should be concerned that you said *might* consider it.... F4LL0U7 What can I say, I'm just not very receptive to ads. Dedren What about Water, Sprite, SimplyOrange, Powerade, Minute Maid? Surely one of those you drink...all Coke. F4LL0U7 I mean, of course I drink water, but I get it from the filtered pitcher in my fridge. No to the others. Adrian quickest way to turn me off on a product. Bluetooth is only on in my car anyway so good luck with it. As soon as someone figures out how to spoof it and annoy people in public, it will go away. Max Johnson I thought it's been NFC and GPS all this time. At least from my Android Pay app. blindexecutioner I would literally break my phone if I got an ad as I walked by a pop machine (or whatever) if I couldn't opt out of it of course.. I would switch to iOS that day. If it happened on iOS I would stop using smart phones altogether. tehboogieman You could just turn off bluetooth. Or you know, there's your way rndusrnm479461 iOS also supports this same thing. rndusrnm479461 I've read the whole article and even watched some of that video and I still don't get it - what do your "preferences" affect in the ads? How will it affect what the ad displays? Does it just play the ad you're more likely to prefer from 5 different ads? I'm confused... Why is such system necessary for something simple like coke? Would make more sense for a bus stop ad or other kinds of billboards.

[Update: Confirmed] Google Assistant in Allo is learning Spanish and French Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/09 9:40am PDTMay 9, 2017 45 Plus 1 on G+ 78 Share on Facebook 90 Share on Twitter Total Shares213 Applications Google News Update 1: 2017/05/09 9:43am PDT Confirmed Google rolled out Assistant first in Allo, but it only supported English at launch. Google has been slowly but steadily adding more languages to the Allo version, as well as the voice-activated version on phones. The company has quietly rolled out support for Spanish and French to Assistant in Allo, but it looks to still be in beta. Google has not updated its list of officially supported Assistant languages yet. It currently includes English, German, Hindi, Japanese, and Portuguese. However, we've gotten multiple tips that Assistant has started popping up in conversations happening in French and Spanish. Specifically, users are seeing smart replies in those languages, and they can ask the Assistant bot to use those languages. This appears to be a very recent change. When asked if is spoke French or Spanish before, Assistant would say it was still learning. Now, it offers to set those as the default language in Allo. It sounds like the new languages are a bit rougher around the edges than the "official" ones. Google's head of conversational search, Behshad Behzadi has reportedly said Spanish will be working completely later this year. French might be on the same track, but at least there's progress. Update 1: 2017/05/09 9:43am PDT Confirmed These languages are now confirmed. Google's head of product for Allo has tweeted that Spanish is rolling out. As for French, Google's Canadian blog says French is a go. End of Update Thanks: Roberto and Mikaël Tags allo assistant Google languages subscribe ...

I live in Quebec and my main language is french Canada so I would appreciate interacting with the assistant in French but do not wish to change my default language to French. I want to keep my device setup in English same as I always had my windows in English or any other tech devices.. TVs etc. And depending who I text it can be in English or French so unless it can switch easily it's useless currently. When I tried speaking french it would come up with gibersih words. It works better to just switch my keyboard language and use the mic. That way I am positive it understands what I am saying the first time whether it's French or English. roberto.elena At least in Allo, you don't have to do any changes. My phone has English US as the main system language for UI and Spanish (Spain) as secondary language for speech recognition. In Allo I can chat via text with the Assistant in English, Spanish and German and it understands all 3 without a problem. What I find weird is that the Assistant always replies using the same language, until you explicitly tell it to change to another one, so if I tell it to speak Spanish, it will always reply in Spanish even if I ask questions in English or German. EowynCarter Saying the assistant "speak french" should do that from what i tested. Keept talking english (device language is french), And it wasn't understanding anything before, expecting me to speak english. Then, it got the french sentance alright. Misanthrope Unfortunately, it still speaks English after that. I am in the same situation and don't want to put my device in French. I want to keep it in English and speak French which is impossible EowynCarter Mmm. I can tell the assistant to speak English despite my phone being in French. But I'm using the allo assistant. Girouf Yeah I remember when I was testing the assistant ...although it was using "French France" then cause french Canada was still not a "learned language, it would never switch to French on the fly if I tried dictating an SMS. As I mentioned my system was set as English default and I want it to stay that way. The best solution for me was to turn everything off and just use the mic in the keyboard, switch my language from there and I could easily create a French or English sms that way with the first try. I haven't used it since though so I don't know how it is now if any better. Marc ¡Hola! Omelette du fromage. Arthur J. Means nothing Bru [971] Seems to be out of beta as Google France's facebook page is asking us to try Assistant in French. With no mention of beta. This is how i saw it roberto.elena I think Google still considers it a beta, even when there is no mention of it. Maybe I'm wrong, but the same happened when the Assistant was launched in English in Allo, before the Pixel launch. JD Has it learned french? Or has it learned Quebecois? Qbancelli Gracias, Google! Daniel D’Oleo ¡Por fin, ya habla español! 😃 Can confirm it works in Spanish (Spain/Latin America). https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/737f7c20cd24f2fc2ad7d8dee390630046978e4c2f455b8f88277ae7afa1fcbf.png Diego S. Spanish yesss Petr Kuchyňka And few commands in Czech (like setting an alarm etc.) Gerardo Sarabia this should come to the rest of the Assistant ecosystem, instead of being limited to Allo. Leonardo Baez Thanks for the heads up. I will change my language to spanish now. 👍 cvm And here, I'm trying to learn French... Stefan There is so much to do in the field of bi-lingual and tri-lingual users.. the OS should know when I chat with a specific person what language I use and the keyboard and Assistant should adopt to contacts across the device.. I use three languages on a daily basis and it's a nightmare to say the least. EnerJi Do you use Gboard as your keyboard? Supposedly it auto-detects languages automatically, but I haven't tested it extensively and I'm not sure whether it works well. Stefan yes nexus 5x with clean android and Gboard.. it seems to work every now and then, and only integrates with native android apps. my iPad seems to work better with remembering which language was previously used in the chat.. but that's iMessage ... siri is one language only and that's a BIG reason why I switched to android because google Now understood which language I was speaking in.. google assistant is FAR behind Rod Swiftkey is your friend. VAVAMk_2 ¿Cuándo podemos esperar que Google Allo aprenda soporte SMS además de nuevos idiomas? Serge Cebrian for a second didnt notice it was spanish (my main language) hahahaha my brain is starting to switch langs for me on the fly .. nice... respondiendote: No se cuando llegue el soporte de SMS pero espero que pronto ! estaria genial VAVAMk_2 Not soon enough YuCMi Proof that Allo is still in beta... it's literally Google's testing ground. Maxime MARAIS Does this mean Pixel phones may be soon available on Google Store? As far as I can remember, these phones are only available in countries where Allô is supported in their main language(s). My good old Nexus 5 would be glad to be retired.

That was the message of DeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman this week — the highly educated entrepreneur who sold his artificial intelligence (AI) startup to Google for £400 million in 2014. "We believe today that in some sense, capitalism in many ways has delivered so much for us over the last couple of centuries," said Suleyman at a Google ZeitgeistMinds event in London on Tuesday. "We've delivered so much progress. No other construct or idea has been able to distribute benefits so broadly and so rapidly. "And yet in many areas, capitalism is currently failing us," he said. "We actually need a new kind of set of incentives to tackle some of most pressing and urgent social problems and we need a new kind of tool, a new kind of intelligence, that is distributed, that is scaled, that is accessible, to try and make sense of some of the complexity that is overwhelming us." View photos drought farmer syria climate changeMore Khaled al-Hariri/Reuters Humans need help from the machines Addressing the audience of global thinkers and leaders, Suleyman went on to say that humans are struggling to grapple with the complexity of the systems that we have created, adding that our current financial systems "need to serve the interests of the many and not just the few". Suleyman, the son of a Syrian-born taxi-driver father and English nurse, supported his argument by making a number of points. "800 million people don’t have access to clean water today and that's going to more than double over the next decade," said Suleyman. A lack of food is another big issue. Suleyman said 800 million people are malnourished "yet almost a third of the food that we produce goes to waste each year." He added: "It would take 3.1 planets worth of resources if all of us across the world were to consume at the rate we do in the UK. How is that sustainable? What does that say about the mechanisms and the incentives that we’ve created and evolved over the last thousands of years of our species?" The issues of clean water and food availability are only going to intensify as a result of global warming, Suleyman said, adding that the concentration of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere is higher than ever. "We have ticking time bombs that our current systems are struggling to address," he said. On wealth equality, Suleyman (who is a multimillionaire himself) said that he'd like to see capital spread more evenly around the world. "The incomes of the top 1%, most of us [at the Google event], have risen 300% over the last 30 years, while the bottom 2/3 have seen their incomes stagnate or fall. How can we change that to ensure benefits are distributed as widely and as fairly as possible?" View photos google dulles data centerMore Read More Google Using AI to make the world better Suleyman believes that AI, and more specifically the AI being created by DeepMind, can play a crucial role in making the world a better place for everyone. The company's most famous algorithm to date is AlphaGo — an AI agent that taught itself how to play, and master, the Chinese board game Go. But DeepMind is now looking to apply similar algorithms to real world problems. Last July, Google announced that it has been using a DeepMind-built AI system to control certain parts of its power-hungry data centres over the last few months as it looks to make its vast server farms more environmentally friendly. This week, Suleyman said the DeepMind technology has now been deployed in all of Google's data centres, as he said it would be. DeepMind is now in talks with the National Grid in the UK about a potential partnership that could help the entire nation to reduce its carbon footprint. Elsewhere, DeepMind's AI is also being used to help medical experts in the NHS to diagnose patients and treat them accordingly. The company has developed an app called "Streams" which is able to detect AKI (acute kidney injury) and other conditions. It is also using its software to help clinicians spot head and neck cancer, and early signs of eye conditions that human eye care experts might miss. The company's work with the NHS gives DeepMind access to large amounts of patient data and the collaboration has been criticised for not being transparent enough, with the first deal (made with the Royal Free NHS Trust in North London) coming under the most criticism.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars PC GAMING Google bags Job Simulator studio Owlchemy Labs in VR’s latest exit Jeff Grubb@jeffgrubb May 10, 2017 1:50 PM Above: Rick and Morty now work for Google. Image Credit: Owlchemy One of the most successful virtual reality game studios is now a part of one of the world’s biggest corporations. Google revealed today that it has acquired Owlchemy Labs, the studio that is best known for developing popular HTC Vive launch game Job Simulator. This acquisition gives Google a talented in-house team that can build content for its Daydream VR headsets that work with select Android smartphones. In its blog post announcing the deal to bring Owlchemy under the Google banner, Google VR engineering director Relja Markovic explained that the company’s existing content teams will partner with Owlchemy to build new experiences. Markovic also suggested that Owlchemy will continue working on other VR platforms like Vive, Oculus Rift, and more. The two parties did not disclose how much Google spent to acquire the studio. Owlchemy has helped define VR for many people. Job Simulator is a game where you experience a museum of jobs through a series of silly interactions. The game also got a chance to prove itself to a mass audience when it appeared on the late-night program Conan. Owlchemy’s followup VR game, Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality debuted in April, and it presented players with a similar set of bizarre, interactive challenges. “Today, we’re thrilled to welcome Owlchemy Labs to Google,” wrote Markovic. “They’ve created award-winning games like Job Simulator and Rick and Morty: Virtual Rick-ality which have really thoughtful interactive experiences that are responsive, intuitive, and feel natural. They’ve helped set a high bar for what engagement can be like in virtual worlds, and do it all with a great sense of humor.” In January, Owlchemy revealed that Job Simulator was a sales hit. Through 2016, it grossed more than $3 million in revenues. Since debuting in April for the Vive, it has since made the move to Oculus Rift and PlayStation VR. It was so popular that the studio even released a physical version of the game for Sony’s PS4 console. This move is also indicative of Google’s commitment to VR and not just as a hardware or experiential exercise. Owlchemy is a game studio, and now Google can actively produce gaming content internally for head-mounted displays without having to necessarily work with outside partners. VentureBeat's PC Gaming channel is presented by the Intel® Game Dev program. 
Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Microsoft HomeHub concept images leak, paint picture of PC-as-an-Amazon-Echo 05/09/2017 at 3:30 PM by Brad Linder 2 Comments Microsoft’s answer to the Amazon Echo and Google Home is expected to be something called HomeHub. But it’s not a standalone device like a smart speaker. It’s an upcoming feature for Windows 10 that will allow you to use just about any PC as a voice-activated smart home hub. It will be able to run on notebooks, desktops, and all-in-one PCs. And while we’ll probably see PC makers release dedicated hardware specifically for use with HomeHub, what will set those devices apart from an Amazon Echo is that they’ll essentially be full-fledged PCs. At least that’s the takeaway from a series of leaked images obtained by The Verge. Microsoft hasn’t actually said much about HomeHub yet. Among other things, it looks like HomeHub will be a simple, full-screen user interface that lets you control smart home gadgets, view updates, and make voice and video calls (probably over Skype, which Microsoft owns). Microsoft’s Cortana virtual assistant will power the experience, much as Amazon’s Alexa and Google’s Assistant are the heart of their respective devices. Apple is also allegedly working on a Siri-powered smart home device. The company’s approach reminds me a bit of the now-defunct Windows Media Center. Instead of delivering a hardware or software solution designed specifically for DVRs or other home media players, Microsoft built an optional media-centric user interface for Windows that shipped with Windows XP Media Center Edition, Windows Vista, and Windows 7 before starting to phase it out with the launch of Windows 8. Windows Media Center developed a small but loyal fan base. Enthusiasts were able to build homemade DVRs from any PC without paying monthly fees to TiVo or a cable company. But these days Microsoft’s TV strategy seems to be focused on the Xbox console. I have to wonder whether this new attempt to shoehorn appliance-like functionality into a desktop operating system will be any more successful. That said, it’s not that different from what Amazon is doing. For all intents and purposes, the new Amazon Echo Show is a desktop computer with a 7 inch touchscreen display, an Intel Atom Cherry Trail processor, eight mics, and a big speaker. It just happens to run a custom operating system designed to showcase Alexa services… but I wouldn’t be surprised if the Echo Show can also do many of the same things as Amazon’s Fire tablets, which are capable of running hundreds of thousands of third-party apps.

It was a polished piece of software that was only as reliable as the OS it ran upon. I missed several recordings because of windows update issues. I now have a dedicated device for OTA recording (ChannelMaster DVR+). It just works. That is the problem with Microsoft’s version of a home appliance. Nobody wants to have to maintain this type of appliance. Alexa and Google Home “just work”. Building a home appliance on generalized computer platform is moronic. Just my $0.02.

But it was always a kind of geeky solution when compared to dedicated appliances. The same is likely true of this attempt to shoehorn appliance-like functionality into a general purpose OS. It’ll appeal to some folks who don’t want a single-purpose gadget. But those who want simplicity over power will just buy an Echo Dot.

[Minority Report] Google and Coca-Cola may target personalized ads at you - in real life Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/10 11:27am PDTMay 10, 2017 20 Plus 1 on G+ 38 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares102 News Videos Google and Coca-Cola's partnership effort for in-store advertising displays looks to be bearing fruit. The advertising system uses DoubleClick's preference and tracking data combined with Google's Beacon Platform to serve up targeted ads by pulling data from passing smartphones. With that info, displays are able to select content based on your preferences in the form of advertisements specifically targeted to passersby. In a recent grocery store pilot program the Minority Report-style ads performed quite very well. This isn't actually that new. It was discussed at a few places in the last couple months since the details were revealed at Google's conference. But, it seems to have quite effectively flown under the radar for that time, considering how cool it is. Coca-Cola made a detailed post about it on one of their social promotion sites in April as well, in which they talked about the potential environments for these tracking signage systems, like movie theaters and other Retail venues than just grocery stores. Google's partnership with Coca-Cola for this system has been discussed off-and-on for a few years. Back at the National Automatic Merchandising Association's OneShow in 2016 Google talked about the potential as applied to vending machines, and said that Google and Coca-Cola were working together on Bluetooth beacons for vending, but this is the first time I've actually gotten to see what it looks like and how it performs. Coca-Cola's Greg Chambers, at Google's recent Cloud Next Conference, said that it has been experimenting with small tests into proximity marketing since at least 2015 when they first started working with Google on a prototype. The two companies tested things with a pilot for the system in 250 Albertson's grocery stores, in which Coca-Cola saw some incredible results. There was a one year ROI on Coca-Cola products displayed by the system, and a spillover effect from so-called "category-lift," in the form of a total one-month ROI for all nearby soda products — i.e., this system sells a lot of soda for Coca-Cola and all other brands near it. There's no word yet on when or how Coca-Cola might roll this out to other stores, but given how positive the results were for the pilot tests, it is likely you'll see one someday at the end of the soda aisle in your local grocery. On a more technical note, I'm not sure exactly what sort of data is being sent to the displays by nearby phones or how it is taken. Allegedly the system uses Google's Eddystone beacons, which exchange information with nearby phones using Bluetooth low energy. This is the first time I've heard of Google's Beacon Platform actually being used, combined with DoubleClick's targeting advertising systems, to target people in the physical world. The privacy-conscious might express some concern at the potential of having your phone communicate your preferences to an in-store display, but I would hope and assume that any identifying information is stripped out.

Anu6is Stop being absurd, how else would you know what you NEED? WesleySmalls Actually, you do. People require social interaction, it's a very strong part of our being. Humans generally don't like to be alone, and very much can't over longer periods of time. Because of this, people tend to follow each other's example in one way or another, advertising is just one of the many examples Ben Yeah, your phone communicating with a vending machine to give you personalised advertisements is not in any way 'social interaction'. WesleySmalls I did not say anything about that, it wasn't even remotely close, nor was the post I commented on. But of course, else you had to actually comment on my actual post, and realize that it's true that people follow other people Prezes Dyrektor But you are making it sound like advertising is indispensable in our lives. Well guess what, ads is the reason why I cut cable tv, they don't have those fancy adblockers. Ads is the reason I mostly listen to local academic radio without any. Etc. Ads and marketing are evil, and we are being manipulated every day. Now excuse me as I run to grab some sugar soda and candy.

Or are people going to start getting ads for the sex toys they have in their amazon cart? Bane✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ There's one way to find out. Add some (more) sex toys to your Amazon cart and then go grocery shopping! Ryne Hager I actually haven't seen one in my area yet, when I go out west in a month I'll see if I can drop by an Albertson's. Carlos Rodríguez So, you have sex toys in your cart, right? Ryne Hager Obviously not enough sex toys, if you're questioning that. Carlos Rodríguez “( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)” yochanan Albertson's are now all Safeway's, FYI. Ryne Hager Albertson's acquired Safeway back in 2015, indeed. yochanan Right, but it wasn't until fairly recently (at least in Northern CO) that Albertsons stores have been converted into Safeway's. Bane✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, I'm a blank slate to advertising. I might as well be a ghost. I block all ads, turn off all targeted options everywhere, and never click on any. I guess I'll have to turn off Bluetooth when I'm in stores now too. Fadakar lol if you think your record is clean you need to re-evaluate how seriously you want to take privacy. James F This. People underestimate how much of a digital footprint they leave, even if they do turn off everything. EowynCarter True. And if they are, they wouldn't show me ads for coca cola, I just don't like that. And sodas in general. Cakefish Agreed, if I have to endure advertising it might as well be about products that actually interest me. Bewear I am a fan of your picture edits, Ryne. Ryne Hager What a coincidence, I am also a fan of your work. I kept a Bewear in my party for most of Moon. Anu6is lol! Lord Argyris My party was boring. Two of them were from Gen I, and apart from my starter, only one other member was from Gen VII. Now really, Nintendo should get in on this whole Coke-Google partnership thing. Maybe put something in their 3DS games that ties into this advertising platform. "Oh, so you're raising a bunch of Fire-type Pokemon. I'll bet you're feeling pretty hot right about now. Know what would cool you right down? A nice, ice cold COKE." Ryne Hager I mean, with the launch event Munchlax and Munchlax/Snorlax available on the first island, who in their right mind didn't take a Gen I Snorlax to end game. Michael Oghia I came here just to give you a +1 for Hypno Toad. Steve Actually noticed this happening to me recently when near the vending machine at my job. Guessing the capabilities will be endless and more diverse when full-on set-ups are placed everywhere. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7ea9fde9939850ddee856f08d34c3e8a98a6c90461c779f049060ec4e655b8c6.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f87dc3afe5a1492c33e179552b9fcf3259d388ef4a1a6cfed7951d9612faeae6.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/da689e538e0681368f0ef1dac408a796aa111781564a9ded426c4639fbeab351.jpg F4LL0U7 Disabling Nearby will disable invasive ads, you say? Done! Morten Ulv Google usually have a way to opt out. james fuston https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPGgTy5YJ-g Ben Nothing better than a new way to sell people tooth-rotting, diabetes-causing sugar water. Nicholas Conrad *This* is the gateway to AR! Aing actual R; genius! abqnm Are these connected to the "Nearby" activity in Google Settings? (Which also interestingly enough at some point has earned the ability to add the Nearby activity directly to the homescreen. Don't know when it appeared as I don't open that screen often, but it's now an option in the overflow menu.) James F Beacons typically use Bluetooth. abqnm Yes, and Google's Nearby uses Bluetooth LE scanning and Play Services location. But with Google being a part of it, I'm asking if it is directly related to the Nearby function. I am not asking for how beacons typically work. MJ Double checked BT is off on my phone... The only time ever use it is when play music on a BT speaker which I don't do when grocery shopping. "With that info, displays are able to select content based on your preferences in the form of advertisements specifically targeted to passersby" How does these ads work exactly? I am not watching a 54min video. Dedren You don't need bluetooth on per say. It just uses that tech. I believe you will have to enable Nearby places, which is disabled by default but will probably be enabled by default in the future. MJ Nearby places will not be going on... F4LL0U7 I'm not sure they could develop an ad that's targeted enough to get me to buy Coke. F4LL0U7 I guess I might consider it if the vending machine held a family member hostage or something. James F I don't know if I should be concerned that you said *might* consider it.... F4LL0U7 What can I say, I'm just not very receptive to ads. Dedren What about Water, Sprite, SimplyOrange, Powerade, Minute Maid? Surely one of those you drink...all Coke. F4LL0U7 I mean, of course I drink water, but I get it from the filtered pitcher in my fridge. No to the others. Adrian quickest way to turn me off on a product. Bluetooth is only on in my car anyway so good luck with it. As soon as someone figures out how to spoof it and annoy people in public, it will go away. Max Johnson I thought it's been NFC and GPS all this time. At least from my Android Pay app. blindexecutioner I would literally break my phone if I got an ad as I walked by a pop machine (or whatever) if I couldn't opt out of it of course.. I would switch to iOS that day. If it happened on iOS I would stop using smart phones altogether. tehboogieman You could just turn off bluetooth. Or you know, there's your way rndusrnm479461 iOS also supports this same thing. rndusrnm479461 I've read the whole article and even watched some of that video and I still don't get it - what do your "preferences" affect in the ads? How will it affect what the ad displays? Does it just play the ad you're more likely to prefer from 5 different ads? I'm confused... Why is such system necessary for something simple like coke? Would make more sense for a bus stop ad or other kinds of billboards.

Google has announced that Google Search can now help you find local events. The events will come from sites like Eventbrite, Meetup, and more, and they’ll be available in the Google app as well as on the mobile web. To begin, you can search for things like “jazz concerts in Austin” or “art events this weekend.” You’ll then see details like the event name, date, time, and location. You can tap the event to get more details or buy tickets, or you can tap “More events” to see even more things that are happening. You can also filter upcoming events by tapping the “Today”, “Tomorrow”, “This weekend”, and similar buttons at the top off the results. You can type “Events near me” to find events that are happening soon close to you, too.

The site emailed a fake invitation to view a Google Docs spreadsheet from a Gizmodo email address, but with the name of the sender mimicking someone the recipient would know — either a family member, colleague or friend. If the recipient clicked the link, it would direct them to a document that appeared like a Google sign-in page, asking them to put in their Google credentials.  Gizmodo said over half the officials connected to the Trump administration clicked on the link. ADVERTISEMENT The site said it did not collect any of the personal information, such as passwords, that the clickers entered. But the fake attack is nonetheless drawing criticism. Jake Laperruque, a senior counsel for The Constitution Project, who previously worked for Sen. Al FrankenAl FrankenGizmodo takes heat for 'stunt hacking' attempts on Trump associates Franken rips Sessions for encouraging Comey firing The Memo: Trump ignites firestorm MORE (D-Minn.), slammed Gizmodo publicly for its “grossly irresponsible” test.  At a minimum @Gizmodo should have anonymized who it was faux-phishing. The more I look at this the more clear it was grossly irresponsible— Jake Laperruque (@JakeLaperruque) May 9, 2017 He said Gizmodo’s article could have the reverse effect of showing vulnerabilities and actually make individuals vulnerable through a short domino falling process. The site's article could inspire others to try to publicly list figures who are susceptible to hacking, which could then make them more vulnerable to a real malicious attack once that becomes public knowledge. “I'm less concerned about it encouraging copycats in the form of actual malicious hacks — hopefully illegality would discourage that — but am very worried that this will lead to efforts that list out public figures that seem vulnerable to hacking,” Laperrugue wrote in an email Tuesday. “That would create serious cybersecurity risks and expose individuals to malicious hacks. Hopefully this activity will be condemned as seriously irresponsible and not repeated in the future on any scale.”   Gizmodo said it emailed the fake link to 15 people, including White House press secretary Sean Spicer, former FBI Director James Comey, senior adviser to the president Stephen Miller, deputy assistant to the president Sebastian Gorka, White House adviser Peter Thiel, White House cybersecurity adviser Rudy Giuliani and informal adviser to the president Newt Gingrich. “Some of the Trump Administration people completely ignored our email, the right move. But it appears that more than half the recipients clicked the link: Eight different unique devices visited the site, one of them multiple times,” Gizmodo.com said in its Tuesday report of the test.  Gizmodo said it does not know who exactly clicked on the link, but they know Comey and Gingrich opened the emails because they both replied.  “Comey, apparently believing that he was writing to his friend, Lawfareblog.com editor-in-chief Ben Wittes, wrote: ‘Don’t want to open without care. What is it?’ And Gingrich, apparently under the impression he was responding to an email from his wife, Callista, wrote: ‘What is this?’ ” the site writes. Gizmodo said it did not respond to Comey or Gingrich’s emails, adding that if it were a real phishing attempt, “the replies could have given the sender a chance to more aggressively put their targets at ease and lure them in,” and make their emails and personal information susceptible to the hackers. Gizmodo said it offered disclaimers throughout the test “for careful readers” to notice that it was a stunt hacking. “In addition to the giveaway in the form of the email address, the last line of the invitation revealed that it had been sent to test the recipient’s digital security acumen … Anyone who clicked the sign-in button would receive a message alerting them to the fact that they’d just taken part in a security audit by the Special Projects Desk. It included our contact information," the site continued. Markus Jakobsson, the chief scientist for Agari, a internet company that aims to eliminate email cyber attacks, disputed that the individuals who clicked on the link are “negligent or clueless,” saying these phishing attempts are sophisticated. “The fact that half of their targets fell for the ruse isn’t shocking. It doesn’t show that the Trump administration is negligent or clueless,” Jakobsson said in a Wednesday blog post. “The administration, simply, is made up of people, and this is what people do. For those who think we should hold the victims accountable for their actions, I have one piece of advice: give it a rest. That might have been possible five years ago, before the level of sophistication of email attacks rose to the current level.” He instead argued that technology needs to advance to the point that it warns users when a phishing attempt is underway. “Instead, we need to usher in a new era of security technologies that are automated 'guardian angels' to all recipients of a protected organization, and which identify risk … by determining whether an email would be deceptive to the recipient,” he writes.  Tags Al Franken   View the discussion thread.

Name: Subject: Message: Google search can now help you learn about events going on in your area Newsby Jimmy Westenberg10 hours ago 83 10 Google might have its sights set on numerous different software and hardware projects, but it has not forgotten about its search engine roots. Today, the company announced an update to its Google app and mobile website that taps into services like Eventbrite, Meetup, and Songkick to give you a bird’s eye glance at what events are around you. Say you search for “jazz concerts in Austin,” or “art events this weekend.” Results that pop up will now display specific information about the event, such as its name, when it begins, and where it will be hosted. You can also filter through events by time, whether they start up the day of, the next day, or the next week. If you are the adventurous type, you can type “events near me” and get a general glance of what is going on around you. Regardless of how you search for an event, you are able to purchase tickets and learn more about the event, all from the search result. The idea is to consolidate your usage of other services and funnel it into a Google search — instead of searching through several different services, why not do it through one? Of course, Google also wants more folks using its search engine, but it does look to make things a little easier for event-goers. If you are such a person, the update to the Google app seems to be a slow rollout, though it should be available to everyone relatively soon.

Jensen Huang beamed out over a packed conference hall in San Jose, California, on Wednesday as he announced his company’s new chip aimed at accelerating artificial intelligence algorithms. But metaphorically speaking, the CEO of chip maker Nvidia was looking over his shoulder. Nvidia’s profits and stock have surged over the past few years because the graphics processors it invented to power gaming and graphics production have enabled many recent breakthroughs in machine learning (see “10 Breakthrough Technologies 2013: Deep Learning”). But as investment in artificial intelligence soars, Huang’s company now faces competition from Intel, Google, and others working on their own AI chips.

AI Is Making It Very Hard to Know The World’s Largest Electric Vehicle Maker Hits a Speed Bump At Nvidia’s annual developer conference on Wednesday, Huang carefully avoided mentioning any competitors by name as he introduced Nvidia’s latest chip, named the Tesla V100. He referred to Google only as “some people,” for example. But he made clear swipes at the technology of Nvidia’s challengers, particularly when talking about the big opportunity opening up to supply AI chips for use in cloud computing. Companies in many industries such as health care and finance are investing in machine-learning infrastructure. Leading cloud computing providers Google, Amazon, and Microsoft are all betting that many companies will want to pay them to run artificial intelligence software, and are going to spend heavily on new hardware to support that. Nvidia came to dominate the burgeoning AI chip market by smartly seizing on a lucky coincidence. The basic mathematical operations needed for computer graphics are the same as those underlying an approach to machine learning known as artificial neural networks. Starting in 2012, researchers showed that by putting new power behind that technique, graphics processors permitted software to become much, much smarter at tasks such as interpreting images or speech. Do you believe artificial intelligence will transform every industry? Tell us why. As the AI market has grown, Nvidia has tweaked its chip designs with features to support neural networks. The new V100 chip announced this week is the culmination of that effort, and features a new core specialized for accelerating deep-learning math. Huang said its power and energy efficiency would help companies or cloud providers to dramatically upgrade their capability to use AI. “You could increase the throughput of your data center by 15 times instead of having to build new data centers,” he said. Nvidia’s new competitors argue that they can make hardware faster and more efficient at running AI software by designing chips tuned for the purpose from scratch instead of adapting graphics chip technology. For example, Intel promises to release a chip for deep learning later this year built on top of technology acquired with startup Nervana in 2016 (see “Intel Outside as Other Companies Prosper from Graphics Chips”). The company is also preparing to release a product to speed up deep learning based on technology from its $16.7 billion acquisition of Altera, which made chips called FPGAs that can be reconfigured to power specific algorithms. Microsoft has invested heavily in using FPGAs to power its machine-learning software and made them a core piece of its cloud platform, Azure. Meanwhile, Google disclosed last summer that it was already using a chip customized for AI, developed in-house, called a Tensor Processing Unit, or TPU. The chips underpinned the software AlphaGo’s victory over a champion player of the board game Go last year. They aren’t for sale, but Google says companies that use its cloud computing services will get the benefits of their power and energy efficiency. Several engineers that built Google’s chip have since left the company to form a startup with $10 million in funding called Groq that is building a specialized machine-learning chip. Other startups working on similar projects include Wave Computing, which says it is already letting customers test its hardware. Huang claimed Wednesday that Nvidia’s technology hits a sweet spot other efforts don’t. Custom chips like Google’s TPU are too inflexible to work equally well with many different kinds of neural networks, he said—a significant downside given how quickly new ideas are being tested and adopted in AI. He claimed FPGAs, like those favored by Microsoft and being bet on by Intel, consume too much energy. “We are creating the most productive platform for deep learning,” he said. As Huang’s rivals reveal more about their products this year, that claim will come under close scrutiny. Get stories like this before anyone else with First Look.

You can get our headlines via email as well, or follow us on Twitter. Buying a home for the first time can be a daunting experience, as the world of credit scores and mortgages is pretty unfamiliar to most of us. Just how unfamiliar it is was revealed in a new study by U.K.-based real estate firm Strata Homes that shows how often consumers turn to Google for answers to some pretty basic questions on the topic. Strata used Google search data to pinpoint the most common search queries for first-time buyers. It found that phrases such as “first time home buyer” are searched for around 9,900 times a month, while more functional queries like “how to get a mortgage” receive 5,400 hits a month on average. These findings prompted Strata to delve further into the minds of newbie home buyers, uncovering the top discussion over the past year to identify the most pressing questions they seek answers to. The company found that around 325,000 first-time buyers looked to Google to assess their finances and answer the question “how much can I borrow?” to buy a home. Meanwhile, another 64,000 asked Google how they could secure their first mortgage. The most surprising query however, asked by 35,000 would-be buyers, was “What is a mortgage?”. Here’s the top ten questions asked by first-time buyers, according to Strata: “Most first time buyers have an endless supply of questions and are entering into a minefield of unknowns with vast numbers of people anonymously seeking answers to their home-buying questions on Google,” said Strata’s Gemma Smith in a statement. “In fact, these figures prove that many first time buyers are not aware of the help that is available to them, whether that is an independent mortgage advisor, an estate agent or a new homes manager.” Strata’s research also revealed that Google Trend Data shows a significant three percent year-over-year increase in the number of people searching for newly constructed homes in the U.K. Strata says this growing trend suggests that consumers are becoming increasingly confident in the ability of homebuilders to provide “trusted guidance and recommendations”.

[Minority Report] Google and Coca-Cola may target personalized ads at you - in real life Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/10 11:27am PDTMay 10, 2017 20 Plus 1 on G+ 38 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares102 News Videos Google and Coca-Cola's partnership effort for in-store advertising displays looks to be bearing fruit. The advertising system uses DoubleClick's preference and tracking data combined with Google's Beacon Platform to serve up targeted ads by pulling data from passing smartphones. With that info, displays are able to select content based on your preferences in the form of advertisements specifically targeted to passersby. In a recent grocery store pilot program the Minority Report-style ads performed quite very well. This isn't actually that new. It was discussed at a few places in the last couple months since the details were revealed at Google's conference. But, it seems to have quite effectively flown under the radar for that time, considering how cool it is. Coca-Cola made a detailed post about it on one of their social promotion sites in April as well, in which they talked about the potential environments for these tracking signage systems, like movie theaters and other Retail venues than just grocery stores. Google's partnership with Coca-Cola for this system has been discussed off-and-on for a few years. Back at the National Automatic Merchandising Association's OneShow in 2016 Google talked about the potential as applied to vending machines, and said that Google and Coca-Cola were working together on Bluetooth beacons for vending, but this is the first time I've actually gotten to see what it looks like and how it performs. Coca-Cola's Greg Chambers, at Google's recent Cloud Next Conference, said that it has been experimenting with small tests into proximity marketing since at least 2015 when they first started working with Google on a prototype. The two companies tested things with a pilot for the system in 250 Albertson's grocery stores, in which Coca-Cola saw some incredible results. There was a one year ROI on Coca-Cola products displayed by the system, and a spillover effect from so-called "category-lift," in the form of a total one-month ROI for all nearby soda products — i.e., this system sells a lot of soda for Coca-Cola and all other brands near it. There's no word yet on when or how Coca-Cola might roll this out to other stores, but given how positive the results were for the pilot tests, it is likely you'll see one someday at the end of the soda aisle in your local grocery. On a more technical note, I'm not sure exactly what sort of data is being sent to the displays by nearby phones or how it is taken. Allegedly the system uses Google's Eddystone beacons, which exchange information with nearby phones using Bluetooth low energy. This is the first time I've heard of Google's Beacon Platform actually being used, combined with DoubleClick's targeting advertising systems, to target people in the physical world. The privacy-conscious might express some concern at the potential of having your phone communicate your preferences to an in-store display, but I would hope and assume that any identifying information is stripped out. Either way, we're one step closer to this. Source: Digital Strategy Consulting Tags beacon platform beacons bluetooth low energy Coca-Cola Eddystone Targeted advertisements video subscribe ...

Anu6is Stop being absurd, how else would you know what you NEED? WesleySmalls Actually, you do. People require social interaction, it's a very strong part of our being. Humans generally don't like to be alone, and very much can't over longer periods of time. Because of this, people tend to follow each other's example in one way or another, advertising is just one of the many examples Ben Yeah, your phone communicating with a vending machine to give you personalised advertisements is not in any way 'social interaction'. WesleySmalls I did not say anything about that, it wasn't even remotely close, nor was the post I commented on. But of course, else you had to actually comment on my actual post, and realize that it's true that people follow other people Prezes Dyrektor But you are making it sound like advertising is indispensable in our lives. Well guess what, ads is the reason why I cut cable tv, they don't have those fancy adblockers. Ads is the reason I mostly listen to local academic radio without any. Etc. Ads and marketing are evil, and we are being manipulated every day. Now excuse me as I run to grab some sugar soda and candy.

Or are people going to start getting ads for the sex toys they have in their amazon cart? Bane✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ There's one way to find out. Add some (more) sex toys to your Amazon cart and then go grocery shopping! Ryne Hager I actually haven't seen one in my area yet, when I go out west in a month I'll see if I can drop by an Albertson's. Carlos Rodríguez So, you have sex toys in your cart, right? Ryne Hager Obviously not enough sex toys, if you're questioning that. Carlos Rodríguez “( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)” yochanan Albertson's are now all Safeway's, FYI. Ryne Hager Albertson's acquired Safeway back in 2015, indeed. yochanan Right, but it wasn't until fairly recently (at least in Northern CO) that Albertsons stores have been converted into Safeway's. Bane✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, I'm a blank slate to advertising. I might as well be a ghost. I block all ads, turn off all targeted options everywhere, and never click on any. I guess I'll have to turn off Bluetooth when I'm in stores now too. Fadakar lol if you think your record is clean you need to re-evaluate how seriously you want to take privacy. James F This. People underestimate how much of a digital footprint they leave, even if they do turn off everything. EowynCarter True. And if they are, they wouldn't show me ads for coca cola, I just don't like that. And sodas in general. Cakefish Agreed, if I have to endure advertising it might as well be about products that actually interest me. Bewear I am a fan of your picture edits, Ryne. Ryne Hager What a coincidence, I am also a fan of your work. I kept a Bewear in my party for most of Moon. Anu6is lol! Lord Argyris My party was boring. Two of them were from Gen I, and apart from my starter, only one other member was from Gen VII. Now really, Nintendo should get in on this whole Coke-Google partnership thing. Maybe put something in their 3DS games that ties into this advertising platform. "Oh, so you're raising a bunch of Fire-type Pokemon. I'll bet you're feeling pretty hot right about now. Know what would cool you right down? A nice, ice cold COKE." Ryne Hager I mean, with the launch event Munchlax and Munchlax/Snorlax available on the first island, who in their right mind didn't take a Gen I Snorlax to end game. Michael Oghia I came here just to give you a +1 for Hypno Toad. Steve Actually noticed this happening to me recently when near the vending machine at my job. Guessing the capabilities will be endless and more diverse when full-on set-ups are placed everywhere. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7ea9fde9939850ddee856f08d34c3e8a98a6c90461c779f049060ec4e655b8c6.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f87dc3afe5a1492c33e179552b9fcf3259d388ef4a1a6cfed7951d9612faeae6.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/da689e538e0681368f0ef1dac408a796aa111781564a9ded426c4639fbeab351.jpg F4LL0U7 Disabling Nearby will disable invasive ads, you say? Done! Morten Ulv Google usually have a way to opt out. james fuston https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPGgTy5YJ-g Ben Nothing better than a new way to sell people tooth-rotting, diabetes-causing sugar water. Nicholas Conrad *This* is the gateway to AR! Aing actual R; genius! abqnm Are these connected to the "Nearby" activity in Google Settings? (Which also interestingly enough at some point has earned the ability to add the Nearby activity directly to the homescreen. Don't know when it appeared as I don't open that screen often, but it's now an option in the overflow menu.) James F Beacons typically use Bluetooth. abqnm Yes, and Google's Nearby uses Bluetooth LE scanning and Play Services location. But with Google being a part of it, I'm asking if it is directly related to the Nearby function. I am not asking for how beacons typically work. MJ Double checked BT is off on my phone... The only time ever use it is when play music on a BT speaker which I don't do when grocery shopping. "With that info, displays are able to select content based on your preferences in the form of advertisements specifically targeted to passersby" How does these ads work exactly? I am not watching a 54min video. Dedren You don't need bluetooth on per say. It just uses that tech. I believe you will have to enable Nearby places, which is disabled by default but will probably be enabled by default in the future. MJ Nearby places will not be going on... F4LL0U7 I'm not sure they could develop an ad that's targeted enough to get me to buy Coke. F4LL0U7 I guess I might consider it if the vending machine held a family member hostage or something. James F I don't know if I should be concerned that you said *might* consider it.... F4LL0U7 What can I say, I'm just not very receptive to ads. Dedren What about Water, Sprite, SimplyOrange, Powerade, Minute Maid? Surely one of those you drink...all Coke. F4LL0U7 I mean, of course I drink water, but I get it from the filtered pitcher in my fridge. No to the others. Adrian quickest way to turn me off on a product. Bluetooth is only on in my car anyway so good luck with it. As soon as someone figures out how to spoof it and annoy people in public, it will go away. Max Johnson I thought it's been NFC and GPS all this time. At least from my Android Pay app. blindexecutioner I would literally break my phone if I got an ad as I walked by a pop machine (or whatever) if I couldn't opt out of it of course.. I would switch to iOS that day. If it happened on iOS I would stop using smart phones altogether. tehboogieman You could just turn off bluetooth. Or you know, there's your way rndusrnm479461 iOS also supports this same thing. rndusrnm479461 I've read the whole article and even watched some of that video and I still don't get it - what do your "preferences" affect in the ads? How will it affect what the ad displays? Does it just play the ad you're more likely to prefer from 5 different ads? I'm confused... Why is such system necessary for something simple like coke? Would make more sense for a bus stop ad or other kinds of billboards.

[Minority Report] Google and Coca-Cola may target personalized ads at you - in real life Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/10 11:27am PDTMay 10, 2017 20 Plus 1 on G+ 38 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares102 News Videos Google and Coca-Cola's partnership effort for in-store advertising displays looks to be bearing fruit. The advertising system uses DoubleClick's preference and tracking data combined with Google's Beacon Platform to serve up targeted ads by pulling data from passing smartphones. With that info, displays are able to select content based on your preferences in the form of advertisements specifically targeted to passersby. In a recent grocery store pilot program the Minority Report-style ads performed quite very well. This isn't actually that new. It was discussed at a few places in the last couple months since the details were revealed at Google's conference. But, it seems to have quite effectively flown under the radar for that time, considering how cool it is. Coca-Cola made a detailed post about it on one of their social promotion sites in April as well, in which they talked about the potential environments for these tracking signage systems, like movie theaters and other Retail venues than just grocery stores. Google's partnership with Coca-Cola for this system has been discussed off-and-on for a few years. Back at the National Automatic Merchandising Association's OneShow in 2016 Google talked about the potential as applied to vending machines, and said that Google and Coca-Cola were working together on Bluetooth beacons for vending, but this is the first time I've actually gotten to see what it looks like and how it performs. Coca-Cola's Greg Chambers, at Google's recent Cloud Next Conference, said that it has been experimenting with small tests into proximity marketing since at least 2015 when they first started working with Google on a prototype. The two companies tested things with a pilot for the system in 250 Albertson's grocery stores, in which Coca-Cola saw some incredible results. There was a one year ROI on Coca-Cola products displayed by the system, and a spillover effect from so-called "category-lift," in the form of a total one-month ROI for all nearby soda products — i.e., this system sells a lot of soda for Coca-Cola and all other brands near it. There's no word yet on when or how Coca-Cola might roll this out to other stores, but given how positive the results were for the pilot tests, it is likely you'll see one someday at the end of the soda aisle in your local grocery. On a more technical note, I'm not sure exactly what sort of data is being sent to the displays by nearby phones or how it is taken. Allegedly the system uses Google's Eddystone beacons, which exchange information with nearby phones using Bluetooth low energy. This is the first time I've heard of Google's Beacon Platform actually being used, combined with DoubleClick's targeting advertising systems, to target people in the physical world. The privacy-conscious might express some concern at the potential of having your phone communicate your preferences to an in-store display, but I would hope and assume that any identifying information is stripped out. Either way, we're one step closer to this. Source: Digital Strategy Consulting Tags beacon platform beacons bluetooth low energy Coca-Cola Eddystone Targeted advertisements video subscribe ...

Anu6is Stop being absurd, how else would you know what you NEED? WesleySmalls Actually, you do. People require social interaction, it's a very strong part of our being. Humans generally don't like to be alone, and very much can't over longer periods of time. Because of this, people tend to follow each other's example in one way or another, advertising is just one of the many examples Ben Yeah, your phone communicating with a vending machine to give you personalised advertisements is not in any way 'social interaction'. WesleySmalls I did not say anything about that, it wasn't even remotely close, nor was the post I commented on. But of course, else you had to actually comment on my actual post, and realize that it's true that people follow other people Prezes Dyrektor But you are making it sound like advertising is indispensable in our lives. Well guess what, ads is the reason why I cut cable tv, they don't have those fancy adblockers. Ads is the reason I mostly listen to local academic radio without any. Etc. Ads and marketing are evil, and we are being manipulated every day. Now excuse me as I run to grab some sugar soda and candy.

Or are people going to start getting ads for the sex toys they have in their amazon cart? Bane✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ There's one way to find out. Add some (more) sex toys to your Amazon cart and then go grocery shopping! Ryne Hager I actually haven't seen one in my area yet, when I go out west in a month I'll see if I can drop by an Albertson's. Carlos Rodríguez So, you have sex toys in your cart, right? Ryne Hager Obviously not enough sex toys, if you're questioning that. Carlos Rodríguez “( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)” yochanan Albertson's are now all Safeway's, FYI. Ryne Hager Albertson's acquired Safeway back in 2015, indeed. yochanan Right, but it wasn't until fairly recently (at least in Northern CO) that Albertsons stores have been converted into Safeway's. Bane✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, I'm a blank slate to advertising. I might as well be a ghost. I block all ads, turn off all targeted options everywhere, and never click on any. I guess I'll have to turn off Bluetooth when I'm in stores now too. Fadakar lol if you think your record is clean you need to re-evaluate how seriously you want to take privacy. James F This. People underestimate how much of a digital footprint they leave, even if they do turn off everything. EowynCarter True. And if they are, they wouldn't show me ads for coca cola, I just don't like that. And sodas in general. Cakefish Agreed, if I have to endure advertising it might as well be about products that actually interest me. Bewear I am a fan of your picture edits, Ryne. Ryne Hager What a coincidence, I am also a fan of your work. I kept a Bewear in my party for most of Moon. Anu6is lol! Lord Argyris My party was boring. Two of them were from Gen I, and apart from my starter, only one other member was from Gen VII. Now really, Nintendo should get in on this whole Coke-Google partnership thing. Maybe put something in their 3DS games that ties into this advertising platform. "Oh, so you're raising a bunch of Fire-type Pokemon. I'll bet you're feeling pretty hot right about now. Know what would cool you right down? A nice, ice cold COKE." Ryne Hager I mean, with the launch event Munchlax and Munchlax/Snorlax available on the first island, who in their right mind didn't take a Gen I Snorlax to end game. Michael Oghia I came here just to give you a +1 for Hypno Toad. Steve Actually noticed this happening to me recently when near the vending machine at my job. Guessing the capabilities will be endless and more diverse when full-on set-ups are placed everywhere. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7ea9fde9939850ddee856f08d34c3e8a98a6c90461c779f049060ec4e655b8c6.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f87dc3afe5a1492c33e179552b9fcf3259d388ef4a1a6cfed7951d9612faeae6.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/da689e538e0681368f0ef1dac408a796aa111781564a9ded426c4639fbeab351.jpg F4LL0U7 Disabling Nearby will disable invasive ads, you say? Done! Morten Ulv Google usually have a way to opt out. james fuston https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPGgTy5YJ-g Ben Nothing better than a new way to sell people tooth-rotting, diabetes-causing sugar water. Nicholas Conrad *This* is the gateway to AR! Aing actual R; genius! abqnm Are these connected to the "Nearby" activity in Google Settings? (Which also interestingly enough at some point has earned the ability to add the Nearby activity directly to the homescreen. Don't know when it appeared as I don't open that screen often, but it's now an option in the overflow menu.) James F Beacons typically use Bluetooth. abqnm Yes, and Google's Nearby uses Bluetooth LE scanning and Play Services location. But with Google being a part of it, I'm asking if it is directly related to the Nearby function. I am not asking for how beacons typically work. MJ Double checked BT is off on my phone... The only time ever use it is when play music on a BT speaker which I don't do when grocery shopping. "With that info, displays are able to select content based on your preferences in the form of advertisements specifically targeted to passersby" How does these ads work exactly? I am not watching a 54min video. Dedren You don't need bluetooth on per say. It just uses that tech. I believe you will have to enable Nearby places, which is disabled by default but will probably be enabled by default in the future. MJ Nearby places will not be going on... F4LL0U7 I'm not sure they could develop an ad that's targeted enough to get me to buy Coke. F4LL0U7 I guess I might consider it if the vending machine held a family member hostage or something. James F I don't know if I should be concerned that you said *might* consider it.... F4LL0U7 What can I say, I'm just not very receptive to ads. Dedren What about Water, Sprite, SimplyOrange, Powerade, Minute Maid? Surely one of those you drink...all Coke. F4LL0U7 I mean, of course I drink water, but I get it from the filtered pitcher in my fridge. No to the others. Adrian quickest way to turn me off on a product. Bluetooth is only on in my car anyway so good luck with it. As soon as someone figures out how to spoof it and annoy people in public, it will go away. Max Johnson I thought it's been NFC and GPS all this time. At least from my Android Pay app. blindexecutioner I would literally break my phone if I got an ad as I walked by a pop machine (or whatever) if I couldn't opt out of it of course.. I would switch to iOS that day. If it happened on iOS I would stop using smart phones altogether. tehboogieman You could just turn off bluetooth. Or you know, there's your way rndusrnm479461 iOS also supports this same thing. rndusrnm479461 I've read the whole article and even watched some of that video and I still don't get it - what do your "preferences" affect in the ads? How will it affect what the ad displays? Does it just play the ad you're more likely to prefer from 5 different ads? I'm confused... Why is such system necessary for something simple like coke? Would make more sense for a bus stop ad or other kinds of billboards. Joey1058 I hate to tell you folks this, but I've been out in the wilderness preaching this for at least a good 10 years, if you go by my 2007 blog post: http://joey1058.blogspot.com/2007/07/robots-dreams-is-vending-machine-robot.html Cakefish ALL GLORY TO THE HYPNOTOAD!!!

The surprise announcement seems to indicate that Google is pushing more into the VR space, with Owlchmey having been at the forefront of the emerging VR gaming space. The added resources of Google could result in some really big things ahead for both the developer and VR as a whole. “Today is a REAAAALLY BIG day for Owlchemy,” explained the dev in their announcement. “We’re positively thrilled to announce that Owlchemy Labs has been acquired by Google!” “We set out on a journey over six years ago to build the kinds of games we wanted to see exist. Over those years, we learned that Owlchemy, at its core, cares deeply about a few key things: building quality multi-platform games, solving tough problems with a small but absurdly talented team, sharing our learnings with the community, and Austin’s famous tacos. Now, as we look to the future with Google by our side, we couldn’t be happier. Our plan to build awesome things will continue forward stronger than ever.” According to the developer, this acquisition means only good things. They promise to continue work on games for HTC Vive, Oculus Rift, and PlayStation VR, and that those games will still focus on “hand interactions”. Motion controls and room scale has been a big part of Owlchemy’s two latest titles, so it’s good to see that they’ll continue pushing the technology. “It’s incredibly exciting that Google and Owlchemy are so well aligned on our goals and vision for the future of VR,” the developer continued before looking back on the history of the studio. Owlchemy started small and has found success in their VR efforts, such as Job Simulator. “Job Simulator was our overnight success many years in the making. We pushed in VR so early and so hard that we were repeatedly told we were crazy, but we knew that we would never be satisfied by making a ‘safe bet’.” The post closed by looking to the future, which the studio believes is only better thanks to this acquisition. “The future of VR is extremely bright, so we’re donning our lab goggles just in case.” Calling All Writers: Become a contributor and write about games at AOTF!

Owlchemy will keep releasing VR games for multiple platforms, but with backing from Google — similar to Tilt Brush studio Skillman & Hackett, which Google acquired in 2015. “We have a slate of original games that we have in [the] production and prototyping phase, and we're going to continue to do that,” says Owlchemy co-founder Alex Schwartz. “We're very excited to continue to do that with the support of Google behind us.” Owlchemy is known for developing games that closely mimic using real hands, and a blog post assures readers that it’s “continuing to focus on hand interactions and high quality user experiences, like with Job Simulator.” Schwartz says that full-motion hand tracking is “kind of our key factor.” That stands in contrast to Google’s current VR platform, Daydream — which uses a remote with limited motion controls. “We have a pretty big vision” for virtual and augmented reality, says Google VR and AR engineering director Relja Markovic. “Daydream's a great product — I love my Daydream. But there will be many, many things that come after that.” “I don't think we're done exploring how you interact with controls in your hand.” It’s difficult to read too much into what this means, and Markovic points out that Google has released products purely for non-Google headsets, like Tilt Brush and Google Earth. But the acquisition does feel like it’s pointing toward something beyond the current version of Daydream. “If you think about where VR and AR are going, especially AR and Tango, and other ways of interacting with your environments, I don't think we're done exploring how you interact with controls in your hand. That's not saying ‘Oh, and therefore we're going to bring Job Sim to Daydream,’” he says. “But there's a lot of learning to still be done in that space as well.” Schwartz and Markovic say Owlchemy will keep engaging with the larger VR development community, sharing knowledge and best practices — as well as potentially contributing to Google’s experimental Daydream Labs program. Owlchemy didn’t start as a VR studio — in 2011, it released the controversial satirical game Smuggle Truck, followed by the fluffy-animal-themed update Snuggle Truck. But it was one of the first studios to work with the initial Oculus Rift development kit in 2013, and Job Simulator was a launch title for the PlayStation VR, HTC Vive, and Oculus Touch motion controllers. In the fairly small and new world of VR gaming, it’s one of the industry’s major success stories; Job Simulator passed $3 million in sales at the start of 2017. Google will probably say more about virtual reality at its I/O developer conference next week, although there have been few rumors about what we might see, and Schwartz says Owlchemy isn’t imminently announcing any new projects. But the acquisition suggests that at the very least, Google is still working on its push to develop more VR content, and that in contrast to Facebook-owned company Oculus — which recently closed its VR film studio in order to fund external projects — it’s comfortable keeping talent in-house.

Big, successful companies have figured out that "fast = more money," and so they cater to consumers' insatiable demand for instant gratification. By doing so, they build a strategic advantage and a stronger business. Luckily, there are areas of business where we don't need to invest millions to deliver more speed. In fact, we can leverage free, open-source projects like Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) from Google to make mobile web pages faster — and, as I'll explain in this post, that can easily turn into a significant improvement in the bottom line. And even though AdWords doesn't seem to officially support AMP yet, advertisers can still use the technology to serve faster landing pages. That can lead to big gains in conversion rates and quality, and in turn help advertisers in a crowded field gain that all-important edge over the competition. Google really cares about speed From its earliest days, Google has painstakingly labored to make search results pages load so fast that users would get an answer before their minds could start to wander and start to think about something else. According to KissMetrics, Google once ran an experiment to show 30 search results instead of 10. The extra 500 milliseconds it took to load the page led to a 20 percent drop in usage. Google is so serious about speed that there have even been cases where they showed no ads on the SERPs because the ad auction took too long. Rather than delaying the page from loading, they simply served it with no ads. They knew that the short-term revenue loss of a few clicks would be more than made up in the long run when happy users came back to do many more searches. But as hard as Google works on making their own site really fast, they lose a lot of control as soon as the user clicks on a result and leaves Google. Despite efforts like preloading pages with the Google toolbar (which no longer exists), building a faster browser in Google Chrome and incentivizing fast load times by making them part of the Quality Score (QS) algorithm, the mobile web is often still a painfully slow place to visit. Making the mobile web faster with AMP In October 2015, Google developed Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) to make the mobile web faster for users. Their search results page began highlighting AMP pages in February 2016. They recently announced that there are now 1.7 billion AMP pages from 860,000 domains, with 35 million new pages being added every week. If you read news stories on your mobile device from Google Search results, you've likely encountered AMP pages. They are marked with a lightning bolt icon (image) and they load really, really fast. AMP states that the first listing usually loads in less than one second. AMP is an open-sourced standard (www.ampproject.org), so it can be used for free by anyone who wants to make their mobile pages faster. Its goal is to help developers create mobile web landing @ https://www.janbaskdigitaldesign.com/ The AMP cache, something where developers have to rely on Google to support it, but with additional benefits once that support is enabled. AMP support in AdWords AdWords doesn't favor ads that lead to AMP landing pages, nor do they load them from the AMP cache. But advertisers can still get all the speed advantages from AMP's cleaner code hygiene. AMP is a web standard, so advertisers can use it today to create faster landing pages which typically have a positive impact on bounce rates, conversion rates, time on site, and maybe even quality metrics (more on this below).

With 40% of its sales now coming through mobile devices, it can hardly be a surprise. But could it be the sector that finally drives all retailers to embrace new technology and new ideas, new paradigms and new ways of doing business? According to the UK FMCG Deep Dive – Taking Stock of the Future of Grocery report from Criteo, 7% of UK grocery sales are now online and 40% of those are mobile. This is driven by our love of click and collect, but it also shows how shoppers are radically changing how they shop. A decade ago ordering online using a mobile and then collecting it in store would have seemed like a crazy idea. Shopping on a mobile is sensible enough, but having it put aside and then collected? Madness: if anything this was a backward step. But, as with the vote for Brexit or Trump becoming president, people are driving strange things to happen (you watch, Jeremy Corbyn will be PM by the summer, I kid you not!) and retailers need to start catering to what they want. This is what is driving the grocery industry to start to embrace change. Tesco this week has announced plans to allow Google Home users to add things to their Tesco shopping basket via the Google personal assistant device. Moreoever, the device is also going to understand what the shoppers favourites and frequently purchased items are and use that to refine how it interacts with the shopper. This is interesting in two ways. Firstly, it marks a major move by a major retailer towards embracing a very new technology. Secondly, it marks a major shift in how a big brand interfaces with its customers, ceding some of that brand touch to another massive brand. The move to embrace home help technology is canny, but not surprising. Not everyone has an Google Home – nor an Amazon Echo – and Apple’s version hasn’t been released yet, but the age of speech interaction is upon us and it won’t belong before we are talking to the internet. Hey, we might even start using smartwatches. This will make shopping more natural and more fun and will slowly become part of the everyday (although, given that the great British shopper embraced click and collect, who knows where speech commerce will go – probably everyone yelling at their Echo or Home pod what time they want to collect from the shops, but I digress). Right now Tesco has got into bed with Google, but I am sure that if it takes off – and when Apple introduces its Siri enabled home assistant hub later this year – major retailers will look to service all of them. There will also be moves to talk to your apps and so on. But that isn’t why this is interesting. What is really interesting is that Tesco has, as I said, ceded control of some of its customer interface to Google. Tesco is a massive brand. With a massive PDF of brand values and brand rules (I’ve seen it!). It values its customers and does all it can to ‘own’ them. But to fit in with the way shoppers want to use technology – especially home assistant devices – they have to hand some of that over to the home device brand. In this case it is Google, but imagine when it is Amazon too. That would be quite a move: Amazon would be the point of contact for shoppers want to dictate their shopping list to their app. This is just the beginning: we are on the verge of retail totally shifting in how it works. How people shop is rapidly changing and even the big retailers are getting on board and having to do things that, a year ago, would have seemed laughably absurd. But we live in topsy-turvey times and anything is possible. While politically it makes me nervous, from a retail perspective I think it is really exciting. And you only have to look at young whippersnappers like Missguided to see what retail should look like. Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Intrusive Interstitials: Guidelines To Avoiding Google’s Penalty By Myriam Jessier May 9th, 2017 AnalyticsMobileResponsive Web Design 4 Comments In 2015, Google announced that mobile searches surpassed desktop searches in at least 10 countries. 56% of traffic1 on major websites comes from mobile. In light of this, Google’s decision to improve the mobile user experience by various means, such as AMP pages2 and a dedicated mobile index, comes across as a sound business move. More than half of the 2 trillion searches3 Google processes each year come from mobile devices. Mobile devices have changed the way we approach search, ushering in new types of habits such as local search, voice search and more. These consumer habits have greatly affected the way search engine providers think about user search intent. A new type of mobile improvement was rolled out by Google. The search giant has decided to launch a war against interstitials that ruin the user experience. As a result, any website found guilty of showing intrusive popups, banners or overlays (called interstitials) will see its content demoted in Google’s mobile search results. We’ll be looking at what’s being penalized, what’s allowed and some workarounds to help you cope with this new penalty. Further Reading on SmashingMag: Link Is Your Responsive Design Working? Google Analytics Will Tell You4 Everything You Need To Know About Google’s Accelerated Mobile Pages5 World Wide Web, Not Wealthy Western Web6 Google’s Mobilegeddon Aftermath: Eight Months Into A Better Mobile Web7 Mobile Reality Link Two years ago, Google introduced a mobile-friendly label8 as it began prioritizing mobile websites. The aim was to push websites that offer a substandard user experience to improve their design, code and content. These guidelines are updated quite often as Google aims to keep the mobile user experience center stage: Mobile-Friendly Test9, Google Search Console AMP10 “Guidelines for Mobile Web Development11,” Smashing Magazine “Responsive Web Design Basics12,” Pete LePage, Web Fundamentals, Google Developers “Enabling Deep Links for App Content13,” Android Developers “Google Algorithm Change History14,” Moz With a dramatically levelled playing field, various elements are fighting to be displayed on one small screen. Coupons, offers, newsletter registration, ads, text, photos, social sharing buttons, and live chat are all vying for some valuable mobile screen space. Often, the visitor pays the price as their mobile experience becomes a confusing mess. Google’s latest penalty aims to change how we think about mobile advertising. Introducing The Intrusive Interstitial Penalty Link One recent change made this year is the intrusive interstitial update15. This algorithm update has one mission: to penalize for intrusive popup ads that affect the mobile user experience. The update rolled out earlier this year. Certain websites saw their mobile rankings in Google lowered. Decrypting The Intrusive Interstitial Update Link First and foremost, it’s a mobile popup penalty. Secondly, it’s an intrusive popup penalty. Google wants to make sure that ads and popups do not interfere with the user experience on a mobile screen. The intent behind devaluing pages with popups and overlays that take up most of the screen is to help users access the content they’ve requested in the first place. What Is The Impact Of This Latest Update? Link Google will no longer consider pages with intrusive interstitials as being mobile-friendly. Bottom line: Obstructing content on mobile with ads or other popups is against Google’s guidelines. The main target of this update is overlays that gray out the content, making the content inaccessible for a few seconds or until the user miraculously manages to tap the minuscule “X” with their sausage fingers to dismiss the ads. Ads displayed over content are no longer acceptable16 on mobile. This includes popups that appear when you load the page from Google or when you scroll down. For many websites, playing according to Google’s rules means removing all barriers17 that could prevent the user from reading the content on the page at any time. What Is An Interstitial? Link Interstitial spaces can be defined as a type of “web page” that appears before or after the page (in a website or an app) expected by the user. Essentially, it is something that blocks out the website or app’s main content. These spaces have served as a promotional tool for many online marketers. They can contain advertisements, surveys, newsletter signup forms, coupons and other various calls to action. What Constitutes An Intrusive Interstitial? Link Intrusive interstitials tend to block most or all of a page, leading to a frustrating experience for desktop and mobile users alike. These ads hinder the experience because they are unexpected and block the content that users seek. On the desktop, they’re annoying at best, but on mobile, intrusive interstitials can ruin the entire experience. Ever had to deal with popups gone rogue on mobile? Google has been relatively straightforward in its definition of what constitutes an intrusive interstitial. A few types of interstitials are problematic, as defined by the new guidelines18: 19 Types of intrusive interstitials, as illustrated by Google. (View large version20) a popup or modal window that blocks most or all of the content on a page (this is basically a full-screen interstitial above the header); a standalone interstitial that’s not responsive and that blocks the content; a layout in which the content above the fold has the look and feel of an interstitial and requires dismissal or scrolling in order for the user to reach the main content beneath the fold. If your popups cover the main content shown on the screen, pop up without user interaction or require a dismissal before disappearing, chances are that they will trigger an algorithmic penalty. Popups that incite users to choose their country or their preferred language are also targets because they fit the description above of what constitutes an intrusive interstitial. They bother readers and are not a necessity. What’s Not Intrusive? Link Not all interstitials are targeted by this penalty. Some exceptions exist, such as interstitials that are in place for legal or ethical reasons. The following popups do not require a change of size, design or position within a page: 21 Types of non-intrusive interstitials, as illustrated by Google. (View large version22) age-verification blockers that act as a shield for certain content, such as alcohol-related or adult content; cookies that use popups that serve as consent notifications as required by the EU; any other type of legally required popup. Gray Area Link The official guidelines provided by Google are pretty vague at times. The company’s definition of what constitutes an intrusive interstitial is not clearcut. Many elements are not addressed, such as: sticky sidebars, related posts, share buttons, live chat boxes, coupon popups. The jury is still out on whether these elements will be targeted by the algorithm update, even if they comply with the guidelines on interstitials. Navigating this gray area can be tricky. If you want to come out on top, we recommend designing these elements in a way that ensures they do not cover any of the page’s actual content. Making sure these notifications do not hinder the user experience can go a long way towards avoiding a penalty. What Is Still Permitted (But Intrusive Nonetheless) Link Make no mistake, as of 10 January 2017, interstitials are a new ranking signal for mobile SEO. It doesn’t necessarily mean that all types of popups should be banned. Intrusive Popups Are Still OK on Desktop Link This penalty targets mobile issues. Overlays, popups and other types of interstitials will live another day on desktop. 23 Atlas Obscura’s desktop website overlay. (View large version24) Interstitials Triggered by Exit Intent Are Still Allowed Link Here is Google’s John Mueller’s advice on interstitials triggered by exit intent: At the moment, those wouldn’t count. What we’re looking for is, really, interstitials that show up on the interaction between the search click and going through the page and seeing the content. So, that’s kind of the place we’re looking for those interstitials. What you do afterwards, like if someone clicks on stuff within your website or closes the tab or something like that, then that’s kind of between you and the user. Page-to-Page Interstitials Will Not Be Penalized Link Google is not looking to penalize all pages with interstitials, only the ones that searchers could land on from search results. It’s still OK to display an interstitial when a user navigates from one of your pages to another. If a user can find a page by searching for something on Google, then you’ll need to ensure that this page has no intrusive interstitials. If after landing on this page, the user decides to navigate to another page on the website that is not listed by Google, then interstitials would be allowed on that page25. Sounds a bit convoluted, but this has been confirmed by Google. Will You Be Penalized? Link Google’s main objective is to make the web more accessible, intuitive and usable, especially for mobile users. If your popups serve a real purpose that add value for the user, chances are you should be OK. How The Penalty Works? Link This mobile interstitial penalty is rolling out on a recrawling basis26. Basically, the next time Google’s bot crawls your website after 10 January 2017, it will evaluate the interstitials present on mobile. The penalty could hurt, but so far the reported impact has been minimal27. How To Identify Intrusive Interstitials Link Auditing your popups is a great way to determine whether your mobile website is compliant. Start by reviewing the mobile popups, because desktop popups are not going to be penalized. Prefer small messages such as banners, inlines and slide-ins for mobile pages. 28 Atlas Obscura’s mobile website interstitial. Testing Tool Link Google has stated that it will not release an official tool to test websites. However, there is a tool out there, Interstitial Penalty Check29, that uses image recognition to identify potential interstitials on your pages. It measures how much space popups take on the screen to flag the ones at risk. Audit Your Popups Link Identify required interstitials, such as age-verification popups and cookie notifications. Identify all other popups, and evaluate them according to the amount of space they take up. Make note of any third-party scripts present on your website that might trigger popups. You will often find these if you use a CMS. For WordPress users, check your plugins. Some plugins used to display popup messages for coupons, membership offers, promotions and other types of ads need to be reviewed. You might have to adjust the sizes using the plugins’ settings. Interstitial Design Guidelines Link Any banners that take up a “reasonable amount of space” will not be targeted. That’s great news! However, no exact guidelines have been communicated by Google. The recommended size is 15% or less, even in landscape mode, because it still allows readers to access several lines of text. Keep In Mind What Google Is Looking For In A Positive User Experience Link Popups aren’t being banned, but marketing efforts will have to adapt to these new restrictions. Let’s rephrase that: Marketing efforts will have to respect the user’s screen space. Try to redesign any interstitials that were previously considered essential to marketing efforts. You can replace them with a link to a separate page or an inline ad, for example. For instance, language-selection interstitials30 can be phased out, in favor of a banner on the website. But first evaluate whether such an element is worth that much screen space: Users arrive with a linguistic context already if they’ve come from Google. Workarounds Link If your website suffers a significant drop-off in conversion following the removal of some interstitials, then you’ll have to work around the issue. Luckily for you, only pages listed in Google’s search results are being targeted. If a user navigates to another page on your website, then a popup placed there would not be a problem for Google. The entry page is the issue for the search engine. This isn’t particularly recommended, but if interstitials remain the best way to convert users for your website, then consider keeping them on the website (and away from Google by placing a no-index tag in your code). Keep in mind that this would mean cutting off organic traffic from Google to that page. News From The War On Interstitials Link False Positives Penalties Link Some websites have been hit by Google’s mobile interstitial penalty even though they were adhering to the guidelines31. Other websites that should have been affected have not encountered any negative impact yet. So, what do you do if you’ve been hit unfairly? Head on over to the Google Webmaster Help forum to give feedback to the Google team. How to Recover From a Penalty? Link If your traffic has suffered because of this penalty, we recommend auditing your popups and removing the ones deemed intrusive. Once that’s done, you’ll have to wait until Google recrawls your pages. You can also submit your pages via the Google Search Console’s fetch and submit tool to kickstart the recrawling effort a bit. This should remove the demotion32 in mobile ranking inflicted on your website. Google’s John Mueller confirms that the demotion would be removed in real time when the pages are recrawled and reindexed. This penalty is doled out in real time, meaning that recovery will depend on how frequently Google indexes those pages. For most websites, though, “real time” means waiting until each individual page is crawled by Google and the demotion is removed. Adapt Or Die: Looking Into New Strategies Link Yes, popups are frustrating, but companies use them because they are effective. SumoMe33 shares recent findings that establish the interstitial’s track record: An average conversion rate is 3.09%, versus 9.28% on average for high-performing popups. Removing revenue-generating interstitials could hurt websites at first, but losing organic search traffic could hurt their revenues even more. Designers, developers and marketers must work together to find new, non-intrusive ways to generate revenue. A sound strategy would be to leverage content marketing to educate audiences and guide them through the buying process. This means moving away from interruption marketing towards permission marketing. The first can be defined as an annoying version of the traditional way of doing marketing via advertising, promotion and sales, whereas the latter is about promoting and selling a product to a potential client who explicitly agrees to receive marketing information. Google is aware that many websites are supported by ads. Its AdSense is based in part on this revenue model. There are pros and cons to this new update. It could mean more time on website, more page views and a lower bounce rate, but it could still harm revenue in the short to medium term. Google representatives have stated publicly that they don’t want confusing ads — so, if there’s any question about what is an ad and what is the main content, you could have a problem. Therefore, label your ads as sponsored content, make them unobtrusive, and you should be fine. In the meantime, audit your popups, cookie notifications, overlays and big banners to make sure they comply with Google’s new guidelines. Make sure they don’t take up more than 15% of the screen to avoid a penalty. If you do get penalized, don’t panic; fix the issues, and wait for Google’s bot to visit your website again. The bot should notice your efforts and remove the penalty.

But a new feature baked into Google’s search tools on your phone is designed to fill up your social calendar. In the latest update to the Google app on Android and iOS (as well as anywhere else you can find a search bar on your phone), you should begin seeing a new interface for local events. For example, when you search for “concerts this weekend” you’ll see a new Events tab at the top of your search results. You’ll be able to quickly view events happening today, tomorrow, or next week, all presented in a calendar-style view that lets you easily see the date, time, and location. Tapping “more events” will expand the view to see additional dates, and you can tap again for more details or to buy tickets. The new interface doesn’t seem to be live yet, but Google says it will respond to a variety of queries, including something as general as “events near me.” The results will largely be populated by popular sites like Eventbrite and Meetup, but Google is also encouraging promoters to mark search terms as events to keep results varied and current. It’s unclear whether an update to the Google app will be needed to use the new events interface, but it should be rolling out to browsers on iOS and Android shortly. Why this matters: We use Google for just about everything, but unless it’s a major event, it’s not always the best way to find something to do in our neighborhood. With a new focus on local events, Google could become our go-to planning tool as well.                                                    To comment on this article and other Greenbot content, visit our Facebook page or our Twitter feed.

[Minority Report] Google and Coca-Cola may target personalized ads at you - in real life Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/10 11:27am PDTMay 10, 2017 20 Plus 1 on G+ 38 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares102 News Videos Google and Coca-Cola's partnership effort for in-store advertising displays looks to be bearing fruit. The advertising system uses DoubleClick's preference and tracking data combined with Google's Beacon Platform to serve up targeted ads by pulling data from passing smartphones. With that info, displays are able to select content based on your preferences in the form of advertisements specifically targeted to passersby. In a recent grocery store pilot program the Minority Report-style ads performed quite very well. This isn't actually that new. It was discussed at a few places in the last couple months since the details were revealed at Google's conference. But, it seems to have quite effectively flown under the radar for that time, considering how cool it is. Coca-Cola made a detailed post about it on one of their social promotion sites in April as well, in which they talked about the potential environments for these tracking signage systems, like movie theaters and other Retail venues than just grocery stores. Google's partnership with Coca-Cola for this system has been discussed off-and-on for a few years. Back at the National Automatic Merchandising Association's OneShow in 2016 Google talked about the potential as applied to vending machines, and said that Google and Coca-Cola were working together on Bluetooth beacons for vending, but this is the first time I've actually gotten to see what it looks like and how it performs. Coca-Cola's Greg Chambers, at Google's recent Cloud Next Conference, said that it has been experimenting with small tests into proximity marketing since at least 2015 when they first started working with Google on a prototype. The two companies tested things with a pilot for the system in 250 Albertson's grocery stores, in which Coca-Cola saw some incredible results. There was a one year ROI on Coca-Cola products displayed by the system, and a spillover effect from so-called "category-lift," in the form of a total one-month ROI for all nearby soda products — i.e., this system sells a lot of soda for Coca-Cola and all other brands near it. There's no word yet on when or how Coca-Cola might roll this out to other stores, but given how positive the results were for the pilot tests, it is likely you'll see one someday at the end of the soda aisle in your local grocery. On a more technical note, I'm not sure exactly what sort of data is being sent to the displays by nearby phones or how it is taken. Allegedly the system uses Google's Eddystone beacons, which exchange information with nearby phones using Bluetooth low energy. This is the first time I've heard of Google's Beacon Platform actually being used, combined with DoubleClick's targeting advertising systems, to target people in the physical world. The privacy-conscious might express some concern at the potential of having your phone communicate your preferences to an in-store display, but I would hope and assume that any identifying information is stripped out. Either way, we're one step closer to this. Source: Digital Strategy Consulting Tags beacon platform beacons bluetooth low energy Coca-Cola Eddystone Targeted advertisements video subscribe ...

Anu6is Stop being absurd, how else would you know what you NEED? WesleySmalls Actually, you do. People require social interaction, it's a very strong part of our being. Humans generally don't like to be alone, and very much can't over longer periods of time. Because of this, people tend to follow each other's example in one way or another, advertising is just one of the many examples Ben Yeah, your phone communicating with a vending machine to give you personalised advertisements is not in any way 'social interaction'. WesleySmalls I did not say anything about that, it wasn't even remotely close, nor was the post I commented on. But of course, else you had to actually comment on my actual post, and realize that it's true that people follow other people Prezes Dyrektor But you are making it sound like advertising is indispensable in our lives. Well guess what, ads is the reason why I cut cable tv, they don't have those fancy adblockers. Ads is the reason I mostly listen to local academic radio without any. Etc. Ads and marketing are evil, and we are being manipulated every day. Now excuse me as I run to grab some sugar soda and candy.

Or are people going to start getting ads for the sex toys they have in their amazon cart? Bane✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ There's one way to find out. Add some (more) sex toys to your Amazon cart and then go grocery shopping! Ryne Hager I actually haven't seen one in my area yet, when I go out west in a month I'll see if I can drop by an Albertson's. Carlos Rodríguez So, you have sex toys in your cart, right? Ryne Hager Obviously not enough sex toys, if you're questioning that. Carlos Rodríguez “( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)” yochanan Albertson's are now all Safeway's, FYI. Ryne Hager Albertson's acquired Safeway back in 2015, indeed. yochanan Right, but it wasn't until fairly recently (at least in Northern CO) that Albertsons stores have been converted into Safeway's. Bane✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Well, I'm a blank slate to advertising. I might as well be a ghost. I block all ads, turn off all targeted options everywhere, and never click on any. I guess I'll have to turn off Bluetooth when I'm in stores now too. Fadakar lol if you think your record is clean you need to re-evaluate how seriously you want to take privacy. James F This. People underestimate how much of a digital footprint they leave, even if they do turn off everything. EowynCarter True. And if they are, they wouldn't show me ads for coca cola, I just don't like that. And sodas in general. Cakefish Agreed, if I have to endure advertising it might as well be about products that actually interest me. Bewear I am a fan of your picture edits, Ryne. Ryne Hager What a coincidence, I am also a fan of your work. I kept a Bewear in my party for most of Moon. Anu6is lol! Lord Argyris My party was boring. Two of them were from Gen I, and apart from my starter, only one other member was from Gen VII. Now really, Nintendo should get in on this whole Coke-Google partnership thing. Maybe put something in their 3DS games that ties into this advertising platform. "Oh, so you're raising a bunch of Fire-type Pokemon. I'll bet you're feeling pretty hot right about now. Know what would cool you right down? A nice, ice cold COKE." Ryne Hager I mean, with the launch event Munchlax and Munchlax/Snorlax available on the first island, who in their right mind didn't take a Gen I Snorlax to end game. Michael Oghia I came here just to give you a +1 for Hypno Toad. Steve Actually noticed this happening to me recently when near the vending machine at my job. Guessing the capabilities will be endless and more diverse when full-on set-ups are placed everywhere. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7ea9fde9939850ddee856f08d34c3e8a98a6c90461c779f049060ec4e655b8c6.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f87dc3afe5a1492c33e179552b9fcf3259d388ef4a1a6cfed7951d9612faeae6.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/da689e538e0681368f0ef1dac408a796aa111781564a9ded426c4639fbeab351.jpg F4LL0U7 Disabling Nearby will disable invasive ads, you say?

Nicholas Conrad *This* is the gateway to AR! Aing actual R; genius! abqnm Are these connected to the "Nearby" activity in Google Settings? (Which also interestingly enough at some point has earned the ability to add the Nearby activity directly to the homescreen. Don't know when it appeared as I don't open that screen often, but it's now an option in the overflow menu.) James F Beacons typically use Bluetooth. abqnm Yes, and Google's Nearby uses Bluetooth LE scanning and Play Services location. But with Google being a part of it, I'm asking if it is directly related to the Nearby function. I am not asking for how beacons typically work. MJ Double checked BT is off on my phone... The only time ever use it is when play music on a BT speaker which I don't do when grocery shopping.

By Kevin Kalhoefer Conservative outlets are highlighting a pro-fracking group's attempt to convince Google, which recently promised to alter its search algorithm to demote fake news, to also tweak it to purge or demote websites critical of fracking. On May 8, Texans for Natural Gas, an industry group funded by Texas energy companies, published an open letter addressed to Google titled "ANTI-FRACKING ACTIVISM IS FAKE NEWS." The letter, which was highlighted in the industry-funded outlets The Daily Caller and The Daily Signal, referred to Google's recent move to alter its search algorithm to "demote misleading, false, and offensive articles online" before claiming, "We believe many of the most prominent anti-fracking websites have content that is misleading, false, or offensive—if not all three. As a result, we urge you to consider purging or demoting these websites from your algorithm, which in turn will encourage a more honest public discussion about hydraulic fracturing, and oil and natural gas development in general." The pro-fracking group claimed that environmental groups such as the Sierra Club, Earthworks and others were "peddling fake news" about the link between fracking and drinking water contamination. The letter cited a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) study to support its claims, saying that the EPA study "found no evidence of widespread water contamination." The group subsequently urged Google to examine other sites that contradict the findings of the EPA report, stating, "There are certainly other environmental groups that have made similarly false claims about fracking and groundwater risks, despite the conclusions of the EPA and other scientific experts." Yet for all the grandstanding the letter makes about rooting out "misleading" information online, it is full of misleading statements. Though the group claimed that the EPA study "found no evidence of widespread water contamination" from fracking, it neglected to mention that the EPA subsequently removed that sentence from the report on the advice of its Science Advisory Board because the findings of the report did not support that conclusion. Additionally, according to Cleveland.com, a study conducted by Stanford researchers in 2016 "found that common practices in the industry may have widespread impacts on drinking water." Texans for Natural Gas also said in the letter that statements linking fracking to worsening climate change are further examples of a "false claim peddled by anti-fracking groups and environmentalist websites," adding that the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) cited the U.S.'s increased use of natural gas as "an important reason for a reduction of GHG emissions in the United States." But this claim ignores more recent studies, including one by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, that found that methane emissions were actually "one-fifth higher than IPCC estimates," as well as numerous studies that have concluded that methane leakage from natural gas production could negate the climate benefits of natural gas. The term "fake news" has been wildly misused recently, and Texans for Natural Gas is only adding to the trend. If the group wants to cast itself as an ally in Google's effort to root out misleading information, it would do well to provide an honest accounting of scientific research in its letter.

Zinke Orders Native American Activist to 'Be Nice' During a tour of the heavily contested Bears Ears National Monument in Utah on Monday, U.S. Interior Sec. Ryan Zinke pointed a finger at monument supporter Cassandra Begay and told her to "be nice" after she repeatedly questioned the secretary about not spending more time talking with tribal leaders as part of his monuments review. Begay, a tribal liaison with the group Peaceful Advocates for Native Dialogue & Organizing Support, described the encounter as "condescending and unnecessarily aggressive." Footage of the incident shows Begay among a throng of Bears Ears monument supporters crowding around Zinke. At one point, the Native American activist asks the secretary, "When are you going to meet with the tribal leaders? It's kind of unfair that you've only met with them for one hour, sir. Is there a reason why you're not listening to them more?" Zinke turns around, juts his finger at Begay and says, "Be nice." "I'm so nice," Begay responds. "Be nice," Zinke repeats. "Don't be rude. Thank you." "I was scared, and my heart was racing," Begay said in a press statement following the encounter. "It felt condescending and unnecessarily aggressive. I have no idea why asking a simple question to somebody who is on a listening tour would react so aggressively." As EcoWatch reported, the 1.35-million acre Bears Ears National Monument is one of the first targets under President Trump's recent executive orders to review 27 national monuments established by prior presidents. Zinke is on a four-day tour of Utah to inspect two monuments, Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante. The Bears Ears monument, created by President Obama last year, has sparked a fierce debate between Republican lawmakers and conservationists. GOP lawmakers have accused President Obama, who designated more monuments than any other president, of abusing the Antiquities Act to protect land from fossil fuel development. Utah Gov. Gary Herbert and Utah's congressional delegation led by Congressmen Rob Bishop and Jason Chaffetz and Senators Orrin Hatch and Mike Lee have launched a campaign to abolish national monuments. Notably, the interior secretary is touring Bears Ears with monument opponents, Gov. Herbert, Rep. Bishop and San Juan County commissioners. But conservationists and tribal supporters of the Bears Ears monument worry that stripping away the designation could leave the environment and sacred lands vulnerable. "Bears Ears is much more than the preservation of sacred sites and of the environment. It is also the story of our resilience and survival. It is a site of resistance and of restitution," James Singer, a Navajo and Democrat candidate running to unseat Sen. Hatch, said. "I urge Secretary Zinke to stand with us to protect the sacred so that our future generations will continue to walk in harmony." The secretary has met twice with members of the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition, which represents the Hopi, Navajo, Ute Indian Tribe, Ute Mountain Ute and Zuni. The group considers many sites within Bears Ears sacred and has complained that Zinke's time with them was insufficient, according to E&E News. Other monument supporters have also criticized Zinke's lack of a public forum and for allegedly refusing to meet with them. "Tribes are trying to have a voice but every week Utah congressional delegates are claiming that there are no tribes in San Juan county and that no locals support the monument, however there are three tribes in San Juan county and 40-60 percent of its residents support the monument," Begay stated. "We need Secretary Zinke to meet with tribal leaders, who can identify burial sites, ceremonial sites, historic areas, medicinal herbs, and antiquities throughout the monument." Zinke told reporters Tuesday that he has not made up his mind about whether Bears Ears should remain a monument or if its borders should be shrunk or expanded. He has until June 10 to report back to Trump. Keep reading...

The vote to proceed to debate on the resolution failed, 49–51. This rule is a common sense standard to limit wasteful methane pollution from oil and gas operations on public lands. The Congressional Review Act is a controversial and anti-democratic tactic that anti-environmental extremists in Congress attempted to use to push this pro-polluter agenda item forward. "Just when we thought all hope was lost, common sense prevailed today in the United States Congress," Jessica Ennis, Earthjustice senior legislative representative, said. "By preserving this win-win rule that protects public health and saves taxpayers money at the same time, Congress is managing to slowly rebuild its credibility as an institution that can serve as a check against powerful corporate interests." Each year, oil and gas companies leak or deliberately vent millions of tons of methane, a potent climate pollutant, into the atmosphere during oil and gas operations. Methane pollution from these operations not only speeds-up global warming, but is often accompanied by toxic air pollutants like benzene, formaldehyde and ethylbenzene, threatening the health of residents who live nearby. To address this problem, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) recently finalized a waste prevention rule, which reduces methane pollution and enjoys wide public support; in a poll out earlier this year, 81 percent of Western voters surveyed said they supported leaving the BLM methane rule in place. Fifty-one senators voted in accordance with their constituents wishes. Among those Westerners who support the methane pollution safeguard is Bob Arrington, a native born Coloradoan whose first job out of the University of Colorado was designing air pollution control equipment for industrial, chemical and power plants. Now living in Battlement Mesa, he puts his years of expertise to use—working to protect himself and his community from methane and other air pollution from nearby oil and gas operations. "We are surrounded in all directions by Bureau of Land Management land and the oil and gas activities on those lands have direct consequences on our air quality," said Arrington. "They're saying they can't, but it absolutely can be done better and with cost recoveries." The BLM rule requires oil and gas companies to reduce venting, flaring and leaks from industry operations on public lands. Without the rule in place, taxpayers could lose out on $800 million in royalties over the next decade because of venting and flaring natural gas alone, according to a Western Values Project Report.

The country has officially opened its new 600-megawatt offshore wind park under schedule and under budget, according to its developer Gemini. The wind farm will deliver 600 megawatts of renewable electricity to the Dutch grid and eventually generate enough power to meet the electricity needs of around 1.5 million people, or around 785,000 households. The $3 billion project consists of 150 Siemens wind turbines spread across 26 square miles in the North Sea, about 53 miles off the country's northern coast. Gemini is the second largest offshore wind farm in the world, slightly smaller than the 630-megawatt London Array. "Now fully operational, Gemini will produce 2.6 TWh of sustainable energy every year, reducing the Netherlands' CO2 emissions by 1.25 million tonnes," the company's managing director Matthias Haag said. "We are proud to make this contribution to the realization of the Netherlands' sustainability targets." Fossil fuels still make up about 95 percent of The Netherlands' energy supply, but the Dutch government is looking to ramp up the nation's share of renewable energy from 4 percent in 2014 to 16 percent in 2023, with the eventual aim of being carbon neutral by 2050. The AFP reported that over the next 15 years, the wind park will be able to generate about 13 percent of the country's total renewable energy supply, and about 25 percent of its wind power. Gemini "is seen as a stepping stone" in The Netherlands, and has "shown that a very large project can be built on time, and in a very safe environment," Haag said. Keep reading...

Sea salt, especially pink Himalayan salt, has gained some popularity in the past few years for mega health benefits like increased energy and immunity, and improved skin and dental health. But, a team of researchers tested 17 sea salt brands from eight different countries and found some shocking results. Published in Scientific Reports, the team found that only one brand was plastic-free. The rest, which were soaked in water and dissolved, left behind a total of 72 particles. Of those 72 particles, 1 in 10 contained microplastics. Overall, 41.6 percent of those were plastic polymers and 23.6 percent were pigments from plastic materials. The most common plastic polymers were polypropylene and polyethylene, both of which are considered safe plastics by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. But, what's most concerning about microplastics is their prevalence in the ocean. Microplastics come from cosmetic products (think, exfoliating microbeads) or break down from larger plastics over time or through chemical processes. It is estimated that there are about 8 million tonnes of plastic entering the oceans every year. These particles enter the food chain because small organisms like plankton eat the plastic. Microplastics have been found in shrimp, salmon and even whales and seals. The growing problem caused the United Nations to form a global initiative in February to encourage companies to reduce their use of microplastics. California is also taking the lead on banning microbeads and other states are following suit, like Connecticut, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington. There are other solutions being touted to manage the crisis of plastics in our oceans, rivers and lakes. For example, 22-year-old Boyan Slat of The Ocean Cleanup will initiate large-scale trials of his cleanup technology in the Pacific Ocean later this year. Inventors at Bluebird Marine Systems have developed the SeaVax, a solar- and wind-powered ship that can suck up plastic waste. And, Mr. Trash Wheel and Professor Trash Wheel—a pair of floating, solar and hydro-powered trash interceptors—are busy every day keeping Baltimore's Inner Harbor free of plastic trash.

Elon Musk: You Can Now Pre-Order Tesla's Solar Roof Tiles Elon Musk announced via Twitter this morning that Tesla is opening orders for the company's highly anticipated solar roof tiles. "Tesla solar glass roof orders open this afternoon. I think it will be great. More in about 10 hours ..." the CEO tweeted to his 8.6 million followers Wednesday morning. Musk said that the black smooth glass and textured glass tiles will be available for order. The Tuscan and French slate styles will be available in about six months. "Solar roof can be ordered for almost any country," another tweet read. "Deployment this year in the US and overseas next year." The tiles are made of tempered glass integrated with high efficiency solar cells and look just like regular roof tiles. Musk touted in November that the solar roof would cost less than a conventional roof. "It's looking quite promising that a solar roof actually cost less than normal roof before you even take the value of electricity into account," he said. "So the basic proposition would be 'Would you like a roof that looks better than a normal roof, last twice as long, cost less and by the way generates electricity' why would you get anything else." Pricing and installation details have not yet been released. During the unveiling of the technology last year, Musk said that, like electric cars, solar roofs will help accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. "Global warming is a serious crisis and we need to do something about that," Musk said. Keep reading... Show less Renewable Energy Sierra Club 12h Dartmouth College campus / Wikimedia Commons Hanover Becomes First New Hampshire Town to Commit to 100% Renewables The town of Hanover, New Hampshire voted Tuesday night to establish a goal of transitioning to 100 percent clean and renewable energy by 2050. The article approved at Tuesday's town meeting sets a community-wide goal of transitioning to 100 percent renewable electricity by 2030 and a 2050 goal of transitioning heating and transportation to run on clean, renewable sources of energy. Tuesday's vote makes Hanover the 29th city in the country to commit to 100 percent renewable energy and the first in New Hampshire to establish this goal. The vote comes after the Sustainable Hanover Town Committee in December endorsed a transition to 100 percent renewable energy in Hanover for electricity, heat and transportation by 2050. Earlier on Tuesday, the Town of Southampton, New York similarly established a goal to transition to 100 percent renewable energy. "As town manager for the Town of Hanover, I am overjoyed that the town meeting voted unanimously to support a goal of 100 percent renewable energy," said Hanover Town Manager Julia Griffin. "We look forward to working with Sierra Club and Sustainable Hanover to achieve this goal." Town meetings like Tuesday's Hanover town vote have long been a form of direct democracy across New England. Unlike the other 28 cities and towns that have committed to 100 percent clean energy, however, Hanover represents the first municipality in the U.S. to have a goal of 100 percent renewable energy voted on and approved by the residents of that community. Tuesday's vote builds on Hanover's growing investment in renewable energy. In 2014, Hanover was named the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's first Green Power Community in New Hampshire. The town is currently at 22 percent renewable electricity through partnerships with Dartmouth College and other businesses and institutions and town residents. "This is a great day for Hanover. I am so proud to be a resident of Hanover—the first town in New Hampshire to make a commitment to 100% renewable energy and the first municipality in the country to have done it by a vote of its citizenry," said Judith Colla, a member of the Sierra Club Upper Valley's Executive Committee. "I look forward to supporting next steps here in Hanover and helping to spread this campaign to our neighbors throughout the Upper Valley." Other cities to commit to 100 percent clean and renewable energy include major metropolises like San Diego and Atlanta, along with small towns including Abita Springs, Louisiana and Moab, Utah. Burlington, Vermont is the first city in the U.S. to run entirely on clean, renewable energy. Keep reading...

As reported by Gothamist, witnesses said the oil slick could be seen all the way in the Queens borough. The exact amount of oil released into the river is currently unclear, but the New York City Patch reported the Coast Guard needed to declare a "safety zone" in waters around the Greenpoint, Midtown and Red Hook neighborhoods as the discharge spread into the river Monday night. The safety zone was still in effect on Tuesday. "Recreational and human powered vessels may not enter, remain in, or transit through the Safety Zone during the enforcement period unless authorized by the Coast Guard Captain of the Port or designated Coast Guard personnel," a spokeswoman said. "Mariners are requested to exercise caution while in the area." Coast Guard spokeswoman Allyson Conroy told Patch that while dielectric fluid is considered hazardous, it is not as toxic as diesel fuel or petroleum. However, Conroy added that "if humans do get in contact with it," they should immediately "wash their skin and avoid touching their eyes." In a statement, Con Edison said employees and environmental contractors are working on the cleaning and containing the spill. The company is also "working cooperatively" with the U.S. Coast Guard, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and other agencies. Crews are using skimmers and absorbent materials to soak up as much fluid as possible. The New York utility noted that the equipment failure also caused a system voltage dip that impacted the MTA's signaling systems on Sunday, resulting in a disruption to some train service. "We continue to assess the volume of oil that migrated to the East River, and how much oil remains in the ground on our property," Con Edison stated. "The Coast Guard has issued reduced speed restrictions for commercial vessels operating in the area, and banning recreational vessels, to assist the cleanup process. We are taking all actions to contain and clean up the oil as safely and as quickly as possible." Keep reading... Show less Fracking Food & Water Watch 15h First photo of Ineos ship of gas from fracking destined for the UK. Andrew Shields / Friends of the Earth Europe Fracking Pennsylvania to Make Plastics in Scotland? A new report from Food & Water Watch documents how a Scottish energy billionaire's dangerous plan to ship gas liquids across the Atlantic is linked to a controversial pipeline currently under construction across Pennsylvania. The report, The Trans-Atlantic Plastics Pipeline, tracks how the fracking boom in the U.S. has spawned a resurgence in petrochemical and plastics manufacturing. A British company called Ineos has contracted with U.S.-based drilling companies to supply it with ethane, a gas liquid used to make plastics. And in order to deliver these liquids, Sunoco is building the 350-mile Mariner East 2 pipeline across the state. The pipeline ends at the Marcus Hook facility south of Philadelphia, where massive "dragon ships" owned by Ineos carry gas liquids to Norway and Scotland. "Fracking is creating a public health and climate disaster while propping the highly polluting plastics industry," said Wenonah Hauter, executive director of Food & Water Watch. "People on both sides of the Atlantic are suffering the costs, with extremely detrimental effects to our global environment—everything from air pollution and climate altering emissions to the proliferation of plastic waste can be tied to the companies benefiting from this poisonous process." Shipping gas liquids to Europe will drive more fracking in Pennsylvania, with all the accompanying water and air pollution that has been well-documented over the last several years of drilling in the state. That drilling is the rationale behind the Mariner East 2. Though the project has been approved by state regulators, communities along the 350-mile route are fighting against the pipeline's construction through a mix of municipally-oriented strategies and nonviolent direct action tactics. "Sunoco Logistics, aka Energy Transfer Partners, continues to insist that it is providing a 'public benefit,' while in fact it is simply lining its pockets at the expense of the environment," said Ellen Gerhart, a Huntingdon County resident who has been resisting Sunoco's pipeline construction on her land. "We, as landowners facing eminent domain by this company, will continue to resist, and stand in solidarity with our friends in both the U.S. and Europe. The fight is not over." The environmental hazards will be evident across the Atlantic, too. In Scotland, Ineos will be "cracking" the ethane to make ethylene, an industrial process that causes air pollution and creates additional plastic litter, like the small pellets called nurdles that are littering shorelines across the UK. Earlier this month, the Ineos petrochemical facility in Grangemouth, Scotland had a substantial ethylene leak that forced the evacuation of employees. All of the companies involved in the trans-Atlantic pipeline, the report shows, have poor environmental records. The Grangemouth facility has been repeatedly cited by Scottish authorities for emissions and pollutions violations, along with workplace safety violations. One of the drilling companies in Pennsylvania, Range Resources—perhaps best known for a water contamination incident in Texas—has been fined almost $21 million by state regulators. The company has been charged with more than 500 health and safety violations between 2005 and 2016. And Sunoco, according to one analysis, had a higher rate of oil spills than any of its competitors in the U.S. It recently completed a merger with Energy Transfer Partners, the company behind the highly controversial Dakota Access pipeline. Food & Water Watch offers several recommendations to communities and political leaders both sides of the Atlantic, starting with a complete ban on fracking everywhere, a ban on fossil fuel imports and ending fossil fuel infrastructure projects that are harming the environment and contributing to the mounting threats posed by climate change.

By Hilary Hanson 280 If you use Google Photos, you’ve probably experienced the app’s “assistant” feature taking the liberty of creating suggested collages, stories or mini-movies out of your pictures. If you’re like most people, you usually ignore these suggestions. If you’re a cat lover, however, you may be getting a suggestion soon that you definitely won’t want to ignore. That’s because Google may be making you a “Meow Movie.” “I got a notification on my phone last night,” writer Courtney Gillette told HuffPost in an email. “It was from my Google Photos app, and it said, ‘Your Meow Movie is ready.’” The notification included a happy cat face emoji, she said. A “Meow Movie” is, well, what you might expect. And the soundtrack is pretty top-notch, so turn up the volume. Gillette was psyched. “Who doesn’t like an excuse to look at a digital flipbook of photos of their cat?” she said. The “star” of Gillette’s video is Sappho, who as a kitten was abandoned on the eve of Hurricane Sandy and rescued by a “saintly woman.” Gillette later adopted Sappho through Facebook. The two supporting feline cast members, Rufus and Domino, were abandoned in a flower bed and adopted by Gillette’s partner, Emily. Gillette’s not the only person to receive a Meow Movie in the past day. This is probably the weirdest and best thing Google Photos has ever made. It's called Meow Movie. Please listen to the audio if you can! pic.twitter.com/bX9CITgWZj— 💀Mads💀 (@stakeandburn) May 10, 2017 We’ve seen at least two different songs your video might feature. The movies are part of a new Google initiative to highlight the importance of pets in people’s lives, a company spokesperson told HuffPost in an email. “Beginning this week, if you take lots of photos of your dog or cat, you may get a movie celebrating your pet in all their paw-some-ness,” the spokesperson said. Additionally, users will be able to use the app’s movie editor feature to choose from six different pet-themed songs. This article has been updated to include comment from Google.

Elon Musk: You Can Now Pre-Order Tesla's Solar Roof Tiles Elon Musk announced via Twitter this morning that Tesla is opening orders for the company's highly anticipated solar roof tiles. "Tesla solar glass roof orders open this afternoon. I think it will be great. More in about 10 hours ..." the CEO tweeted to his 8.6 million followers Wednesday morning. Musk said that the black smooth glass and textured glass tiles will be available for order. The Tuscan and French slate styles will be available in about six months. "Solar roof can be ordered for almost any country," another tweet read. "Deployment this year in the US and overseas next year." The tiles are made of tempered glass integrated with high efficiency solar cells and look just like regular roof tiles. Musk touted in November that the solar roof would cost less than a conventional roof. "It's looking quite promising that a solar roof actually cost less than normal roof before you even take the value of electricity into account," he said. "So the basic proposition would be 'Would you like a roof that looks better than a normal roof, last twice as long, cost less and by the way generates electricity' why would you get anything else." Pricing and installation details have not yet been released. During the unveiling of the technology last year, Musk said that, like electric cars, solar roofs will help accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. "Global warming is a serious crisis and we need to do something about that," Musk said. Show Comments () Fracking Media Matters for America 12h Peter Byrne, ZUMA Press / Newscom Will Anti-Fracking Websites Be Labeled 'Fake News?' By Kevin Kalhoefer Conservative outlets are highlighting a pro-fracking group's attempt to convince Google, which recently promised to alter its search algorithm to demote fake news, to also tweak it to purge or demote websites critical of fracking. On May 8, Texans for Natural Gas, an industry group funded by Texas energy companies, published an open letter addressed to Google titled "ANTI-FRACKING ACTIVISM IS FAKE NEWS." The letter, which was highlighted in the industry-funded outlets The Daily Caller and The Daily Signal, referred to Google's recent move to alter its search algorithm to "demote misleading, false, and offensive articles online" before claiming, "We believe many of the most prominent anti-fracking websites have content that is misleading, false, or offensive—if not all three. As a result, we urge you to consider purging or demoting these websites from your algorithm, which in turn will encourage a more honest public discussion about hydraulic fracturing, and oil and natural gas development in general." The pro-fracking group claimed that environmental groups such as the Sierra Club, Earthworks and others were "peddling fake news" about the link between fracking and drinking water contamination. The letter cited a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) study to support its claims, saying that the EPA study "found no evidence of widespread water contamination." The group subsequently urged Google to examine other sites that contradict the findings of the EPA report, stating, "There are certainly other environmental groups that have made similarly false claims about fracking and groundwater risks, despite the conclusions of the EPA and other scientific experts." Yet for all the grandstanding the letter makes about rooting out "misleading" information online, it is full of misleading statements. Though the group claimed that the EPA study "found no evidence of widespread water contamination" from fracking, it neglected to mention that the EPA subsequently removed that sentence from the report on the advice of its Science Advisory Board because the findings of the report did not support that conclusion. Additionally, according to Cleveland.com, a study conducted by Stanford researchers in 2016 "found that common practices in the industry may have widespread impacts on drinking water." Texans for Natural Gas also said in the letter that statements linking fracking to worsening climate change are further examples of a "false claim peddled by anti-fracking groups and environmentalist websites," adding that the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) cited the U.S.'s increased use of natural gas as "an important reason for a reduction of GHG emissions in the United States." But this claim ignores more recent studies, including one by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, that found that methane emissions were actually "one-fifth higher than IPCC estimates," as well as numerous studies that have concluded that methane leakage from natural gas production could negate the climate benefits of natural gas. The term "fake news" has been wildly misused recently, and Texans for Natural Gas is only adding to the trend. If the group wants to cast itself as an ally in Google's effort to root out misleading information, it would do well to provide an honest accounting of scientific research in its letter.

Zinke Orders Native American Activist to 'Be Nice' During a tour of the heavily contested Bears Ears National Monument in Utah on Monday, U.S. Interior Sec. Ryan Zinke pointed a finger at monument supporter Cassandra Begay and told her to "be nice" after she repeatedly questioned the secretary about not spending more time talking with tribal leaders as part of his monuments review. Begay, a tribal liaison with the group Peaceful Advocates for Native Dialogue & Organizing Support, described the encounter as "condescending and unnecessarily aggressive." Footage of the incident shows Begay among a throng of Bears Ears monument supporters crowding around Zinke. At one point, the Native American activist asks the secretary, "When are you going to meet with the tribal leaders? It's kind of unfair that you've only met with them for one hour, sir. Is there a reason why you're not listening to them more?" Zinke turns around, juts his finger at Begay and says, "Be nice." "I'm so nice," Begay responds. "Be nice," Zinke repeats. "Don't be rude. Thank you." "I was scared, and my heart was racing," Begay said in a press statement following the encounter. "It felt condescending and unnecessarily aggressive. I have no idea why asking a simple question to somebody who is on a listening tour would react so aggressively." As EcoWatch reported, the 1.35-million acre Bears Ears National Monument is one of the first targets under President Trump's recent executive orders to review 27 national monuments established by prior presidents. Zinke is on a four-day tour of Utah to inspect two monuments, Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante. The Bears Ears monument, created by President Obama last year, has sparked a fierce debate between Republican lawmakers and conservationists. GOP lawmakers have accused President Obama, who designated more monuments than any other president, of abusing the Antiquities Act to protect land from fossil fuel development. Utah Gov. Gary Herbert and Utah's congressional delegation led by Congressmen Rob Bishop and Jason Chaffetz and Senators Orrin Hatch and Mike Lee have launched a campaign to abolish national monuments. Notably, the interior secretary is touring Bears Ears with monument opponents, Gov. Herbert, Rep. Bishop and San Juan County commissioners. But conservationists and tribal supporters of the Bears Ears monument worry that stripping away the designation could leave the environment and sacred lands vulnerable. "Bears Ears is much more than the preservation of sacred sites and of the environment. It is also the story of our resilience and survival. It is a site of resistance and of restitution," James Singer, a Navajo and Democrat candidate running to unseat Sen. Hatch, said. "I urge Secretary Zinke to stand with us to protect the sacred so that our future generations will continue to walk in harmony." The secretary has met twice with members of the Bears Ears Inter-Tribal Coalition, which represents the Hopi, Navajo, Ute Indian Tribe, Ute Mountain Ute and Zuni. The group considers many sites within Bears Ears sacred and has complained that Zinke's time with them was insufficient, according to E&E News. Other monument supporters have also criticized Zinke's lack of a public forum and for allegedly refusing to meet with them. "Tribes are trying to have a voice but every week Utah congressional delegates are claiming that there are no tribes in San Juan county and that no locals support the monument, however there are three tribes in San Juan county and 40-60 percent of its residents support the monument," Begay stated. "We need Secretary Zinke to meet with tribal leaders, who can identify burial sites, ceremonial sites, historic areas, medicinal herbs, and antiquities throughout the monument." Zinke told reporters Tuesday that he has not made up his mind about whether Bears Ears should remain a monument or if its borders should be shrunk or expanded. He has until June 10 to report back to Trump. Keep reading...

The vote to proceed to debate on the resolution failed, 49–51. This rule is a common sense standard to limit wasteful methane pollution from oil and gas operations on public lands. The Congressional Review Act is a controversial and anti-democratic tactic that anti-environmental extremists in Congress attempted to use to push this pro-polluter agenda item forward. "Just when we thought all hope was lost, common sense prevailed today in the United States Congress," Jessica Ennis, Earthjustice senior legislative representative, said. "By preserving this win-win rule that protects public health and saves taxpayers money at the same time, Congress is managing to slowly rebuild its credibility as an institution that can serve as a check against powerful corporate interests." Each year, oil and gas companies leak or deliberately vent millions of tons of methane, a potent climate pollutant, into the atmosphere during oil and gas operations. Methane pollution from these operations not only speeds-up global warming, but is often accompanied by toxic air pollutants like benzene, formaldehyde and ethylbenzene, threatening the health of residents who live nearby. To address this problem, the Bureau of Land Management (BLM) recently finalized a waste prevention rule, which reduces methane pollution and enjoys wide public support; in a poll out earlier this year, 81 percent of Western voters surveyed said they supported leaving the BLM methane rule in place. Fifty-one senators voted in accordance with their constituents wishes. Among those Westerners who support the methane pollution safeguard is Bob Arrington, a native born Coloradoan whose first job out of the University of Colorado was designing air pollution control equipment for industrial, chemical and power plants. Now living in Battlement Mesa, he puts his years of expertise to use—working to protect himself and his community from methane and other air pollution from nearby oil and gas operations. "We are surrounded in all directions by Bureau of Land Management land and the oil and gas activities on those lands have direct consequences on our air quality," said Arrington. "They're saying they can't, but it absolutely can be done better and with cost recoveries." The BLM rule requires oil and gas companies to reduce venting, flaring and leaks from industry operations on public lands. Without the rule in place, taxpayers could lose out on $800 million in royalties over the next decade because of venting and flaring natural gas alone, according to a Western Values Project Report.

The country has officially opened its new 600-megawatt offshore wind park under schedule and under budget, according to its developer Gemini. The wind farm will deliver 600 megawatts of renewable electricity to the Dutch grid and eventually generate enough power to meet the electricity needs of around 1.5 million people, or around 785,000 households. The $3 billion project consists of 150 Siemens wind turbines spread across 26 square miles in the North Sea, about 53 miles off the country's northern coast. Gemini is the second largest offshore wind farm in the world, slightly smaller than the 630-megawatt London Array. "Now fully operational, Gemini will produce 2.6 TWh of sustainable energy every year, reducing the Netherlands' CO2 emissions by 1.25 million tonnes," the company's managing director Matthias Haag said. "We are proud to make this contribution to the realization of the Netherlands' sustainability targets." Fossil fuels still make up about 95 percent of The Netherlands' energy supply, but the Dutch government is looking to ramp up the nation's share of renewable energy from 4 percent in 2014 to 16 percent in 2023, with the eventual aim of being carbon neutral by 2050. The AFP reported that over the next 15 years, the wind park will be able to generate about 13 percent of the country's total renewable energy supply, and about 25 percent of its wind power. Gemini "is seen as a stepping stone" in The Netherlands, and has "shown that a very large project can be built on time, and in a very safe environment," Haag said. Keep reading...

Sea salt, especially pink Himalayan salt, has gained some popularity in the past few years for mega health benefits like increased energy and immunity, and improved skin and dental health. But, a team of researchers tested 17 sea salt brands from eight different countries and found some shocking results. Published in Scientific Reports, the team found that only one brand was plastic-free. The rest, which were soaked in water and dissolved, left behind a total of 72 particles. Of those 72 particles, 1 in 10 contained microplastics. Overall, 41.6 percent of those were plastic polymers and 23.6 percent were pigments from plastic materials. The most common plastic polymers were polypropylene and polyethylene, both of which are considered safe plastics by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. But, what's most concerning about microplastics is their prevalence in the ocean. Microplastics come from cosmetic products (think, exfoliating microbeads) or break down from larger plastics over time or through chemical processes. It is estimated that there are about 8 million tonnes of plastic entering the oceans every year. These particles enter the food chain because small organisms like plankton eat the plastic. Microplastics have been found in shrimp, salmon and even whales and seals. The growing problem caused the United Nations to form a global initiative in February to encourage companies to reduce their use of microplastics. California is also taking the lead on banning microbeads and other states are following suit, like Connecticut, Hawaii, Oregon and Washington. There are other solutions being touted to manage the crisis of plastics in our oceans, rivers and lakes. For example, 22-year-old Boyan Slat of The Ocean Cleanup will initiate large-scale trials of his cleanup technology in the Pacific Ocean later this year. Inventors at Bluebird Marine Systems have developed the SeaVax, a solar- and wind-powered ship that can suck up plastic waste. And, Mr. Trash Wheel and Professor Trash Wheel—a pair of floating, solar and hydro-powered trash interceptors—are busy every day keeping Baltimore's Inner Harbor free of plastic trash.

The article approved at Tuesday's town meeting sets a community-wide goal of transitioning to 100 percent renewable electricity by 2030 and a 2050 goal of transitioning heating and transportation to run on clean, renewable sources of energy. Tuesday's vote makes Hanover the 29th city in the country to commit to 100 percent renewable energy and the first in New Hampshire to establish this goal. The vote comes after the Sustainable Hanover Town Committee in December endorsed a transition to 100 percent renewable energy in Hanover for electricity, heat and transportation by 2050. Earlier on Tuesday, the Town of Southampton, New York similarly established a goal to transition to 100 percent renewable energy. "As town manager for the Town of Hanover, I am overjoyed that the town meeting voted unanimously to support a goal of 100 percent renewable energy," said Hanover Town Manager Julia Griffin. "We look forward to working with Sierra Club and Sustainable Hanover to achieve this goal." Town meetings like Tuesday's Hanover town vote have long been a form of direct democracy across New England. Unlike the other 28 cities and towns that have committed to 100 percent clean energy, however, Hanover represents the first municipality in the U.S. to have a goal of 100 percent renewable energy voted on and approved by the residents of that community. Tuesday's vote builds on Hanover's growing investment in renewable energy. In 2014, Hanover was named the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency's first Green Power Community in New Hampshire. The town is currently at 22 percent renewable electricity through partnerships with Dartmouth College and other businesses and institutions and town residents. "This is a great day for Hanover. I am so proud to be a resident of Hanover—the first town in New Hampshire to make a commitment to 100% renewable energy and the first municipality in the country to have done it by a vote of its citizenry," said Judith Colla, a member of the Sierra Club Upper Valley's Executive Committee. "I look forward to supporting next steps here in Hanover and helping to spread this campaign to our neighbors throughout the Upper Valley." Other cities to commit to 100 percent clean and renewable energy include major metropolises like San Diego and Atlanta, along with small towns including Abita Springs, Louisiana and Moab, Utah. Burlington, Vermont is the first city in the U.S. to run entirely on clean, renewable energy. Keep reading...

As reported by Gothamist, witnesses said the oil slick could be seen all the way in the Queens borough. The exact amount of oil released into the river is currently unclear, but the New York City Patch reported the Coast Guard needed to declare a "safety zone" in waters around the Greenpoint, Midtown and Red Hook neighborhoods as the discharge spread into the river Monday night. The safety zone was still in effect on Tuesday. "Recreational and human powered vessels may not enter, remain in, or transit through the Safety Zone during the enforcement period unless authorized by the Coast Guard Captain of the Port or designated Coast Guard personnel," a spokeswoman said. "Mariners are requested to exercise caution while in the area." Coast Guard spokeswoman Allyson Conroy told Patch that while dielectric fluid is considered hazardous, it is not as toxic as diesel fuel or petroleum. However, Conroy added that "if humans do get in contact with it," they should immediately "wash their skin and avoid touching their eyes." In a statement, Con Edison said employees and environmental contractors are working on the cleaning and containing the spill. The company is also "working cooperatively" with the U.S. Coast Guard, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and other agencies. Crews are using skimmers and absorbent materials to soak up as much fluid as possible. The New York utility noted that the equipment failure also caused a system voltage dip that impacted the MTA's signaling systems on Sunday, resulting in a disruption to some train service. "We continue to assess the volume of oil that migrated to the East River, and how much oil remains in the ground on our property," Con Edison stated. "The Coast Guard has issued reduced speed restrictions for commercial vessels operating in the area, and banning recreational vessels, to assist the cleanup process. We are taking all actions to contain and clean up the oil as safely and as quickly as possible." Keep reading... Show less Fracking Food & Water Watch 15h First photo of Ineos ship of gas from fracking destined for the UK. Andrew Shields / Friends of the Earth Europe Fracking Pennsylvania to Make Plastics in Scotland? A new report from Food & Water Watch documents how a Scottish energy billionaire's dangerous plan to ship gas liquids across the Atlantic is linked to a controversial pipeline currently under construction across Pennsylvania. The report, The Trans-Atlantic Plastics Pipeline, tracks how the fracking boom in the U.S. has spawned a resurgence in petrochemical and plastics manufacturing. A British company called Ineos has contracted with U.S.-based drilling companies to supply it with ethane, a gas liquid used to make plastics. And in order to deliver these liquids, Sunoco is building the 350-mile Mariner East 2 pipeline across the state. The pipeline ends at the Marcus Hook facility south of Philadelphia, where massive "dragon ships" owned by Ineos carry gas liquids to Norway and Scotland. "Fracking is creating a public health and climate disaster while propping the highly polluting plastics industry," said Wenonah Hauter, executive director of Food & Water Watch. "People on both sides of the Atlantic are suffering the costs, with extremely detrimental effects to our global environment—everything from air pollution and climate altering emissions to the proliferation of plastic waste can be tied to the companies benefiting from this poisonous process." Shipping gas liquids to Europe will drive more fracking in Pennsylvania, with all the accompanying water and air pollution that has been well-documented over the last several years of drilling in the state. That drilling is the rationale behind the Mariner East 2. Though the project has been approved by state regulators, communities along the 350-mile route are fighting against the pipeline's construction through a mix of municipally-oriented strategies and nonviolent direct action tactics. "Sunoco Logistics, aka Energy Transfer Partners, continues to insist that it is providing a 'public benefit,' while in fact it is simply lining its pockets at the expense of the environment," said Ellen Gerhart, a Huntingdon County resident who has been resisting Sunoco's pipeline construction on her land. "We, as landowners facing eminent domain by this company, will continue to resist, and stand in solidarity with our friends in both the U.S. and Europe. The fight is not over." The environmental hazards will be evident across the Atlantic, too. In Scotland, Ineos will be "cracking" the ethane to make ethylene, an industrial process that causes air pollution and creates additional plastic litter, like the small pellets called nurdles that are littering shorelines across the UK. Earlier this month, the Ineos petrochemical facility in Grangemouth, Scotland had a substantial ethylene leak that forced the evacuation of employees. All of the companies involved in the trans-Atlantic pipeline, the report shows, have poor environmental records. The Grangemouth facility has been repeatedly cited by Scottish authorities for emissions and pollutions violations, along with workplace safety violations.

Photo by Mike Blake/Reuters In early 2017, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced a new initiative in the city’s ongoing battle with violent crime. The most common solutions to this sort of problem involve hiring more police officers or working more closely with community members. But Emanuel declared that the Chicago Police Department would expand its use of software, enabling what is called “predictive policing,” particularly in neighborhoods on the city’s south side. The Chicago police will use data and computer analysis to identify neighborhoods that are more likely to experience violent crime, assigning additional police patrols in those areas. In addition, the software will identify individual people who are expected to become – but have yet to be – victims or perpetrators of violent crimes. Officers may even be assigned to visit those people to warn them against committing a violent crime. RELATED LINKS Sessions calls Ferguson an emblem of tense relationship with police Any attempt to curb the alarming rate of homicides in Chicago is laudable. But the city’s new effort seems to ignore evidence, including recent research from members of our policing study team at the Human Rights Data Analysis Group, that predictive policing tools reinforce, rather than reimagine, existing police practices. Their expanded use could lead to further targeting of communities or people of color. Working with available data At its core, any predictive model or algorithm is a combination of data and a statistical process that seeks to identify patterns in the numbers. This can include looking at police data in hopes of learning about crime trends or recidivism. But a useful outcome depends not only on good mathematical analysis: It also needs good data. That’s where predictive policing often falls short. Machine-learning algorithms learn to make predictions by analyzing patterns in an initial training data set and then look for similar patterns in new data as they come in. If they learn the wrong signals from the data, the subsequent analysis will be lacking. This happened with a Google initiative called “Flu Trends,” which was launched in 2008 in hopes of using information about people’s online searches to spot disease outbreaks. Google’s systems would monitor users’ searches and identify locations where many people were researching various flu symptoms. In those places, the program would alert public health authorities that more people were about to come down with the flu. But the project failed to account for the potential for periodic changes in Google’s own search algorithm. In an early 2012 update, Google modified its search tool to suggest a diagnosis when users searched for terms like “cough” or “fever.” On its own, this change increased the number of searches for flu-related terms. But Google Flu Trends interpreted the data as predicting a flu outbreak twice as big as federal public health officials expected and far larger than what actually happened. Criminal justice data are biased Neighborhoods with lots of police calls aren’t necessarily the same places the most crime is happening. They are, rather, where the most police attention is – though where that attention focuses can often be biased by gender and racial factors. The failure of the Google Flu Trends system was a result of one kind of flawed data – information biased by factors other than what was being measured. It’s much harder to identify bias in criminal justice prediction models. In part, this is because police data aren’t collected uniformly, and in part it’s because what data police track reflect longstanding institutional biases along income, race and gender lines. While police data often are described as representing “crime,” that’s not quite accurate. Crime itself is a largely hidden social phenomenon that happens anywhere a person violates a law. What are called “crime data” usually tabulate specific events that aren’t necessarily lawbreaking – like a 911 call – or that are influenced by existing police priorities, like arrests of people suspected of particular types of crime, or reports of incidents seen when patrolling a particular neighborhood. Neighborhoods with lots of police calls aren’t necessarily the same places the most crime is happening. They are, rather, where the most police attention is – though where that attention focuses can often be biased by gender and racial factors. It’s not possible to remove the bias Some researchers have argued that machine learning algorithms can address systemic biases by designing “neutral” models that don’t take into account sensitive variables like race or gender. But while it may seem possible in hypothetical situations, it doesn’t appear to be the case in real life. Our recent study, by Human Rights Data Analysis Group’s Kristian Lum and William Isaac, found that predictive policing vendor PredPol’s purportedly race-neutral algorithm targeted black neighborhoods at roughly twice the rate of white neighborhoods when trained on historical drug crime data from Oakland, California. We found similar results when analyzing the data by income group, with low-income communities targeted at disproportionately higher rates compared to high-income neighborhoods. But estimates – created from public health surveys and population models – suggest illicit drug use in Oakland is roughly equal across racial and income groups. If the algorithm were truly race-neutral, it would spread drug-fighting police attention evenly across the city. Similar evidence of racial bias was found by ProPublica’s investigative reporters when they looked at COMPAS, an algorithm predicting a person’s risk of committing a crime, used in bail and sentencing decisions in Broward County, Florida, and elsewhere around the country. These systems learn only what they are presented with; if those data are biased, their learning can’t help but be biased too. Fixing this problem is not a matter of just doing more advanced mathematical or statistical calculations. Rather, it will require rethinking how police agencies collect and analyze data, and how they train their staff to use data on the job. Understanding the biases to improve the data Using predictive analytics in the real world is challenging, particularly when trying to craft government policies to minimize harm to vulnerable populations. We do not believe that police departments should stop using analytics or data-driven approaches to reducing crime. Rather, police should work to understand the biases and limitations inherent in their data. In our view, police departments – and all agencies that use predictive algorithms – should make their systems transparent to public scrutiny. This should start with community members and police departments discussing policing priorities and measures of police performance. That way any software the police use can be programmed to reflect the community’s values and concerns. Ensuring transparency It is not enough to claim or assume an algorithm is unbiased just because it is computerized and uses data: A lack of bias must be proven by evaluating the algorithm’s performance itself. Police agencies should get independent experts or human rights groups to perform regular audits of the algorithms and the data they process. Much like the annual financial reviews large companies do, these examinations can ensure the input data are valid and are analyzed properly to avoid discrimination. If a company wants to claim its algorithm is proprietary and should be kept secret, it should still be required to offer robust testing environments so outside experts can examine its performance. Further, police departments that use algorithms to make predictions about individuals, like Chicago’s Strategic Subject List does, should have policies similar to a new European Union regulation requiring human-understandable explanations of computer algorithms’ decisions. And no agency or company should be allowed to discriminate against people who have been identified by predictive policing. Used correctly, predictive policing can be used to address the complex factors underlying crime trends. For example, rather than stepping up patrols, Toronto and other cities in Canada are using predictive modeling to connect residents to local social services. By improving the quality of data cities collect, and analyzing the information with more transparent and inclusive processes, cities can build safer communities, rather than cracking down harder on areas that are already struggling.

The FTSE 100 business said HMRC was preparing to demand additional tax and interest of £107m for 2015 and 2016. The firm said it would challenge the assessments from HMRC when they are received in the next 30 days. “Diageo does not believe that it falls within the scope of the new diverted profits tax regime,” it said in a statement. The dispute relates to profits that have been moved between the UK and the Netherlands, where Diageo employs 220 people. Diageo said it would have to pay the full amount up front and would then work to resolve the matter with HMRC over the next 12 months. A resolution is not expected until the third quarter of next year. The firm will not make a provision to cover the payment. The multinational tax legislation was introduced by the former chancellor, George Osborne, and came into law in April 2015. It imposes a 25% charge on taxable profits that have been diverted from the UK and was swiftly dubbed the Google tax, although Osborne did not mention the internet search giant by name when he announced the new regime. However, the rule acquired its moniker following a furore over the tech firm’s tax arrangements, which saw it divert its UK revenues through its European headquarters in Ireland. Diageo paid overall tax, in multiple countries including the UK, of £466m last year on pre-tax profits of £2.9bn. The UK tax charge last year was £95m, but Diageo may have paid less if one-off items were deducted. It did not disclose the actual tax paid. There has been a clampdown on tax avoidance by multinationals in Europe by national governments and the EU commission, the executive arm of the European Union. Last year Google agreed a deal with the British tax authorities to pay £130m in back taxes and increase its future tax burden. But the tax deal was criticised by parliament’s public spending watchdog for being secretive and “disproportionately small when compared with the size of Google’s business in the UK”. Osborne described the Google tax deal as a “major success”, but was accused of being too soft on multinationals and the agreement has drawn close attention from Brussels. The European commission ordered Apple to pay a record €13bn (£11bn) in back taxes to Ireland last August, after a three-year investigation into Apple’s complex tax dealings. European competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager said a sweetheart tax deal between Apple and the Irish tax authorities amounted to illegal state aid. Apple and Ireland said they would challenge the ruling. A week ago, Google reached a tax settlement in Italy, when it agreed to pay €306m in back taxes. Italy has aggressively pursued tech giants, and struck a deal with Apple in late 2015 whereby the company would pay €318m in back taxes.

The Echo propelled the idea of a “smart home”, and at a reasonably affordable price to boot. Since then, Amazon has released the cheaper Echo Dot, and even Google joined in with the introduction of Google Home just last year. Despite their apparent usefulness (controlling smart devices around the home by voice, the device’s ability to listen from far away, ordering food, reciting recipes, Bluetooth speaker, etc.) there was still something missing from these smart speakers: visuals. This absence, however, is no longer out of the question as Amazon revealed its third Echo device today, the Amazon Echo Show. The “Show”, of course, indicates that the device can “show” you what’s going on with the inclusion of a screen. From my perspective, it feels as if this is what smart speakers have needed all along. I have yet to purchase a smart speaker, despite feeling that it could be a useful addition to my home. For the most part, I had trouble trusting the speaker’s ability to correctly handle voice commands. Paranoid perhaps, but for me, seeing is believing. I would be much more comfortable using a smart speaker if I had a visual confirmation to go along with it. The Echo Show becomes much more than just a smart speaker with the addition of the 7-inch touchscreen. It is essentially a smart speaker, intercom, and dedicated Fire tablet all in one. The Echo Show can show calendar and weather information on the screen, show YouTube videos, show lyrics to a song, make phone and video calls, and flash news and briefings. The Echo Show also connects with some smart cameras to serve as a video monitor. Otherwise, the Echo Show appears to work exactly as the Echo or Echo Dot do by responding to Alexa voice commands, hands-free. The Echo Show can also connect to the Echo and Echo Dot – or anybody with an Alexa app – to make voice and/or video calls. Personally, I think this is the feature that has me sold on the concept. My biggest concern regarding smart speakers are solved with this addition, and $229 isn’t too steep of a price. Additionally, if you pre-order two Echo Show devices, you can save $100 by using the code SHOW2PACK. It will be interesting to see if this concept catches on. Although I don’t think that smart speakers will become irrelevant, I do think offering a screen will be a welcome option for many. I predict that a lot of people will spring for it, but it will require real-world usage and experience to judge its performance. Amazon has been successful in the past at helping certain products succeed, such as e-readers and cheap-yet-functional tablets, and its plight to make smart speakers a common household gadget seems to be another one we can add to that list considering its strong lead over Google Home, taking an estimated 70% of the smart speaker market, while Google Home holds an estimated 24%. By being the first to offer a smart speaker with an interactive screen, Amazon may soon have an even stronger lead against competitors.  Source:  Investors Amazon Amazon Opinion Amazon Next ArticleYou're leaving too soon, Amazon Underground Don't forget to VOTE!

An array of Gmail users, including BuzzFeed tech reporter Joe Bernstein, readily handed over access to their email to a bogus app. Politicians should be especially wary of suspicious emails given recent events, yet a security test run by the Special Projects Desk found that a selection of key Trump Administration members and associates would click on a link from a fake address. Advertisement The Trump camp has talked a lot about cybersecurity-or " the cyber "-particularly to criticize Hillary Clinton for the risks posed by her private email server and to savor the damage done by hacks against the Democratic National Committee and Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta. Its own record, however, is less than sterling-in January, notably, after Trump named Rudolph Giuliani as a cybersecurity advisor, experts promptly discovered that the Giuliani Security corporate website was riddled with known vulnerabilities . So, three weeks ago, Gizmodo Media Group's Special Projects Desk launched a security preparedness test directed at Giuliani and 14 other people associated with the Trump Administration. We sent them an email that mimicked an invitation to view a spreadsheet in Google Docs. The emails came from the address security.test@gizmodomedia.com, but the sender name each one displayed was that of someone who might plausibly email the recipient, such as a colleague, friend, or family member. Advertisement The link in the document would take them to what looked like a Google sign-in page, asking them to submit their Google credentials. The url of the page included the word "test." The page was not set up to actually record or retain the text of their passwords, just to register who had attempted to submit login information. Some of the Trump Administration people completely ignored our email, the right move. But it appears that more than half the recipients clicked the link: Eight different unique devices visited the site, one of them multiple times. There's no way to tell for sure if the recipients themselves did all the clicking (as opposed to, say, an IT specialist they'd forwarded it to), but seven of the connections occurred within 10 minutes of the emails being sent. At least the recipients didn't go farther. Our testing setup-which included disclaimers for careful readers at each step-did not induce anyone to go all the way and try to hand over their credentials. Sponsored Two of the people we reached-informal presidential advisor Newt Gingrich and FBI director James Comey-replied to the emails they'd gotten, apparently taking the sender's identity at face value. Comey, apparently believing that he was writing to his friend, Lawfareblog.com editor-in-chief Ben Wittes, wrote: "Don't want to open without care. What is it?" And Gingrich, apparently under the impression he was responding to an email from his wife, Callista, wrote: "What is this?" In both cases, we didn't respond. In an actual phishing attack, the replies could have given the sender a chance to more aggressively put their targets at ease and lure them in. Advertisement Advertisement In fact, Comey and Gingrich appear to have been less vigilant than Podesta, who had reported his phishing email to a security advisor, only to be mistakenly told it was "legitimate." (The advisor later claimed that it was a typo and that he had meant to say that it was "illegitimate".) Along with Comey, Giuliani, and Gingrich, we sent the messages to 12 other people: FCC chairman Ajit Pai; White House press secretary Sean Spicer; Oval Office operations director Keith Schiller; White House Homeland Security advisor Tom Bossert; John Ratcliffe, the House Chairman of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on Cybersecurity; White House advisor Peter Thiel; Jeanette Manfra, the Department of Homeland Security Acting Undersecretary for Cybersecurity; Stephen Miller, senior advisor to the President; Sebastian Gorka, deputy assistant to the President; Grace Koh, special assistant to the President; John Lynch, chief of the Department of Justice's Computer Crime and Intellectual Property Section; and Trump lawyer Michael Cohen. In addition to the giveaway in the form of the email address, the last line of the invitation revealed that it had been sent to test the recipient's digital security acumen. (Always read the fine print!) And the Google logo linked to our page . Example of what our email looked like. On desktop, it was quickly evident this was not sent by Donald Trump. Opening the email on mobile, you wouldn't see the email address it was sent from, just the 'name' of the sender. In the actual test, we didn't use Donald Trump as a sender. The link then took those who clicked it to the following login page. At the bottom of the page, there were links again to our site, along with the message, "This page was built by Gizmodo Media Group to test your digital security acumen." What they encountered if they clicked the link. Please take note of the url. Anyone who clicked the sign-in button would receive a message alerting them to the fact that they'd just taken part in a security audit by the Special Projects Desk. It included our contact information. If you are reading this, you messed up. A security test like this has precedent. Tech companies like Facebook assign a team to try to hack their colleagues on a regular basis to keep people on their toes, in a practice called red teaming. In 2011 , the Department of Homeland Security left USB sticks in the parking lots of government buildings, and found that 60 percent of the government employees and contractors who picked up the sticks plugged them into their computers, which then could have been infected with malware. Advertisement Advertisement The Trump people were not as careless as this, but some of them were still too trusting. They avoided the pitfall of entering their login information-which in a real attack would have opened them up to having their email accounts invaded and their messages downloaded, and would have compromised any other accounts where they used the same password-but those who clicked the link at all were taking a risk. In a worst-case scenario, a click like that could lead to malware being installed in their browser. It could also potentially reveal a user's geographic location, what device is in use, that device's operating system, and their choice of browser, all of which would be useful information for a future hack. These are not theoretical risks. Politicians are increasingly being targeted for email hacks. This past weekend, French presidential-elect Emmanuel Macron saw his campaign's emails dumped on the internet. Last month, people affiliated with his campaign received emails "with links to fake websites designed to bait them into turning over passwords," according to the New York Times . We contacted all of the recipients and asked how they realized that the email or the Google sign-in page, if they clicked through, wasn't legitimate. Sadly, no one was in the bragging mood. Neither they, nor their government agencies, had responded to a request for comment as of press time. Advertisement Correction: The original version of this post stated that Ben Wittes is the editor-in-chief of Lawfare.com. He's in fact the editor-in-chief of Lawfareblog.com .

The proposal could limit Apple’s control over its App Store. The European Commission said in its midterm review of its digital strategy that the EU needs to take action to “promote the online platforms as responsible players of a fair internet ecosystem.” Read: Spotify CEO, Others Say Companies Like Google, Apple 'Abuse' Size In European Smartphone Market The commission said it will prepare an initiative to tackle “unfair contractual clauses and trading practices identified in platform-to-business relationships” by the end of the year. The move comes after chief executives from European firms, including Spotify, Deezer and Rocket Internet, sent a letter to the EU, accusing mobile giants, like Google and Apple, of abusing their power within the smartphone market. Apple’s iOS and Google Android hold more than 90 percent of the global smartphone market, IDC numbers show. The companies did not mention Google and Apple by name in their letter, but they specifically highlighted mobile operating ecosystems, app stores and search engines. The letter claimed the companies exhibited anti-competitive behaviors. The letter also criticized companies with online platforms that allow them to become “gatekeepers.” “Our collective experience is that where online platforms have a strong incentive to turn into gatekeepers because of their dual role, instead of maximizing consumer welfare, they can and do abuse their privileged position and adopt B2B [business-to-business] practices with adverse consequences for innovation and competition,” the letter said. “These practices range from restricting access to data or interaction with consumers, biased ranking and search results to lack of clarity, imbalanced terms and conditions and preference of their own vertically integrated services.” The EU said Wednesday its investigation, which began a year ago, found some online platforms were conducting trading practices that are a “potential detriment [to] their professional users.” The commission found platforms were delisting products or services without due notice or without any possibility to contest the move. The EU said the platform’s actions contribute to lack of transparency. “There is widespread concern that some platforms may favor their own products or services, otherwise discriminate between different suppliers and sellers and restrict access to, and the use of, personal and nonpersonal data, including that which is directly generated by a company's activities on the platforms,” the commission said.

Earlier this year, a California judge ruled iPhone app buyers may sue Apple over claims the company monopolized the market for iPhone apps by not letting people buy them outside the App Store. The decision brought back a 2013 ruling that dismissed a lawsuit by a group of iPhone users who claimed Apple’s App Store control led to anti-competitiveness and therefore higher prices on products.

Google reportedly developing new 'Fuchsia' operating system for phones And it looks completely different to what we're used to  Share  Comments ByJeff Parsons 18:45, 10 MAY 2017 Technology (Photo: Google)  Share  Comments Get daily updates directly to your inbox + Subscribe Thank you for subscribing!Could not subscribe, try again laterInvalid Email Along with Android and Chrome OS, Google is reportedly developing a third mobile operating system codenamed "Fuchsia". Pictures unearthed by tech site Ars Technica appear to show a new tile-based user interface (UI). Importantly, the Fuchsia system appears to have been developed completely in-house by the tech giant. It's a departure from the two current operating systems that are both based on the open-source Linux platform. Although it's far from complete yet, Ars points out the system's UI source code (codenamed "Armadillo") can actually be compiled into an APK file and installed on an Android device.

Which is important if you're switching to a tile-based control system. The homepage in this case is a scrolling list of windows, rather than the static icons we've become used to since the iPhone was launched. Google developers have confirmed this is more than just a throwaway project and that the company has legitimate plans to develop it further. Part of the reason Google may want a new operating system is that Android has become hugely fragmented through the millions of third-party devices around the world that run it. It's also an old product. Google began development on the mobile operating system before the iPhone was even launched and BlackBerry was still the number one smartphone in town.

Ars Technica points out that the new Fuchsia platform is being designed to work with modern phones and computers with fast processors. Many years from now, it could allow Google to splinter its product offering towards high and low-spec devices. This development also goes hand-in-hand with the company's decision to build and market its own hardware. Last year Google introduced its first own-brand smartphone, the Pixel, which featured stock Android and high-end specs (and a price to match) that put it squarely in competition with Apple's range of iPhone products.

[Jason Howie/Flickr] Comments Print Internet platforms like Google, Facebook and Amazon Marketplace face regulation over their contracts with other businesses by the end of the year, under possible new EU legislation announced today (10 May). The proposal will affect “unfair contractual clauses and trading practices identified in platform-to-business relationships” and follows a 2016 Commission strategy that suggested “problem-driven” EU action but no across-the-board regulation of online platforms. One Commission official said the rules would focus on forcing platforms to be more transparent and give companies options for redress if a platform wrongly removes their products from search results. A Commission document published today said that “there is widespread concern that some platforms may favour their own products or services, otherwise discriminate between different suppliers and sellers and restrict access to, and the use of, personal and non-personal data, including that which is directly generated by a company’s activities on the platforms”. Some online platforms remove products from search results “without due notice or without any effective possibility to contest the platform’s decision”. The official said details of the plans haven’t been nailed down yet, but that the EU executive is also analysing transparency measures for platforms’ algorithms. “We cannot say here today that we will come out with legislation on algorithms,” the official said. Commission wants to regulate US-dominated online platform market Amid controversy over the European Commission’s increased scrutiny of American technology companies, the EU executive will propose new rules regulating online platforms, according to a leaked draft document obtained by EURACTIV.com. The Commission’s announcement has drawn fury from tech companies. Siada El Ramly, director of EDiMA, a Brussels-based association representing platforms like Amazon, Airbnb, Google and Facebook, said she was “astounded” by the announcement, which she called a “complete contradiction” of the Commission’s communication last year that promised not to introduce sweeping legislation. The Commission published that communication last April, one week after EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager accused Google of using its Android mobile operating system to harm competitors by pre-installing Google Search and its own Chrome browser on Android mobile phones. 66% of small and medium-sized businesses that responded to a 2016 Eurobarometer survey said their sales are significantly affected by how platforms position them in search results. Georgios Petropoulos, a researcher at the Bruegel think tank, said new legislation could help smaller European companies in the online platform market, which is now dominated by American giants like Amazon and Google. “Clearly we need some regulatory clarity to incentivise investment in platforms and to incentivise the scale-up of startups. Here we see some problems with the diversity of business models in some platforms,” he said. MEPs raise Netflix quota to 30% and sharpen rules on violent online posts Netflix and other video-on-demand platforms could be required to include a minimum 30% of European content—more than the Commission’s proposed 20% quota, if new broadcasting rules follow a report approved yesterday (25 April) by MEPs in the Culture Committee. Andrus Ansip, the Commission Vice-President for digital policies, announced the action on platforms during a press conference on the EU executive’s flagship Digital Single Market initiative two years after it was first started. He also said that the Commission will by the end of this year introduce measures to better coordinate how online platforms remove users’ posts that contain illegal content once they receive notice about it. Ansip told reporters before today’s announcement that rules on removing illegal content from platforms are unclear because there is “no common understanding of what ‘notice’ is”. The Commission has come under pressure to act on platforms’ role in removing illegal content, including hate speech and copyright breaches. Several EU countries are pushing to pass their own legislation that takes a stricter, more legally binding approach than the EU executive, which has until now stuck to softer, non-binding agreements with companies to encourage them to remove more hate speech. “We will get a fragmented Europe if we do not provide clarifications,” Ansip said. Germany’s justice ministry proposed a new law in March that would require internet companies to remove hate speech or face fines of up to €50 million. The Bundestag has not yet voted on the bill. Several Commission officials have said they are concerned that the law might violate freedom of expression and platform liability rules, but Ansip said today that it is still too soon for him to react. The Commission is required to respond to Germany’s notification of the law by next month and can either approve it or ask the German government to clarify the Commission’s concerns. A European Parliament report that was passed by the Culture Committee (CULT) last month on draft EU audiovisual rules would require video-sharing platforms like YouTube to remove any illegal posts. The Commission insists that its measure to guide platforms later this year will respect freedom of speech and will not affect the EU e-Commerce directive, a seventeen-year-old law guaranteeing that internet companies will not be completely liable for what their users post. The EU guidance on the rules for removing content will outline requirements like a minimum procedure to take down posts and dispute resolution for users who think their posts are wrongly removed. Ansip told reporters today that the measure will clarify when firms will be required to react once they are notified of illegal content on their platforms, and what rights users have to object if their posts are removed. A group of 24 MEPs, led by Dutch Liberal Marietje Schaake, wrote to Ansip today asking him to propose hard legislation, instead of non-binding guidelines, to specify when and how platforms should be required to remove illegal content. Legislation could create transparency requirements for platforms and prevent EU countries from introducing their own national laws against hate speech, they argued. “A notice and action directive could counter these trends towards fragmentation. It would provide a framework which guarantees legal certainty for businesses and users alike, while increasing the transparency, effectiveness, and proportionality of takedown procedures,” the MEPs wrote. Germany set to fine social media platforms millions over hate speech A new draft German law would fine social media firms up to €50 million if they fail to remove hate speech, jumping ahead of EU plans. The European Commission is still weighing up whether it will propose rules to crack down on online hate speech.

The company announced yesterday that you’ll be able to configure this connection with the company’s iDevices Connected app for iPhone and Android. To make this happen, you’ll need to enable the iDevices Service inside of the Google Home app, which is also available for both mobile platforms. [ Further reading: The best home water leak detectors ] iDevices The iDevices app is the centerpiece of controlling the company’s products. The iDevices application gives you detailed controls for various components in the company’s suite of products, such as the intensity of the night light on hardware that supports lighting, organizing your set of products by room for easier control, and setting schedules to best fit your day. Those with a Google Pixel smartphone will also be able to talk to their iDevices directly without a Google Home, since the phone also includes the Google Assistant. Over time, Google hopes to feature its digital companion in more hardware, just as Amazon has done with Alexa. Google has been racing to catch up to Amazon, recently bringing aboard Vivint, Wink, and 11 other smart home brands. Existing partnerships include other major players including Philips Hue, Samsung SmartThings, Logitech, and of course the Alphabet-owned Nest. Google maintains a running list of its smart home partners. For iDevices, this gives the company compatibility with each of the major DIY smart home platforms: Alexa, Google Assistant, and Apple’s HomeKit. Microsoft might also creep into this space, with the recent revealing of a Cortana-powered Echo competitor. While this is an important new product line to connect with Google, Amazon continues to push ahead with what Alexa can do. The new Echo Show adds in a touchscreen, and the Alexa has a more extensive set of skills that connect to third-party services.

Plus, the future of big data architecture, and other stories from the Ad Tech trenches By George Anadiotis for Big on Data | May 10, 2017 -- 17:37 GMT (10:37 PDT) | Topic: Big Data Analytics Advertising is strangling the web, and that may have to do with the declining value and lack of transparency associated with the players that dominate it. (Image: Anders Emil Møller / Trouble) The greatest minds of this generation are wasted on advertisement. Or at least, that's what someone who has been there and done that thinks. Like most successful aphorisms, this raises eyebrows, drives heated discussions, and strikes a point or two. Marketing and advertising have enormous influence on society at large -- business, technology, media, culture, and data. So, discussing with people working on the intersection of those can offer some insights on the state of the union of Big Data and Ad Tech. Advertising is big, and so is its data special feature IoT: The Security Challenge The Internet of Things is creating serious new security risks. We examine the possibilities and the dangers. Read More Advertising is a multi-billion dollar business that has been going through the process of digital transformation for a couple of decades already. Some of today's most advanced, powerful, and influential companies have advertising embedded in their core. A good part of the innovation that has been driving big data has come about as a response to the needs of advertising at scale before getting a life of its own. MapReduce, for example, the blueprint for Hadoop's first incarnation, was originally developed and deployed at scale at Google. But although Facebook and Google, the 'Big Two,' are by far the biggest players in the digital advertising space, they are not the only ones. The Ad Tech, or Marketing Tech, scene is booming, and programmatic marketing is taking over quickly. Mike Driscoll, CEO of MetaMarkets, points out that marketing is being digitally transformed and marketers are following suite. MetaMarkets is part of the Ad Tech wave, and its core business is to provide marketers with insights on their digital presence. "The future will be digital," Driscoll says. "CMOs (Chief Marketing Officers) are turning to CMTOs (Chief Marketing Technical Officers). But as marketers are going digital, they are also starting to have less trust in some of the channels they're buying from. Investing in technology means they are now able to hold their partners accountable." The problem with advertising data Driscoll has more than anecdotal evidence and opinions here. MetaMarkets just published a survey called the Transparency Opportunity, in which it attempts, as it says, to quantify the benefits of trust. The findings of the survey show that almost half of the brands using programmatic media buying believe lack of transparency is inhibiting its future growth and scale. But what do we talk about when we talk about transparency here? "All marketers work with the established duopoly -- Google and Facebook," says Driscoll. MetaMarkets also works with other platforms, such as Twitter and AOL, but it's the Big Two that dominate the advertising market. While the market is growing, nearly all of that growth is driven by Google and Facebook. The advertising pie may be growing, but the growth is driven by a duopoly. (Image: Jason Kint) It's not hard to see where this is going: Google and Facebook dominating the market and dictating their terms. This presents a problem for all parties involved. For media, dependence on advertising translates as dependence on the Big Two. Media are trying to find ways to cope and come up with new models of doing business while maintaining their editorial independence. For consumers, the ever-increasing volume of advertising means they are constantly bombarded by a barrage of ads. They are told that this is the price they have to pay for having access to free content, and to a certain extent, it is true. The problem is that more and more advertising is strangling content, consumer fatigue is taking over, and the value and effectiveness of advertising is dropping. Obviously, this presents a problem for advertisers and their clients. "Marketers want more transparency. They would like to get a receipt for what they buy, instead of a powerpoint and a good story," Driscoll says. "Brands are asking from their partners to provide better analytics. Historically, channels have been providing results, but not analytics on the results. Digital transformation means that we don't just buy goods anymore, we also buy data about the goods. Take AWS, for example: When they started, they just provided the service, but by now, you also get analytics to go with it. Major channels need to invest more not just in internal technology, but also in providing better data access to their partners." The big guys will just not share But, seriously, this is Google and Facebook we're talking about. Are we to believe that the most iconic data-driven organizations in the world can't make the right data available to marketers? "Ask any marketer and they'll tell you -- the big guys will just not share. It's not in their interest to be transparent, but rather to be as less transparent as possible," Driscoll says. Almost half of brands being advertised see lack of transparency as a problem. Image: MetaMarkets So, what can be done to deal with this? The real power of marketers is the power to check them, according to Driscoll. "If you look at the leaders emerging in Fortune 500, the next generation of marketers are technologists, and they are demanding independent audits and data. Consider this: For a long time, advertisers wanted to know if their ads were viewed or not. Facebook says, 'OK, we'll measure it ourselves.' And they got away with it for a while. Yhey reported their own view-ability stats, just like NBC used to report how many people viewed their own shows. In the last year, that has changed. Marketers says, 'We will not send advertisements to Facebook, unless we have an independent source of truth.' So, Facebook responded by providing access to their data to a company called Moat, which built a business model around auditing Facebook data. That does not mean Facebook and Co., will give away all of their data -- you also have to consider privacy issues here. But when you talk to brands, even though they will not say that in public, they are actually doing that. When you have budgets in the tends of millions, you can do that -- pull data out and do what every marketer would like to do: Build a unified view over their channels." Analyst super powers But what about the rest of the world, the ones that don't have the budget to cope with this? Perhaps regulation would be needed, so if the big guys won't share, someone should make them? "We've been hearing rumours about the Congress getting involved, but for most businesses that would be the last resort. It's not the ideal solution for marketers or media companies, especially considering the all-time low approval ratings in the US right now," Driscoll says. For him, the answer is in marketers investing more in analytics. On the one end of the continuum, organizations can do it all themselves, using infrastructure like Hadoop and analytics tools that sit on top and can help them collect and analyze the data they need. On the other end, MetaMarkets touts itself as the right solution for marketers. MetaMarkets is a domain-specific solution that builds on four pillars: Fast data exploration, intuitive visualization, collaboration, and intelligence. Driscoll elaborates: "Scale is a requirement, and we are quickly moving towards streaming events and data. Interactive visualization helps you understand what's going on. You need more than dashboards. Dashboards may update, but the questions they answer stay the same. You need collaboration -- like Slack for data, that helps teams communicate and share methods and insights. And you need intelligence. In analytics, you spend 80 percent of your time preparing data and 20 percent actually doing analysis. We have ETL connectors for a multitude of platforms that help get the data where you need them. Plus, it's one thing to show data, and another thing to search for insights." MetaMarkets tries to look at what analysts do and automate that to suggest root causes. For example, a campaign running behind targets is something that can be monitored using metrics. But to get to the reason why this is happening, an analyst would slice and dice data per region or demographics. MetaMarkets says they can automate this process and suggest root causes, evolving from tracking statistical significant signals to deriving business-focused insights. "We let analysts specify metrics they are interested in, and then perform root cause analysis for them. We believe in machine and human working side by side, not in replacing analysts, but in giving them super-powers," Driscoll says. Data at advertising scale and the future of pipelines As MetaMarkets has been on the forefront of data at advertising scale, and Driscoll himself has served as its CTO, he shared some insights on the evolution of big data architecture: "We have been pushing the limits of scale, so we encounter problems before others do," he says. This has resulted in MetaMarkets developing and releasing Druid, an open-source distributed column store. "We created Druid because we needed it and it did not exist, so we had to build it. And then we open sourced it, because if we had not, something else would have come along and replaced it." MetaMarkets has been evolving its data pipeline, but still not turning to Kappa architecture on the grounds that its clients are not ready for it. (Image: MetaMarkets) Druid is seeing some traction in the industry. Case in point, when Hortonworks' engineers recently presented their work on the combined used of Hive & Druid at the DataWorks EMEA Summit, they attracted widespread interest. Could this mean there may be a valid case for building a business around Druid? "We have the largest deployment in production, and we love being part of the community. Druid is used by the likes of Airbnb and Ali Baba. But we have no plans of building a business around it. We don't believe the future is around data infrastructure, which is becoming a commodity, and we don't want to be competing against the Googles of the world there. Sure, this may be working for companies built around Hadoop, but commercialization of open source needs widespread adoption to succeed. But I can tell you that Cloudera and Hortonworks are looking to add Druid to their stack and to the range of services they offer."

Its own pipeline has been evolving, going from Hadoop to Spark and from Storm to Samza. "Spark is more mature and it meets our needs at this point, and we also feel about the same way about Samza," he says. "But we see streaming as the future of our pipeline. When you work with streaming, there's a sort of CAP theorem equivalent that applies there. In distributed data stores, you have consistency, availability and partition tolerance, and you can pick two of those that your system supports simultaneously. In streaming data, you have accuracy, velocity, and volume, and your system can only support two of those simultaneously. This is why we think the model supported by Apache Beam, Google Data Flow, and Apache Flink will be key going forward. When streaming at scale, there's no such thing as objective truth, so you have to rely on statistical approximation and on using watermarks. Do we see our current Lambda architecture giving way to a flattened, Kappa architecture? When you work on the bleeding edge of real-time architecture, the ability of organizations like MetaMarkets that are in the business of integrating data from other sources is important. But when it comes to other companies, not many are yet at the point where they can stream data out. Only the most sophisticated, agile companies out there are able to do this. At this point, only about 50 percent of our clients are there." Who really owns your Internet of Things data? In a world where more and more objects are coming online and vendors are getting involved in the supply chain, how can you keep track of what's yours and what's not?

It was a well-received addition to the Google menu of consumer-oriented services. Owners of GOOGL stock cheered it a bit too, as over-the-top television is an area where Google has been getting lapped by competitors like PlayStation Vue, from Sony Corp (ADR) (NYSE:SNE) and SlingTV. Source: Shutterstock At $35 per month, Google parent company Alphabet should at least be price-competitive with the same so-called “skinny bundle” of channels (which isn’t exactly skinny) that the Vue and SlingTV are offering their customers. After a closer, more scrutinizing second look, GOOGL shareholders who thought this might finally mark the moment where the true potential of YouTube as a game-changing over-the-top television alternative is realized might want to rethink their stance. The ship has already sailed, for a handful of reasons. YouTube TV is Anything But Special Sorry GOOGL shareholders, but YouTube TV is anything but a panacea. That’s not an indictment of the platform itself. The channel offerings are robust, and the price is fair. SlingTV packages start at $20 per month. PlayStation Vue’s offerings range from $30 to $65, and Hulu’s costs around $40 per month. YouTube TV more or less offers the same channel lineups as those alternatives. The issue is, above all else, once of perception. The secondary issue (and this is a close second) is one of timing. Kudos to Alphabet for turning YouTube into the world’s most recognizable repository of user-generated video content. The company reports viewers consume a billion hours worth of its digital content every single day. For perspective, Americans watch 1.25 billion hours of traditional TV on a daily basis. But the switch from ad-supported interludes of video amusement to a true alternative to traditional cable television is a large one. And it’s one that Alphabet hasn’t proven it’s ready to make. As evidence of this idea, one only has to look at the limited success of YouTube Red — Google’s loose version of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX). YouTube Red offers a (mostly) ad-free YouTube experience, also offering members access to a fair amount of music and some exclusive video content. Google also developed some original content for YouTube Red,though reviews were mixed, at best. That may be why as of the latter half of last year, YouTube Red only boasted 1.5 million subscribers. That’s a pittance compared to Netflix’s nearly 100 members, and Hulu’s 12 million paying subscribers. To be fair, it is apples and oranges … or maybe red apples to yellow apples. Netflix and Hulu sport a wide selection of curated, traditional TV content, and YouTube is a hodgepodge of user-generated videos and a smattering of organized, scripted programming. Still, 1.5 million YouTube Red members has to be something of a letdown for Google. Doesn’t YouTube TV Fix That? In many regards, YouTube TV is the answer to that problem. YouTube TV looks, acts and feels like a true alternative to traditional TV. It’s essentially a clone of Sling TV and PlayStation Vue. Problem is, that’s still not good enough.

As seen in the example, searching for things like “art events this weekend” will now show a simple, organized list of nearby matches. Google also allows for more specific searches, so you’ll be able to search for things like “jazz concerts in Austin next week” and get similarly filtered results. The events will be pulled from sites like Eventbrite and Meetup, and Google has published a set of developer guidelines that will allow anyone to integrate their own services into the events results It’s similar to other additions to Google search, as the company continues to try to find ways to serve more contextual content to the service. The local event feature should be rolling out to Google users in the US starting today.

It’s a new iteration of Windows 10 which will enable Microsoft to effectively compete against Google’s Chrome OS-powered Chromebooks in the education sector. Microsoft is enforcing strict app policies on Windows 10 and those policies might prevent Google Chrome from ever being released on Windows 10 S. One major difference between Windows 10 S and conventional Windows 10 is that the former can only install apps from the Windows Store. ZDNet reports that Windows Store apps that can be used to browse the internet have to use the HTML and JavaScript engines provided by the Windows platform. The reason why Chrome for Windows 10 S might remain a dream is because Chrome’s underlying code doesn’t use these engines. This stipulation that Microsoft has added to the Windows Store policies eliminates the possibility of Google Chrome being released for Windows 10 S in its current shape and form. If Google really wants to bring its Chrome web browser to Windows 10 S, it’s going to have to rework the entire browser based on Microsoft’s engines. Even if it does that, it’s not like Microsoft will allow Windows 10 S users to choose any browser other than Microsoft Edge as the default browser, so this may not happen after all.

Google's answer to the Amazon Echo launched in the UK last month. The high-tech gadget not only plays music but provides information on request and obeys spoken commands. Tesco has now updated its If This Then That (IFTTT) channel to enable Google Home users to add products to their shopping basket using just their voice. "Rather than setting up an individual IFTTT recipe for each product, you'll now be able to create just one recipe and then ask your Google Home to 'add milk to your Tesco basket' or 'buy more eggs'," Tesco explained. Read More Burger King uses sneaky trick to force Google Home to advertise the Whopper While Amazon Echo does something similar, allowing Amazon Prime customers to order products from Amazon.com using just their voice, Tesco claims its Google Home integration is smarter. "If you already shop with Tesco regularly we'll do our best to bias those search results towards the products that you'd normally choose, so that IFTTT will add your favourites/usuals for you – not just the first result," it said. "Another feature we've added alongside this is around existing orders. If you already have a slot booked then IFTTT will amend the existing order and if you don’t it will just add it to your basket." The move by Tesco is yet another indication that voice search is set to be the next battleground in online shopping.

"The news that a major consumer brand like Tesco has aligned itself with Google Home is further evidence that we, as an industry and as a society, are moving into an 'interface-less' society," said Hugh Fletcher, global head of consultancy and innovation at global digital consultancy Salmon . "As we see these virtual ecosystems grow and become more widespread, we are likely to see a battle commence between the digital assistants such as Google Home, Amazon Echo and the imminent Apple Home, as retailers and brands affiliate themselves with one or the other.

"As a result this could pose a risk to existing customer loyalty and brand equity that they possess with customers," he said. "While Tesco is undoubtedly right to get into this space and get in there early, for the sake of its future, we must hope that Tesco has also considered its strategy for customer ownership, data ownership and Tesco brand loyalty."

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search How to Send Recipes to Google Home for Step-By-Step Instructions By Eric Ravenscraft on May 10th, 2017 Voice assistants like Google Home are excellent kitchen aids. They can set timers, add things to your grocery list, and play music while you cook. But the Google Home has one standout kitchen feature: you can use it to read off recipes one step at a time while you cook. Here’s how to find recipes, send them to Google Home, and get hands-free step-by-step instructions. First, you’ll need to pick a recipe that you want Google to walk through. You can find them a few ways. First, and perhaps the easiest, you can search for recipes on your phone. Open up Google Assistant or Google search on your Android or iPhone and search for the kind of recipe you want. You’ll see a scrolling list of recipes to choose from. When you’ve found one that looks good, tap Send to Google Home. You can also search for recipes on Google Home directly, where Google will read each result out one by one until you find a recipe you like. The recipe you choose will be waiting for you whenever you decide to start it. To get started, say to Google Home, “Ok Google, start recipe.” Once the recipe is started, Google Home will recite the recipe one piece at a time. Google will ask if you want to hear the ingredients or skip straight to the cooking instructions. Whichever one you choose, you have several voice commands you can use to control playback of the recipe. “Ok Google, Next step.” This command will play the next step in the recipe. “Ok Google, Repeat step.” If you need to hear another part of the recipe again, use this command to have Google Home repeat the last step you heard. “Ok Google, What’s step [x]?” You can use this to hear one of the steps out of order without losing your place. For example, if you’re on step four of the recipe, but you want to hear what step two was again, you can say “What’s step two?” and Google will play it. The next time you say “Next step,” Google will continue to step five. In between each step, you can use any Google Home command like normal. You can play music or set a timer, then say “Next step” to continue. Google will remember where you’re at in the recipe even when you’re doing something else.

Over the coming months, Oracle said that it would be reviewing proposals from the Government and business partners to provide customers with the capability to build and move workloads to an India-based cloud. “There has been so much demand for our cloud-based services that we are now seriously targeting to bringing them here to serve companies and the government,” said Thomas Kurian, president of product development, Oracle, during a keynote address at its flagship event Oracle OpenWorld. Oracle said that its services would offer uncompromised security and performance at a significant price advantage over both existing on-premises infrastructure and competitive cloud offerings. “We are much faster and cheaper than the competition,” said Mr. Kurian who reports to Oracle co-founder and chief technology officer Larry Ellison. Referring to data provided by one of the customers, Mr. Kurian said that they found cloud computing services of Oracle to be 20% cheaper and ten to twelve times faster than Amazon. India stack The company also said that Oracle Cloud Platform has been validated to develop applications using India Stack services. IndiaStack is a set of application program interface (APIs) that allows Governments, businesses, start-ups and developers to utilise a unique digital infrastructure and deliver secure presence-less, paperless, and cashless service delivery.+ With this validation, developers and partners can leverage Oracle Cloud for the customer to create and test next generation cloud applications that invoke core India Stack APIs, including Aadhaar Authentication and eKYC, eSign and DigiLocker. The Redwood City, California-based firm which provides its services to customers in over 195 countries said that it is processing 55 billion transactions a day. “We believe we will enable every person in the world to get access to our technology. All they need is a browser and a phone and that is our vision,” said Mr. Kurian.

"The 'FAAAM' index — Facebook, Amazon, Alphabet, Apple and Microsoft — these companies now have virtual monopolies," Calacanis told CNBC's "Squawk Alley" on Wednesday. "In fact, they've figured out how to game the Justice Department and really become monopolies that are immune to government action — at least, in the United States." While stocks pulled back from record highs on Wednesday, the Nasdaq 100 has climbed more than 16 percent so far this year, while the S&P 500 Information Technology sector has jumped more than 17 percent — far more than any other S&P grouping. Markets may have risen broadly, but companies like Facebook and Google have also made plenty of money. Both companies reported better-than-expected earnings in the first quarter, shaking off controversies around "fake news" and extremist content. Justin Sullivan | Getty Images Research firm eMarketer estimates that Google will account for 40.7 percent of percent of U.S. digital ad revenues in 2017. Facebook, eMarketer predicts, will capture 39.1 percent of the display ad market. "If you look at Google, they have just an amazing monopoly when it comes to search advertising," said Calacanis, a media entrepreneur and early Uber investor. "And they know exactly how to avoid triggering what would look like a monopoly. So they've always kept an anemic, incompetent competitor alive. So Google had Yahoo. They could have bought it, they could have taken over their advertising revenue. Suspiciously, they didn't." Google has what Calacanis referred to as "moats," borrowing from a phrase used by famed investor Warren Buffett: Well-known brand names that make it difficult for them to succumb to competitive forces. "Google's moats are transcendent now: Chrome, Android," Calacanis said. "It's amazing the monopoly they've built that doesn't look like a monopoly." The market power behind the tech giants has caught the eye of regulators abroad. In Europe, Google's aggregation of content, WhatsApp's encryption, Apple's low taxes and Amazon's payments to publishers are just a few of the issues that have sparked a regulatory crackdown. "Facebook, they've always had, or [CEO Mark] Zuckerberg's referred to it as, 'the clown car:' the incompetent Twitter, which can't seem to get out of its own way," Calacanis said. "These are perfect little companies to keep on the side. Don't buy them. Let them be independent. So when the anti-trust people come, you can say, 'Look, no, there's options here.'" U.S. regulators have their fair share of spats with technology companies, but the debate wages on as to whether these companies cause any economic losses or harm to consumers since they lower prices for some services. Calacanis said it's a warning for newer tech companies, like Snap, which reports earnings for the first time after the bell on Wednesday. "They're not going to try to compete with the global user base in the same way Facebook is obsessed with having everybody," Calacanis said. "Snapchat is going to really get themselves into trouble if they get into Yahoo's big problem, which was a constant comparison to .... Google. Snapchat has to establish they are something different."

Comment Share Tweet Stumble Email Tech giant IBM says two and a half quintillion bytes of data are generated every day – equivalent to 90 years of HD video. To put that in perspective, that's a 2 and a 5 with 17 zeroes behind them. A new book examines what all this data reveals about us. Data scientist and New York Times op-ed contributor Seth Stephens-Davidowitz is the author of "Everybody Lies: Big Data, New Data, and What the Internet Can Tell Us About Who We Really Are." He joined "CBS This Morning" to discuss some of his wide-ranging insights into human behavior, as told by our digital footprint.   Stephens-Davidowitz calls Google searches the most important data set collected on the human psyche. "People lie consistently to just about everybody but they tend to be really really honest to Google. Something about that little white box people feel comfortable telling things they might not tell to anyone else and it serves as kind of a digital truth serum," he said. Stephens-Davidowitz, who has studied Google search data for five years said, "You can see from what people are searching what they really think, what they really want and what they really desire." CBS News Not just that, but "a lot of our stereotypes, a lot of what we think about the world is dead wrong."  One example of this is seen in analysis of anxiety levels. The data scientist was surprised to find the highest stress levels not in big cities typically associated with a stressful lifestyle, like New York City, but instead in rural areas, according to Google search data analysis. CBS News He also looked at how social media posts about husbands differ from Google searches about husbands. On social media, husbands tend to be described as "the best" or "my best friend," while Google searches focus on more negative terms like "a jerk" or "annoying." ("Amazing" makes both lists.) "It's really interesting when you compare social media versus Google because social media, in some sense, we're the biggest liars because we're trying to impress our friends."

Even though the move doesn’t necessarily eliminate fake news altogether, it will force “low quality” articles further down in the search results, thus making it much more difficult for users to locate. According to Google, the decision to introduce the new algorithm was sparked by the 2016 presidential election, where the issue of so-called “fake news” was consistently debated on the national stage. “It was not a large fraction of queries – only about a quarter percent of our traffic – they were the important queries,” explained Ben Gomes, Google’s vice president of engineering for search. “It’s not a problem that is going to go all the way to zero, but we now think we can stay a step ahead of things.” The most recent victim of Google’s fake news witch hunt has been the website Infowars, run by political radio host Alex Jones. Leaked documents from the Internet search giant reveal that employees were being instructed to rate articles and other posts from Infowars as “low” to “medium” quality, even if the information was entirely accurate. Google’s rating guide used Infowars as an example of what a website looks like when it has a “poor reputation and conspiratorial bent.” The leaked guide went on to say, “There are a number of controversial, often debunked claims that the site regularly promotes.” Eventually, Google was forced to admit that their suppression of Infowars was a “mistake,” and that they would act fast to correct the problem. This seems to be the consistent mindset among those who seek to suppress or silence what they consider to be “fake news” – do it until you get caught, and then just simply call it a “mistake” to avoid any further scrutiny or confrontation. But what if it’s not a mistake at all? What if Google really is out to silence right-of-center websites and blog posts? It’s truly bizarre how companies like Google and pundits within the mainstream media never give a clear-cut definition of the term “fake news.” They are always quick to tell us that we need to act to censor it, but they never seem to go into detail about what specifically is going to be censored. This is because fake news is a subjective term – politically speaking, what is considered to be factual information by conservatives is almost always going to be considered lies or propaganda by the progressive left. Therefore, what we should really be paying attention to are the people behind the push to combat fake news, not just fake news itself.

The Google logo as seen on March 23, 2010. (Virginia Mayo / Associated Press) To the editor: Matthew Baum and David Lazer say we can control fake news by holding Facebook, Google and other platforms to account. In fact, fake news stories are an unimportant source of influence. They’re competitive (like billboards), somewhat silly and have existed as long as news has and most certainly always will. (“Google and Facebook aren't fighting fake news with the right weapons,” Opinion, May 8) More important, compared with new sources of influence like the Search Engine Manipulate Effect, or SEME, which my research team and I have been studying since 2013, fake news is a trivially small source of influence. It mainly confirms beliefs people already have, whereas SEME and other genuinely new sources of online influence are affecting billions of people. Google has complete control over the search suggestions and search results it shows us, affecting our purchases, opinions and votes on an unprecedented scale. Through targeted messaging, Facebook has the power to shift nearly a million votes on election day with no one aware of the company’s meddling.

To the editor: Trying to cut back on the influence of fake news won’t work, as too much junk is flowing to stem the tide. A more enduring solution is to educate the public, beginning in elementary school, how and why to differentiate the real from the fake. This requires reading the better newspapers and magazines, perusing a book now and then, listening carefully and critically to the talking heads, and being aware of how preconceptions and biases color what we choose to believe and to act upon.

Educational Technology May 10, 2017 Personal Google accounts can now create classes in Google Classroom Filed under: Educational Technology — admin @ 12:40 am by Abner Li, 9to5Google Classroom allows teachers to post schedules online and give out assignments. In turn, students can submit work and collaborate, as well as take quizzes with Google Forms. Previously, personal Google accounts could only join classes already started by G Suite accounts. Now, any regular user can create classes and manage curriculum. Google cites online education classes, clubs, and other informal groups as being able to take advantage of this wider release. The free version of Classroom does not have integration with G Suite for Education and as such does not permit full administration of user accounts, email summaries of student work for guardians, and other paid features. https://9to5google.com/2017/04/27/google-classroom-create/ Share on Facebook Comments Off No Comments No comments yet.

The best-kept AdWords secret: AMP your landing pages Even though AdWords doesn’t officially support AMP yet, advertisers can still use the technology to serve faster landing pages. Columnist Frederick Vallaeys explains how implementing AMP can lead to big gains in conversion rates. Frederick Vallaeys on May 10, 2017 at 10:17 am More The best experiences are those where we don’t have to wait for stuff: receiving a one-hour delivery from Instacart, skipping the lines at Disney World with a FastPass, getting a response from our digital assistants like Alexa in less than a second. Big, successful companies have figured out that “fast = more money,” and so they cater to consumers’ insatiable demand for instant gratification. By doing so, they build a strategic advantage and a stronger business. Luckily, there are areas of business where we don’t need to invest millions to deliver more speed. In fact, we can leverage free, open-source projects like Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) from Google to make mobile web pages faster — and, as I’ll explain in this post, that can easily turn into a significant improvement in the bottom line. And even though AdWords doesn’t seem to officially support AMP yet, advertisers can still use the technology to serve faster landing pages. That can lead to big gains in conversion rates and quality, and in turn help advertisers in a crowded field gain that all-important edge over the competition. Google really cares about speed From its earliest days, Google has painstakingly labored to make search results pages load so fast that users would get an answer before their minds could start to wander and start to think about something else. According to KissMetrics, Google once ran an experiment to show 30 search results instead of 10. The extra 500 milliseconds it took to load the page led to a 20 percent drop in usage. Google is so serious about speed that there have even been cases where they showed no ads on the SERPs because the ad auction took too long. Rather than delaying the page from loading, they simply served it with no ads. They knew that the short-term revenue loss of a few clicks would be more than made up in the long run when happy users came back to do many more searches. But as hard as Google works on making their own site really fast, they lose a lot of control as soon as the user clicks on a result and leaves Google. Despite efforts like preloading pages with the Google toolbar (which no longer exists), building a faster browser in Google Chrome and incentivizing fast load times by making them part of the Quality Score (QS) algorithm, the mobile web is often still a painfully slow place to visit. But Google has a plan to fix that… Making the mobile web faster with AMP In October 2015, Google developed Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) to make the mobile web faster for users. Their search results page began highlighting AMP pages in February 2016. They recently announced that there are now 1.7 billion AMP pages from 860,000 domains, with 35 million new pages being added every week. If you read news stories on your mobile device from Google Search results, you’ve likely encountered AMP pages. They are marked with a lightning bolt icon (image) and they load really, really fast. AMP states that the first listing usually loads in less than one second. Screen shot from Google News and Weather App — May 2017 AMP is an open-sourced standard (www.ampproject.org), so it can be used for free by anyone who wants to make their mobile pages faster. Its goal is to help developers create mobile web landing pages that load much faster than the average HTML page. There are two core components that let AMP achieve greater speed and a better user experience: Code hygiene, something that anyone who implements AMP on their site will benefit from right away by producing better code. The AMP cache, something where developers have to rely on Google to support it, but with additional benefits once that support is enabled. AMP support in AdWords AdWords doesn’t favor ads that lead to AMP landing pages, nor do they load them from the AMP cache. But advertisers can still get all the speed advantages from AMP’s cleaner code hygiene. AMP is a web standard, so advertisers can use it today to create faster landing pages which typically have a positive impact on bounce rates, conversion rates, time on site, and maybe even quality metrics (more on this below). According to a 2017 study by Akamai, there are several benefits of faster landing pages: A 100-millisecond delay in website load time can hurt conversion rates by 7 percent. A two-second delay in web page load time increase bounce rates by 103 percent. 53 percent of mobile site visitors will leave a page that takes longer than three seconds to load. Given Google’s involvement with AMP, their history of promoting a faster internet and clear benefits for advertisers who make faster pages, there’s no doubt in my mind that Google will extend support for AMP to AdWords. When they do, it will create additional value for advertisers using AMP. For that reason, advertisers would be wise to have a plan for deploying AMP on their sites in 2017. AMP drives big gains for sites using it While Google started the open source project, it’s already been adopted by some big names. eBay AMP’ed millions of pages, Pinterest is using it and WordPress has deployed it to tens of millions of the sites they host. And those using it are seeing positive impacts on their business. For example, The Washington Post saw an 88 percent improvement in load times for AMP content vs. traditional content, and that has helped them increase seven-day return visits from mobile users by 23 percent. NoBroker has seen a 10 percent increase in pages per session and an 18 percent reduction in bounce rate. Faster loading pages create a better user experience, and that leads to increased usage. For a publisher who monetizes through subscriptions or ads on their pages, this means AMPing their site puts them in a great position to grow their revenues. For e-commerce sites, it likely also means more business. To give you a real example of the difference AMP can make in the user experience, here’s an example of the same page loading with and without AMP: Why advertisers should care about AMP Since implementing AMP, Wired Magazine reports that they’ve seen a 25 percent increase in CTR when they advertise to get more readers. While they don’t disclose it, we know that a better CTR produces a better Quality Score, and hence a lower cost per click for the same ad rank. If you want to understand that better, I wrote a pretty detailed overview of how Quality Score works shortly after I left Google here and more recently here. Screen shot from https://www.ampproject.org/case-studies/wired/ — May 2017 Once people are reading Wired’s stories, they see a 63 percent increase in CTR of the ads they run to monetize their site. So let’s summarize that: 25 percent more readers from the same ad buy Probably a lower average CPC thanks to improved Quality Score 63 percent more monetization That works out to better ROAS (return on ad spend) and more revenue, so it makes a really compelling argument for investing in AMP pages. It also means that since they have a better performing business, they can afford more competitive bids to move up higher in the auction to further boost their business. All of this got me thinking, why don’t we hear about more advertisers using AMP? Is this one of the best-kept secrets of successful advertisers? So I asked Google… Google’s response I reached out to Google with some questions and received some details from Jon Diorio, a Group Product Manager on the AdWords team. Here’s what I learned. Q: Can you share who’s using AMP and what results they’re seeing? We cannot divulge advertiser details without permission. That said, we have permission from the following three advertisers to share their business names and some of their URLs (AMP vs. non-AMP). I also took the liberty of running some 3G speed tests via WebPageTest.org, to help illustrate the difference in speed that you get from loading AMP HTML vs. non-AMP HTML. Note, these results do not take into account the additional speed benefits that would be realized if these pages were served from the AMP cache (these are served from the advertisers’ web servers). In these non-cached cases, the average reduction in their median load time is 54 percent, with a range of 29 percent to 73 percent. Similarly, the average reduction in their median speed index is 42 percent, with a range of 31 percent to 63 percent. Boxed.com (speed test results) These are three groups of URL pairs, where the first in each pair is the AMP page and the second is the non-AMP version. This is why the first in each pair is faster. I’ve annotated this to make it easier to understand. The same structure is used for subsequent screen shots. Bodybuilding.com (speed test results) These are three groups of URL pairs, where the first in each pair is the AMP page, and the second is the non-AMP version. This is why the first in each pair is faster. Grand Luxury Hotels (speed test results) These are three groups of URL pairs, where the first in each pair is the AMP page, and the second is the non-AMP version. This is why the first in each pair is faster. Q: Will Google serve advertisers’ landing pages from AMP cache when an AMP page is available? Today, the organic search listings do. AdWords does not. That said, advertisers still stand to benefit from the fact that AMP HTML renders faster than all but the most highly optimized HTML. As you can see from the results above. When these pages are served from the AMP cache (e.g., if organic indexes them), then the load times would be approximately one second. Q: Does AMP potentially interfere with measurement systems like Google Analytics because content is preloaded and it gets counted as a view even though no one came? AMP will never trigger page views via preloading. AMP is component-based, and the AMP runtime knows exactly what each component does on an AMP page. Therefore, when preloading, AMP knows not to trigger any components (in this case, amp-analytics or amp-pixel) that trigger analytics on measurement systems like Google Analytics. Therefore, for example, a page view is only triggered when a real user loads the page on their browser. Q: Does the improvement in page load speed impact landing page QS? As we also mention in our help center, decreasing your landing page loading time can improve your landing page experience. That said, remember that AdWords’ quality system is based on hundreds of different signals, so it’s difficult to predict how one single change in isolation will affect the scores. Q: How much would that Landing Page QS impact overall QS? As you know, QS is not used in the auction, but is a representation of your historical quality in previous auctions. Your “below average,” “average” or “above average” rating for landing page experience in the front end has a simple relationship with the 1–10 QS number in the front end, but this is different than our real-time estimates of quality at auction time. Landing page experience continues to play a very important role in the Ad Rank function, and the overall weight it carries in that score is dynamic and changes based on a number of factors. Next steps for trying AMP Hopefully, I’ve laid out why AMP is worth using for your AdWords landing pages. Here are a few good next steps to learn more or to get started: Read the AdWords help article about AMP. Read the AdWords Developer’s Guide to AMP, which covers some of the typical concerns around personalized content, conversion tracking, A/B testing and more. Test the impact for your own site. If you don’t have a testing tool, you can use AdWords’ Draft & Experiments (D&E) where you create a draft campaign, add the AMP URLs as the Mobile Final URL (for each ad), and then launch this as an experiment. There are a few caveats when using Experiments: You will need a lot of conversions in your campaign to receive a statistically significant result. D&E decides a searcher’s A/B assignment with every query, so if your customers likely click your ads a few times before buying, this might not give you a true sense (since the conversion will be attributed to whether or not the last click followed an AMP page interaction). TIP: Make sure every landing page in the draft has an AMP equivalent page, so this is a true apples-to-apples comparison. Conclusion Today, AMP has been adopted on over 1.7 billion pages, and Google’s organic search listings both identify AMP pages and load them instantly. While AdWords does not provide the same level of support, advertisers can still benefit today from sending mobile traffic to AMP pages. There are tremendous improvements in bounce rate, conversion rate and quality from having faster landing pages. Since AMP pages are still HTML pages, AdWords will treat them like any other page. All you need to do is enter them as your ad’s and/or keyword’s mobile landing page. Assuming it’s just a matter of time until AdWords starts to support the AMP cache, advertisers who set up AMP now will be the first to benefit from the additional boost in speed when AdWords starts to support it. And should AdWords add a visual cue to ads with AMP landing pages (like organic does today), that could possibly produce a boost in CTR like we’ve seen so many times when they change how ads look.

Weathering the Google storms Columnist Bobby Lyons explains his method for gauging the impact of a Google algorithm update and using these insights to discover opportunities for improvement. Bobby Lyons on May 10, 2017 at 10:32 am More A good friend of mine and truly the best SEO expert I have had the privilege working with, Gregory Gromov, once referred to the Google algorithm updates and tests as “Google storms.” The coined phrase made all the sense in the world. Per Gregory, a solid SEO program provides the ballast to weather the storm, but if a storm hits and flips you over… well, it is time to right the ship. A Google algorithm update is actually a rare opportunity. While in some cases it may appear to be more of a nightmare than a dream come true, understanding how to capitalize on the event is key to succeeding in SEO — and as your program matures, you will look forward to the updates. The following is a process I have used for years to evaluate Google updates at a site level to glean new opportunities for improvement and to determine what is already working. This is a second-level analysis after I have reviewed patterns related to page title, meta description and H1 tags. The first step in the analysis is establishing the timeline of the update. Search Engine Land usually publishes information quickly when an update is confirmed, so it should be pretty easy to get an approximate date range. Once you have a date range, begin with Google Search Console (GSC) running comparisons within the date range on top pages and determine the date of impact. After establishing the approximate start date of impact, grab two weeks prior to the date and two weeks from the date forward. Export the data out to Excel, and add a column calculating the change in position between the two weeks. I like to look at positive change first; so, after creating the calculated change column, filter for values greater than 0. Note: The data represented is sample data compiled for demonstration purposes; the data is not from a live domain. As we continue the process, we will be pulling data from multiple sources and then combining the data sources to form a full view of all the critical SEO data points. Before we move to the next step, though, we should review the GSC data by itself to see if a pattern exists. Identifying patterns requires pages that have similar metrics. Add a filter for the range of change that is outside of your normal variation. For example, if your website average position for your high value pages moves up or down between 0.1 and 0.3, as is typical for page 1 rankings, then add a filter to your change column that exceeds the normal variation. For the purposes of my demonstration, we are going to look at ranges between 0.5 and 0.99. A half-position change for a page one position is significant in a two-week time frame. Now that we have a set of data to analyze, we want to grab a sample of pages that have similar metrics. Pages with similar position change, average position and click-through rates (CTR) make a good sample. Reviewing the GSC data alone in this demonstration did not produce results. Position changes in the positive range in our data set do not have common data elements on a whole. The CTR variation is significant, which tells us the positive fluctuation was not a result in a weight change in the algorithm related to the CTR… so on to the next step we go. The next step is to use the crawler of your choice. I prefer Screaming Frog due to the speed of gathering the data. Copy and paste into a text document the list of your URLs that are in the range of change you are analyzing, then perform a crawl on the URLs using the list option in Screaming Frog. For this pass, we are focused on the data elements from the crawl versus the meta data elements like description, title and so on. The idea here is to just look for data similarities that stand out. We are looking for obvious standouts. Rarely will you find the exact data point you are looking for to correlate to the position change during this step. Typically, it is through the entire process where we find multiple data points that correlate. In this example, I found a couple of correlations related to page size and response time. I know this crawl is isolated only to the group of URLs that improved in the range of a half-position, so these correlations are important to set to the side. Now I am at the point where I want to see the full picture of these URLs. Completing the picture requires exporting engagement metric data from your analytics package. Google Analytics provides this view in the Landing Pages report under Site Content. If you are using Google Analytics, export the data as well from the Site Speed -> Page Timings report. For this data we can use just the two weeks from the date of change. Obtaining the full view of the data requires consolidating the data sources. The issue with data consolidation is that Google does not utilize the same format for URLs across Google Analytics and Google Search Console. Luckily, there is a free tool to standardize the URLs. Simply take the copy and paste the URLs from GSC and Screaming Frog into this tool, and it will strip the URLs down to the root page: Copy and paste the stripped URLs into the Excel spreadsheet for GSC and Screaming Frog. If you are working with smaller data sets and/or just prefer to work directly in Excel, you can use the following formula with some minor adjustments to strip the full URL down to the page: =RIGHT(A3,LEN(A3)-FIND("/",A3,FIND("//",A3)+2)) Combining the data requires linking spreadsheets and performing vlookups — or what I prefer is to use a database tool. With larger data sets, you can use Access and combine the data quickly. Using the URLs as the joining column, you can produce a spreadsheet with all the core data elements you need to find correlations. Beyond evaluating the data, URLs with similar data points should be evaluated at a page level. For example, is the content in page similar in ratio, and if customer reviews or Q&A are present, are they present in the similar pages in similar volume? Document all of the metrics that correlate so we can validate the correlations later. In the sample data above there is an important correlation we will want to investigate. The conclusion we can draw here is that the pages that received a significant positive impact all had two correlating data points. Page load time was below four seconds and bounce rate was below 33 percent. The last step in this analysis project is to filter the data for negative change and evaluate the pages with significant declines in position and validate the theory that page load time and bounce rate exceeded the values from the positive change data set. If the data demonstrates the negative metrics are on the opposite end of the spectrum, you know exactly what you need to do to bring the negative positions up and improve the pages that improved after the algorithm update even further.

Google Home can now order you groceries from Tesco in the UK, via IFTTT Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/05/09 11:09am PDTMay 9, 2017 17 Plus 1 on G+ 38 Share on Facebook 53 Share on Twitter Total Shares108 Applications Downloads Google Home News For a couple of months now, Google Home users in the US have been able to easily order shopping from a range of US retailers through the Google Express service. Now, those in the UK are going to be treated to a similar luxury, with supermarket Tesco adding support for ordering with the Google Assitant via a clever little workaround — using a special IFTTT recipe. Following a recent update to Tesco's IFTTT channel, it's now possible to make use recipes such as "OK Google, add [something] to my basket" to include items in your next order. You can edit the phrase to be anything you want, too. So you could say "buy more milk" or "procure another kilo of caviar," and the integration will do the rest. The service will be particularly useful if you've been using Tesco home delivery for some time as it will default to favorites you already have on your account and otherwise try to give preference to items you've previously purchased. Another rather helpful feature is that when adding something once you've already finalized an order, the app will automatically amend it to include the recent addition, so long as it's not already out for delivery. Tesco is the biggest supermarket chain in the UK and it's great to see its support for technology still in its infancy. It's also especially impressive that rather than wait for Google to roll out Express in the UK (which could be a way off) it's found another way to make use of Google Assistant and compete with Amazon's Alexa in the process. To give it a try you'll need to live in the UK and have a tesco.com account. And you'll also need the IFTTT app, which you can grab using the link below or from APKMirror.

He said in a statement that the KFCB had ordered Google to take down the game from all social media sites as it is believed that the teen committed suicide for reasons connected with the game. He said that he had further written to all internet service providers to block the video from being accessed in Kenya. The Films board boss also said that he had contacted Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms to block all content related to the game. The game is being blamed for the death of the teenager in Nyamakima, Kamukunji after a he was given a challenge by a game administrator who dared him to commit suicide. The game goes through various levels of challenging dares and eventually a player is dared to commit suicide. “Anyone found allowing children to play the Challenge will be arrested and prosecuted in line with the Film and Stage Plays Act Cap 222. Under this act, it is illegal to expose children to any content that is suitable for adults only,” said Mutua. “The Board will liase with the Communication Authority of Kenya (CA) to find ways of blocking access to social media gaming applications that pose dangers to children locally under the Child Online Protection (COP) Programme,” he added. Mutua urged parents to be vigilant and watch closely content being accessed by their kids and to report any contentious content to the board through its hotline 0711222204. A couple of years back, Mutua had asked google to take a down a video which featured music containing content showing gay lovers making out. The video was never taken down but it was flagged as inappropriate. The Blue Whale challenge encourages players to harms themselves with the ultimate dare being to commit suicide. A number of US school districts have warned parents about the challenge game terming it as dangerous. When a player signs up to the challenge game, they are required to follow an administrator’s challenge over the course of 50 days which may involve cutting yourself in various places or even listening to a song. The player wins when they complete the final task, committing suicide, on the 50th day.

The move follows similar actions by Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox earlier this year. Browser vendors and certificate authorities have been engaged in a coordinated effort to phase out the use of SHA-1 certificates on the web for the past few years, because the hashing function no longer provides sufficient security against spoofing. SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) dates back to 1995 and has been known to be vulnerable to theoretical attacks since 2005. The U.S. National Institute of Standards and Technology has banned the use of SHA-1 by U.S. federal agencies since 2010, and digital certificate authorities have not been allowed to issue SHA-1-signed certificates since Jan. 1, 2016, although some exemptions have been made -- for example, for outdated payment terminals. A hash function like SHA-1 is used to calculate an alphanumeric string that serves as the cryptographic representation of a file or a piece of data. This is called a digest and can serve as a digital signature. It is supposed to be unique and non-reversible. In February, researchers from Google and CWI (Centrum Wiskunde & Informatica, a math research center in The Netherlands) have proved the first practical collision attack against SHA-1, producing two PDF files with the same SHA-1 digest. This proved without a doubt that the aging hashing function is effectively broken and should not be used for sensitive applications. [ To comment on this story, visit Computerworld's Facebook page. ] Browser vendors have planned since 2015 to flag SHA-1 certificates as insecure and block them. Google Chrome and Mozilla Firefox used a staged approach: Since early 2016 the browsers blocked SHA-1 certificates issued after Jan. 1, 2016 and since January this year they started blocking all existing SHA-1 certificates, including old ones that have long validity periods. Chrome version 56, released in January, started blocking all SHA-1 certificates that chain back to publicly trusted certificate authorities. In version 57 it also started blocking SHA-1 certificates that chain back to a local root CA. However, it provides a policy mechanism for organizations to disable this restriction. That's because enterprises might run their own internal certificate infrastructures that rely on self-generated SHA-1 root certificates and cannot easily replace them due to legacy systems that don't support newer hashing functions like SHA-2. The ban on SHA-1 certificates introduced Tuesday in IE and Edge will only impact certificates that chain to a root certificate in the Microsoft Trusted Root Program, Microsoft said in a security advisory. Enterprise and self-signed SHA-1 certificates will not be affected for now, but Microsoft's long-term plan is to phase out SHA-1 from all usages in Windows, including the function's use for verifying the integrity of downloaded files.

Privacy Advocates Raise Concerns About Mattel’s Always-On ‘Aristotle’ Baby Monitor Share on Facebook Share on Twitter RSS Feed Tweet Share Privacy Advocates Raise Concerns About Mattel’s Always-On ‘Aristotle’ Baby Monitor Image courtesy of Aristotle site May 10, 2017 12:00 pm EDT By Kate Cox@kcoxdc listening in aristotle mattel ccfc campaign for a commercial-free childhood spy toys Anyone who has watched a young child become fascinated with virtual “assistants” like Amazon’s Alexa, Apple’s Siri, or Google Home could guess that it was only a matter of time until one of these “smart” devices would be created specifically for monitoring kids. With Mattel set to release an all-in-one assistant/monitor, consumer advocates are questioning how secure, beneficial, or harmful these devices actually are. The product is called Aristotle, and looks basically like a slightly taller Google Home, and includes a wall-mounted, WiFi connected camera that promises real-time HD streaming video of your kid to your phone or tablet. And the Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood thinks it’s gross. The website for Aristotle heavily features branding for manufacturer Nabi, a kids’ electronics brand that Mattel bought the parent company of back in January. Nabi describes the product as “the first all-in-one, voice-controlled smart baby monitor that grows with your child.” It works about the same way as your Google or Amazon counter-mounted assistant, too — always listening for cue sounds, then responding — but with a few extra features. The camera lets it function as a baby monitor, and the base not only has a speaker but also incorporates a light and a sound machine. The companion app, meanwhile, promises to function as a growth, feeding, and diapering tracker for new parents, as well as parenting automation — you can set it to turn on the light and play music in your baby’s room if it detects crying, for example. Aristotle isn’t available yet, but shoppers can pre-order units, expected to ship in July, for $350. Nabi at least seems to be well aware that internet connected baby monitors and cameras are basically the worst-secured, most easily-hacked devices in the world. It promises heavy-duty encryption on your video streams, and full compliance with COPPA, which regulates how and when companies can collect and use data pertaining to children under 13. But security from would-be hackers is only a tiny, tiny fraction of the huge problems with Aristotle, the CCFC says. In a petition asking Mattel not to release Aristotle, the CCFC says the product “isn’t a nanny, it’s an intruder,” and says, “Children’s bedrooms should be free of corporate snooping.” Because Aristotle connects to other apps and online retailers, the CCFC says, data about families and children can be shared with all those partner corporations, who in turn can use it for deeply personal targeted advertising. Additionally, the CCFC says, the device itself may cause more direct harms, by interfering with parts of infant development that, while exhausting for new parents, are totally normal. For example, soothing a child in the night or reading stories to them in person has a physical bonding aspect that digital caretaking does not. The CCFC points out that when asked specifically about the effects AI has on growing children, Mattel’s chief products officer actually said, “honestly speaking, we just don’t know,” adding, “If we’re successful, kids will form some emotional ties to this. Hopefully, it will be the right types of emotional ties.” And as your baby grows into a toddler and child, Aristotle is supposed to keep up with them, answering new queries and delivering targeted, commercial content from companies with books, music, games, or apps to sell. (Imagine, for example, the marketing that could arise if your kid asks the AI about their favorite Disney movie du jour.) “Aristotle is no friend to babies or children – it’s a marketing device and a data-collecting intruder into family privacy,” CCFC Executive Director Josh Golin said in a statement. “With Aristotle, Mattel seeks to inject corporate surveillance and marketing into the most intimate and important moments of young children’s lives. We urge Mattel to not rush this device into the marketplace, but to listen to the experts who understand how Aristotle will undermine children’s healthy development,” Golin concluded. We’ve reached out to Mattel for comment on the CCFC petition and will update if we receive a response from the company. Toys and devices that listen and report back on kids have come under increased scrutiny in recent months. Back in December, a group of consumer advocates including CCFC and our colleagues at Consumers Union filed a complaint to the FTC about two dolls that record children. Similar complaints overseas led to German authorities asking parents in that country to destroy the dolls, and potentially facing hefty fines if they don’t comply. Was this helpful?

U.S. Editions Australia Edition China Edition India Edition Italy Edition Japan Edition Singapore Edition United Kingdom United States May 11, 2:57 AM EDT Subscribe Search Search Business Technology World National Media & Culture Millennial Money Entertainment Sports Subscribe Technology Police Using Technology To Fight Crime Threatens Black Neighborhoods By William Isaac AND Andi Dixon On 05/10/17 AT 12:00 PM Close In early 2017, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced a new initiative in the city’s ongoing battle with violent crime. The most common solutions to this sort of problem involve hiring more police officers or working more closely with community members. But Emanuel declared that the Chicago Police Department would expand its use of software, enabling what is called “predictive policing,” particularly in neighborhoods on the city’s south side. The Chicago police will use data and computer analysis to identify neighborhoods that are more likely to experience violent crime, assigning additional police patrols in those areas. In addition, the software will identify individual people who are expected to become – but have yet to be – victims or perpetrators of violent crimes. Officers may even be assigned to visit those people to warn them against committing a violent crime. Any attempt to curb the alarming rate of homicides in Chicago is laudable. But the city’s new effort seems to ignore evidence, including recent research from members of our policing study team at the Human Rights Data Analysis Group, that predictive policing tools reinforce, rather than reimagine, existing police practices. Their expanded use could lead to further targeting of communities or people of color. Working with available data At its core, any predictive model or algorithm is a combination of data and a statistical process that seeks to identify patterns in the numbers. This can include looking at police data in hopes of learning about crime trends or recidivism. But a useful outcome depends not only on good mathematical analysis: It also needs good data. That’s where predictive policing often falls short. Machine-learning algorithms learn to make predictions by analyzing patterns in an initial training data set and then look for similar patterns in new data as they come in. If they learn the wrong signals from the data, the subsequent analysis will be lacking. This happened with a Google initiative called “Flu Trends,” which was launched in 2008 in hopes of using information about people’s online searches to spot disease outbreaks. Google’s systems would monitor users’ searches and identify locations where many people were researching various flu symptoms. In those places, the program would alert public health authorities that more people were about to come down with the flu. But the project failed to account for the potential for periodic changes in Google’s own search algorithm. In an early 2012 update, Google modified its search tool to suggest a diagnosis when users searched for terms like “cough” or “fever.” On its own, this change increased the number of searches for flu-related terms. But Google Flu Trends interpreted the data as predicting a flu outbreak twice as big as federal public health officials expected and far larger than what actually happened. Criminal justice data are biased The failure of the Google Flu Trends system was a result of one kind of flawed data – information biased by factors other than what was being measured. It’s much harder to identify bias in criminal justice prediction models. In part, this is because police data aren’t collected uniformly, and in part it’s because what data police track reflect longstanding institutional biases along income, race and gender lines. While police data often are described as representing “crime,” that’s not quite accurate. Crime itself is a largely hidden social phenomenon that happens anywhere a person violates a law. What are called “crime data” usually tabulate specific events that aren’t necessarily lawbreaking – like a 911 call – or that are influenced by existing police priorities, like arrests of people suspected of particular types of crime, or reports of incidents seen when patrolling a particular neighborhood. Neighborhoods with lots of police calls aren’t necessarily the same places the most crime is happening. They are, rather, where the most police attention is – though where that attention focuses can often be biased by gender and racial factors. It’s not possible to remove the bias Some researchers have argued that machine learning algorithms can address systemic biases by designing “neutral” models that don’t take into account sensitive variables like race or gender. But while it may seem possible in hypothetical situations, it doesn’t appear to be the case in real life. Our recent study, by Human Rights Data Analysis Group’s Kristian Lum and William Isaac, found that predictive policing vendor PredPol’s purportedly race-neutral algorithm targeted black neighborhoods at roughly twice the rate of white neighborhoods when trained on historical drug crime data from Oakland, California. We found similar results when analyzing the data by income group, with low-income communities targeted at disproportionately higher rates compared to high-income neighborhoods. But estimates – created from public health surveys and population models – suggest illicit drug use in Oakland is roughly equal across racial and income groups. If the algorithm were truly race-neutral, it would spread drug-fighting police attention evenly across the city. Similar evidence of racial bias was found by ProPublica’s investigative reporters when they looked at COMPAS, an algorithm predicting a person’s risk of committing a crime, used in bail and sentencing decisions in Broward County, Florida, and elsewhere around the country. These systems learn only what they are presented with; if those data are biased, their learning can’t help but be biased too. Fixing this problem is not a matter of just doing more advanced mathematical or statistical calculations. Rather, it will require rethinking how police agencies collect and analyze data, and how they train their staff to use data on the job. Understanding the biases to improve the data Using predictive analytics in the real world is challenging, particularly when trying to craft government policies to minimize harm to vulnerable populations. We do not believe that police departments should stop using analytics or data-driven approaches to reducing crime. Rather, police should work to understand the biases and limitations inherent in their data. In our view, police departments – and all agencies that use predictive algorithms – should make their systems transparent to public scrutiny. This should start with community members and police departments discussing policing priorities and measures of police performance. That way any software the police use can be programmed to reflect the community’s values and concerns. Ensuring transparency It is not enough to claim or assume an algorithm is unbiased just because it is computerized and uses data: A lack of bias must be proven by evaluating the algorithm’s performance itself. Police agencies should get independent experts or human rights groups to perform regular audits of the algorithms and the data they process. Much like the annual financial reviews large companies do, these examinations can ensure the input data are valid and are analyzed properly to avoid discrimination. If a company wants to claim its algorithm is proprietary and should be kept secret, it should still be required to offer robust testing environments so outside experts can examine its performance. Further, police departments that use algorithms to make predictions about individuals, like Chicago’s Strategic Subject List does, should have policies similar to a new European Union regulation requiring human-understandable explanations of computer algorithms’ decisions. And no agency or company should be allowed to discriminate against people who have been identified by predictive policing. Used correctly, predictive policing can be used to address the complex factors underlying crime trends. For example, rather than stepping up patrols, Toronto and other cities in Canada are using predictive modeling to connect residents to local social services. By improving the quality of data cities collect, and analyzing the information with more transparent and inclusive processes, cities can build safer communities, rather than cracking down harder on areas that are already struggling.

Just think, before you try out a new product or service, don’t you usually go online to read the reviews and see what kind of experiences other customers have had? In addition to boosting your online reputation, reviews can also be used to boost your visibility and authority online. Google has always been a great place to look for reviews; their trusted stores feature contains a lot of helpful insights and information about a wide variety of popular businesses. That being said, they recently decided to do away with trusted stores in favor of a new type of review: verified customer reviews. Now it’s up to businesses to learn the difference between the two as well as how to optimize this new feature in their favor. Below I’ll explain more about what verified reviews are as well as suggest some ways businesses can use them to come out on top of the competition. What is a verified customer review? A verified customer review is a review a customer can leave after making a purchase from a company’s website. It differs from a typical Google review in that in order to leave one, a customer MUST make an online purchase, so the business being reviewed is required to have an online store. Traditional Google reviews could be left about anything (an online purchase, an in-store purchase, a customer service experience, etc.) and they could also essentially be written by anyone, even though Google discourages fake reviews. There is no way to verify that the person leaving the review actually made a purchase. These types of reviews are not going away, but because of their flaws it was necessary for Google to introduce a more reliable way to leave feedback. Image via thesearchmarketingshop.com Verified reviews stand out in the way they are obtained; after a customer makes an online purchase, they’ll be sent an email with a link asking them to leave a review. If they haven’t made a purchase, they won’t receive an email and they won’t be able leave feedback. This is great for other customers who now have a trustworthy way to determine whether a business is worth pursuing; they don’t have to try and guess if a review is authentic or not. That being said, it’s going to require some extra work on the part of entrepreneurs. You have to set up verified reviews, and then it will take some time to build up a positive reputation. Thankfully there are some things you can do to enhance your chances of coming out on top. How to sign up for verified customer reviews The following steps come straight from the Google Blog and explain exactly how you can enable customer reviews. Sign in to your Merchant Center account (or sign up if you do not have an account). Select “Merchant Center programs” from the dropdown in the upper right-hand corner. Click “Get Started” in the Google Customer Reviews card and accept the Program Agreement. Add the survey opt-in code to your website. Optional: Add the badge code to your site wherever you want. This will make the badge appear on your site, allowing you to display your seller rating and show customers that you’re integrated with Google Customer Reviews. Image via Google The key here is to remember that you have to opt-in for this feature; you won’t automatically start receiving verified reviews. Thankfully, it’s free, and if you follow the few simple steps listed above, you’re bound to start getting reviews in no time. That being said, because verified reviews are a relatively new feature, not much is known on exactly how to best optimize them in your favor. The essence of them is that they’re left by true online customers, so we’re going to focus on how you can collect as many positive reviews as possible. 1. Offer an incentive Unfortunately it’s often the customers who have bad experiences who are most likely to leave a review; most people can’t be bothered to take the time to write about a positive experience. This may change if you offer some kind of incentive for leaving a review (you can’t specify that it has to be a positive one, but most likely it will be if you run an incentive program). Include information about the incentive in your company newsletter, post about it on social media, and advertise it on your website. You can offer something like free shipping or a percentage off their next purchase for taking the time to leave a verified review; people love free stuff, and it might just be enough to encourage them to take the extra few minutes to follow the link and leave the review. It never hurts to ask!

Follow up the link with a personal email Google is already making it incredibly easy to leave a review by automatically emailing a link to customers, but there’s no reason why you can’t take it a step further and follow up their email with your own. Just because Google is asking them to leave a review doesn’t mean they’re going to do it. Customers will appreciate a more personalized email from you explaining why reviews are important to small businesses and how much you would appreciate them reviewing the product they just purchased, as well as your business overall. If you don’t want to send an email you can also follow up with a phone call if you have that information. It’s much easier to say no to a computer than it is to a human, and many people are receptive to the idea of helping a small business succeed. Throw in an incentive for leaving a review and you’re golden! 3. Respond to both positive and negative reviews It’s not enough to just ask people to leave a review; you also need to respond after they’ve done so. If they leave a positive review, reach out and thank them for taking the time to do so. If they leave a negative one, it’s even more imperative that you respond and try to rectify the situation. Find out exactly what they’re unhappy about and try to make it right. Even if you can’t satisfy that particular customer, other patrons will see that you’ve taken the time to address the concern and try to fix the issue and they’ll appreciate that. One or two bad reviews don’t necessarily have to ruin your reputation as long as you handle them appropriately.

Regardless of how you get them, reviews are essential for business success and we recommend that you take the extra time to cultivate relationships with your customers so that they’re motivated to leave positive feedback. Now that verified customer reviews have been introduced, we foresee Google reviews holding even more weight with customers, so it’s important that you collect positive ones for your business.

Chrome version 56, released in January, started blocking all SHA-1 certificates that chain back to publicly trusted certificate authorities. In version 57 it also started blocking SHA-1 certificates that chain back to a local root CA. However, it provides a policy mechanism for organizations to disable this restriction. That’s because enterprises might run their own internal certificate infrastructures that rely on self-generated SHA-1 root certificates and cannot easily replace them due to legacy systems that don’t support newer hashing functions like SHA-2. The ban on SHA-1 certificates introduced Tuesday in IE and Edge will only impact certificates that chain to a root certificate in the Microsoft Trusted Root Program, Microsoft said in a security advisory. Enterprise and self-signed SHA-1 certificates will not be affected for now, but Microsoft’s long term plan is to phase out SHA-1 from all usages in Windows, including the function’s use for verifying the integrity of downloaded files.

(AAPL) Stock Can Hit $185 Snap Inc (SNAP) Stock Still Has Too Much to Prove View All Posts On Tuesday, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) unveiled Echo Show, an addition to its market-leading Echo speaker line. The Seattle-based tech giant says the product, which has has the ability to perform video calls from its built-in screen, will cost $230 and will begin shipping on June 28. With that in mind, to what extent can Echo Show propel AMZN stock higher? Source: Shutterstock With its display capabilities, the Echo Show — powered by Alexa’s artificial-intelligence — allows users to perform a wide range of visual tasks. “Now Alexa can show you things,” Amazon said on its site. “Watch video flash briefings and YouTube, see music lyrics, security cameras, photos, weather forecasts, to-do and shopping lists, and more. All hands-free — just ask.” AMZN Stock and the Battle for Home Turf  The company’s smart speaker technology, which in 2016 broke all sorts of records in terms of sales, has created a new market that will help Amazon stock grow in the long run. It’s a market where Alphabet, Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google is racing to catch up with Google Home. Although Google Home arrived after Amazon’s Echo, Google recently announced that its product now offers support for multiple users on its device. Meanwhile, Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is rumored to be working on a smart speaker system of its own with its Siri artificial intelligence technology. Bloomberg recently reported that Apple’s Echo-type device has moved beyond the research and development stage and is now being prototype-tested by Apple engineers in their homes. Reports suggests that the device, which will be tied to Apple’s iOS ecosystem, will enable users to play music from Apple Music, read e-mails and send text messages using voice commands. And to say nothing about Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has just entered the battle by teaming up with Harman International, a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics (OTCMKTS:SSNLF). Can AMZN stock and Amazon, which research firm eMarketer estimates will sell some 25 million Echo devices this year, maintain its lead? Amazon doesn’t break out its sales numbers for Echo, but analysts believe it had sold more than 8 million Echo speakers as of January 2017. 7 Stocks to Buy Now for BIG Summer Outperformance Tuesday’s announcement by AMZN, however, not only demonstrates how serious the company believes the smart speaker market can grow, it also hints of the many ways it can collect data to further dominate retail by pushing into a new area of services — particularly the calling and messaging features. Amazon, which recently open-sourced the Echo hardware to developers, continues to spend tons of money to improve the platform. It has also funded university fellowships for research into use cases for the device. Bottom Line for Amazon Stock AMZN stock, which has risen 26% year-to-date, closed Tuesday at $952.82. Although the stock is not cheap at a forward P/E of 142, betting on Amazon remains the smarter play than betting against it. And until CEO Jeff Bezos loses his Midas-like qualities, Amazon stock should reach $1,200 in the next 12 to 18 months, yielding more than 25% returns. As of this writing, Richard Saintvilus did not hold a position in any of the aforementioned securities.

The day began with a keynote address from Rabin Yaghoubi, Chief Commercial Officer at Babylon Health. Rabin’s team at Babylon created an AI-powered virtual physician app that boasts over 750,000 users worldwide. The keynote introduced a recurring theme of the day: that the global demand for access to healthcare professionals is exponentially outstripping our ability to train them. To combat this problem Babylon’s app provides an AI platform for diagnosis with the possibility of connecting to a doctor for confirmation and a prescription. The work of the Babylon team showed the power of leveraging big data to predict health problems and intervene early, keeping people healthy enough to avoid a visit to a real doctor. Rabin also emphasized that when connecting human interaction with machine learning, the quality and sophistication of any training set must be carefully considered to account for geography, context, and human factors. Ground-breaking research on facial recognition and feature analysis was presented by Maja Pantic, from Imperial College. The research is underpinned by sophisticated machine learning models that are beginning to extract features we often consider to be readable by humans alone, such as gender, mood, thoughts, and personality. Maja’s work has a particular focus on aging, dementia, and depression; her striking findings suggest that it is the quality of facial expressions, such as smiling and eye movements, that often hold the key to a diagnosis. Jordi Guitart, from Atem-NT, predicted a future in which clinicians will be training and working hand-in-hand with machine learning systems, thus moving diagnosis “from perception to cognition.” Jordi’s presentation addressed a common misconception of the futurist vision in AI: it is important to remember that machine learning systems are no more accurate than humans, but they do learn significantly faster from their mistakes. The presentation went on to showcase impressive work by the Atem-NT team that used AI-based feature recognition to accurately identify metastases in low-quality imaging that could reduce the time and cost burdens for hospitals by an order of magnitude. Rupert Whitehead, from Google developer relations, pointed out the increasing number of Google products that are powered by machine learning. Of particular interest was the discussion of Google’s open source TensorFlow machine learning library that is being used in-house at Google and which is also available for anyone to install on systems of different scales, from smart phones to data centers! Spyros Kotoulas, detailed the work of IBM Research against the startling statistic that in the US and Europe only 10% of the population accounts for 90% of the complexity and cost of healthcare delivery. Spyros spoke of “building software to help people help people” and using the gains in computational power to understand more dimensions of health, including behavior, environment, and genetics. In one of IBM’s social care projects, patient empowerment and decision-making are placed center stage by using AI software to remove mundane tasks for care professionals, allowing more time to prioritize face-to-face engagement. Bringing a clinical perspective, Indra Joshi, NHS England, spoke about some of the complexities of integrating decision-making software into the clinical realm, and stressing that the power of such systems lies not in replacing clinicians, but in improving clinicians’ ability to do their jobs. A number of example initiatives from within the NHS illustrated how smarter systems are provisioning care more appropriately, improving the outcomes of the very sickest patients, and giving peace of mind to patients receiving palliative care in the community. Indira also cautioned the audience to ask the tough questions that remained unanswered, including: “who should have governance over the data of more than 65 million people in the NHS system?” In the afternoon session, Billy Boyle, CEO of Owlstone Medical and who was interviewed by Medgadget last year, presented inspiring results of early cancer detection using the company’s innovative breathalyzer system. Capitalizing on the human lung’s fantastic ability to exchange molecules from the blood to breath, the Owlstone medical team has supposedly developed a diagnostic platform that requires only one minute of breathing into a mask to sample the biochemistry of all the blood in the body. This system is coupled with detection algorithms that can offer real-time readouts of blood chemistry and the possibility of monitoring disease progression entirely non-invasively. The Owlstone team hopes to use the technology to improve stage-one cancer diagnoses—in particular, hard-to-diagnose lung and colorectal cancers—and increase the survival rate from a painfully low number that has effectively not changed in decades. Gareth Stokes and Bonella Ramsay, from DLA Piper, guided the audience though the complex and ever-changing waters of legal issues relating to artificial intelligence and healthcare. Together they offered valuable advice for founders and tech-entrepreneurs on data-sharing collaborations with large healthcare providers, as well as insight into data protection and security. The talk sparked a lively discussion, especially regarding the burden of responsibility for software-generated mistakes and the complexities of IP protection in a system perceptually adapting and altering itself in response to data. Nuno Godinho, from GE Healthcare, posed the interesting question of how connected machines in the Internet of Things (IoT) will impact healthcare, given the disruption to business and commerce seen from connecting 1 billion individuals over the internet. A number of GE’s projects that blur the line between the physical and digital were discussed, including “digital twins”—entirely virtual instances of real-world objects like jet engines, which may be monitored and tested with both measured data and hypothetical risks to better understand performance. Nuno also predicted an impending clash between clinical and consumer health data, exemplified by the possible health insurance implications of activity trackers, but cautioned the audience that in ignoring such issues we risk obsolescence. Pearse Keane, of the Moorfields Eye Hospital, spoke about reinventing the eye exam for the 21st century by integrating machine learning into optical coherence tomography (OCT). Pearce showcased new OCT hardware he has co-developed, which allows for increased diagnostic accuracy with more automation and reduced waiting times in the eye exam. The Moorfields team is also collaborating with Google DeepMind, using a dataset of 1.2 million patient images to help automate early detection and exponentially improve outcomes for diabetic retinopathy and age-related macular degeneration patients. The event was brought to a close by Shafi Ahmed, from Medical Realities, who discussed the so-called Fourth Industrial Revolution and its implications for medicine. He spoke of how the traditional role of the physician—talking to a patient whilst holding their hand—has not changed in 5,000 years, but that disruptive technology has the power to radically change this. Shafi predicted a future “not FaceTiming with a clinician on a screen, but V-Timing by virtually porting your hologram anywhere in the world.” Shafi echoed a common sentiment of the day by insisting we must confront the challenge of disruptive technology in healthcare due to its immense potential power…or in Shafi’s own words: “innovation that is disruptive enough to have put me in Cosmopolitan magazine!” During the conference, an unparalleled level of technical and policy expertise from speakers and participants alike was on display; lively discussion that spanned disciplines and perspectives continued throughout the day, united by a fervent desire to shape the future of healthcare.

Google is having issues with account sign-in, resulting in errors with Android devices, OnHub, and Wifi Phil Oakley Follow View All Posts 2017/02/24 5:48am PDTFeb 24, 2017 18 Plus 1 on G+ 184 Share on Facebook 91 Share on Twitter Total Shares293 Google News My Google account is the key to much of what I do online, so not being able to use it is a bummer. Since yesterday, many people have been having issues signing in to their accounts - we at Android Police have been seeing this across the US and Europe. However, Google has confirmed on the Product Forums that this is not the result of a hack or malicious activity. Google is aware of the issue, and has put a note up on the Google Play support page, saying "If you’ve recently been signed out of your account, sign back in using your usual username and password at https://accounts.google.com. If you can’t remember your password or can’t sign in for another reason, go here to recover your account password. For security reasons, our support agents are unable to assist with password issues." According to Down Detector, the company is still having issues, although possibly not as widespread as before. However, the problems are not the result of a hack or phishing, so if you have been signed out, you shouldn't need to change your password, as your account is still secure. Google account issue, having been signed out of the account. Google has confirmed that this is what has been causing Google Wifi and OnHub products to reset themselves. This unfortunately means the devices need to be set up again. Google lists how you can tell if the device has been reset, and how to re-set it up, on the support page. If you've recently been signed out of your Google account, sign back in here. Let us know in the comments what you've been seeing, and we'll try and keep you updated with any new developments.

Google account OAuth tokens stored by third-party apps that use Cloudflare could have been exposed. It's weird, too, since it also deauthed every app I was signed into, including Google Apps Script. It seems that something on your end went through every request you had in that data sample (and Google's cache), invalidated tokens if it found any, then prompted the user to sign in again. Like David, I'm just speculating, as I couldn't find anything related to this in my G Suite console as well." Ben Lee well said using your Google account may be, but this is direct login to Google itself, which would not be affected in itself. I only had the Google accounts logged out on the device, no specific apps were affected. My apps account and main Google account, 2 others went affected. Ivunsasu This happened to me last night. I didnt know what was going on. I thought I got hacked or something (even though my password didn't change). Checked all my credentials and everything was in-tact. Changed my PW anyways. Glad to know this is the cause. This happened for about 2 hours last night, then I restarted my phone, and things have been quiet since then. Bill D Same here - I guess a small side benefit is a lot of users updating their account passwords! Ivunsasu yep <3 drksilenc Same i use a yubikey for security though so a breach is unlikely. Swaminathan Guru Ran into this issue today on my Pixel, while at the same time I was signed in fine on my OP3 Andrew Ran into this on my s7 edge and chrome on desktop Suicide_Note I've not had any problems, but my wife noticed it on her Gmail. alexus I have same issue on nexus 6p & watch Tomáš Petrík Me and whole family had the issue last night. Ben Lee Had this last night on 2 of my accounts on tablet and mobile, very frustrating. I got scared and changed my passwords, thought someone was messing with my account. Glad I've discovered it was a Google issue. rjyanj Holy fuck. I thought my account had been compromised and my identity stolen! Glad I finally saw this 12 hours later. Adrian I had this happen last night. Signed back in and haven't had any problems since. It only happened on my phone though. They texted the code for me to enter, I did, and everything worked as usual. Milo Joseph Jesus google dont scare me like that.. I thought my life was over.. Scary how important a google account is HSidhu I know shadowx360 Good time to remind everyone that it's imperative to run two factor authentication on your main Google account. Google doesn't support security questions anymore so if someone takes your account, it's almost impossible to take your life back. Impulse_Vigil Set up a backup email/phone # and store those emergency codes too. Daniyyel Django Touboul wow I feel you, I was 90% sure that my account was hacked. Justin I got hit with the google home bug that prevents it from responding to anything, saying there's a problem or a glitch, and when I rebooted it, I had to unlink and relink my account. Thinking that having to sign in again is related to this as it hit my pixel yesterday afternoon and my chrome browser at home this morning. Weird. YaKillaCJ Ran into it last night on my Umi Super. Said changes has been made to my terms or something. So I need to login, but it wouldn't. So I backup after entering my password twice and I was never logged out. I was like hmm, I'll just monitor my account activity for a bit because I would rather not have to change my password. But this article is a relief. Stephane Sby Balmy Same, woke up with "sign in please" on my phone, i freaked out and i was about to factory reset my phone + change my password... Gonna do it anyway i think Wayne Randall Changing your password and then factory resetting your device _will_ lock it down, IIRC. Be particular in which order you choose. I'm certain I will be corrected if I'm wrong. Stephane Sby Balmy Thanks for the warning, the order i plan to use is PW change, then factory reset. 07070 I don't have this, last changed my account password 3 days ago though. bolski I've been seeing this apparently from my phone. I don't have any Google WiFi products, unless my Chromecast is one of them. Oatz Just knew I was hacked. Stop it Google! Playing with my emotions! Cinj Had the issue last night while using OGYoutube. I merely thought Google was finally blocking that app. thingswentworsethanexpected.jpg.exe Cai I was wondering why my phone asked me for my password again. 😂 OmniWrench I would just like to add my voice to the "Oh that's what that was!" chorus. Thanks for the heads up, much appreciated... Plus this gives me a link to send to tech-support relatives as well. Gohan040 Happend to me yesterday evening in the Netherlands. First I noticed I google assistant didn't work properly on my pixel c, tho it worked on my Nexus 4 which I o ly use as a assistant in my bedroom. (No google home in the Netherlands sad enough) A few minutes later I noticed a notification from Google on my s6 edge. If I could sign in again, so I did with two step verification. Everything looks fine again at the moment. 8giggles The odd thing to me is that I'm logged into my account in my browser, both on my phone & office desktop. My phone/Google apps need me to sign back in & it's telling me there's been a CHANGE to my account. What change?! I didn't do any change. Did THEY do something? And if so, a heads-up would have been appreciated. But if there was a change to my account, why am I still logged into my Google acct online? The Zombie Hustler Exactly. I'm curious now as to what happened that caused this Travis Coble Completely forgot about that, same here. Upon review no event signifying a change could be found in account history. 😕 Impulse_Vigil Same, I went to my security settings and checked it hadn't been logged in elsewhere or on other devices, it wasn't so didn't think much of it after that. Glitches happen, they should probably revise their stock messages and/or how these glitches are labeled at time of re-login tho. llf It's okay for us who know a bit about the Internet and we can search for the answer that "Google just logged you out, log in back and no panic." But, Google needs to know that some non-geeky people depend on their service too. I set up location service for my senior family members. And they were logged out. Then I lost their whereabout. Try to feel how I felt. 😕 Just hope Google has learnt from this issue and avoid it in the future. 8giggles 😮😲 That would have really upset me too! Steven Santinelli weird, only device that had issues was the nexus 5x. all the tablets were fine, S7 was fine, and wifi and home were fine... :) Jordan L I had the "change to your account" bug yesterday too, around 4:45pm EST. I basically had to sign into everythign thing again. My friend said he Google Authenticator 2step was not working either, codes were not accepted. (I'm guessing he had to remove and re-add it.) Feels like it's working now. really curious what happened. feels like an emergency hack response or something of that nature. HSidhu BiG Data leak at Google, Accounts hacked. Jordan L they would have forced password change, no? OR it's somekind of account token leak. just actually read the article above... Google would have said, "we are investigating a small, isolated security incident". right?! HSidhu no company will say that to keep their reputation, question to you why we know about the BIG data leaks after 2 years? example - Target, Yahoo (Yahoo was silent for 2 years). The Zombie Hustler I'm from India. Same thing happened to me last night. Changed my passwords on all the accounts and applied 2 step verification, thinking my account had somehow been compromised. Glad I'm not the only one lol Sean Thomas had to log in to all three google accounts I have on my phone last night. was weird. The Zombie Hustler So. What EXACTLY happened that caused this? Fred this actualy is Google's reaction to cloudbleed : https://blog.cloudflare.com/incident-report-on-memory-leak-caused-by-cloudflare-parser-bug/ Matt S. Was wondering if that cloubleed issue had to do with this. I had been asked to re-sign into my accounts all over the place for Google products and somehow didn't put two and two together. Gabriele Tomberli It has been confirmed by Google to not be related actually: https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=1139#c25 Matt S. Huh wow, pretty curt response on closing the thread there. Wonder what the actual issue is? Arkitech Not really. He was right in stating it was completely wrong to ask there. More often than not folks who have that sort of knowledge level will be curt about most things. I work with a lot of them so maybe i'm just used to it?? ¯_(ツ)_/¯ Matt S. Ha yeah, not the place and it was to the point, just sometimes feels a bit impersonal. TomCarchrae all the related security fallout could be considered to the point though, and that would be a lot! sadly, i doubt we'll ever see a transparent anything ever come out of google in terms of reacting to a breach. Pranjal Bhatia Happened to me a couple of days ago. I wasn't able to login and every time it showed "Server error try again" , on contacting google , they told me to change date & time manually and login again and it worked. They told me it was a sync error. This happened on another device of mine , i simply just logged back in and the issue hasn't returned. AdamH I have no issues. But few days ago Youtube was down for like 2 or 3 hours in the Czech rep. It might have something to do with this. Brian Flores Happened to me as well. My accounts also said "Brand Account" underneath them. It was the weirdest thing. Good to know I shouldn't be alarmed. Leo Ya, happened to me in Canada too. debsuvra I was just logged out of my secondary Google account on a third party mail app on Android. Primary email account works fine, both on phone and PC. Howard Stern ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ keep being asked to log in to my chrome browser at work and a tablet at home....i'm not getting this at home. nor on my phone. Dustin Gerlach I was unable to use my Google account on my phone for about 3 hours yesterday. exquisitemb I came home from work yesterday and worked for hours trying to figure out what was wrong with my Google WiFi spots.. Glad to see there was an actual cause for it.. Badouken This freaked me out so much last night. I went ahead and enabled a ton of security settings and was still receiving it. I was like what's going on?!?!? DirkBelig Happened on my Nexus 6P last night and thought it was some malware hack despite no w4r3z being loaded or even being rooted. Suspected phishing, but it seemed legit and reentered PW. Later it popped up on my Nexus 7 and my buddy's Pixel XL. Later, when word was finally getting around that there was some sort of glitch with El Goog, when I was logged out of my Nvidia SHIELD I wasn't worried. Robin I am from India and yesterday I face this issue, but only I face this issue in my family strange. PJ I do know my password and have entered it in all my devices only to have the pop up say my Google Account Has Been Changed and I need to enter my password which I had just done. It does not recognize my password. WTF? Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez That happened to me last night as well and was like "What?!!" Anyhow, after the shocking experience I though perhaps is time for me to change my password once and for all for all my web accounts, it's the same since two years ago. I know I've been doing this wrong in the wrong way because you are suppose to change it every 6 months, but Man, it is kind of bummer since I have to go through about 40 different webs sites, it is a process that takes a lot of time and effort in my case :( Ahnaf Mahmud Android Police you should probably check your site connection with cloudflare. Kim Having issues with it in Airmail on my iOS Travis Coble Had this happen yesterday on my 6P, and was seriously nervous I had been hacked. The best part? My two factor authentication made everything worse, as everytime a verification code was sent via text (NOT my preferred method FYI), Google Sign-In would spaz out and reset, so the process was repeated three to five times. A quick reset seemed to fix the issue, and I have been using my account with no apparent issues. imsoupercereal Glad I saw this. I did a lot of digging last night to make sure my account wasn't compromised. Ming William Lee I had it last night, really scared, especially AP did not post anything on it at the time... -Matoro Zeliph- I THOUGHT I WAS HACKED yesterday! This isn't funny Google! Maybe they did this on purpose so that we can change our passwords to be stronger. No longer I will use my pets name as a Google password Cakefish Looks like I am in the tiny minority who wasn't affected at all. Weird. Rob Same here Maria Hernandez I had this happen to me and thought someone tried to hack my account. I have that 2 step verification turned on so I wasn't too worried. Demonshout Thought I was hacked lastnight, changed my password and everything. saf1927 Had this issue yesterday, but I simply had to enter the password and the 2FA code to get back to business. Hurricane Andrew This happened to be yesterday as well. I was concerned, and went to my security settings to check for any new device sign-ins or security events, and there were none, so I felt a little better but have still been uneasy. This article clears up my remaining concerns and puts me at ease. Thanks for the coverage, Phil! SB This happened when I tried to watch a movie on our LG Smart TV. When tried to rent a movie I had to enter in the code that was shown on the tv as verification. SpasilliumNexus Welp I'm temporarily locked out of my phone. I've got hit with this on my 3T and changed my password. At the same time I was backing stuff up to do a factory reset. After I did the reset, when I try to sign in on the phone it says I have to wait 24 hours. Jen Unfortunately, this is different from and unrelated to the weird issue that's been plaguing many Google Home users for over a week and is therefore causing our problem to get less attention (because support thinks we're talking about this account linking/sign in thing). For some reason, after a random (small) number of home automation commands, the GH just stops responding with anything other than "something went wrong, try again in a few seconds" until the device is rebooted from the 3 dot menu in the app. Then all is fine again until a few more home automation commands are issued. While there is now a pinned thread about this in the product forums (https://productforums.google.com/forum/#!topic/googlehome/tOFxNFN_exg), it doesn't look like any significant progress has been made on even officially acknowledging the issue and its status. thespacecowboy It weirdly only happened on one of my google accounts, and not both of them. I trusted it as it was a proper google notification rather than an email. I HOPE those can't be spoofed... Juniors234 Just got signed out for no reason from my Google Account 5 mins ago. -__- HSidhu Change your password, big data leak at Google. Hamdi Ferchichi On Windows 10 too! Ailín Ó’S I had this happen in Ireland on my Nexus 9 and OnePlus 3. Scared me to no end! Pedro Diego Fernández I was freaking out about this yesterday and found nothing online, only 2 or 3 post from 3 years ago, without any clear explanation... now I have 2steps verification and my tinfoil hat on just in case HSidhu Big G is not safe anymore, moving my photos from Google Photos. Vivek Rameses It hasn't been for years. Probably around the time they dropped the do no evil motto. wjrandon In addition to my Android devices. My Google account has been disconnected from Chrome on various computers and applications that depend on Google Sign-in have lost their account authorization. gosa Had this one last night (CET) Googled the issue, but I either didn't search properly or I was too early. Went through two "better safe than sorry" password resets because of the lack of information found. But at least I learned about two factor verification in the process... Robert Nicewander Keep an eye on things, I had to sign in on my phone yesterday and today I've gotten two phishing E-mails. May be unrelated, but I rarely get these kind of E-mails and I don't believe in coincidence... SIGTRAP Got that notification on my phone last night. I bet the intern over at Google tripped over an ethernet cable. Martial Clausse Happened to me too... Removed my account, deleted cache & data from Google play services. Readded my account. Everything works now. Andrew Brereton For me it's only the new Google Voice app. Every time it opens I have to sign in, and when it's backgrounded I don't get any notifications. Very frustrating. Everything else works though. Socaltyger Still can't log into my YouTube account on my Nvidia shield. Keeps getting the same error message. Lee Anne L Happened to me yesterday and I'm in Ontario Canada =( Ignacio Nallar My Google Now (I believe now it's Feed, can't keep up) won't load since yesterday. Might be related? TedPhillips i had assumed this was because of the sha1 break, they want people to sign in again to rehash tokens... that said, my account got dinged several time a couple of weeks ago, heard about this though last night from the 'rents (thought they had been hacked) Paul Yep happened to me on my tablet, phone and desktop chrome browser but once I signed back in on all of them, it worked without any issues. Was strange because I was in the Google Play Store at the time and it just happened out of the blue, anyway, glad it's not a security issue. ekngee yup, happened to me as well. woke up with a notification telling me to sign in because "something was changed". and my 2FA got reverted to SMS, not Google Prompt. when i went in to check my security settings, Google Prompt could not find my phone. >:( had to remove and add back my account to get things working again. keithzg I had this yesterday, but by today my phone is back and listed without me having to do anything. (Note: I live in Edmonton, Alberta.) ashjas This is due to yesterday's cloudbleed data leek bug of cloudfare in my guess,that google is being silent of. Vivek Rameses Same here on my device. My apps in play store says authorization required. But I could care less. Not doing any harm. dsignrr I had an issue with my Motorola tablet the week before last, when after some updates all my google apps ceased to function. Gmail and Maps would open and immediately close again, while Drive and Photos would open to show only some of my files and pics. Google sign in was posting error messages saying there was no wifi even though the tablet showed strong signal and other apps, including Play Store were functional. I tried everything, even did a factory reset on the device, and after 2 days of wasting time, I bought a new tablet and erased everything again on the Motorola. All my other devices, phones, other tablet, and laptop, had no issues with accessing my Google account. I can only assume that some update affected that particular unit. It is running Android 4.1 and I "did" disable Play Services and uninstall the updates followed by fresh updating to no avail. Michael During this period my Hangouts send a few blank messages to someone on my friends list. I do have 2 factor auth enabled. mazamorac Speculation: Google forced everyone's sessions to log out to protect them against Cloudbleed session token caching. I for one am grateful that I've had to reauthenticate. I also changed my application-specific passwords, make sure you do so if you're using 2FA. Darnell Good to see Google has made an announcement. Google still beats the heck out of a Yahoo account :-D . Hex I still cant get any help from Google. They are not sending the code to my phone still. How to fix this? When I use my email, they send the code, but then it links to 3 different accounts Ive never seen before. Also when I ask for them to find my account, put in my phone number and name it says there is no account. Can anyone help? Is there a way to contact google by phone? Wallace Finch My phone can log into Google just fine with the browser but the Gmail refuses to sync. I can't authenticate the account, it keeps saying the password is wrong (it isn't). I've disconnected the account from my phone and then re-connected, but it still won't log in. Courtney&Cyrus Staley Still locked out two weeks later because the two step codes aren't being sent right either. They say they're aware of the issue and working on it. Doesn't help. Alisa MotoAdventureGal This sign out issue happens to me several times a day. The result is that I do not get incoming text messages because I have been inadvertently signed out of my Google account. The frustrating thing is that I only get signed out of Google Voice, not email or Google Drive. What's worse, is that I was just in Cuba. I inadvertently got signed out of my account due to their system errors, and then when I tried to sign back in I was told that this service is not supported in this country. So I had zero access to my Google account. Very frustrating! halfbloodnative I need help info got a new phone and it's saying that their has been a recent password change try back in 24 hours is this the case after 24 hours will it let me log in the Google account I have two other devices and they are working fine was told that it's a security feature and nothing I can do for 24 hours please is this true I'm going nuts trying to fix this and I'm not touching my phone untill 24 hours is up and I was told if I try any sooner then that it will reset the clock is this true charley peixe New sign in came a couple of days ago, what fucking shit it is, how many times l need click to get it to turn to my email address, then how many times l need to click to get it to accept, google is finished and l am going to yahoo instead, years of google crap is enough.

And if Google does ultimately decide to support the simplified version of Windows, it would require a much different app than the one desktop users are running today. ZDNet has confirmed with Microsoft that “Windows Store apps that browse the web must use HTML and JavaScript engines provided by the Windows Platform.” On Windows, Chrome’s underlying code doesn’t currently use those engines. Windows 10 S only allows users to install apps from the Windows Store, so this stipulation would seem to eliminate any possibility of Chrome being on the platform — unless Google reworks the browser to use Microsoft’s favored engines. Even then, users would be unable to pick Chrome as their default browser. Microsoft’s Edge browser running on a Windows 10 S laptop from Dell. Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge But Google has acquiesced in these situations before; the Chrome browser on iOS utilizes WebKit instead of Google’s Blink engine. It’s based on the same underlying foundation as Apple’s own Safari browser, but looks and feels like Chrome to the end user. If Google wants to put Chrome on Windows 10 S, it will need to resort to a similar solution. Should the company decide against that, Microsoft will certainly deal with complaints from consumers over Chrome’s absence. Google might opt to build a compatible version should Windows 10 S overcome potential confusion and find success. Even then, Chrome would always be a second-class citizen to Edge — just as it is to Safari on iPhones. Microsoft is quick to point out that Windows 10 S customers have the option of upgrading to Windows 10 Pro for a more traditional and open app experience. Once they’ve paid the $49 fee, they can use any browser they’d like. Other operating systems like iOS and ChromeOS (the platform that Microsoft is directly competing against with Windows 10 S) have comparable rules in place. And just like Apple and Google, Microsoft says the chief reason behind this policy is providing carefree security. “With this policy, instated early this year, the browser a customer chooses in the Store will ensure the protections and safeguards of our Windows platform.” The Verge has reached out to Google for comment on the company’s plans around Windows 10 S.

Those miles were logged over the course of the last eight years in Mountain View, California; Austin, Texas; and Phoenix, Arizona, by everything from the company’s new self-driving minivans to its Lexus SUVs, and the tiny bug-like “Google Car,” too. What’s important about Waymo’s milestone is the speed with which it logged the last million miles. It took seven years (2009–2016) to reach 2 million miles when the project was still a part of Google. Spinning the self-driving effort off into its own company in December — and adding 100 autonomous minivans to the fleet — seems to have accelerated things, because the project logged 1 million miles in the last seven months alone. We’ve reached 3 million miles of self-driving on public roads! That’s 1 million miles in just 7 months pic.twitter.com/VsC1ZSscbY— Waymo (@Waymo) May 9, 2017 Waymo’s self-driving cars seem to be getting safer as they drive more miles, too. Data released by the California Department of Motor Vehicles in February showed a huge drop in the number of times that Waymo’s human engineers had to take control of the self-driving cars. That increase in safety likely played a role in the company’s recent decision to start offering people rides in its autonomous minivans in and around Phoenix, Arizona. Overall, though, data has been harder to come by since the company was spun off from Google. Under Google, the project spent more than a year publishing monthly reports on its progress, including detailed accident reports. Since becoming Waymo, the project has shifted to releasing information in scattershot blog posts on Medium. Tesla said last year that its customers have driven well over 100 million miles with the company’s semi-autonomous Autopilot feature active, by far the most by any company that’s working on this kind of technology. But Waymo’s miles are fully autonomous, something Tesla has not yet achieved. Whether it can sustain or even accelerate its testing efforts testing will hinge on whether state DMVs and Trump’s new transportation secretary remain kind to what companies like Waymo are doing.

N E X T Email Print Save Text:  A A Google Paid Search Trends: 1Q17 by Ayaz Nanji  |   May 10, 2017  |  856 views Tweet Kindle Email Top The proportion of clicks on Google AdWords units originating from mobile phones increased significantly in the first quarter of 2017 (1Q17) compared with the first quarter of 2016, according to recent research from iProspect. The report was based on 1Q17 paid search data from 1,300 Google AdWords accounts and more than 176,000 active campaigns. Some 59% of clicks on Google paid search units in 1Q17 came from mobile phones, up 24% from 1Q16; 32% of clicks in 1Q17 came from desktop computers, and 10% from tablets. Although smartphones accounted for a larger share of paid search clicks in 1Q17, the average clickthrough rate (CTR) for mobile units decreased 27% from 1Q16 levels. That decrease in CTR was likely because of Google's introduction in mid-2016 of additional paid search units on mobile SERPs as well as increased competition for mobile inventory. Cost per click (CPC) increased for paid search units across all devices from 1Q16 to 1Q17, with the largest increase coming from mobile (up 42%); desktop and tablet CPCs increased 26% and 18%, respectively. About the research: The report was based on 1Q17 paid search data from 1,300 Google AdWords accounts and more than 176,000 active campaigns.

Previous, Google would raise your max CPC bid by up to 30% but Google is removing that bid cap completely. Google wrote in their help document "We’re now removing the 30% bid cap to fully account for differences in conversion rates across dimensions like audience and location." Google explained that "this means you generally won’t have to set bid adjustments when using ECPC." "You may still want to set a bid adjustment for mobile, as ECPC doesn’t adjust for the difference in conversion rates between mobile and other devices," Google added. Here is a screen shot of the announcement, which is linked to in the alerts section of some AdWords accounts: @zgromadzenie notified of this change this morning. @zgromadzenie Hi Krzych, thanks for your inputs. I'll be sure to pass this on as feedback for our product teams. -Adi— Google AdWords (@adwords) May 10, 2017 Forum discussion at Twitter.

May 10, 2017 • 8:25 am | (0) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google Search Engine Optimization Prev Story Next story Tweet Pin It   Prev Story Next Story Ever see a spike in the 404 errors reported in Google Search Console's crawl error report? Espesially from URLs that have been 404ed for ages? Well, it can happen said Google's John Mueller. He said that Google will periodically retry old 404 URLs to see if anything changed with those URLs. He posted a response on Twitter saying: @davidwkelley @googlewmc AFAIK no change in reporting. We periodically recrawl older URLs to see if there's something awesome there, maybe you're seeing that.— John ☆.o(≧▽≦)o.☆ (@JohnMu) May 9, 2017 So if you see such spikes, there is no need to panic, espesially if those pages should be 404ing. If you see 404 responses on pages that should exist, then you probably should panic. Otherwise, don't worry about it. It is a good thing that Google retries old 404 URLs. I mean, what if you put new content on a URL that once was 404ed, don't you want Google to find it? Forum discussion at Twitter.

The app itself isn’t meant to reflect the true user experience of the upcoming operating system and is only intended to serve as a preview of things to come. Following the installation of Fuchsia OS 1.0 “Armadillo,” users will be presented with a launcher that looks unlike any other user interface Google introduced with Android so far. While the vanilla version of Fuchsia features some rather noticeable elements of Material Design, the platform itself seems much more streamlined that Google’s ubiquitous operating system that’s been dominating the smartphone market for years. The Fuchsia launcher revolves around a central card that contains basic information including time, date, and battery level, and also features what seems to be the profile picture of the device owner. Tapping the profile picture expands the card and shows a number of commands that Android would usually situate in its (expanded) notification panel. From here, users are able to change the volume and brightness level of their device, control its orientation lock, turn Airplane mode on or off, or quickly connect to a Wi-Fi network. The card also features the option for logging out of one’s account that’s located immediately above a “More” button, but neither element is functional in the current Fuchsia OS build. Regardless, the button on the bottom of the launcher’s central panel will likely be used to further expand the list of quick settings. The remainder of the user interface is dedicated to email and stories apps, in addition to featuring an “Ask for anything” card that’s labeled with a Google logo and will presumably serve as a shortcut to the Fuchsia version of the Google app. While this hasn’t been explicitly stated, Fuchsia OS will likely follow the same naming conventions that Android already does, i.e. the next major build of the operating system will likely be named after an animal that starts with the letter “B.” You can download the Armadillo build of Fuchsia OS by following the link below, though note that the app was compiled from Google’s GitHub code by a third-party developer, so you’re installing and running it at your own risk.

Shares fell 0.87% to US$152.63 in early US trading after closing 2.72% higher to US$153.01 on Monday when the iPhone maker cemented its position as the world’s most valuable publicly traded company. Apple became the first company to see its market capitalisation pass US$800bn after Drexel Hamilton raised its target price to US$202 a share from US$185, giving the company an estimated US$1trn valuation. Its share price was also lifted by news that Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc disclosed in its quarterly filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission on Monday that it raised its stake to US$19.2bn at 31 March from US$7.1bn at 31 December. Apple's market capitalisation exceeds that of its biggest competitors, including Google’s parent company, Alphabet, which comes in second place with a valuation of US$653bn as of Monday. Microsoft has a market capitalisation of US$532bn while Amazon.com is valued at US$451bn. Yet, Drexel Hamilton analyst, Brian White, thinks Apple is the most “underappreciated stocks in the world" with a “very, very depressed valuation” at 11 times excluding cash. However, he expects that to change as investors begin to recognise the company’s growth potential. In an interview with Bloomberg about the target price hike, White said there were four things to look forward to at Apple – the release of the iPhone8 in September, valuation growth, new innovations and an increase in capital returns. Apple could hike dividend or explore acquisition… White also believes Apple could hike its dividend or explore possible acquisitions once the US tech giant repatriates its profits held offshore. The company holds more than US$200bn offshore and plans to bring home much of the pile this year. The decision comes after US President Donald Trump vowed to offer US firms a one-off tax holiday if they return offshore cash to American soil. “I think if there is repatriation and 93% of their cash is overseas, which is almost US$240bn, I think you could see something else happen -  it could be a higher dividend, it could be a one-time dividend,” White said. “The dividend yield is 1.7%. Look at the mega tech companies they are well over 3%, I’d like to see that on Apple.” Sizeable debt but strong cash flows... Apple has in recent years turned to debt markets to reward shareholders. Last week the company announced it was increasing the size of its capital return programme to US$300bn by the end of March 2019 instead of the previously announced US$250bn, including US$210bn worth of share buybacks and a dividend of US$13.2bn annually. White noted that Apple had about US$84bn in long-term debt at its last earnings report, but said the company generates about £60bn-£70bn in free cash flow a year. The analyst added that the repatriation would boost cash in the US to allow for merger and acquisition opportunities. He believes an acquisition would be in the US where “a lot of the innovation is coming from, (particularly) these next generation areas". Apple vs Amazon, Google... Apple investor Warren Buffet admitted to shareholders over the weekend that he made a mistake on missing out on investing in Google and Amazon years ago when their stock price was a fraction of what it is today. Buffet, whose Berkshire Hathaway holds the second-biggest equity holding in Apple, said he realised early on the Google was turning significant profits from advertising but didn’t think it could sustain long-term success. On Amazon, he said he was “too dumb to realise” its growth potential as he underestimated  its potential dominance and the ability of  chief executive Jeff Bezos. Separately, analyst Rob Sanderson at MKM Partners has raised his stock price target on Amazon to US$1,095 from US$995 and reiterated a ‘buy’ rating, saying he considers it "the best long-term growth opportunity available to investors today”. He said the growth potential comes from Amazon’s strategy of heavy investment in its Prime video, devices and technology, fulfillment capacity and cloud services businesses. Apple also seems to have recognised the threat Amazon poses, hinting recently about developing a competitor to smart home hub Amazon Echo. In an interview with technology news site Gadgets 360 at the weekend, Apple’s senior vice president of worldwide marketing, Phil Schiller, was asked what he thinks of Amazon Echo and Google Home. He said, "my mother used to have a saying that if you don't have something nice to say, say nothing at all", adding that customers might benefit from having a screen in addition to voice assistance with their smart home hubs. “There is an over 50% chance that Apple will announce its first home AI product at WWDC in June," KGI Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a note. WWDC is Apple's annual developers’ conference. Apple could lose top position to Saudi Aramco... Saudi Aramco could take over as the world's most valuable publicly traded company when Saudi Arabia floats 5% of the energy giant in an initial public offering to take place next year. The stock market debut could value the company at US$2trn based on sizeable oil reserves and is expected to be the biggest IPO to date, raising tens of billions of dollars. Aramco has reportedly hired investment bank Moelis to work on its stock market flotation, which is seen as an important step in transforming Saudia Arabia's economy to reduce its dependence on oil revenues in coming years.    Share Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Email Print Download PDF version Renae Dyer Register here to be notified of future AAPL Company articles View full AAPL profile Apple Timeline Article May 03 2017 Apple fanatics hold off buying ahead of release of next model of the sacred cash cow Video May 03 2017 'Media hype takes bite out of Apple' - Proactive's John Harrington Article May 02 2017 Apple shares nudging higher ahead of first quarter numbers Article April 12 2017 Apple to benefit from Donald Trump's tax holiday plans Article April 11 2017 Apple accused of threats and lying to regulators in legal dispute with US chipmaker Qualcomm Article April 06 2017 Apple sued by Australian regulators for allegedly refusing to repair devices serviced elsewhere Article March 30 2017 Apple vs. Samsung - will the iPhone8 trump the Galaxy S8?

Join For Free Download the Guide to Open Source Database Selection: MySQL vs. MariaDB and see how the side-by-side comparison of must-have features will ease the journey. Brought to you in partnership with MariaDB. At this point, everyone has heard of Google’s Cloud Spanner. It’s Google’s first database offering that can scale out write transactions linearly, as well as provide cross-node transactions with ACID guarantees, claiming to solve significant problems that Amazon’s Aurora cannot. But as discussed before, Spanner is able to accomplish that scale by accepting some trade-offs, such as increasing latency with each node (“participant”). And, of course, the elephant in the room: Google Spanner is not MySQL compliant, nor even ANSI SQL compliant. It turns out those aren’t the only compromises Google has made with Cloud Spanner. Let’s walk through a complete list, and then highlight what each means to your workload (and business rules). After spending the better part of a week at Percona Live 2017, I answered the following questions enough times that it’s probably a good idea to write it all down. Spanner isn’t MySQL compliant, nor even ANSI SQL compliant, and doesn’t plan to be. We discussed this before, but it’s still worth noting. The biggest interest and use case for Google Spanner’s target customers is migrating workloads from MySQL. But at the Google Next Deep Dive I attended, there was quite a bit of discontent in the crowd at the lack of MySQL support, both currently and in the Spanner roadmap. Migrating a workload from MySQL requires a lot of effort, both in design and coding, in order to ensure a performant implementation. And as detailed below, making mistakes in schema design can lead to system downtimes, due to the lack of online schema changes for PK and interleave object mutation. Cloud Spanner doesn’t provide full RDBMS functionalities, such as referential integrity, except as specified at ‘design time.’ When designing your data model, Spanner requires that parent/child relationships be defined at the table level. The documentation does say elsewhere that this is optional: You can optionally define parent-child relationships between tables if you want Cloud Spanner to physically co-locate their rows for efficient retrieval —  Cloud Spanner Schema and Data Model However, if you do not define child tables as “interleaved,” then no referential integrity (cascade updates and deletes) will be automatically performed. If you later realize that you’d like to change a table into a child (“interleaved”) table, you’re going to have to drop/recreate that table. And yes, you can still create roll-your-own JOINs across non-interleaved tables (at lesser performance) using indexes. But those fields aren’t true PK/FK relationships, so cardinality guarantees and cascade updates and deletes won’t be enforced, and thus offloading that usual RDBMS-native activity to your application programmers. Cloud Spanner doesn’t provide online schema changes for keys. The keys of a table can’t change; you can’t add a key column to an existing table or remove a key column from an existing table. —  Cloud Spanner Schema and Data Model This means if you want to change the PK of your table, you’re going to have to drop and replace that table. Which means you have to pause your workload, i.e. take a downtime. And why would you want to change the PK of your table? If you’ve ‘classically’ designed your table(s)’ PKs to leverage timestamps, auto-increment IDs, or use concatenated (rather than the Google-recommended hash) keys, then when business rules change, this can come up. The Spanner documentation highlights this in bold, all-caps, and red. Anti-pattern: Using a column whose value monotonically increases or decreases as the first key part. —  Cloud Spanner Schema Design Similarly, if your workload leverages ad-hoc query generation, i.e. with dynamic reports with user-choosable attributes, any table relationships that aren’t already instantiated as parent/interleaved tables, aren’t guaranteed to have correct cardinalities unless that’s been (re)built-in by your application developers. Even more likely, if your workload experiences unexpected data growth, the original PK you designated might result in lowered performance in the system. At which point Google recommends swapping the order of your concatenated PK, or using a hash-distributed key, either of which creates downtime. Many Cloud Spanner schema changes require validation, which is not controlled by MVCC. For example: If you’re adding NOT NULL to a column, Cloud Spanner will almost immediately begin rejecting writes for new requests that use NULL for the column. If the new schema change ultimately fails for data validation, there may be a period of time when  writes were blocked even if they would have been accepted by the old schema. —  Cloud Spanner Schema and Data Model (emphasis added) Cloud Spanner is bad at choosing indexes and recommends using FORCE_INDEX directives in your code. Translation: not only does your application SQL updates have to be converted from SQL to Google’s APIs, but your application programmers’ efforts will have to be bolstered by data architects who know how to both design around the limits of Spanner, including avoiding Spanner-specific anti-patterns which degrade performance. These include changing PKs to hashes, removing auto-increment, and correctly designating parent/child data relationships as “interleaved” tables and interleaving necessary indexes as well at design-time. All of this information is idiomatic to Spanner, which means your code conversion efforts will need to take that much longer before you can see the performance benefits of Spanner Data migration to Cloud Spanner is tricky. Not only are the lists of supported datatypes severely reduced from MySQL 5.7, but actually getting the data into Spanner requires carefully designed and scaled-back (read “slow”) ingest: Avoid writing rows in primary key order. …Ideally each data load worker would be writing to a different part of the key space. Partition the ordered key space into ranges, and then have each range processed by a worker batching the data into that range into approximately 1MB or 10MB chunks. — Google Spanner Schema Design Note that Quizlet found they had the least amount of errors when they limited themselves to 5MB per insert transaction and that the data ingest took a “longer than they expected.” Current Cloud Spanner doesn’t support consistent backups controlled by MVCC or replication across regions today. To be fair, both of these are on the Spanner roadmap. Cross-region replication is where both the vaunted high-speed Google back-end network custom hardware and private fiber will shine, as will as all those atomic clocks for consistency. It’s just you aren’t able to leverage those yet, so be sure to factor that in when planning an implementation. Cloud Spanner TCO is larger than users expected. And a less ‘technical’ consideration is price. Usually, as DevOps, DBAs, and data architects, we don’t usually consider the price of the implementation; we’re working with product features and technical feasibilities. However, at some point the ‘business side’ of your company has to authorize a purchase of the actual system(s); whether it’s licensing, support, or DBaaS solutions, all of them have a price, and all of them have to be ‘justified.’ Knowing how to frame your implementation recommendations into pros- or cons-based ‘business cases’ will help you greatly, either with your department head or the guys and gals in finance. That being said, Cloud Spanner costs more than you’d think. At Google Next, I talked to a few Beta customers and they were a bit taken aback by how much it costs, i.e. $10-$40k for a test at full scale for their workload, and spiking sharply for any accesses outside of Google Cloud Platform. The Quizlet presentation at Google Next was terrific;  it was implied the Quizlet team got a ‘good price’ from Google. Summary On some level, Google Cloud Spanner harkens back to the time of hierarchical databases, which required the schema to be set at design time. If you know the queries you’re going to run, and how big your data is going to be, deploying Cloud Spanner is reasonably straightforward. You’re still required to change your code and as well as be responsible for making sure it runs well on their proprietary system (i.e. you’re still locked-in). Once you’re done with that work, your workload should perform much better than on MySQL or Aurora. However, if your workload and business rules require ongoing flexibility (and who doesn’t in this fast-moving cloud-scale world), you might want to consider an RDBMS that: Is like Spanner: Linearly scales-out writes and read transactions. Maintains full ACID guarantees across all the nodes in the cluster. Provides more than Spanner: Provides full RDBMS functionalities such as referential integrity. Provides online schema changes (i.e., no dump/replacing tables to change PK/FK relationships). Automatically uses available INDEXES. Provides consistent backups controlled by MVCC today. Provides full ANSI SQL access to DML and DDL. Replicates across regions today.

By Mikah Sargent Tuesday, May 9, 2017 at 11:00 am EDT 4 Comments Mikah Sargent is Senior Editor at Mobile Nations. When he's not bothering his chihuahuas, Mikah spends entirely too much time and money on HomeKit products. You can follow him on Twitter at @mikahsargent if you're so inclined. Need help deciding between Amazon Echo and Google Home? If you're an Apple product user trying to choose your in-home voice assistant, this one's for you! You've got a home full of Apple products: an iPhone in your pocket, a Mac on your desk, an Apple Watch on your wrist, and an iPad in your backpack. Lately, however, you've noticed a hole in your life; your home … it's too quiet, too disconnected, too lonely. Suddenly it hits you: You're ready to take the next step in connected home living! What you need is an always-on, voice-controlled assistant to keep you and your home company. Although we may soon see a voice-controlled home hub from Apple, it's still only a rumor for now and that means you're left with two viable options, Google Home or Amazon Echo. So which one's right for you? Read on to find out! A brief introduction Amazon Echo and Google Home are both always-on smart speakers, devices that play media and feature intelligent assistants that respond to voice commands. The Amazon Echo is a tall, cylindrical tube with built-in 360º omni-directional speakers and seven microphones touting "far-field voice recognition" that allow the device to hear you no matter where you are in the room. Google Home is a shorter, squatter device that looks more like home decor than its taller counterpart. It packs in a hi-fi speaker and microphones with "far-field voice recognition" as well as a touch surface on the top of the device for controlling the system with your hands. The Amazon Echo features Amazon's intelligent assistant, Alexa, which gives the device access to an ever-growing list of smart home technology and other integrations. Google Home touts the Google Assistant, an intelligent assistant powered by Google's knowledge graph, AI chops, and integrations with your personal data. The Amazon Echo typically retails for $149.99 and Google Home goes for $129. We're going to take a look at several different factors that might affect your decision to buy an Amazon Echo or Google Home. For each deciding factor, I'll mark a winner based on how well the device holds up in that category. Hopefully you'll be able to walk away with a decision! Amazon Echo - See at Amazon Google Home - See at Best Buy Basic compatibility: It's a draw Because most of your interactions with Google Home and the Amazon Echo should be happening with your voice, compatibility with your iOS and macOS devices shouldn't be too important. That said, you'll need a base level of compatibility in order to set up your smart speaker and perform non-voice interactions. Both smart speakers are compatible with your Apple devices. Amazon and Google both offer third-party iOS apps for setting up and controlling the Amazon Echo and Google Home, respectively. You'll use the apps during the initial setup process to get your smart speaker connected to your home Wi-Fi network and from that point on to add integrations (music, home automation accessories, IFTTT, etc.) and control your device without needing to use your voice. Amazon Alexa - Free - Download Now Google Home - Free - Download Now There's honestly not a lot to say about the smart speakers' basic compatibility with your Apple devices. Setup can be clunky for both the Echo and Home and the speakers' apps can be difficult to navigate at times and finicky at others. If the goal is to get you using your voice to interact with the devices as much as humanly possible, Amazon and Google are doing a good job of discouraging users from using their respective apps. Music listening: Amazon Echo Let me be clear: This piece is meant to help you decide on a smart speaker based on how well it integrates with your Apple products. Given that's the case, this category has a clear winner. While both the Echo and Google Home offer music streaming integrations with Spotify, Pandora, and their own music streaming services (Google Play Music and Amazon Music Unlimited), only the Amazon Echo lets you stream your music over Bluetooth. You can use the Amazon Echo like you would any portable Bluetooth speaker: connect with a device and stream any and all audio content your heart desires! Google Home works a little more like Sonos: If you want to listen to music, you've got to use the services it offers. If you listen to music via an Apple Music subscription, you're definitely going to want to go with the Echo. Smart home: Amazon Echo Smart home integrations aren't strictly about Apple device compatibility, but they're something you should consider before deciding on a smart speaker. Why? Controlling your smart home accessories with your voice is the best reason to have an always-on, always-ready smart speaker. The Amazon Echo wins this category because Alexa's smart home compatibility list is monstrous and it continues to grow. There's also quite the overlap between HomeKit-enabled accessories and Alexa compatibility.

Both the Amazon Alexa and Google Home have IFTTT integrations that will help you do any number of things using voice commands. I can, for example, say, "Alexa, trigger find my phone," and IFTTT will call my phone. I can also, for example, say, "Ok Google, add a reminder to my iPhone" and IFTTT will add the reminder to Reminders for iOS. Google Assistant on IFTTT Amazon Alexa Overall: Amazon Echo Looking strictly through the lens of Apple device compatibility, Amazon Echo takes home the trophy for Best Smart Speaker for Your Apple Home. Thanks to Amazon's "come one, come all" philosophy for Alexa and Amazon Echo, the device is essentially universally compatible. Google Home, in contrast, works best with Android devices and has limited smart home integrations. It works fine in an Apple home (I have one), but I can't help but notice how much better it works with the Huawei Mate 9 I have sitting near it. Even after all the compatibility considerations, it's important to note one thing: These smart speakers have fancy built-in microphones for a reason and it's not for interacting with 'em via apps. As long as your smart speaker reacts to the sound of your voice and provides your desired features and interactivity, compatibility considerations matter less. Questions?

I don't see support for iDevices, iHome, Leviton, and much more. 0 20 hours ago Reply jacksmith21006 Most of my siblings and myself carry iPhones. Gave our mother a Google Home and Chromecast. She now sits in her family room and just says "hey google how me photos of timmy playing violin" or anything you can think of with her grandkids. This is NOT possible with the Echo. Me and my siblings including my brother with his Android phone simply use Google Photos. That is it. This allows my mother to then without pushing a single button to see photos of her grandkids. We also used Google Photoscan in addition to include all her old photos. Apple integration with Google Home literally required one push which is the shutter button on our iPhones and. nothing else.. BTW, a fantastic mother's day present, IMO. Must be complicated to setup? This is what is incredible is this was all the steps. My wife was already doing this in our home and demonstrated recently to her family when they came over. She simply installed Google Photos on her iPhone and that was it. Is could not be more seamless integration. You click the shutter button and not a single additional button press and she can have any photo she wants display on the TV. This is NOT possible with the Echo. We have had the Echo since it launched and now several Google Homes and, IMO, this article is not accurate. Think about how well existing Google services integrate with Apple products today and simply the Google Home connects those same services. 0 14 hours ago Reply Bounou Outside of having much better microphones I don't know how anyone could come to the conclusion that the echo is better then google home. Alexa is just plain stupid, the difference in AI between the two products are night and day, even Siri is much smarter. A google home with Alexa level microphones is a perfect product 0 18 min ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads MrMobile Modern Dad About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

Reader comments Google Photos — Everything you need to know! 9 Comments View All Comments Log In to Comment Register Sort by Date Sort by Rating kitykity I tried using the Google Photos web page app. Last time I checked, Google Photos was not searching the description you put on a photo... and there is no "tagging" feature (just words, I don't mean tagging people)... and if you wanted to use albums for "tags," the albums are not sorted by title, or even searchable (this is Google, right?), so you can't easily find an "album" to add a photo to if you have hundreds of albums. If I can't simply type a word and find a photo from years ago, I don't want to use it. I've gotten into Amazon photos, which has some of those things I just mentioned, and saves full size versions of the photos I take (I have Amazon Prime, who doesn't now), which Google doesn't do. 0 11 hours ago Reply nutmac 1. In the free unlimited tier, does Google Photos backup photos and videos at full resolution? 2. Do I need to keep Google Photos app open on iOS devices to ensure all photos are backed up? 0 10 hours ago Reply dlongman 1. In the free tier a high res photo is kept in the Google cloud but not the FULL res photo. (You need to pay for an account to do that.) 2. I believe the 'Google Photos' app needs to be open to upload the photos to their cloud. (When I open the 'Google Photos' app in begins automatically uploading photos/videos to their cloud. I'm in the app so often or take so few photos that they upload before I can adjust my eyes.) Note: Just because photos upload to the Google cloud does not mean they are off your phone. If you want to free up space on your phone there are a few more steps you need to take. 0 10 hours ago Reply returnmyjedi 1) No, full resolution photos and videos will use up your allocated storage. 2) No again, iOS will turn off background sync a short while after you exit the app. 0 10 hours ago Reply nutmac Thanks (to dlongman as well). 1. Google Photo's conversion is rather opaque as to which photos and videos will be converted and how. I suppose for most general public, it doesn't matter much. But I want to know and it's unfortunate that it's a black box. 2. Inability to always backup photos and videos maybe iOS limitation but makes it difficult for me to trust Google Photos. I guess I will stick to iCloud Photo Library. My library is just a tad over 1TB so I am paying $240/year! 0 10 hours ago Reply cmdacos That is ridiculous that you have to spend that. I'm extremely happy with Google Photos. Just works as they say. Posted via the iMore App for Android 0 0 sec ago Reply CrzyP The free option compresses the photos but does not alter the resolution unless it exceeeds 16MP. If photos exceed 16MP, it will resize to 16MP. The iPhone's 12MP images will remain 12MP. The same goes for video, which is limited to 1080P max. Google Photos support is the source of this information. 0 6 hours ago Reply ssiliveri Amazon's family vault for photos is good concept, hope other companies follow this step. Google's unlimited photos backup is also good though. 0 9 hours ago Reply Mylene Savard I have loads of photos on Flickr, can I transfer directly from there to google photos? 0 6 hours ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads MrMobile Modern Dad About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner

DEVONagent gets support for StartPage, better connectivity to DEVONthink, and workflow enhancements. DEVONsphere 1.9 supports new file formats and received a revised results list. All updates are free and recommended to all users. DEVONagent 3.9.6 adds two new search plugins in all three editions: StartPage and searching for PDFs with Google. StartPage is a privacy-focused search engine that uses results from Google but prevents the filter bubble by not disclosing the user's identity. Other plugins for common search engines such as DuckDuckGo or PubMed have been improved as well. The interoperability with DEVONthink - key for a smooth research workflow - received attention in this update, too. DEVONagent Pro 3.9.6 allows to set a destination group when automatically filing found results to databases. Users can send pages as HTML-based formatted notes or Markdown files to DEVONthink. And a new plugin for DEVONagent Pro scans all bookmarks in open DEVONthink databases. Researchers can so run searches unattented, file the results in their research database, and even re-scan important websites with just a few clicks. Searching the internal archive of DEVONagent Pro returns more comprehensive results. It's easier to switch between different views, web views can be zoomed with gestures, and tabs receive a contextual menu. DEVONagent Pro and Express better handle dates, e.g. missing dates or dates in a wrong format, and refine support for Google Chrome bookmarks. DEVONsphere Express 1.9 adds support for new file formats, namely Adobe InDesign, OmniOutliner 5 (flat), Fountain, and .mp3u8 playlists. It also searches DEVONthink Personal if available. An improved results list lets the user more easily hide and show categories. Like DEVONagent, DEVONsphere Express returns more complete search results, and the See Also function supports source URLs now as well as much longer text selections. Version1.9 launches smoother than previous versions and indexes Finder/Spotlight comments much faster. DEVONagent is a smart internet search agent. It queries search engines and crawls web sites. It then filters the results again and presents the results in a multitude of ways. DEVONagent is available in three editions from Pro for serious research to Lite for the casual search from the menu bar. DEVONsphere Express is a menulet that keeps track of documents, email messages, and web pages. It discovers the hidden connection between them and presents them focused on whatever the user is currently working on. Pricing and Availability: All editions of DEVONagent as well as DEVONsphere Express require OS X Mavericks or later. They can be downloaded from DEVONtechnologies online and be test-driven for free before they need to be properly licensed. All applications are also available in the App Store; DEVONagent Pro and Express can be bought as part of attractive bundles with DEVONthink in DEVONtechnologies' online shop. DEVONsphere Express is available in bundles with DEVONagent Express and/or DEVONthink Personal, too. * DEVONagent Pro: US $49.95 (App Store: $49.99) * DEVONagent Express: US $4.95 (App Store: $4.99) * DEVONagent Lite: free * DEVONsphere Express: US $ 9.95 (App Store: $9.99) More information Customers find more information about our apps on the DEVONtechnologies website.

The European Commission said on Wednesday in a mid-term review of its digital strategy it would prepare an initiative by the end of the year to address unfair contractual clauses and trading practices in relations between platforms and businesses, prompting strong criticism from the tech industry. This follows on from EU proposals to remove barriers in online services to improve European companies' chances of competing against U.S. tech giants like Google, Apple and Facebook. European companies such as Spotify, Rocket Internet and Deezer have complained that online platforms - such as search engines and app stores - abuse their position as gateways to customers to promote their own services or impose imbalanced terms and conditions. The Commission said that initial findings of an investigation launched last year showed platforms were delisting products or services without due notice, restricting access to data or not making search result rankings transparent enough. The Commission wants to establish fair practice criteria, measures to improve transparency and a system to help to resolve disputes. Spotify hit out at Apple last year after it rejected an updated app for the Swedish music streaming service on iPhones, saying it diminished its competitiveness on iOS. EDiMA, which represents the main online platforms like Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook, said it was "disappointed and astounded" at the announcement. "Considering online platforms 'key gatekeepers' deviates greatly from the progressive thoughts put forward by the Commission in its platform communication in 2016," EDiMA said in a statement. HATE SPEECH The Commission's mid-term review also looked at the issue of hate speech on social media. It said it would coordinate more effectively on existing initiatives - such as a code of conduct with the main social media companies - and provide guidance on dealing with illegal content to avoid overly zealous removals. An earlier draft of the Commission's mid-term review of its digital single market strategy showed it was considering legislation on how companies should take down hate speech and incitement to violence, but that idea has been scrapped. The German parliament is discussing a law to fine social media networks up to 50 million euros ($54.4 million) if they fail to remove hate speech postings quickly. To encourage social media companies to be more proactive, the Commission said it would provide guidance on a "good Samaritan" principle whereby companies would not be held liable for illegal content posted on their websites or platforms if they actively hunted it down. The EU executive will also propose a law to reduce national restrictions on where some types of commercial and health data can be stored, saying unnecessary data localization rules hamper technological innovation.

Insel. Credit: National Institute of Mental Health Wikimedia Advertisement | Report Ad Sixteen months after leaving the US National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) for Google’s health sciences division, psychiatrist Tom Insel is on the move again. The former NIMH director, who left Google on May 5, is starting his own company. Insel’s group, called Mindstrong, will try to infer a person’s mental-health status by analysing the way they use smartphones. Insel stepped down as NIMH director in December 2015 in order to start a mental-health program called Verily within Google’s Life Sciences group. One of the division’s goals overlaps with that of Mindstrong's: Verily intends to build tools, which could include smartphone apps or computer programs, that can recognize characteristics of mental illness using a method known as “digital phenotyping”. The method analyses factors such as a user’s word choice in communication, voice patterns when talking to digital assistants, their physical movements and location data to determine their state of mind. If a smartphone could recognize when its owner was feeling suicidal, for instance, it could potentially intervene by providing resources or alerting others. Insel says that Mindstrong takes a similar approach to gathering mental-health data. The company’s cofounders include Richard Klausner, a former director of the US National Cancer Institute, and Paul Dagum, who holds patents on at least three digital phenotyping methods. They assess cognitive function — which could be impaired in disorders like Alzheimer's disease — from features such as misspellings and the length of time between keystrokes, according to the Mindstrong website. A different direction Insel says that a handful of companies, including Verily, are pursuing digital phenotyping. “I love the idea of rethinking how we measure human behaviour and coming up with entirely new behavioural features” of diseases including schizophrenia and depression, he says. New approaches to mental illness are especially important since “we’re not doing very well either on the diagnostic or therapeutic side”, Insel says. Verily has not yet launched any mental-health products, but Insel says that it has developed the initial parts of the program. “I felt like Verily was at a point where it was big enough and successful enough I could walk away,” he says. “I knew in moving to Verily it would be a transitional job until I could figure out what I really wanted to do, and I've had an entrepreneurial itch.” Insel denies that his departure was due to any conflict with the company, which has lost several high profile scientists in recent months, and says Verily is interested in collaborating with him in the future. In an May 8 blogpost announcing Insel’s departure, Verily said that its mental-health efforts will continue in his absence. The company declined to comment on whether it plans to work with Mindstrong or whether his position will be replaced. Insel says that Verily’s mental-health effort will now be run by Danielle Schlosser, a clinical psychologist who joined Google in August 2016. Schlosser, formerly at the University of California, San Francisco, developed smartphone apps that tried to increase motivation in people who lack it because of conditions including schizophrenia and depression.

That was the message of DeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman this week — the highly educated entrepreneur who sold his artificial intelligence (AI) startup to Google for £400 million in 2014. "We believe today that in some sense, capitalism in many ways has delivered so much for us over the last couple of centuries," said Suleyman at a Google ZeitgeistMinds event in London on Tuesday. "We've delivered so much progress. No other construct or idea has been able to distribute benefits so broadly and so rapidly. "And yet in many areas, capitalism is currently failing us," he said. "We actually need a new kind of set of incentives to tackle some of most pressing and urgent social problems and we need a new kind of tool, a new kind of intelligence, that is distributed, that is scaled, that is accessible, to try and make sense of some of the complexity that is overwhelming us." Drought in Syria.Khaled al-Hariri/Reuters Humans need help from the machines Addressing the audience of global thinkers and leaders, Suleyman went on to say that humans are struggling to grapple with the complexity of the systems that we have created, adding that our current financial systems "need to serve the interests of the many and not just the few". Suleyman, the son of a Syrian-born taxi-driver father and English nurse, supported his argument by making a number of points. "800 million people don’t have access to clean water today and that's going to more than double over the next decade," said Suleyman. A lack of food is another big issue. Suleyman said 800 million people are malnourished "yet almost a third of the food that we produce goes to waste each year." He added: "It would take 3.1 planets worth of resources if all of us across the world were to consume at the rate we do in the UK. How is that sustainable? What does that say about the mechanisms and the incentives that we’ve created and evolved over the last thousands of years of our species?" The issues of clean water and food availability are only going to intensify as a result of global warming, Suleyman said, adding that the concentration of greenhouse gases in our atmosphere is higher than ever. "We have ticking time bombs that our current systems are struggling to address," he said. On wealth equality, Suleyman (who is a multimillionaire himself) said that he'd like to see capital spread more evenly around the world. "The incomes of the top 1%, most of us [at the Google event], have risen 300% over the last 30 years, while the bottom 2/3 have seen their incomes stagnate or fall. How can we change that to ensure benefits are distributed as widely and as fairly as possible?" Inside a Google data centre.Google Using AI to make the world better Suleyman believes that AI, and more specifically the AI being created by DeepMind, can play a crucial role in making the world a better place for everyone. The company's most famous algorithm to date is AlphaGo — an AI agent that taught itself how to play, and master, the Chinese board game Go. But DeepMind is now looking to apply similar algorithms to real world problems. Last July, Google announced that it has been using a DeepMind-built AI system to control certain parts of its power-hungry data centres over the last few months as it looks to make its vast server farms more environmentally friendly. This week, Suleyman said the DeepMind technology has now been deployed in all of Google's data centres, as he said it would be. DeepMind is now in talks with the National Grid in the UK about a potential partnership that could help the entire nation to reduce its carbon footprint. Elsewhere, DeepMind's AI is also being used to help medical experts in the NHS to diagnose patients and treat them accordingly. The company has developed an app called "Streams" which is able to detect AKI (acute kidney injury) and other conditions. It is also using its software to help clinicians spot head and neck cancer, and early signs of eye conditions that human eye care experts might miss. The company's work with the NHS gives DeepMind access to large amounts of patient data and the collaboration has been criticised for not being transparent enough, with the first deal (made with the Royal Free NHS Trust in North London) coming under the most criticism.

Unlike Android, Fuchsia isn’t built on Linux, but rather on Google’s own Magenta kernel, and utilizes their in-house Flutter SDK as well. All of this means that Fuchsia is an entirely different platform than Android, which raises the question — what is Google planning on doing with it? It could be anything from an eventual replacement for Android, to just a testing platform for Flutter apps; it’s really anyone’s guess at this point. Still, we wanted to take a first-hand look and see what this mystery OS is all about. Since the build we’re running is just an early preview, there are still a lot of missing features, broken links, and placeholders, but enough of the core functions work to get an early feel for Fuchsia’s Armadillo UI. The home screen is a vertically scrolling list of running apps, similar to the Recent Apps view on Android. At the bottom is a personal card with basic info like the time, date, and some settings toggles. The most interesting part of Fuchsia is its multitasking capabilities. By now we’re all used to running split screen apps on Android 7.0 Nougat, but Fuchsia takes it a step further with the ability to run more than two apps at a time. By dragging apps from the home screen into each other, you can run four apps at the same time, either in a tabbed view or divided up across the screen. This is definitely a unique approach to multitasking on a mobile platform, and though it could quickly feel cluttered it’s certainly a more capable method than the current options. Check it out in our video below, and feel free to subscribe on YouTube for more: Are you interested in Fuchsia OS and Armadillo UI? Could its multitasking potentially pull you away from your current platform, or are you content with just one or two apps open at a time?

Opinion: Even if you can, you probably shouldn't buy a Google Pixel anymore David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/05/01 2:09pm PDTMay 1, 2017 107 Plus 1 on G+ 378 Share on Facebook 105 Share on Twitter Total Shares590 Editorials Pixel Pixel XL The Google Pixel is a notoriously hard phone to get a hold of. Persistent stock issues have plagued Google's first "in-house" handset from day one, and things really are little to no better six months after the launch event. Honestly, it's a bit embarrassing just how consistently incompetent Google seems to be at keeping a reasonable inventory of phones available for purchase. But setting that aside, as one of the Pixel's most ardent evangelists, I think there's something it's probably time for me to come clean on: Even if you could buy a Pixel today, I really think you shouldn't. The Pixel is a product with generation-one product issues. The Bluetooth performance is horrid. It's not waterproof. The bezels really are due for a shrink. I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a particularly high quality. The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. The Snapdragon 821 is officially old news. And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four of the big US carriers. There are other flaws I could point to, and while none of them are too terrible, they do speak to the slightly-rushed development cycle this phone seems to have been subjected to. Sure, Google got some things astoundingly right: the performance, the camera, the larger software experience. In fact, I think the Pixel is easily the best Android smartphone ever for these strengths, at least if we're talking about me personally as a user (your mileage, obviously, may vary). But for all the great, smooth, fast, clean, pure, simple, natural, and various other adjective-members singing in the Pixel-praise cavalcade, this phone is not the one to buy right now. For starters, Google continues to ask what is an increasingly laughable amount of money for the model most of us want - the 128GB XL - at a staggering $870. Sure, Apple charges the same for an iPhone 7 Plus 128GB, but I'm under no illusion that this comparison in any way favors Google. The iPhone comes with Apple customer service (with actual stores), a longer software support period going forward, and runs no real risk of poor resale value. The Pixel? Google's online support is iffy at best, we know the phone will be unsupported by October 2018, and I have a strong feeling generation-one Pixel resale values will drop like a rock once the new phones are announced. And that really is why, if you haven't pulled the trigger on a Pixel yet, you should just wait. It's overpriced, under-supported, and competing phones like the Galaxy S8 offer a whole lot more technology for your money. The Galaxy S8+ is $20 less than a 128GB Pixel XL, and I would argue it is far and away the better smartphone value. That amazing display, brand-new Snapdragon 835 processor, jaw-dropping design and packaging, and the full support of all our American carriers' latest LTE advancements could each be a reason on its own to put the Galaxy S8 above Google's smartphone. Do I still prefer using the Pixel over the S8? Sure. But I wouldn't buy a 128GB Pixel XL over a Galaxy S8+ today. That would be, frankly, a bit silly. If Google was asking $670 and not $870, the discussion would probably change, but they aren't. You've got to pay full price, and there's no way I could recommend anyone do that. If you're still on the fence about the Pixel, let me try to push you over: wait for the next generation. I realize that this sort of thinking can devolve into a rationale that encourages you to never upgrade anything because something newer, faster, and better is constantly on the horizon. But in this case, I think it's a consideration that is worth weighing more seriously than usual. Many of the Pixel's biggest flaws relate to Google's inexperience producing a smartphone. Issues that only come up as you try to mass-produce and distribute a product with a real marketing campaign that creates real demand, and the phone gets into the hands of "real" users who aren't part of the now-derailed Nexus phone hypetrain. Inside Google, expectations were no doubt managed, realities realized, and priorities accordingly re-calibrated after this first launch. (Side note: if the Bluetooth performance on the next Pixel is as bad as the first one, I may scream, Google.) Meanwhile, the things that make the Pixel great aren't going anywhere. The next Pixel will be fast, it will take great photos, and it will offer a wonderfully unfettered Android experience. Those that make it less than great? Google is no doubt drilling down through the worst of them in order to ensure the Pixel 2 - or whatever it's called - won't make the same mistakes that the original did (waterproofing, please). And one of the primary reasons to try the Pixel in the first place - to be on the very bleeding edge - really only remains true from a software standpoint. Older phones like the Nexus 5X and 6P don't even let the Pixel have an advantage there, as they're on the same update track until around the time the next Pixel phones launch. If you absolutely need a smartphone soon and the Pixel is tempting you, ask yourself this: Can you deal with a Moto G5 Plus for six months if it means having a better Pixel down the road? While as a reviewer I have the admitted luxury of not needing to consider such things, were I in such a position, I'd have little in the way of a counterargument to offer. Sure, you'll take a resale hit on anything you buy now, but the Pixel is going to face a much, much steeper devaluation curve in that time than any budget phone. Buying a Pixel right now just doesn't make sense. I love my Pixel XL, but I'm officially done recommending the phone to friends and relatives. Instead, I'll tell them to wait, or to get the Galaxy S8 they were probably going to buy anyway. Tags editorial google pixel google pixel xl opinion pixel xl subscribe ...

What's wrong with it? I haven't really noticed issues on my 128 non XL. I still love my phone but I understand if someone was switching now, they should just wait for the new one. I probably will. Patruns The XL is too large for me. No wireless charging is a game stopper for me. $650+ is just too much to pay as I buy my phones outright for my wife and myself. We are still happily using our Nexus 5 phones until something of roughly the same dimensions with QI charging comes out that won't break the bank. Also, I want pure Android. Not interested in Touchwiz or any other skins. Rod So, I found another proud N5 owner! I'm in my third battery, nothing to complain about. YuCMi I skipped this generation, was too salty about Google's treatment of Nexus devices. If they make their next phone reasonably priced, then I'll consider it. Otherwise, Google can fuck off with their "premium" pricing. CW The OnePlus 3T is a great phone at a great price! Laura J. Sellers Hughes I bought my Google Pixel XL for the camera. I have not been disappointed! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c44fd1bc546c27c02f945b075e0388e076c62e0fd612b3c74442129a05446139.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c4618b9d22a1d44186f347c184038b3a833f38a1148cc4b91b95981303fa8b6b.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/465d23a781688e73e20a0737904c3880ee693ee06b5dd1779ae91d9799b0488b.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/1f3d76182fdd59b34eda695d20943d03e71240b775f63106ef41809601a7cabf.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/66175dfb8d6503940dc945b8d865f4f8276c84f7f3abd0e0e46dc31136501275.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f7fa8ed860bc28a3a3e377a7e74591e764bdec5795747c4a1afb93eaa44aa0b2.jpg Rod You shouldn't. It's the best camera in a smartphone currently. Even the S8 was left behind in image quality. Aj Wayans Nothing wrong with my Pixel, best phone I've ever had. Only has scratches because I've dropped it a few times Rod Impossible. Pixel is horrid, every single owner has an urge to throw it onto the nearest wall. WNDRKND I hear ya, but I got pixel for Christmas. And back then, there was no new Samsung phone. Personally, the optimization alone makes the phone worth it... Like, I've literally had no problems. Even the speaker issue, Bluetooth, whatever. My handset works perfect, even for a first generation device. Either way, I'll be waiting for pixel three and skipping pixel 2 this Christmas. Rod I think you're 4 months late. Lol WNDRKND Haha perhaps, but with nobody able to get one... I still feel 9 months early lmao! Rod First rule of the Pixel club: no one talks about the club Hussain Ahmadi Pixel is an indie phone, like indie films with limited screens and very much less public appeal, no matter how good it is it will always be just a side phone. The only true big sharks in the market are Samsung and Apple. Google is not able to compete with them erikz The main reason I wanted the Pixel was to get on Google Fi. ackthbbft I think there are still good reasons to go with the Pixel, even if it means waiting for gen 2. I went with the Pixel because I wanted to get on Project Fi and "pure" Android. As a former Samsung Galaxy S5 user (S2 before that), I got tired of both carrier-installed and OEM bloatware, plus I've been saving money on my plan. Tj Hariharan Frankly I'm considering an LG-G6... comes with assistant, near stock android from what I've been told and my little experience with in-store demo's...AND iirc: an SD Card. Rod Then, when Google drops Android 8, you'll infuriated asking LG where your OTA is. gparmar76 Google will charge the same price with Pixel 2. They have a proven track record with the Nexus phones... roseglace >The Bluetooth performance is horrid. so? bluetooth is not everything to everyone. in particular, i've used it on my pixel exactly once. a non-issue. > It's not waterproof. i'll remember not to take my phone into the shower. another non-issue. > The bezels really are due for a shrink. the bezels i can't see with the phone in its case? > I don't think the exterior coating on the black and blue variants is of a >particularly high quality. the coating i can't see with the phone in its case? > The glass window gets scuffed up incredibly easily. there's that case in the way again. darn. > And it doesn't support proper advanced network features across all four >of the big US carriers. such as? maybe i'd worry if i lived in the united states but i bought the phone for phone calls, SMS and wifi. are those 'advanced'? they work in canada. > the model most of us want - the 128GB XL is there a shred of evidence that 'most' of 'us' want it? if it was the exact same price as the 16GB version i'd want it. if it was even twenty bucks more? umm, probably not. i know it's labelled 'opinion' and everything, but could you try a _little_ harder not to sound like you're whining? John Pitkethly I got a Pixel in December and have none of the problems listed in this article. Jordan Bartholme Great article, thank you! thereasoner If fast updates and performance are your thing than it's never a bad time to buy a Pixel but if one must wait then I guess the Pixel 2 is not that far off. Don't care about stock Android performance and updates? Then there are more choices coming still besides Samsung. I personally am looking forward to the HTC U 11 in a couple of weeks time. geolemon Good points. Even still, the worst point is that it's a metal (stupid) and glass (downright silly) wannabe iPhone (including all the hardware limitations we all hate Apple for) to try to pull the "Apple demographic" stereotype as a customer - people who want a jewelry phone rather than a functional, practical tool. Sadly, few alternatives exist today, if you want high end specs. How far we've fallen in just a few years. Hopefully it's something to just ride out - high end phones that fit in front trouser pockets and have swappable batteries, sd cards, and the durability of polycarbonate replacing the impact vulnerability of metal will reappear. But certainly - the Pixel is one of the more vulgar offerings. Sad, because I was otherwise a satisfied customer on Google Fi. Mike Dealbreaker on the Pixel 2 could be whether or not Google include unlimited full resolution Photos & Video BackUp like they have with the Pixel 1. If they don't & just throw in something like the S8's increased 100K Play Music songs limit instead, we just might hold on to our Pixel XL 128 a little longer instead. Like all hardware, it's what you do with it that really matters, but without the software to achieve it with... You just pays your money & you takes your choice. Notpoliticalyet Mate 9 is my Pixel XL. Easy to get one and top end specs. I have had all the Nexus phones and passed up the Pixel. I may look at the 2nd generation but they need to fix their supply chain. No reason to wait long with all of the good competition out there. They also created hype with limited availability. Get it right Google. Kimwo Good read! I've HATED my Pixel from day one! I tried to fall in love with it but I haven't! My husband made me do an upgrade and of course it was when this dumb a*$ ph came out! I sent my Samsung GalaxyS5 in as was required for rebate to get the Pixel. The camera sucks butt, I don't know what all the hype was about! I thought I'd like the fact it has unlimited storage but how is that useful if you can't get a good quality photo!!!! I think Androids are way better, and easy to use. That's all I've had sense the iPhone 4! Wouldn't go back to an iPhone but would take it over a Pixel any day!!😝 Christopher Hopkins First off who ever made this post is just a glorified iPhone fan and downing the Google pixel I've had mine since launch and so have the 3 others on my account and all of us can say nothing has gone wrong with my pixel not once so get off your high horse and the back glass part of my phone is not scratched still and this is the same phone since launch same with my GF her brother and my best friend on my account Stanced Imports What a joke review I've had a Google pixel since January this phone is the best phone I've ever had, and I've had a iPhone 7😂 if you can't afford it that's not a reason to not buy it, that's a choice the consumer should make not a reflection on the phones performance 😁 I live in Canada so my Google pixel is about 1000$ and it's worth every penny Stanced Imports Also I find it's nice that the phones availability is scarce so I don't look at everyone and they all have the same phone. vitriolix "unsupported by October 2018" That's wrong, they will still get security patches until Oct 2019.

The European Commission said on Wednesday in a mid-term review of its digital strategy it would prepare an initiative by the end of the year to address unfair contractual clauses and trading practices in relations between platforms and businesses, prompting strong criticism from the tech industry. This follows on from EU proposals to remove barriers in online services to improve European companies' chances of competing against US tech giants like Google, Apple and Facebook. European companies such as Spotify, Rocket Internet and Deezer have complained that online platforms - such as search engines and app stores - abuse their position as gateways to customers to promote their own services or impose imbalanced terms and conditions. The Commission said that initial findings of an investigation launched last year showed platforms were delisting products or services without due notice, restricting access to data or not making search result rankings transparent enough. The Commission wants to establish fair practice criteria, measures to improve transparency and a system to help to resolve disputes. Spotify hit out at Apple last year after it rejected an updated app for the Swedish music streaming service on iPhones, saying it diminished its competitiveness on iOS. EDiMA, which represents the main online platforms like Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook, said it was "disappointed and astounded" at the announcement. "Considering online platforms 'key gatekeepers' deviates greatly from the progressive thoughts put forward by the Commission in its platform communication in 2016," EDiMA said in a statement. HATE SPEECH The Commission's mid-term review also looked at the issue of hate speech on social media. It said it would coordinate more effectively on existing initiatives - such as a code of conduct with the main social media companies - and provide guidance on dealing with illegal content to avoid overly zealous removals. An earlier draft of the Commission's mid-term review of its digital single market strategy showed it was considering legislation on how companies should take down hate speech and incitement to violence, but that idea has been scrapped. The German parliament is discussing a law to fine social media networks up to 50 million euros ($54.4 million) if they fail to remove hate speech postings quickly. To encourage social media companies to be more proactive, the Commission said it would provide guidance on a "good Samaritan" principle whereby companies would not be held liable for illegal content posted on their websites or platforms if they actively hunted it down. The EU executive will also propose a law to reduce national restrictions on where some types of commercial and health data can be stored, saying unnecessary data localisation rules hamper technological innovation.   Copyright Reuters, 2017  Twitter Facebook Google+ Pinterest LinkedIn Tumblr Mail Print the author Shoaib Ur Rehman Siddiqui Previous SoftBank logs second-best annual profit, talks up T-Mobile deal potential Next China's factory prices slow further as manufacturing, commodities cool Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Rocket Fuel Launches New Anti-Malvertising Platform Leveraging the Power of AI and Google Cloud Vision API REDWOOD CITY, Calif.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–Rocket Fuel (NASDAQ:FUEL), a predictive marketing platform, today announced a new solution to fight malvertising in the advertising ecosystem through a robust, multi-layered detection and prevention system. Rocket Fuel uses Google Cloud Vision API to detect and reject certain ad types that are prohibited, thus protecting consumers in an effort to ensure client campaigns are free of malicious ads. Rocket Fuel’s system applies artificial intelligence, big data, blacklists and multiple anti-malware tactics to heavily scrutinize ads. By leveraging Google Cloud Vision API, Rocket Fuel can further identify and prevent for advertisers a substantial number of ads that fail to render or click-through correctly, as well as protect consumers against malicious intent. This ultimately results in significant savings for brands and agencies, allowing them to provide a better consumer experience. “Malvertising and those who perpetuate it have been a huge problem for the digital advertising industry for years,” said Randy Wootton, CEO of Rocket Fuel. “Rocket Fuel is committed to the fight against malicious ads and by continuing to leverage outside technologies like Google Cloud Vision API, we can take even greater strides in protecting brands, agencies and consumers.” Additional anti-malvertising capabilities on the Rocket Fuel platform include: Text Inspection: Activation of Google Translate to automatically translate copy in ads in 104 foreign languages to detect prohibited products and “click-bait” ads. Assisted Automation: If ads are free of malware, screening happens in milliseconds. When an ad is flagged as suspicious, it gets held for human review. Ads that require human review are then typically turned around in a matter of hours. DoubleClick Ad Exchange (AdX) maintains the highest standards for ad quality and requires that their partners submit clean ads to run on DoubleClick Ad Exchange inventory. Rocket Fuel initially built its platform to comply with DoubleClick Ad Exchange’s strict requirements. After seeing its success, the platform was rolled out to all of Rocket Fuel’s inventory partners, now representing more than half a billion impressions per day.

By Hadlee Simons on 10 May, 2017 Amazon’s Echo is a rather cool idea, beating Google Home to the smart speaker mark. The idea for these boxes is simple, as you merely speak to them (via Alexa or Google Assistant respectively) to get your information, play music and more. Now, Amazon has revealed another interesting device in the range, called the Echo Show, featuring a 7-inch touchscreen and Intel Atom X5 chip. The online retail behemoth is still marketing the device for its voice commands, but adds that video content can now be consumed too. “Echo Show brings you everything you love about Alexa, and now she can show you things. Watch video flash briefings and YouTube, see music lyrics, security cameras, photos, weather forecasts, to-do and shopping lists, and more. All hands-free — just ask,” the company says on its website. The Amazon Echo Show looks like it was ripped straight out of the back of an airline seat The company is also touting the ability to video chat with people who have the Alexa app or an Echo Show, via the 5MP camera. Because we don’t have enough communication platforms out there. Where things do get interesting though, is in the Echo Show’s ability to show camera footage — at least with supported baby/security cameras. Otherwise, voice commands for your IoT gadgets are in full effect too, so expect the ability to change the temperature and more. The Amazon Echo Show has a US$230 price tag. We’ve enquired about a local release but haven’t heard a response as of publication. In any event, Amazon’s Alexa virtual assistant doesn’t look like it will be coming to South Africa any time soon, if at all, so we’re doubtful.

The bug, which was first spotted by researchers at Check Point, is caused by a development oversight in Android permissions, which in the past required users to manually grant downloaded applications the ability to display content on top of other app panes. However following complaints from users who found it difficult to manually whitelist each app, the Android 6.0.1 'Marshmallow' update made this process automatic, which was good news for legitimate apps like WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger. It appears that fix has meant apps hiding malicious codes are able to bypass security also being automatically granted the same access, specifically the 'SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW' permission. According to Google's own statistics, the vulnerability will be active on close to 40% of all Android devices.  "As a temporary solution, Google applied a patch in Android version 6.0.1 that allows the Play Store app to grant run-time permissions, which are later used to grant SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW permission to apps installed from the app store," the Check Point research team explained in a blog post. "This means that a malicious app downloaded directly from the app store will be automatically granted this dangerous permission." This permission is particularly dangerous as it allows an app to display over any other app, without notifying the user. This means apps are able to display fraudulent adverts or links to content hosting malicious code, which are heavily used in banking Trojans. "It can also be used by ransomware to create a persistent on-top screen that will prevent non-technical users from accessing their devices," explained the team. This particular permissions exploit is used by 74% of all ransomware, 57% of adware and 14% of banker malware, according to the report, clearly demonstrating that this is a widespread tactic in the wild. What's worrying is that Google has stated that a fix will be available in time for the release of Android O, which isn't expected until late summer. In the meantime, Check Point has urged users to beware of dodgy-looking apps and to check the comments left by other users. Although the Play Store is able to police the apps being uploaded to its platform, malicious content is repeatedly bypassing security checks. Check Point recently disclosed the discovery of a new malware strain hidden inside game guides hosted on the Play Store, thought to have infected close to two million Android devices over the past seven months. Paul Ducklin, senior technologist at security software firm Sophos, believes companies are in a "Catch 22" situation over Google Play: "If you block Google Play, you'll probably end up turning on Android's 'Allow installation apps from unknown sources' instead. And 'unknown sources' opens you up to a massive menagerie of mobile markets." "Companies should consider some sort of central mobile device management software that helps IT to prevent egregious mistakes, such as quietly blocking apps that no one has heard of yet, because they represent an as-yet unknown risk, while still allowing fun and freedom among better-trusted parts of the ecosystem."

Scroll down for video  Almost half of Android smartphone users are at risk of having their screen 'hijacked' thanks to a major security flaw in the software, security researchers have found. The bug allows hackers to steal photos, passwords and bank details, leaving millions at risk of blackmail (stock image) 'SCREEN HIJACK' FLAW The vulnerability can be accessed through the Android system that allows apps to pop-up on your screen. This is the same system that the Facebook messenger app uses to show a bubble pop-up when a friend wants to chat. But criminals, through malicious apps, could use it to take control of victims' screen and install harmful software. Android users have been advised to avoid downloading untrustworthy apps until the bug is fixed later this year. The bug is understood to affect 45 per cent of Android users worldwide. Google has said it does not plan to fix the issue until summer when its newest operating system is released. Security experts Check Point found the flaw on Tuesday.  'Based on Google’s policy which grants extensive permissions to apps installed directly from Google Play, this flaw exposes Android users to several types of attacks, including ransomware, banking malware and adware,' the team said in a blog post on the vulnerability. 'Check Point reported this flaw to Google, which responded that this issue is already being dealt with in the upcoming version of Android, currently dubbed “Android O”.'

MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe. It features 24 hours of battery life and claims to be a 'mini-disco on the move'. But does it live up to the claim? Samsung's Galaxy S8: A hefty price tag and a dumb personal assistant Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning, but its $100 price hike is hard to swallow. Overall the S8 is for those who want elegance - and are willing to pay for it. Affordable, robust and surprisingly responsive: Samsung's Galaxy A5 With the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 having been pushed back, South Korea-based Samsung has plugged the gap with the Samsung Galaxy A5, a high-end device with a mid-range price tag. Is it really worth paying £280 for Nintendo's Switch? MailOnline's verdict While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

That’s what makes it so fun, right? Analytics programs let you measure everything from who and where your website visitors come from to what content they are interested in. NB: This is a viewpoint from Vikram Singh, author of the Words of Vikram blog. These engagement and conversion metrics can help you understand what is really working when it comes to your website and marketing efforts. Some hotels have an in-house digital marketing team, but most outsource their online campaigns to an agency. Either way, these teams are usually tasked with producing an ROI (return on investment) report for every dollar spent on channels like Google AdWords, Facebook, etc. There is an industry-wide obsession with knowing where the last revenue-generating click came from. This metric invariably takes center stage in marketing meetings, ensuring that the conversation never moves beyond the last click and how much revenue was booked. Ignoring overall marketing channel performance might have worked for hotels in the good old days, but not today. A lot of hotels are struggling to understand why they are not seeing massive returns on their advertising dollars anymore. Even brand name traffic and clicks are in decline. So what has eroded your marketing campaign power? The villain in this story – the one preventing you from moving forward – is this thing called last click attribution. It has derailed countless hotel marketing campaigns for both large and small operators. I’d like to take some time to help you understand attribution models in the hospitality and travel business, and how they affect your marketing efforts. What is an attribution model? The good news is that most hotels and inns are spending some amount of money on digital ads. The bad news is that decision-makers have a limited understanding of how online marketing works today, and which strategies they should be crediting for the successes and failures of their campaigns. Let’s dive right into attribution – this is a set of rules that that help you determine which touchpoints along the conversion path should be getting the credit for the final sale or conversion. Sounds simple… but it’s not. What makes it tremendously complicated in our sector is the number of touchpoints involved when someone is planning a trip, and subsequently a hotel stay. A touchpoint is any point of contact that occurs between you and your customer; in our case, we are discussing online touchpoints. Here is a list of some of the touchpoints that might occur between your hotel and a potential guest who is planning a trip to Sydney over a period of weeks or months before visiting: Top-level destination research: airfare searches, Sydney travel blogs, etc. Neighborhood research: staying in Bondi Beach vs Central Business District vs iconic Sydney Harbor Hotel research: Narrowing lodging search by researching independent vs brands; top-ranking hotels for value and price on TripAdvisor; hotel websites, social media profiles, and blogs Things to do: online searches for top things to do in Sydney; lists and blogs about Sydney; seasonal events Dining: restaurants, dietary requirements and cuisine preferences, must-haves, food blogs, review websites While the above process is happening, your guest might also encounter some of these hotel-specific marketing touchpoints: Hotel display ads: placed on top travel blogs and websites Hotel location and value Google ads: “Luxury Hotels in Sydney,” “Hotels near Sydney Harbor” Hotel brand name Google ads: when they search for your hotel by name Hotel TripAdvisor Page: while they are still researching your price and value Meta/OTA rate shop: your listings, reviews, and rate profile Hotel blog post about seasonal events: useful content on your website Hotel email newsletter: perhaps they sign up to stay in touch before booking or arriving the hotel Hotel local dining guide; return visit for more useful content on your website Hotel Facebook ads: and other social media ads, while scoping out your social profiles Every single touchpoint is a crucial part of the shopper’s journey. This Expedia study showed that a typical hotel guest will visit over 38 websites before booking the room. A typical website reservation that you are seeing today is the result of 30+ touchpoints that occurred at different stages of travel planning before the final act of booking a room. All the online channels you use today are more connected than ever; they must work together to support your goal of getting a booking. If you are only looking at where the final click came from when attributing revenue, you are missing the big picture. The very last step in a long decision-making process has not single-handedly earned the booking. It doesn’t make sense to allocate your entire marketing budget based on the last click that occurred before the booking. So, let’s talk now about proper marketing channel attribution. Deciphering the attribution models in Google Google has been working on making attribution modeling more mainstream, in 2014, it released the Attribution Modeling Tool in Google AdWords. Google wants you to see how users interact with your ads, so you can run better campaigns. As of May 2016, you can integrate the attribution model of your choice with your conversion data and ad bids. Excellent tool for everyone involved! It’s especially helpful for the very few with “marketing” in their job title that actually log in and work on their marketing campaigns. Of course, if you are just waiting for agency reports to drop into your inbox, you cannot witness this beauty firsthand…but at least you can make changes to the way you measure success. Once you have decided to actively assign attribution for your paid and earned marketing efforts, you have to determine which model works best for your business. The following example illustrates how each attribution model would work for a hotel reservation with four touchpoints. Touchpoints Touchpoint 1: Google PPC Ad. Guest X finds your hotel website for the first time by clicking on one of your Google AdWords campaign ads for “luxury hotels in Sydney.” They browse the website and consume your content and photos. You capture their email address (with their permission, of course). Touchpoint 2: Facebook Ad. Two weeks later, Guest X returns to your website, this time from a Facebook Ad about “Things to do in Sydney.” Touchpoint 3: Email Marketing. Five days later, you send them an email about upcoming events in Sydney and why your hotel is in the best location to enjoy them. You get a click-through. Touchpoint 4: Direct Traffic. The next day Guest X books a room directly on your website by typing www.yourhotelname.com into the browser. Mission accomplished! Your attribution options Last click attribution. The last click before booking, in this case your website’s direct traffic source, gets 100% credit for the reservation. First click attribution. The first touchpoint, your Google AdWords campaign ad for “luxury hotels in Sydney,” gets 100% credit for the reservation. Linear attribution. Every touchpoint – Google AdWords, Facebook, Email and Direct – gets equal credit for the reservation (25% each). Time delay attribution. The touchpoints closest to the reservation dates get the majority of the credit. In this case, Email and Direct get most of the credit; Google AdWords and Facebook get less. Position-based attribution. The first and last touch points (Google AdWords and Direct) get 40% credit each, and the remaining 20% credit for the reservation is divided evenly between the middle touchpoints. Facebook and Email get 10% each. Data-driven attribution. This model gives credit for conversions based on the steps people have taken to find you and ultimately book a room with you. It uses data from your own account to determine which ads, keywords, and campaigns have the greatest impact on conversions. This is only available to accounts that have accumulated enough data over time. I love this model! Where can you see all this? Oh, it’s right there in your Google Analytics dashboard! Look under Conversion > Attribution. (I have always loved GA. Here is why I think it’s better than anything fancy out there) Why should you abandon last click attribution? Everyone would like to see the return on a marketing investment. It helps you justify why you did what you did, right? The cliché “what gets measured gets done” (used by folks who love management guru books) is very hard to implement in digital marketing. I want to be clear that measurement is not the enemy here. It’s how you draw insights from the data that makes or breaks your marketing campaigns and future revenue. Marketing budgets are already in very short supply in the hotel business. Imagine what happens when the allocation of these tiny budgets is determined solely by the last click that generated a booking. The result is apparent in hundreds of marketing reports today. It’s just not working anymore. It’s time to let go and move on. The booking journey The path to booking a hotel room today spans multiple websites and devices: online travel agents, metasearch, review sites, social media, etc. When you are dealing with 38 touchpoints, it’s not enough to look at the bottom of the funnel. Instead, ask yourself what you are doing to help your guest move through their booking journey. Do you think your typical pay per click brand name ad “Official Website: Book Direct And Save!” helps when someone is still researching your location? No, it doesn’t! Are you speaking with your guests on social media? Or is your Facebook strategy just serving up a “25% off for Spring Break” display ad? What about email? Is it all about 35% off your best rates? Is that the only conversation you are having with your guests? Focusing on the last touchpoint prevents you from helping your guests during the planning process, before they are ready to book. You are so busy moving marketing dollars to campaigns that target the last touchpoint that you never feed and fund top-of-the-funnel activities and channels. Ultimately, the volume is going to decline and you are going to end up playing the price game instead of selling value. Under-utilising your marketing arsenal and agency By giving 100% credit to the last click channel, you shift the focus of your marketing campaign to that one channel. All eyes are on the tool that is converting and showing a healthy return on investment. Hotel marketing agencies get stuck producing “ROI Reports” to justify their existence every single month. Fixation on one channel kicks off a vicious cycle in which your revenue numbers start to decline, you fire the agency, hire a new one, repeat. This is particularly harmful if your digital assets are not in your control and you start from the bottom every time just like Sisyphus. Your website, campaigns and data need to consistently grow over time, and not get disrupted or lost when you change vendors. Content production, photography, social media conversations, and email conversations are all part of your full marketing arsenal. Don’t go to battle with one weapon when you have a wide range of tools that allow you to target every single phase and touchpoint of the booking cycle. Others prosper while you analyze I have previously written about dinosaur metrics to avoid and super metrics to embrace. With most marketers 100% focused on the last click at the bottom of the funnel, the top-of-the-funnel playing field is wide open in the travel business. Online travel agents have done a great job of focusing on the entire travel journey. Of course, they bring tons of cash to the game and dominate paid channels…but there is a ton of work on the top of the funnel that is funded by conversions. They run, manage and curate thousands of websites that have content relating to the early stages of the travel-booking journey. As a result, they build trust and solid brand names in the travel business without owning a single bed. When you leave opportunity on the table, someone will always be there to seize it. Conclusion Booking a room at a hotel, bed and breakfast, or Airbnb is a process. First comes the destination, then the location within the destination, then a price and value comparison, and finally the right user experience to complete the booking. Judging your hotel and travel marketing campaigns at the finish line incorrectly assigns all the praise and investment to one single component. In time, your super-performing touchpoint will face a decline and stop producing revenue for you on its own. New lemons are needed to make more lemonade. Stop squeezing the life out of your campaigns by focusing on the last click. NB: This is a viewpoint from Vikram Singh, author of the Words of Vikram blog.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Tech & Trend Google Street View ready is here; but can you use the platform with your mobile phone camera? Google has announced a new "Street View ready" certification standard 20 new 360-degree cameras will be released soon. Raymond Ronamai   May 10, 2017 18:34 IST Street photos uploaded on Google Street ViewGoogle Blog With an aim to let people share wonderful images of their surroundings with their family and friends, Google has announced a new "Street View ready" certification standard, integrated with 20 new 360-degree cameras, which will be available in the market in 2017. You may ask if you can avail the technology with your smartphone camera. Well, the answer is no. You just need any mobile phone with video camera feature to vlog but specific cameras are required to share your experience through Google's street view ready programme. The search giant said that 20 new 360-degree cameras that meet its certification standard will be released over the coming months. Also read: India turns down Google's Street View technology The certification standard programme covers four categories of cameras and they are: 1) Street View mobile ready: To publish photos on Street View directly from a mobile app 2) Street View auto ready: It is tailored for vehicle-based collection 3) Street View vr ready: To capture geometry for VR content 4) Street View workflow ready: Publishing tools that can upload to Street View accounts If you have a camera that meets Google's set standard, you can download the Street View app and experience the new programme. Google Street ViewGoogle Blog "You can walk, run, bike, drive -- even ride a horse -- while we do the heavy lifting of connecting each frame of your video into a traditional, interactive Street View experience," wrote Charles Armstrong, Product Manager for Google Street View, on a blog post. It may be mentioned that India has reportedly turned down Google's request to feature it in its Street View technology last year over security concerns. However, the technology has been launched in some tourist spots like Taj Mahal, Red Fort, Qutub Minar, Mysore Palace, Jantar Mantar, Chinnaswamy stadium and several others in partnership with the Archaeological Society of India (ASI) on an experimental basis. Google Street View technology was first launched in 2017 and has been extensively used in the U.S., Canada and several European countries.

Google disables location sharing in Google+ before enabling it for everyone in Google Maps Rita El Khoury Follow View All Posts 2017/03/28 1:14am PDTMar 28, 2017 241 Plus 1 on G+ 176 Share on Facebook 97 Share on Twitter Total Shares514 Applications Google News Last week, Google announced new location sharing features in Google Maps that would allow you to easily share your current position momentarily or indefinitely with select people. The option is the same that we've had in Google+ for a few years, except it would now be in the app that made most sense, Maps. It also follows Google's trend of decoupling options and features from Google+. In the official announcement, Google said the feature would be rolling out "soon" worldwide, but didn't give an exact timeline, and we have yet to see it on our devices regardless of the version of Maps we're running. However, Google has gone ahead and disabled it in Google+ for many users, making it momentarily impossible for them to share their location in either app. What these users are seeing when they head to the Locations tab in Google+ is a message telling them to move to Google Maps. If they tap the button to switch to Maps, they get redirected to a help page that offers updating Google Maps because the new feature is not yet live in their current version. And if they finally tap to update Google Maps, they're redirected to the Play Store with no update in sight for Maps.   Go to Google Maps. Update Google Maps. And there's no update for Google Maps. Huh?! It looks like a case of eager fingers pulling the plug too soon on the feature from Google+ without making sure it's already live in Maps. Or, better yet, miscommunication between the teams and lack of clear timeline planning to make sure all users have the alternative live for them before killing the previous option. Couples, parents and children, friends, and teams who relied on this feature to follow each other's progress are left without a functional location sharing. In the interim, I suggest maybe you give Trusted Contacts a try to at least have the option to request someone's location if you're worried about them. It's not the same as live sharing, but it should cover the most crucial situations while Google sorts this mess out and releases an update to Maps.

Dennis Ulijn More like "Google Attitude" UniBroW Everything that is old is new again HSidhu Old is Gold Soundjudgment ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Or in the Google Universe: "Everything New... is Old." Justin It's not the same, some people just too dumb to realize including the OP. This is real-time location sharing get it? Google Latitude and Google+ both only update our location periodically. Did you even watch the video? Jay Latitude did have real time location sharing. You could use real time location for up to a certain time limit. They put a time limit so you wouldn't drain the other person's​ battery. After the time limit, you could just keep requesting real time updates though. Justin No, Google Latitude does not have real-time location sharing, it was the same like Google+ which updates you the current location only if you open the app, it updates the location periodically. https://youtu.be/Q-Oq-9enE-k Jay Yes it did. I am 100% sure it did. I used to use it all the time. Before Latitude was folded into Google+ Latitude had real time location sharing, but was removed because it used up too much battery. There are entire forums dedicated to asking what happened to Latitude real time location sharing. Justin Nope, i was a Google Latitude user too, it was not real-time. Also it didn't even mention a single word "real-time" in Google Latitude Wikipedia page. Jay Google maps 4.6 https://techcrunch.com/2010/10/28/latitude-real-time/ As I said. It existed, it was awesome and it was removed due to poor battery life. Justin Ok, you're half right, it was in Google Maps v4.6 instead of Google Latitude and it was experimental, guess i wasn't that lucky enough to experience it. Was it only available for a short time before they removed it? Jay Google Latitude was the sharing portion of Google maps. They were never 2 separate apps. I was not half right, I was completely right. They removed it because you could track someone real time and the person being tracked would have their battery killed in a couple hours from nonstop GPS use. After a month they put a time limit and within the year they shut it down, then a few months later it got rolled into google+. Justin Ok mate, but why the real-time location sharing was stripped off when it got integrated into Google+? It's was such a powerful feature. demarcmj They were technically two separate apps. Kinda like how Google Street View is it's own app even though it is essentially an extension for the Maps app. But they were tightly integrated. makapav In fact, Latittude was a very smart implementation of Google Maps. It could show a parallel instance of the Maps app layer - with the bubbles even while you were navigating in the 'main app instance'. I doubt they were smart enough to do the same thing this time because there is not 'second' Latitude/Locations launch icon yet. shubjero I remember real time sharing with Google Latitude. Jay is spot on here. makapav Yes. You are correct. In Latitude you had the option to 'request immediate location update' for a particular bubble provided the remote phone supported it. It was added in subsequent updates. Lars Jeppesen Yep, used it too. U are right Aaron Berlin In my experience, people found the combination of "always on" location with an actual dot on a map a little invasive. Somebody would describe a problem to me, Latitude would be the obvious solution, but the response I'd get was almost always "that's pretty creepy". Maybe it's me! Justin Well, you can always opt not to share it. demarcmj I think you're making assumptions based on only very little information Google has actually provided on this. With Latitude (and G+) it always shared your most recent location. If the person on the other hand had the maps app open, then their location was updating constantly on their phone, and you saw it on your phone updating in more-or-less real time. If they didn't have the maps app open, the regular background polling rate resumed, and you only got updates whenever their phone decided to check in. Aside from the addition of the "navigation sharing" there's no reason to think this won't work exactly the same way that Latitude always did. This "real time" text is probably overblown marketing. I find it really hard to believe that if you turn on sharing, your GPS poll rate is going to be pegged to the maximum 100% of the time. Your battery would die in 2 hours. Google makes some questionable decisions, but they're not that stupid. Justin Well, Jay just explained that Google Latitude was available in real-time location sharing just for a year before Google pull the plug so I didn't get the chance to experience it, late adopter i guess. No, Google+ was not real-time even if you open the Google+ location page and you drive around, i tested this myself and it was periodically. demarcmj The sharing was always your most recent location. So if the person had maps open, their location is constantly updating and therefore the sharing was more-or-less real time. I did that all the time... opening up navigation even when I knew where I was going, just so my wife could see me moving (and vice versa). I literally did this a week ago. It works. Granted, the app itself didn't update as fast, if you were just staring at it, but if you refreshed the persons location, you'd get a fresh position every time Justin No mate, i tested it too, the GPS dot does not move in real-time in the Google+ location page, unlike the Google Maps GPS dot always moves in real-time with or without turn-by-turn navigation turned on. But once you restart Google+ the location only will be updated. I agree with you on "more or less" the same as real-time but definitely not 100% real-time in every single second. demarcmj Well I used it all the time. Like I said, you did have to refresh the location manually when you wanted to check (although you shouldn't have needed to restart the G+ app entirely). Justin Yes not necessary need to restart the app, just hit the refresh button will do. But did you notice that when you're hitting the refresh button constantly, it doesn't update immediately, same goes to restarting the app, it has a cool down duration and i guess it has something to do with Location History because Google+ location sharing only can operate if you turned on Location History. Nathaniel Yang I have tracked my partner on G+ before and its pretty close to real time. They tell you the last known location of the person and even tell you when they were last here. In my case its usually a minute ago or less. Ryan Who cares, youre bitching about semanitcs. It was as realistic as real-time location sharing got then and it was where it should have been, built into a mapping software. It just updated in a reasonable span and you could ping for a more recent update, but you didnt need input from the share-er. If you really want to be a pedantic ass then you could argue that THIS isnt going to be real-time either, because really doing that doesnt scale. Justin Oh look a bitch who cared enough to leave a comment. Ryan Who cares was about your shitty logic in an attempt to tell yourself youre right about something you were universally wrong about. But as I scrolled down I saw all of your responses to everyone clawing at any way to be right . It was too pathetic to continue pointing out so Ill let you have at it. Now as for the topic at hand, I do care about it. Justin Google Maps location sharing is going to be real-time whether you like it or not bitch. Ryan It would be hilarious of the trademark expired on it and someone else got it from them. I was so pissed when they broke Google Latitude and moved it to + because they never took the feature over to Apple. So it broke location sharing for the family since my parents had Iphones. It should, at this point, be something they supported universally. It really helped when the parents had a breakdown while we were all in a foreign city, we could find them easily. Nicholas Well, that was the one think I was using Google + for these days. DELETED Duncankrebbers Same here! I wonder how long it will take before Google Apps users will get this feature in maps. Especially since "saved lists" still aren't available for us either. Peter Been wondering the same thing. Also, the 'places with upcoming events' doesn't work eithet yet. Duncankrebbers I'm seriously considering switching to an @gmail.com account on my phone, just to have access to features like these and Google Music Family etc. Just wished there was an easy way to do this. Peter I am slowly migrating over myself. I have my old g apps and a gmail account on my pixel. There is a 4 month free for play music promo at the mo too. Duncankrebbers Sounds like a good incentive to make the switch, thanks! Gerardo Sarabia I did that a couple years ago because support sucks for business accounts, do it, it's way better. You'll never get rid of your old account, tho, unless you purchase everything in the Google Play Store again, or transfer all your data from Drive or Google Photos, or videos on YouTube, or change your email on every single service you subscribed before... very annoying. Google should allow profiles to be linked to multiple emails. It just makes sense. James Bray I did this a year ago, and while it was a total pain in the ass for a couple of weeks, it's okay now. I then set up mail forwarding with my domain registrar to forward e-mails to my GApps address to my gmail one. Ryan Ugh, I didnt think about that. I hope they dont drag their feet to get this up and working again. There are a few things good about apps but Googles implementation of anything even remotely tied to "security" is hot garbage. And youre supposed to pay for that hot garbage! Ryan So I just got it on my apps/G Suite account, so at least in this instance we arent left behind. Paulo Apps for Business user here.

James Bray What's strange, is that there is a widget available from Google Maps for "Friends Location" and one for "Share Location" but trying to add these to the home screen gives "Get Started" page and then just dumps you into the app. Looks like the app is up to date, but the server needs a switch flipped. I'm on the Google Maps Beta app. Imre I agree - this is very likely BomberLT Same here. I wonder how many people have this server side switch already on. Total Insecurity I have it in Germany. I had to do press some magic buttons and then I instantly got the server side update 😎🤓 Amir Arsyad It is live for me https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8dc4777ce2271b8b70b8b9448e466d94a21c24df6616a1307b55aa342bd974cb.png demarcmj It's starting to show up for a few people now. I think they started the rollout at the same time they killed the feature in G+. Artem Russakovskii Which is just so blatantly idiotic. demarcmj https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/47636d452e9cdd20b07a2a23a2e039381471a7aebca8a6bf49b7bd5bbde0086d.png makapav PS. Did they screw up all existing shares from Google+ Locations like they did with Latitude > Google+? demarcmj I don't have it yet, but there is a 100% chance that that is the case. makapav You should now be able to add others that should force activate it on their IDs like most other Google rollouts. BFRC My G+ Locations is not disabled, but there are no people left that share their locations with me, strangely enough. I need to say though: if you migrate a service, which sensible company would allow for downtime in the first place? It feels weird that Maps lacks the feature. Peter Reboot your device, and G+ locations will disappear. Although the empty widget still exists. SSyar clearing G+ data does that for me Justin Just restart the app itself will do. No need to reboot device. Justin Just restart the app itself will do. Ryan They broke the location sharing before killing it with an app update. Mine was broken for a few days prior. furioustoaster Mine was working up until it disappeared today Martin Korbel Location sharing in maps is live for me... Peter What version of maps are you running and what country are you in? Martin Korbel 9.49.2, Czech Republic Peter Thanks, i live in hope it is a quick global rollout. Rita El Khoury It's only live for a small subset of users, but not everyone. Hence why it's weird that it was disabled in Google+ before reaching complete rollout in Maps. ChicagoPete It's live for me this morning in the US. I'm pretty sure it wasn't there before, at least when the original story came out last week. Ryan They actually broke it about 48 hours ago anyway. While G+ behaved normally everyone I had sharing turned on with disappeared from my location sharing lists. Total Insecurity I think this could be of interest to you and everyone else who likes this be feature: "Edit: I just tried the same on my other device.

Roy Santos I'm sure that years ago this used to be in Google Maps, before they made it less functional by moving it to the (then brand new) Google+. At least it's finally going back to where it should be, even if they are messing up the transition. John Monks FFS Google, my wife and I use this all the time. It's particularly useful for checking if the other is driving before making a distracting (and illegal if they answer) phone call. Thank you Rita for the Trusted contacts suggestion but it doesn't really fit our needs. Just have to hope they don't take forever to replace it. Darius_bd Glympse? https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.glympse.android.glympse John Monks Thanks, I've added it to my wishlist for consideration if the gmaps share doesn't show up soon (or it doesn't work well when it does). dxdydz I've been using Glympse for a couple years now. One thing I like about it is that if the other person doesn't have the Glympse app it just send them a link that opens a web app with the real-time location data. This link feature works great for people who don't have the app. Which is just about everybody. Google Maps' location integration is nice because most people have Google Maps, except the people who use Apple Maps (I'm in the US). I haven't heard anything about the new location integration in Google Maps having any sort of share function similar to Glympse, which is kind of a bummer. I could see it being beneficial. ALSO what's neat about Glympse is you can open the link on your computer too. Abhilash Bingi If they don't have a Google Account: People with this link can see your location for as long as you choose, up to 72 hours. From: https://support.google.com/plus/answer/3302509?co=GENIE.Platform%3DAndroid&oco=1 dxdydz Great news! Sorry Glympse... Total Insecurity You can also share the link to anyone in Google Maps' live location sharing ;D Lars Jeppesen Yeah same here.. this is pretty stupid, Google.. I'm jumping to Glympse for the time being.. Total Insecurity I make it shorter for you: Edit: I just tried the same on my other device. There it could get activated by signing out and in again.

I hope it works for you as well! ﻿ Virtud When they deleted Google Latitude years ago, I started using Life360 for my family. Try that if only temporary until they enable this new sharing feature in Maps. catalysto Not to sound like an ass or anything, but why don't you just trust each other not to answer while you're driving? Seems like a waste of time to have that extra step every time you want to call. Also, depending on where you are, handsfree while driving is a (totally legal) option. John Monks I do trust her not to answer the phone, but rather than call, and then assume a lack of an answer means she's driving and hope she remembers to return the missed call when she arrives, I can just wait until she gets there and call her then. Its not the only use case we have for it, just one example I gave. And yes, hands free calling is legal in some places, but it's not where I am, so that's not really relevant. John Monks So apparently impotently shaking my fist in the general direction of Mountain View worked, and the feature is now active in maps for me, good luck to those still waiting Total Insecurity Bro. To make it faster read this. It should enable the new (old) feature in an instant: "Edit: I just tried the same on my other device. There it could get activated by signing out and in again.

Cristian Sebeni-Grec I have the new Share Location working on Google Maps v9.49.2 Andy Kennedy I have this version in UK too but not live for me. Google really are messing things up for its users in many things this year and it isn't looking great for them. I'm finding it so hard to keep reccommending their products to people when they pull poop like this! SteveO Location sharing in maps is live for me as well (Germany). Rita El Khoury But it's not live for all users, hence the "for everyone" in the title. Those who don't have it yet have no option in the meantime. JG Just to clarify... When we talk of the location sharing inside G+ that's been removed... I'm assuming/hoping we're referring to a feature that I apparently didn't know existed, that would be similar to what will be available via the Maps app... And not the Facebook like ability to tag your posts with your current location.... I don't tag many of my (unfortunately infrequent) posts, but I have found it to be useful from time to time... And in checking G+ I see I still have the ability to tag my posts, so either Google brought it back or hasn't taken it from me yet, or I was right and it's some other service... Gerardo Sarabia Same feature exactly as the one Google Maps is getting. It was on maps, then they moved it to G+, and now it's making a comeback. Nathan J Maps would be the logical place for location sharing, but the third-party app Glympse has been doing such a great job at this for so long, it's only a trivial fact that Google offers a similar service, first in Google+, and soon in Google Maps. Google's Maps implementation might even make more sense than Glympse, which would be the redundant app, as opposed to Maps, but with Google's habit of dismantling services for no good reason would leave those of us who have been around the block a few times just sticking with Glympse, lacking a reason to change from it. I don't have the option to share my location in Google Maps. Apple Maps has the option to mark my location, and then share that, but I assume it doesn't follow me like Glympse does. I'm pretty sure I can do this in Google Maps as well. Just to be clear though — the forthcoming Google Maps feature will actively follow you, like Glympse does now? So for example two people can share their location with one another, and find each other, in real time, on the map, like they can now with Glympse? Because really, I think that's easily within one of the top 10 coolest things you can do with smartphones, as well as identify songs (SoundHound, Shazam, and others), tune in to TVs in bars/restaurants (Tunity), listen to your hometown's radio if you're not there (TuneIn Radio), and ride sharing/modern taxi (Uber/Lyft). Oh, and paying for stuff with your phone (Android/Apple/Samsung Pay). Gerardo Sarabia Yes, it's gonna follow you. This options was called Latitude as a feature of Google Maps, it's just making a comeback and I think this time is here to stay. You can replace Glympse now... or in a few hours when the feature goes live for everybody. Nathan J I think I remember Latitude. Blue arrow icon, actually came with Maps in Android 2.x? Or was that the navigation shortcut? Because I remember that vaguely. So the feature is a server side flip as opposed to an app update? I just checked and I see no updates. Of course, I'm on the dark side, though Opinion Rewards aside, Google doesn't tend to show preference to Android over iOS. To much dismay of Android loyalists. I'll definitely give it a shot, though. Gerardo Sarabia Your app is probably up to date, Google just needs to activate the feature from their servers, very likely that's gonna happen today. demarcmj The blue arrow was navigation. The Latitude icon looked like this... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5e4f9c487ba8715d966da912006582bdbeca4f72be72b020376ca3cc01efcc1c.jpg 4Ui812 Is it just me or did all these issues with Google start cropping up around the time as the name change to alphabet ? Rob Also think so Chcheri Do I have to add all the people I share my location with (and vice versa) all over again? Morten Ulv That's safe to assume, yes. gus70 Yes Lynxy I have maps location sharing available, am on beta if that helps. Morten Ulv Screenshots?

When did you get it? Lynxy Not completely sure, I checked when the first AP article came out a couple of days ago and it wasn't there yet, checked today if G+ already removed it and followed the link from G+ app to Maps and it worked :) Lynxy This is interesting, you can add a shortcut to quickly share with a specific person: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/12a5b1883abb166cc9afa14f2fab1376824dded2e48c760b342f7193cff8f36b.png Sebastian Is anyone able to enable this for Circles? MaximumFish Well that explains why my sharing list was empty yesterday. I just thought everyone had simultaneously decided they didn't like me - including my wife. Didn't get any message about the service moving to Maps either. James Bray Looks like you only get that message if you open Google+ and then click locations. Using a widget or something just takes you to an empty tracking list. Ryan And only after a G+ update. Mine was like his, mine had been broken prior to getting the update for G+ cdotlawrence https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/1882d22c61331730c54a3233ce104b4123ceaab2599a2a8214f4ec5c6bb04e6a.png I gots it Imre niiiiice Oxfordmark Nothing! :( demarcmj The rollout is starting. Other people across the internet are getting it too. Total Insecurity Like me (in Germany). Ron Christensen Jr. What the heck? My menu doesn't have "share location" .... Should I uninstall and install? I have an android... Rod Google always slowly rolls out new features. You'll receive it in the next couple days. Ryan Server side switch. Mine just showed up, no restart or update at all. If anything maybe just terminate the app so it has to launch, but nothing more.

You didn't blur your email at it... ;-) Bo Mathis Google starting to operate like our federal government (of Zimbabwe)😕 Fifth313ment This happened to me yesterday on both myself and my wife's phone. Thank god we have Waze (Google Owned also, arg) as we could still see if each other got to work and home safely. This is just another example of Google's arrogance as a company and as their own SJW objectives. I only use Google as nothing else works like it does and the integration is great even though they are douchesacks. They took away Google Latitude to force everyone to Google Plus and now they are going back to Google Maps but without just pushing over our already shared contacts instead of making millions of people have to go over everything step by step again. I get calls from angry Google users (almost always older) everyday as Google arbitrarily changes things like icons in Google maps or icons here or there. They simply can't stick with anything for more than a few months. And with before someone says everything they provide is FREE, that is BS. They know where I work, where I go for lunch, what stores I shop at, how long I stay there, which ways I go home, what I search for all without me having to post anything on ANY social media site ( I don't have dacebook). So everyone is paying Google one way or another even by having just a Gmail account. The sad part is that it makes our lives so much better that we really have no other choice unless we want to go back to paper, pen and a map. Fluck off Google and you're left wing SJW agenda. Fluck you for changing everything constantly. You are no better than Microsoft removing the start button douchesacks (trying to avoid censors). And the whole sad part of this rant is there is nothing I, or any of us, can do about it as there are no good replacements for them (and I domt want to hear about M$ and Bing/Live B$). /rant johnforamerica Holy shit man... How can I subscribe to your anti-SJW newsletter? jibust I already have the new location sharing on Google Maps, but I'm on the beta program. noodlynooman Did you need to do anything special to get it? I am on the beta program too and don't have location sharing yet. jibust No, just using the latest version 9.49.2 Bo Mathis Android Police is the only news source that has reported this; hats off to you guys. Google, who I have immense respect for, dropped a turd on this one. The lack of communication between division (Google+ and Google Maps) has left a GAP instead of an OVERLAP in the location sharing feature. Inexcusable. Michael Tran This happened at such a bad time. Family member was over an hour late without response and I went to check for location in Google plus just to come across this!! Needless to say I was freaking out a bit. Bad move Google! We came out on the positive side of things but a company as big as Google should be able to get the little things right. demarcmj Fixed the title for you Rita... "Google disables location sharing in Google+ before enabling it for anyone in Google Maps" Kaleb Peters Yeah the title confused me too... What I first got from it was Google disabled G+ locations and then enabled Maps locations And I thought "so what's the problem?" augustojr Also sucks that even if Google enables it for me doesn't mean it will enable it for my friends and family. Chris Sanner this is, in fact, bullshit. Jordan L Doesn't their "Trusted Contacts" app how location sharing ability. Is that out for iOS yet? demarcmj It's not the same. You can't leave it on all the time, it's not conveniently bundled in the Maps app, and it has annoying notifications any time you share and/or request location. It has it's own uses, but it's not the same. Ocepi Almost got in trouble with my wife because of this, she thought I was "hiding". Facebook messenger just added an option to share location as well, but it's limited to 60 minutes at a time. Poor form Google. Midas Gordon-Farleigh Agree. The rollouts take so long... cocolopecita Seriously, dude? Your wife HAS TO KNOW where you are at all times? Hello marial issues! Kath Stennett I use location sharing in Google + with several contacts, extremely useful when we/they are travelling so I'm very annoyed that it has been removed but is not available in Maps yet. What dreadful planning on Google's part! Also the help seems to imply that we'll all have to set our sharing up again once it is available! Is that really true? We didn't need to when this moved from Latitude to Google +, I found that all my contacts were still located. It could take ages to liaise with everyone and get it set back up again DragoCubed Google keeps messing stuff up. I'm getting really tired of this. Red Bungholes. Stacy Scott Way to screw the pooch. You suck google. Stacy Scott So for those that see location sharing is it obvious how this works? DeAno Jackson I have the feature in my Google Maps. Unfortunately no one else I know does yet, so I can't even test it. Jonathan Campbell So, I just updated Google+ and that enabled sharing in maps somehow. Maps version is still 9.49.2 but no sharing before G+ update then immediately enabled after update. This seems pretty odd. Midas Gordon-Farleigh Coincidence! I just updated G+ and no such luck. Paul Arbour On again, off again. Last night locations in G+ turned off, then it was back, now it's gone again. then this morning it was back again, now it's gone again, and it isn't in maps yet.. Thanks Google. Kent @khouryrt:disqus Just got a Google+ update. Clicking on locations on the latest app goes to the new share page for Maps. Happy sharing. Ciro Santilli Does it work on iOS? If not implies useless for me. makapav GODDAMN IT GOOGLE DID NOT MIGRATE ANYONE FROM GOOGLE+ LOCATIONS!!! 50 people on my list have to go through the ordeal again!!! This is ridiculous! L. Curtis Muldrew I have it now ... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/298c13bd4ed2cecd8419d9e079a1e0f6d158767ed776658f2e0e57f3e5bbc667.png Dan Brown Maddening Google!! Michael Tran Looks like it's working now. It was enabled on one phone for me so I forced closed maps on my primary and it started working. Seems there is an option to share indefinitely, but I'm trying to figure out if that leaves GPS on all the time or does it just update periodically. All the location sharing folks i had before in G+ got wiped out so I have to send out requests all over again. JSet12 I just force closed Maps (per your comment), and it worked for me as well! Thanks. noodlynooman I think it only updates periodically with indefinite sharing. My fiance has his location shared with me indefinitely and last I checked his location was updated 9 minutes ago. Michael Tran Thanks. This is looking to be a solid replacement so far. Another confusing part is which contact so you share with? I see notification and I see their Gmail address. I wonder what the difference is. Ian Salter I was able to initialize the feature by watching this video and then tapping on the embedded link https://youtu.be/u62nPKgLJeg augustojr I just got it. Yaffle It's enabled for me now in Maps Adam Margeson Now I can't select whether a contact can see my exact location or just city level. Question... does this drain the battery any faster than G+ locations did? ctaylor Location Sharing is live for me, running 9.49.2. has been for a few days. But it's not live for my friends. Go Google! cocolopecita First thing I do in every gmail account I set up for relatives: disable location. Why people want Google to keep tabs on them on behalf of the NSA? Beats me.

Let's hope they at least fix the iOS unpredictable delays in location updates that can be as much as 12 hours. Robert England I have lost everybody I had shared location track with, how to refind?

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Download APK and preview the new Google Fuchsia OS By Rei Padla - May 10, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Google has released a new OS although not formally and officially yet. We’ve only seen the APK which you can actually download to install the Fuchsia OS on your Android device. We can’t say it’s the final name but for now, we’ll treat Fuchsia as a codename. Some Google developers shared the files on Github and our friends over at SlashGear managed to check what’s inside the OS also known this early as the Armadillo. The APK shows a quick preview of a launcher as demonstrated by the app. Fuchsia aka Armadillo. However, the latter is referred to as the 1.0 version. Possibly, this phase will be followed by an animal that begins with the letter ‘B’ after ‘A’ (Armadillo). Inside the next-gen OS, the Material Design elements are very noticeable. There’s a center panel where you can see some basic information like date, time, device, location, and battery level. Click on the icon to bring up more options and information about the user. You can launch Story panels by pulling up/down the screen. It appears to be a different version of a Google Assistant but is reminiscent of the Google Now On Tap with the onscreen functions. We’re assuming there are more features but it’s not the full OS yet. Feel free to explore on your own by downloading the APK first and install on your Android phone–as always, AT YOUR OWN RISK.

The two combined account for around two-thirds of our traffic. Firefox, Internet Explorer and Edge follow by some distance, and barely registering a pulse is Opera, with just over half a percent. Whether or not that’s representative of the world as a whole (spoiler: it is), Opera knows it has its work cut out to stand out in a world where Google can ram Chrome down every searcher’s throats, and Apple and Microsoft can bundle their browsers straight into their respective operating systems. So, how does Opera compete? By introducing innovative ideas that its rivals will ultimately likely adopt themselves. The latest of these is built-in chat, essentially making the desktop your phone away from phone. By default, in the latest version of Opera, a tab sits on the left-hand side of your browser at all times, with web versions of Facebook Messenger, WhatsApp and Telegram built in. You can disable any that you don’t use, but it means you’re never far away from your friends – without having to either keep tabs constantly open or keep one eye on your phone. Under a blog post entitled “Opera is Reborn”, Krystian Kolondra, executive vice president of desktop at Opera, explained that the thinking behind the move was to ensure the desktop could catch up with the smartphone as a multitasking tool. “Social messengers completely changed our lives, by allowing us to work, discover new things and communicate at the same time,” he explains. “This shift has come with smartphones, but desktops and laptops, while theoretically more powerful multitasking tools have been left behind.” “Browsing and chatting simultaneously is cumbersome and inefficient now, as you need to switch between tabs when responding to a message,” he continues. Video of Why we all need a better browser for chatting with friends | BROWSER FOR COMPUTER | OPERA I’ve been using it this morning in a bid to increase the Opera population browsing Alphr and have found myself quietly impressed, although it’s not perfect. One of the nice features is being able to drag and drop a photo from the web straight into a conversation, but for that to work you need to have the messaging app of choice pinned, taking up half the screen. Likewise, if you have multiple windows, the sidebar has to be open in all or none, which isn’t ideal. Notifications could probably be a little clearer (if you have sound switched off, you’ll just get a small dot on the icon), and WhatsApp can be a little flakey about loading quickly sometimes, but overall it’s a great idea that works well. I can see this catching on. Throw in Slack and Google Hangouts, and pretty much every way I chat is on tap at all times, and my phone’s tiny imprecise keyboard is kept out of the whole equation. See related  We need to save online journalism from ad-blocking – and here's how Best VPN services of 2017: What's the best VPN you can get, and should you pay? What is Telegram? The app ISIS is using to communicate Opera has another couple of tricks up its sleeve, which I have mixed feelings about. A built-in free VPN is certainly welcome, although those serious about their privacy or security would still probably feel safer paying for one. Ad-blocking is also on hand, but that’s something I have serious issues with that I won’t get too sidetracked on here (in short: if everyone blocks ads, then the only people left to publish content will be those that can afford to make a loss – and I find that chilling). Still: that’s three things right there that Opera does to set it apart. There’s a good chance that some or all of these will be adopted by the browser’s rivals in the next few years, but for now it’s hard not to be impressed with Opera for thinking outside the box. And it will be my browser of choice until other browsers match its innovative thinking.

Here’s how you can use it to drive traffic to your site, build your authority on topics, and even get some SEO benefits. What Is Quora? Quora was co-founded in 2009 by Adam D’Angelo and Charlie Cheever, both formerly of Facebook. Initially, it was mostly being used by people familiar with the Silicon Valley scene. By December 2010, after a few news stories recognized more and more high profile people, like Facebook co-founder Dustin Moskovitz, Foursquare director of business development Tristan Walker, Pandora Radio founder Tim Westergren, and even Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, use of the site grew exponentially. Today, Quora is actually an awesome hangout. Anyone can ask a question and people answer. It is also a mega website. Quora gets around 100 million monthly visitors. Why is it cool? Let me give you a few examples. You will want to bookmark these and follow them. The Most Surreal Places to Visit This thread goes through the best places in the world to visit. It provides pictures and gives users insight. This thread is awesome because of the user-generated content. Realistic Ways To Get Rich in 5 Years We all want money. Who wouldn’t want a never ending bank account? This perfect question got answered by millionaires, CEOs, and TIME people of the year. It walks through business to affiliate marketing. What can I learn/know right now in 10 minutes that will be useful for the rest of my life? This question got more than 2,000 responses. Some of the responses were small life hacks to find out what Google knows about you. As you can tell, Quora attracts a wide audience. It also has a ton of information already contained in its enormous website. Why Should You Care About Quora? Well, that actually leads to a more specific question: is Quora good for SEO? If we’re asking that question, well, it only makes sense to ask Quora. Is Quora good for SEO? Unfortunately, like most SEO questions, it came down to opinion. Can I use Quora to help rank my website? This was still a debate over the facts. Let’s look at the facts. Quora’s Weird SEO Benefits Links from Quora are nofollow. While a nofollow link may not sound like something worth the effort, you would be wrong. Here’s why. Google & Bing Show Quora Results Some Google and Bing searches show Quora’s answers in the first search position. Quora is always growing and gaining more authority. Google grabs the info and displays the answer with a small link. Bing showcases the link and information. So if you write a great answer and it gets upvoted, you’re getting traffic to that post. If that post then has a link to your content, you are gaining exposure. Does that help SEO? Follow Google Engineers and Learn the Dirt There are former Google engineers that talk about their time at Google. There are of course the present Google engineers that have answers to questions on Quora. You can even invite them to answer your questions. Interested in the “history” of search engine marketing? Then follow this guy. Quora Isn’t Bad for SEO Figuring out that Quora doesn’t actually offer a ton of SEO value was a bummer. It seems like such a happening place. So I decided to dig deeper and look at why so many marketers are using Quora. Is There Value in Quora Other Than SEO? SEO is incredibly valuable, but also incredibly competitive. You can’t just rely on people finding your brand or business via a Google search. That’s why marketers are using Quora to build their authority and expertise on a variety of subjects. Quora gives you access to 100 million visitors per month, and you can turn some of those users into new visitors and even conversions. Your customers are also on Quora. And they may be asking questions about your products or services. Providing great answers to questions will increase your authority and popularity, which will improve your findability in search engines. In addition, you can turn insights from others in your industry, or even your own answers, into content that your target audience will be interested in. Quora Is a Great Traffic Strategy In this post, Ryan Stewart talked through how he drove more than 1,500 visitors to his site using Quora. He called it growth hacking – although his tactics weren’t entirely on the up and up. He logged into Quora, found topics around his blog, then posted comments that had links back to his site. Pretty standard, right? But then he then bought upvotes (he even announced that he had done so on his blog). Be warned: this is spam. Quora will ban any accounts doing this. If he would have interacted on Quora and gained upvotes in a natural fashion it would have been fine. Quora has long-term value. Stay consistent and keep interacting. The upvotes will happen. A Legit Case Study There are plenty of case studies out there on generating traffic from Quora. Take a minute and search for them. They will give you in-depth information on how various people achieved it. This one covers a few. Imran Esmail has achieved almost a million and a half views on his answers. He did this by posting 343 answers. That is legit! How Do You Drive Traffic From Quora? Here is a simple checklist to drive traffic from Quora: Create a stunning profile. Show that you are an authority and stand out. Find questions that have lots of views and followers. Craft your answers like a great article. Tell a cool story and show that you know the subject in depth. Find ways to go visual. Insert pictures or videos. Drop a link to another piece of content that covers the subject more in depth. Stay consistent. Summary Quora is a long-term traffic strategy. Those who are spending time answering questions on Quora are reaping the benefits. Find ways to have everyone on your team create a constant and consistent presence on Quora. There are tons of visitors to your offers to show for it. Use Quora to drive more traffic to your site and get a few SEO benefits from it as well. Image Credits Featured Image: DepositPhotos Screenshots by Will Robins. Taken April and May 2017.

The unusual bug, in Microsoft anti-malware software such as Windows Defender, could be exploited without the recipient even opening the message. Researchers working for Google’s Project Zero cyber-security outfit discovered the flaw at the weekend. The fix has been specially pushed out hours before the software giant’s weekly Tuesday security update. Hackers could exploit the flaw simply by sending an infected email, instant message or getting the user to click on a web browser link. Windows 8, 8.1, 10 and Windows Server operating systems are affected by the bug. Anti-virus software such as Windows Defender would merely have to scan the malicious content for the exploit to be triggered. On some computers, scans are set up to occur almost instantly – “real-time protection” – or to take place at a scheduled time. “Anti-virus normally tries to intercept these things before you get to them,” said cyber-security expert Graham Cluley. He added it was “tremendous” that Microsoft had released the patch so quickly. The bug was discovered by Google Project Zero researchers Tavis Ormandy and Natalie Silvanovich. And Mr Ormandy later tweeted he had been “blown away” at the speedy response. The vulnerability allows for remote code execution: “the thing all the malicious attackers are aiming for”, Mr Cluley told the BBC. “It means they can install code on to your computer without your permission – it means they can hijack your computer.” Mr Cluley did add, however, that he thought the Project Zero protocol for announcing the vulnerability had been risky, because it included information that malicious hackers might have found useful. “That can help the bad guys,” he said. Windows users can check that they are running the latest Windows Defender version (1.1.13704.0), which should download automatically, to make sure they are not at risk – or hit the update button.

Google has been slowly but steadily adding more languages to the Allo version, as well as the voice-activated version on phones. The company has quietly rolled out support for Spanish and French to Assistant in Allo, but it looks to still be in beta. Google has not updated its list of officially supported Assistant languages yet. It currently includes English, German, Hindi, Japanese, and Portuguese. However, we've gotten multiple tips that Assistant has started popping up in conversations happening in French and Spanish. Specifically, users are seeing smart replies in those languages, and they can ask the Assistant bot to use those languages. This appears to be a very recent change. When asked if is spoke French or Spanish before, Assistant would say it was still learning. Now, it offers to set those as the default language in Allo. It sounds like the new languages are a bit rougher around the edges than the "official" ones. Google's head of conversational search, Behshad Behzadi has reportedly said Spanish will be working completely later this year. French might be on the same track, but at least there's progress. Update 1: 2017/05/09 9:43am PDT Confirmed These languages are now confirmed. Google's head of product for Allo has tweeted that Spanish is rolling out. As for French, Google's Canadian blog says French is a go. End of Update Thanks: Roberto and Mikaël Tags allo assistant Google languages subscribe ...

I live in Quebec and my main language is french Canada so I would appreciate interacting with the assistant in French but do not wish to change my default language to French. I want to keep my device setup in English same as I always had my windows in English or any other tech devices.. TVs etc. And depending who I text it can be in English or French so unless it can switch easily it's useless currently. When I tried speaking french it would come up with gibersih words. It works better to just switch my keyboard language and use the mic. That way I am positive it understands what I am saying the first time whether it's French or English. roberto.elena At least in Allo, you don't have to do any changes. My phone has English US as the main system language for UI and Spanish (Spain) as secondary language for speech recognition. In Allo I can chat via text with the Assistant in English, Spanish and German and it understands all 3 without a problem. What I find weird is that the Assistant always replies using the same language, until you explicitly tell it to change to another one, so if I tell it to speak Spanish, it will always reply in Spanish even if I ask questions in English or German. EowynCarter Saying the assistant "speak french" should do that from what i tested. Keept talking english (device language is french), And it wasn't understanding anything before, expecting me to speak english. Then, it got the french sentance alright. Misanthrope Unfortunately, it still speaks English after that. I am in the same situation and don't want to put my device in French. I want to keep it in English and speak French which is impossible EowynCarter Mmm. I can tell the assistant to speak English despite my phone being in French. But I'm using the allo assistant. Girouf Yeah I remember when I was testing the assistant ...although it was using "French France" then cause french Canada was still not a "learned language, it would never switch to French on the fly if I tried dictating an SMS. As I mentioned my system was set as English default and I want it to stay that way. The best solution for me was to turn everything off and just use the mic in the keyboard, switch my language from there and I could easily create a French or English sms that way with the first try. I haven't used it since though so I don't know how it is now if any better. Marc ¡Hola! Omelette du fromage. Arthur J. Means nothing Bru [971] Seems to be out of beta as Google France's facebook page is asking us to try Assistant in French. With no mention of beta. This is how i saw it roberto.elena I think Google still considers it a beta, even when there is no mention of it. Maybe I'm wrong, but the same happened when the Assistant was launched in English in Allo, before the Pixel launch. JD Has it learned french? Or has it learned Quebecois? Qbancelli Gracias, Google! Daniel D’Oleo ¡Por fin, ya habla español! 😃 Can confirm it works in Spanish (Spain/Latin America). https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/737f7c20cd24f2fc2ad7d8dee390630046978e4c2f455b8f88277ae7afa1fcbf.png Diego S. Spanish yesss Petr Kuchyňka And few commands in Czech (like setting an alarm etc.) Gerardo Sarabia this should come to the rest of the Assistant ecosystem, instead of being limited to Allo. Leonardo Baez Thanks for the heads up. I will change my language to spanish now. 👍 cvm And here, I'm trying to learn French... Stefan There is so much to do in the field of bi-lingual and tri-lingual users.. the OS should know when I chat with a specific person what language I use and the keyboard and Assistant should adopt to contacts across the device.. I use three languages on a daily basis and it's a nightmare to say the least. EnerJi Do you use Gboard as your keyboard? Supposedly it auto-detects languages automatically, but I haven't tested it extensively and I'm not sure whether it works well. Stefan yes nexus 5x with clean android and Gboard.. it seems to work every now and then, and only integrates with native android apps. my iPad seems to work better with remembering which language was previously used in the chat.. but that's iMessage ... siri is one language only and that's a BIG reason why I switched to android because google Now understood which language I was speaking in.. google assistant is FAR behind Rod Swiftkey is your friend. VAVAMk_2 ¿Cuándo podemos esperar que Google Allo aprenda soporte SMS además de nuevos idiomas? Serge Cebrian for a second didnt notice it was spanish (my main language) hahahaha my brain is starting to switch langs for me on the fly .. nice... respondiendote: No se cuando llegue el soporte de SMS pero espero que pronto ! estaria genial VAVAMk_2 Not soon enough YuCMi Proof that Allo is still in beta... it's literally Google's testing ground. Maxime MARAIS Does this mean Pixel phones may be soon available on Google Store? As far as I can remember, these phones are only available in countries where Allô is supported in their main language(s). My good old Nexus 5 would be glad to be retired.

Google Home now works with smart home products from iDevices, NuBryte, and more Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/09 12:28pm PDTMay 9, 2017 9 Plus 1 on G+ 15 Share on Facebook 41 Share on Twitter Total Shares65 Google Google Home News The Google Home only worked with a handful of services at launch, but over the past few months, we've seen more and more services start to work with it. Starting today, select products from iDevices, NuBryte, Universal Devices, and MobiLinc will be compatible with the Google Home (and anything else with Google Assistant). iDevices sells a variety of smart home products, including light switches, wall outlets, and lights. All of iDevices' products are rather expensive, but at least you don't need a hub for them. Two of the company's products stand out as pretty cool - a rain-tight outdoor smart plug, and an adapter to make any light bulb 'smart' (but buying Hue light bulbs would probably work better in most cases). NuBryte's main product is the TouchPoint, which replaces the light switch in a room with a touchscreen display. The TouchPoint can control lighting, view camera feeds, work as an intercom, and display weather and calendar information. However, it hasn't received great reviews. Universal Devices sells INSTEON lighting controllers, like this one, primarily for business or enthusiast use. Finally, MobiLinc offers apps for controlling specific smart home systems, such as ones using Universal Devices controllers.

The European Commission said on Wednesday in a mid-term review of its digital strategy it would prepare an initiative by the end of the year to address unfair contractual clauses and trading practices in relations between platforms and businesses, prompting strong criticism from the tech industry. This follows on from EU proposals to remove barriers in online services to improve European companies' chances of competing against U.S. tech giants like Google, Apple, and Facebook. European companies such as Spotify, Rocket Internet, and Deezer have complained that online platforms—such as search engines and app stores—abuse their position as gateways to customers to promote their own services or impose imbalanced terms and conditions. The Commission said that initial findings of an investigation launched last year showed platforms were delisting products or services without due notice, restricting access to data or not making search result rankings transparent enough. The Commission wants to establish fair practice criteria, measures to improve transparency and a system to help to resolve disputes. Spotify hit out at Apple last year after it rejected an updated app for the Swedish music streaming service on iPhones, saying it diminished its competitiveness on iOS. EDiMA, which represents the main online platforms like Amazon (amzn), Apple (aapl), Google (googl), and Facebook (fb), said it was "disappointed and astounded" at the announcement. "Considering online platforms ‘key gatekeepers’ deviates greatly from the progressive thoughts put forward by the Commission in its platform communication in 2016," EDiMA said in a statement. HATE SPEECH The Commission's mid-term review also looked at the issue of hate speech on social media. It said it would coordinate more effectively on existing initiatives—such as a code of conduct with the main social media companies—and provide guidance on dealing with illegal content to avoid overly zealous removals. An earlier draft of the Commission's mid-term review of its digital single market strategy showed it was considering legislation on how companies should take down hate speech and incitement to violence, but that idea has been scrapped. The German parliament is discussing a law to fine social media networks up to 50 million euros ($54.4 million) if they fail to remove hate speech postings quickly. To encourage social media companies to be more proactive, the Commission said it would provide guidance on a "good Samaritan" principle whereby companies would not be held liable for illegal content posted on their websites or platforms if they actively hunted it down. The EU executive will also propose a law to reduce national restrictions on where some types of commercial and health data can be stored, saying unnecessary data localization rules hamper technological innovation.

Cloud music storage services can help – and there’s a lot out there. Here are some of the best cloud storage solutions for your songs: Don’t worry, they’re all free to use, too!   1. Google Play Out of the major brands, Google Play offers one of the most versatile free cloud storage for music. With Google Play you can upload up to 50,000 songs from your computer to the Play cloud servers – and that includes music from other sources including iTunes. You do this through the Music Manager app that Google offers, which can successfully save your songs, playlists, and ratings. Then you can access that music through Google Play via any Android platform or the Web itself. You can download Google Play for free here   2. iCloud iCloud on its own is a fair free cloud music storage service for moving your music around. You may not be surprised to learn that it is limited to music that you buy from the iTunes Store, but within that framework iCloud is a solid service for transferring songs between your Apple devices (it also works for the newer Windows devices). The automatic syncing functions mean that you don’t have to worry your new music showing up on your iPhone or iPad once you buy it. However, the true music storage service of Apple’s is iTunes Match, which allows you to store music in the Apple cloud from any source and also ties into ad-free iTunes Radio. Unfortunately, there’s no free options here (yet), you’ll have to pay a couple bucks a month to use it. You can learn how to set up iCloud here   3. Amazon Cloud Player Amazon Cloud Player is a somewhat less useful cloud storage option, not because of its lack of features but because the best features are available when you upgrade to Premium, which of course costs money. However, the basic service still allows you more than a couple hundred free uploads worth of free storage, and is dedicated to music with a focus on Amazon Music services. However, there are Cloud Player apps available across the major platforms with plenty of flexible curation options, so you still retain a lot of control…providing you like Amazon services in the first place, of course. You can download Amazon Cloud Player here   4. Synology Audio Station Synology’s cloud storage offering is a little…different. First, the service and its associated programs are definitely free, and they offer unlimited micromanagement of your songs in what is one of the best cloud music storage options available. The downside is that they are only available through a Synology server device, which you already need to have (or at least have access to). But if the conditions are right, you probably won’t find better customization options around after installing the various DiskStation Manager and Audio station programs. There are options to download music for iTunes, etc., but as the tutorials show Synology is typically used in a Windows environment. You can learn more about downloading Synology Audio Station here   5. StreamNation StreamNation is a relatively recent addition the media storage service world, and it has some of the best cloud storage for music around. The app offers one-click imports of music libraries like iTunes, and allows to stream to any other device you want. It can then use music to recommend new songs in the genres that you like or show you what your friends are listening to. The interface also impresses with its flowing, album covered-based design. There are several different plans to choose from, but the free version gives you 20GB of data, not too shabby at all. You can get started with the StreamNation service here   6. My Music Cloud My Music Cloud is a simpler service than many on the list, but that simplicity is part of its charm. Like StreamNation, the service offers one-click importing from iTunes, Dropbox, etc., but there’s much more of a focus on streaming services (plus some capabilities to listen offline). Like Spotify and other apps, My Music Cloud can learn your preferences by seeing what music you play and suggest similar artists or remind you of uploaded songs that you haven’t listened to in a while yet. Storage, however, is a little limited with the free version offering 250 tracks max. You can download My Music Cloud here Tweet It Like It Google + Linkedin Pin it Stumble Tyler Lacoma When he isn't enjoying the beautiful Northwest outdoors, you can find Tyler on business and tech sites, writing about the latest news, analyzing trends, and generally making the Internet a more interesting place.

I also keep on LOOP all my FLAC music files. Reply Rhiannon on I would not recommend My Music Cloud. I wanted it to play my Itunes playlists through my TV. I paid for it on Saturday – today is Tuesday and it has only downloaded 600 songs never mind my playlists. Complete waste of money, DO NOT be a sucker like me and pay the £29.99 for it Reply Kimberly on Do you have a recommendation for a service that would take my CD collection, rip it, and allow me to stream it? Murphie seems to be the only one I’ve found. Does it have competitors? Reply Yulia on Try Vox music player! Loop for Vox has unlimited cloud storage and Vox plays your music in lossless Reply Evan Glenn Potter on Excellent list- but what about MyMusi.cc?- its a great music storage site with no upload or playback limits. It’s what me and all my friends use Reply Bob Dylan on Tyler, Great list but you should should definitely include myMusi.cc among the top contenders. I have 3tb stored for free and they have great playback interfaces on my laptop and iphone. Its all browser based so its super easy, drag and drop music from itunes to browser to upload, drag and drop from Google images for album art. Highly recommended Reply Igor P. on Thanks. It seems like best choice for now. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The flaw that enables a wide variety of malware is connected to the SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW permission that provides apps with the ability to overlay content over other apps without specifically notifying the user that they’re writing on the screen. The very nature of the permission makes it a serious security risk if it’s accidentally granted to a malicious app, though the main problem lies in the fact that the permission is de facto granted to all apps that are downloaded from the Google Play Store as of Android 6.0.1. The Mountain View-based tech giant reportedly opted to facilitate the process of granting the permission due to the fact that non-malicious apps who legitimately needed it often weren’t able to function in an optimal manner as users would fail to grant them authorization in the system settings of their devices. While the Alphabet-owned company implemented certain safeguards that were designed to prevent the abuse of its mechanism, hackers reportedly still managed to find several ways to trick or completely bypass Google’s security measures and have their malware-enabling apps featured on the Google Play Store. The aforementioned permission was abused by 74 percent of Android ransomware and 57 percent of adware-infused apps on the Google Play Store, Check Point claims. Due to that state of affairs, Google will be patching the vulnerability related to the problematic permission by shipping Android O with TYPE_APPLICATION_OVERLAY, a new type of permission that will serve as an alternative to its predecessor but also prevent apps from overlaying any kind of data over “critical system windows.” While the wording of the announcement doesn’t necessarily suggest that the Alphabet-owned Internet giant will be radically changing the process of granting the SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW permission, it seems that the company is still adamant to address the vulnerability by replacing the problematic authorization with a much more restrictive one whenever possible. By doing so, the company would minimize the chances of Android users falling victim to ransomware, adware, and other types of malware even if they accidentally download and authorize a malicious app. Post navigation Nvidia Beats Estimates, Revenue Rose 48% YoY In Q1 Waymo Hits 3 Million Self-Driving Miles On Public Roads May 10, 2017 | Android News Source: Check Point Blog Show Comments Hide Comments () Latest News Sygic GPS Navigation Service Debuts Sygic Maps API For Devs Phone Comparisons: Google Pixel vs BlackBerry KEYone Xiaomi Mi 6 Durability Test Reveals Big Improvements Over Mi 5 The Sims Mobile Brings The Legacy Challenge To Android EU Legislation Could Make App Stores More Fair Pick Up An Unlocked LG G4 for $89 – 5/10/17 BLU Studio J2 Passes FCC Certification Snap’s Spectacles Are A Multi-Million Dollar Business New Advertisement From Honor Asks Which Honor Type You Are Job Simulator Developer Owlchemy Labs Joins Google Uber Adds Saved Places Feature To Their App For Riders HTC U 11 Preview: What To Expect From HTC’s Next Flagship Wide Selection Of Ulefone Smartphones On Sale Through GearBest New CBS Bundle Combines Showtime And CBS All Access Toyota To Use NVIDIA Drive PX In Autonomous Cars Boom Road Hits Play Store Complete With Retro Racing Action Chrome Dev For Android Includes A New & Fast Search Widget Deal: Buy two Amazon Echo Show’s, Save $100 w/ Code – 5/9/17 Verizon Says Network Is Performing Well With Unlimited Data Coca-Cola And Google Create Personalized In-Store Ads Netflix Now Supports HDR Video On The LG G6 Load More Posts Follow Share

Chinese professor defends facial-recognition study after Google scoffing Published time: 10 May, 2017 11:18 Get short URL © Cornell University Library / arxiv.org A Chinese professor’s study on revealing criminals based on their facial features has been lambasted by Google researchers, who described it as “deeply problematic, both ethically and scientifically.” Shanghai Jiao Tong University computer science Professor Wu Xiaolin said that the Google scientists read something into the research that simply isn’t there and started their “name-calling,” the South China Morning Post reported. “Their charge of scientific racism was groundless,” Wu added, saying that his work was taken out of context and that he was just eager to share his findings with the public. Read more NYPD sued for refusing to disclose face recognition technology docs In the research, Wu and his student Zhang Xi described machines that could figure out if someone was a criminal, basing on the analysis on nearly 2,000 Chinese state ID pictures of criminals and non-criminals. In particular, the Chinese researchers based their research on “race, gender and age,” and noted that “the faces of law-abiding members of the public have a greater degree of resemblance compared with the faces of criminals.” For example, criminals tended to have eyes that were closer together, they added: “the distance between two eye inner corners for criminals is slightly narrower (5.6%) than for non-criminals.” All of the photos are of people between 18 and 55 years old who lack facial hair, facial scars or other obvious markings. Seven hundred and thirty of the images are labeled ‘criminals’, while the others are ‘non-criminals’. The study was submitted to Cornell University Library’s arXiv resource, a repository for scientific papers, last November. However, the harsh reaction of Google researchers came only last week, when they said they found the Chinese scientists’ findings “deeply problematic, both ethically and scientifically.” They likened Wu's study to physiognomy, the practice of judging a person's character by their facial features, which is considered a pseudoscience by modern scholars. “In one sense, it’s nothing new. However, the use of modern machine learning (which is both powerful and, to many, mysterious) can lend these old claims new credibility,” Google researchers Blaise Aguera y Arcas and Margaret Mitchell, and Princeton University Psychology Professor Alexander Todorov, wrote in the paper published online. Google scientists showed six examples of ‘criminals’ and ‘non-criminals’, noting that the latter seem to be smiling and the supposed ‘criminals’ were frowning. © Cornell University Library / arxiv.org What the Chinese scientists’ findings show is the “inaccuracy and systematic unfairness of many human judgments, including official ones made in a criminal justice context.” Google researchers also note the unlikely accuracy rate of the study (about 90 percent), citing another paper, “a well-controlled” study carried out in 2015 by computer vision researchers Gil Levi and Tal Hassner using a convolutional neural net with the same architecture as the Chinese scientists (AlexNet). The net was only able to guess the gender of a face with an accuracy of 86.8 percent.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman How to Use Google Docs with WordPress, and Why It’s Awesome Automattic (the creators of WordPress) recently released a Google Docs add-on aptly named, WordPress.com for Google Docs. It’s a pretty simple add-on that allows you to draft and publish posts from Google Docs directly to your WordPress site. The WordPress.com distinction in the add-on is a bit misleading, as this feature is available to self-hosted WordPress sites (through the free Jetpack plugin). This means that nearly anyone using WordPress can use this tool. The marriage of these two apps is significant: about 60% of content management systems use WordPress (free, self-hosted, or enterprise-level), and Google Docs are an increasingly important collaborative tool (integrated into the Google ecosystem and popular with millennial users). But what are the benefits to using Google Docs to draft content instead of WordPress? Collaboration – one of the best features of Google Docs is the capability to share and collaboratively edit documents. This is quite simple even for users outside of the Google ecosystem. By giving users permission to modify a document, multiple users can contribute and edit a piece of content simultaneously. Ease of use – Google Docs works like a simplified version of Microsoft Word. Because of its cloud functionality, everything is automatically saved to the document as soon as it is written, and Docs notes who contributed what content in the revision history. Security – Perhaps one of the most under-reported aspects of Google Docs posting to WordPress is how it enhances the security of your posts. You can allow multiple collaborators without having to assign WordPress logins and user roles. All of the writing and editing can be done in Docs and saved to WordPress by one person (I’ll discuss why it might not be wise to publish directly from Docs below). What I want to do in this post is to show how to install and use the WordPress.com for Google Docs add-on, and demonstrate how the add-in translates text in Docs to HTML. Getting started If you want to use this feature with a self-hosted or enterprise WordPress site (wordpress.org as opposed to wordpress.com), you’ll need to have the Jetpack plugin installed. Note that Jetpack is a freemium plugin, but you only need to have the free version installed to use the Google Docs add-in. Note that Jetpack will require a wordpress.com account and that you will immediately want to look at the default Jetpack settings and make sure it’s not doing something you don’t want it to (I turned off everything except for spell-checking, which is the integration of the After the Deadline plugin). After installing the WordPress.com for Google Docs add-in, you will need to activate it under the “Add-ons” tab in Docs. Note that you don’t have to do this until you are ready to save, spruce or publish to WordPress. After opening the add-on, to the right of your document, you’ll see an “Authorization Needed” box. Click Authorize….. Now the box should allow you to post a draft to any site that you have associated with your wordpress.com account (with Jetpack installed). How True is Google Docs to HTML? As a test, I created a document in Docs using all of the available (common) functions that it offered, I then saved it to WordPress and compared the post and the HTML to see how well Docs translated my text to HTML. And for the most part, it did well…. although some of the features in Docs didn’t appear in the WordPress post. Here’s my Google Doc: And here is how the post looked on my site: And this is the HTML: Overall, Google Docs does a pretty fantastic job of translating text to HTML. Here are some of the takeaways/inconsistencies that I noticed: Headings are true: H1, H2, H3 translate well “Title” in Docs creates an H1 heading in WordPress “Subtitle” in Docs creates an H2 heading in WordPress Bold, underline, italics, and strikethrough are translated perfectly from Docs to WordPress Ordered and unordered lists translate true from Docs to WordPress Text color, font type, and indentation do not translate from Docs to WordPress Links from a document work fine in WordPress There is no blockquote in Docs Most of this is forgivable but reinforces that you need to preview content in WordPress before publishing. This is why I recommend only saving drafts from Google Docs, rather than using the Publish to WordPress add-on that installs with the Draft to WordPress add-on. And this…. Images are easy to insert and tough to manage with Docs As with any document, you can just cut and paste an image into a post. I tried three different methods of inserting an image into a test post: cut and paste, insert file, and insert from URL. What I discovered about images in Google Docs translated to WordPress HTML: “Cut and paste” resulted in Google Docs naming the file “image” and making alt text = “null” Inserting an image from file led to the image being uploaded to WordPress with the original image title with alt text equal to the file name. Inserting an image from URL resulted in the image being uploaded to WordPress with the original image title with alt text equal to the file name. So it doesn’t stay hosted on the URL as it would if you performed the same function in WordPress. Practically, the only situation where you would insert an image through Docs would be if you wanted to host the image on your site and the filename is equal to the alt text. Other users of the add-on have commented that the lcr orientation of images doesn’t translate well for images. Realistically any images that you upload you will have to preview and possibly amend in WordPress (I am drafting this post in Docs, but will go into WordPress to place Imgur links for my images. Conclusion If you like Google Docs (I do) or if you do a lot of collaboration, you may find this add-on useful. Using Google Docs is far faster than WordPress (if your computer has poor processing power this might be a great option), but Docs has disadvantages such as lack of function, features lost in translation, and reduced image choices. I wrote this entire post in Docs and found it incredibly easy to use, but still, have to do some editing in WordPress to optimize the images and to check formatting. If you like Google Docs, I recommend trying this add-on to see if its features are helpful for you. For many content creators, this may be a very valuable tool.

Opinion Op-Ed Op-Ed The tech industry is eroding copyright law. Here's how to stop it Richard Vogel / Associated Press YouTube's website in March of 2010. YouTube's website in March of 2010. (Richard Vogel / Associated Press) Jonathan Taplin Suppose a band spends months making an album in expensive recording studios, and the band’s record label releases the album on iTunes. Imagine that, by the end of the first day, all the music has been posted on YouTube, where it is available for free. Now suppose that, the following day, the record label files a “takedown notice,” asserting copyright infringement and requesting the music be removed. Within a week, the work is taken down. Two days later, the album appears on YouTube again, posted by a different user. So begins the copyright holder’s game of whack-a-mole. The posting of content by users who do not hold the copyright for it is perfectly legal, under the “notice and takedown” provision of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act. It’s legal even when the copyright holder already has filed a takedown notice, as long as the work is posted by a different user. Takedown notices address instances of infringement — individual videos posted to YouTube, say — but they don’t apply generally to the actual content. The only way to get Internet companies to honor the widely accepted understanding of fair use is to make it law. YouTube, Google and virtually every pirate site on the Internet invokes the DMCA, over and over, to avoid prosecution for hosting content without permission from the copyright holder. Google received about 2 million takedown notices every day in 2016, according to the Silicon Valley Business Journal. There is a growing movement to change this. Over the past few years, record companies, musicians’ rights groups and Hollywood studios have been pushing to amend copyright law so that websites like YouTube and Facebook bear the responsibility for keeping bootleg content down, a concept some are calling “notice and staydown.” In this approach, it would be up to the websites — once they have been notified — to remove unwarranted content whenever it reappears. In response to this movement, many tech companies are encouraging their users to employ the doctrine of “fair use” in order to fight takedown notices. This is a gross distortion of the concept. Fair use allows for the limited reproduction of content without permission from the copyright holder — emphasis on “limited.” Your local TV station can show a snippet of a football game that was broadcast by another network under fair use. There is no legal statute specifying the maximum length a video or audio clip can be, but it has long been accepted practice that a clip cannot exceed 30 seconds and that it must be quoted in a “transformative” work, such as a remix, a mashup or a hip-hop sample. This loose definition is widely honored in the TV industry, the music industry, book publishing and academia, among other sectors. Tech companies abet the routine violation of it. When you post something on YouTube, you can always check a box that says “fair use,” and no matter what it is, the content will go up on the site. It will go up even if you are posting a song in its entirety, and even when you acknowledge that you do not hold the copyright by leaving unchecked a box that says, “I own this piece of content.” Some tech companies are going even further. In late 2015, Google acknowledged that it is providing support to users who employ fair use as a legal defense. Tech companies have a strong financial incentive to erode copyright law because their businesses grow in part through the recycling and repurposing of content. Copyright holders have an equally strong incentive to protect it. Faced with the deep pockets of the tech industry, copyright holders are fighting a losing battle. The only way to get Internet companies to honor the widely accepted understanding of fair use is to make it law. Although the current legal definition makes one thing crystal clear — you cannot use a work in its entirety and still claim fair use — it leaves many aspects of the doctrine open to interpretation. The Registrar of Copyrights should codify a 30-second time limit for audio and video clips and require that content be used in a transformative or interpretive way. With concrete guidelines in place, regulation would have to be built in. For instance, when a user asserts fair use for a work that YouTube identifies as being blocked by the copyright holder, the clip would have to be sent to a human screener for evaluation. If it is longer than 30 seconds or does not appear in a transformative work, the clip would remain blocked. YouTube already has this process in place for screening pornography, ISIS videos and the like. The ambiguous definition of fair use allows for its continued abuse, and this abuse has become a gateway for the further eroding of copyright law. By now it is well understood that the rise of tech monopolies such as YouTube and Google has hastened the decline of publishing industries. If we don’t move to safeguard copyright law now, there will be no new content to remix.

It also marks a fundamental shift in the grocery business. According to Paul Wilkinson, head of technology research at Tesco Labs, the system not only listens to what you say, but can refine the list by referring also to your ‘Favourites’ and ‘Most frequently purchased items’ in the Tesco grocery app. “It prioritises these in the search results and so can be very specific on the products it adds to their basket,” he says. But the move by IRUK Top500 retailer Tesco to use voice not only taps into the growing move towards how these smart devices play a role in retail, but also it marks a cultural shift in retail: Tesco is now allowing its customer to access it through Google. Amazon’s Echo already allows users to add things to their Amazon Prime accounts, but this is the first time that a major retailer has used someone else’s interface to buy – and it could have an unwanted downside. According to Hugh Fletcher, Global Head of Consultancy and Innovation at global digital consultancy Salmon: “The fact that Tesco is now promoting its sales through another retailer – Google – is a clear paradigm shift. Customers of Tesco are now accessing Tesco via Google. One thing that retailers and brands need to be wary of in a world of many interfaces is that branding and experience become less evident. As a result this could pose a risk to existing customer loyalty and brand equity that they possess with customers. While Tesco is undoubtedly right to get into this space and get in there early, for the sake of its future, we must hope that Tesco has also considered its strategy for customer ownership, data ownership and Tesco brand loyalty, or face becoming a tier two retailer accessed via an interface which isn’t owned by them.” The move also marks the growth of the ‘virtual ecosystem’ for retail, believes Fletcher. “As we see these virtual ecosystems grow and become more widespread, we are likely to see a battle commence between the digital assistants such as Google Home, Amazon Echo and the imminent Apple Home, as retailers and brands affiliate themselves with one or the other. Tesco is one of the first of what will inevitably be a long line of retailers making the decision to offer its customers a voice controlled service, removing the need for a cumbersome, physical interface and allow consumers to slot digital services into their lives with less disruption.   Mentioned in this piece… Tessuti IRDX: RTES Tessuti has stores in Chester, Liverpool, The Trafford Centre, The Metro Centre, Meadowhall, Canary Wharf and Bluewater Shopping Centre.
