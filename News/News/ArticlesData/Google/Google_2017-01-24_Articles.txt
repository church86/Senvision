It was too late to stave off pernicious false rumors about Hillary Clinton’s health problems, or her involvement in a nonexistent underground child-prostitution ring, but the companies still moved to make it harder to spread similar misinformation in the future. Facebook and Google quickly took aim at the most egregious offenders: websites that peddled deceptive news stories in order to attract hordes of readers and make money off of advertising. Both companies banned those types of sites from their powerful ad networks. But there’s a category of often-misleading news sources that seems to have escaped the notice of tech companies: state-sponsored outlets like RT, a TV network and online news website that’s funded by the Russian government. As my colleagues Julia Ioffe and Rosie Gray wrote in the Columbia Journalism Review and BuzzFeed, respectively, RT—formerly known as Russia Today—routinely shapes its coverage portray Russia in the best possible light, and to make the West, and especially the United States, look bad. As part of a landmark report released last month, the intelligence community concluded that RT was part of a “state-run propaganda machine” that spread misinformation about the U.S. election. The report said RT “actively collaborated” with WikiLeaks, and gave its founder, Julian Assange, a platform from which to publicize documents stolen from top Democrats. (Some experts say, however, that the intelligence community may have overstated the channel’s influence.) RT stories regularly appear toward the top of Google search results. Earlier this month, when I Googled “ODNI hacking report” on my smartphone, I was inundated with links to RT news stories and video clips from its TV broadcasts. (ODNI stands for the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, which released the document.) A screenshot of Google search results for "ODNI hacking report." The first two items in the carousel of “featured news stories,” the top three listed search results, and seven of the ten featured videos on the page linked to RT content. One story presented the Kremlin’s line on the report: “It is truly reminiscent of a witch hunt.” In another story, Assange called the report “quite embarrassing to the reputations of the U.S. intelligence services.” The stories and videos aren’t factually inaccurate; they’re simply framed to discredit the hacking report and distance Russia from the accusations it contains. A Google spokesperson declined to comment on whether the company had any policies for how to rank and display news stories and videos from state-sponsored outlets like RT. But since I reached out to the company, searching for “ODNI hacking report” no longer displays sections for featured news stories or videos. On Tuesday, only one link on the first page of Google results for the search pointed to RT. Google came under fire in November when searches for “final election results” prominently featured a page from an amateur website that falsely claimed that President Donald Trump had won the popular vote. (In fact, Clinton received nearly 2.9 million more votes than Trump.) “In this case we clearly didn’t get it right,” a spokesperson for Google told me at the time. “But we are continually working to improve our algorithms.” Real estate on the all-important first page of Google results is a zero-sum game. Google searches for other political issues also turn up plenty of RT content, but none featured as many as the hacking report search earlier this month. The top news result in a search for “how big was women’s march” is an RT article focused on criticism of the mess left behind by demonstrators. A search for “Trump inauguration attendance” returned an RT story as a featured news article, with the headline, “‘You are wrong’: Trump & spokesperson blast media over inaugural attendance figures.” Data about Facebook engagement and reach isn’t public, beyond the number of people who like RT’s Facebook page: more than 4 million. That pales in comparison to Facebook pages of major American news networks, but eclipses the audience of smaller news sites and magazines. I asked a spokesperson for Facebook, which has taken an aggressive approach to slowing the spread of misleading news stories, if articles or videos from state-sponsored outlets are treated the same way as content from The New York Times or The Wall Street Journal. The spokesperson only pointed me to changes the company has already announced, which suppress the circulation of links to news stories that users report as false. But since RT’s stories are more likely to be biased than to be “purposefully fake or deceitful,” as Facebook’s reporting tool puts it, its users may not report them that way. Before Trump’s inauguration last week, RT was briefly banned from posting links, photos, and videos to Facebook. The network decried the ban as an act of censorship, but a Facebook spokesperson said that suggesting that the move was “in any way linked to outside factors or events is entirely inaccurate.” RT said the ban may have stemmed from a copyright claim. There’s a bright line between discussing how technology companies circulate news stories from state-funded outlets and advocating for media censorship. RT and other foreign state-sponsored sources can legally broadcast and publish in the United States without fear of reprisal or meddling. But today’s gatekeepers of online information, like Facebook, Google, and Twitter, get to decide what information deserves to be elevated—in Google’s “Top Stories” box, for example—and which, by extension, get suppressed. Real estate on the all-important first page of Google results is a zero-sum game: Only about ten links will ever appear on it for any one search, and if four of them point to one news site, those slots can’t be used to direct users elsewhere. Russia is far from the only country to sponsor a media organization. The U.K. helps fund the BBC, France 24 is paid for by the French government, and the U.S. funds publishers and broadcasters like Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty. The problem isn’t RT’s funding sources, but rather its record of skewed, pro-Moscow reporting. Speaking to The Atlantic in 2015, Ann Cooper, a professor of journalism at Columbia University and an expert on Russian media, said that the government shouldn’t designate RT as a foreign agent. “You don’t want to get into a situation where you’re trying to set up categories and define different news agencies and basically say, ‘These ones are good, these ones are not,’” Cooper said. She argued that the public should be allowed to choose what news source they want to listen to. And RT, of course, isn’t about to swallow up a significant portion of the U.S. news landscape. According to The Economist, the network routinely inflates the size of its TV audience, and its performance on Facebook and Twitter falls way behind mainstream news networks like CNN and the BBC, newspapers like The New York Times, and news services like Reuters and the Associated Press.

Twitter Facebook Email Most Popular Presented by Pablo Martinez Monsivais / AP How Trump’s Executive Orders Could Set America Back 70 Years Jeremi Suri The president is taking the United States back to the nightmares of the world before the Second World War: closed borders, limited trade, and a go-it-alone national race to the bottom. Despite all the lies and distortions, President Donald Trump has spent his first week in office assembling a coherent and well-planned framework for foreign policy. It is hiding in plain sight—frequently missed in the storm of tweets and the attacks on domestic enemies. Read as a whole and in detail, with attention to their larger single-minded purpose, Trump’s executive orders are the blueprints for the most significant shift in American foreign policy since the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. The latest drafts of executive orders, several of which the president will reportedly sign Friday at the Pentagon, are bold and breathtaking in their reach. They are strategic and transformative. They are also poised to destroy the foundations for the last 70 years of American-led peace and prosperity. The orders question the very ideas of cooperation and democracy, embodying an aggressive commitment to “America First” above all else. So much for the “defense of the free world,” and the “march of freedom”—obvious soft-headed “loser” ideas for the new team of White House cynics. Continue Reading Lucy Nicholson / Reuters On Pitying Melania Megan Garber Via memes, jokes, and fan fictions, many Americans have taken it upon themselves to feel bad for their new first lady. She is not in need of the sympathy. Did you see the gif? The one that features Melania Trump, the newly installed first lady of the United States, radiantly smiling as her husband gazes upon her … and then, as he turns away, allowing the grin to melt into a frown? Grin-grimace, grin-grimace, grin-grimace, looping into eternity. Call it a Kinsley gif: The image seemed to reveal, in its frozen fluidity, an unspoken truth—about Melania, about her marriage, about all of us. During a time of Much News, it quickly became conversation fodder. Slate offered “A Detailed Forensic Analysis of Melania Trump’s Creepy, Devastating Inauguration Smile/Frown.” Jezebel shared it with the sardonic declaration that “Melania Trump Definitely Loves Her Husband and Is Very Happy to Be Here.” New York magazine did a fact-check of the video the gif came from to assure us, finally, that “That Awkward Clip of Donald and Melania at the Inauguration Is Definitely Real.” (Snopes agreed, but warned that the video is inconclusive when it comes to its ability to reveal Melania’s emotions.) #FreeMelania trended. Continue Reading Lenny Ignelzi / AP Which Christians Are Telling Donald Trump to Keep Out Refugees? Emma Green Many religious groups have urged the president not to give Christians priority in seeking asylum, but some conservative political organizations back his new policy. President Trump has signed an executive order that temporarily suspends the U.S. refugee program and bars Syrian refugees. It will likely suspend immigration from certain Muslim-majority countries and bars the admission of anyone who engages in “acts of bigotry or hatred,” including “the persecution of those who practice religions different from their own.” It also allows the the secretaries of State and Homeland Security to jointly admit individuals on a case-by-case basis, “including when the person is a religious minority ... facing religious persecution.” In an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network on Friday, Trump clarified what this means: Christians refugees will be given priority status. “They’ve been horribly treated,” the president said. “Do you know if you were a Christian in Syria it was impossible, at least very tough, to get into the United States? If you were a Muslim you could come in, but if you were a Christian, it was almost impossible.” People overseas “were chopping off the heads of everybody, but more so the Christians,” he added, “so we are going to help them.” Continue Reading Tom Pennington / Getty Images The Mind of Donald Trump Dan P. McAdams Narcissism, disagreeableness, grandiosity—a psychologist investigates how Trump’s extraordinary personality might shape his possible presidency. In 2006, Donald Trump made plans to purchase the Menie Estate, near Aberdeen, Scotland, aiming to convert the dunes and grassland into a luxury golf resort. He and the estate’s owner, Tom Griffin, sat down to discuss the transaction at the Cock & Bull restaurant. Griffin recalls that Trump was a hard-nosed negotiator, reluctant to give in on even the tiniest details. But, as Michael D’Antonio writes in his recent biography of Trump, Never Enough, Griffin’s most vivid recollection of the evening pertains to the theatrics. It was as if the golden-haired guest sitting across the table were an actor playing a part on the London stage. “It was Donald Trump playing Donald Trump,” Griffin observed. There was something unreal about it. Continue Reading Bettman / Getty A Twitter Tribute to Holocaust Victims Candice Norwood A new social-media project commemorates refugees turned away by the United States in 1939. Software developer Russel Neiss and Rabbi Charlie Schwartz have collaborated on a number of projects that use technology to bring awareness to Jewish issues, history, and culture. But last night they dreamt up the St. Louis Manifest, a Twitter project sharing the story of some 900 Jews who fled Nazi Germany in 1939 on the MS St. Louis in an attempt to gain entry into the United States. After being turned way, the passengers were forced to return to Europe, where a number of countries accepted them as refugees; 254 of them were killed in the Holocaust. This story, Neiss and Schwartz believe, serves as a fitting tribute to International Holocaust Remembrance Day on Friday, and a reminder of a time in American history when the country closed its doors to refugees. Continue Reading Mark Kauzlarich / Reuters What Does the Billionaire Family Backing Donald Trump Really Want? Rosie Gray The Mercers are enjoying more influence than ever with their candidate in the White House—but no one seems to know how they intend to use it. She owns a cookie store. He loves model trains. They both hate the Clintons. And beyond that, not much is clear about the motivations of the Mercer father-daughter duo of Republican megadonors who have become two of the most powerful people in the country over the last 18 months. Hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer and his daughter Rebekah were among the earliest and strongest backers of Donald Trump while other elite donors still disdained him. It turned out to be a good investment. But now, with their favored candidate freshly installed as president of the United States, it remains unclear what they believe, or what they hope their investment will yield. The Mercers have been a quiet but constant presence in the background of Republican politics since the beginning of the 2016 cycle. They started the campaign as backers of Ted Cruz, pouring millions into one of the main super PACs supporting his candidacy. Their data firm, Cambridge Analytica, was hired by the Cruz campaign. They switched to support Trump shortly after he clinched the nomination, and he eventually hired Cambridge Analytica, as well. Their top political guru is Steve Bannon, the former Breitbart News chairman and White House chief strategist. They’re close, too, with Trump’s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway, who also has a senior role in the White House. They never speak to the press and hardly ever even release a public statement. Like Trump himself, they’ve flouted the standard playbook for how things are done in politics. Continue Reading Stoyan Nenov / Reuters The Coldhearted Folly of Trump's Proposed Immigration Order Graeme Wood The countries likely affected are not those whose nationals have actually perpetrated the most ghastly attacks on Western targets. When I first started talking to ISIS propagandists and supporters, I was much impressed by one of their favorite Koranic verses: “We have already created man and know what his soul whispers to him, and We are closer to him than [his] jugular vein.” The verse is a reminder of God’s omnipresence, and his Santa Claus-like awareness of our deepest selves, our sins, and our good deeds. In time, I came to associate that unsettling proximity (He is closer than you think) not only with God, but also with ISIS. They too were less distant than they seemed. What seemed at first like a movement of barbarians with alien origins and impulses looked increasingly like a human phenomenon, with human flaws and virtues (mostly flaws). The more I investigated the group’s supporters, the more I found people who at one point had shared my culture and community, even if they tried to throw it all away in the service of something wicked. In the end I discovered that one of the most important figures in the Islamic State, a mysterious ideologue named Yahya Abu Hassan, was not Syrian or Iraqi at all, but a 33-year-old American, a dope-smoking theological prodigy from my own hometown.

It’s a little before 3 p.m. on a sunny Friday afternoon and Laugardalur Park, near central Reykjavik, looks practically deserted. There’s an occasional adult with a stroller, but the park’s surrounded by apartment blocks and houses, and school’s out—so where are all the kids? Walking with me are Gudberg Jónsson, a local psychologist, and Harvey Milkman, an American psychology professor who teaches for part of the year at Reykjavik University. Twenty years ago, says Gudberg, Icelandic teens were among the heaviest-drinking youths in Europe. “You couldn’t walk the streets in downtown Reykjavik on a Friday night because it felt unsafe,” adds Milkman. “There were hordes of teenagers getting in-your-face drunk.” Continue Reading Jon Woo / Reuters Can the U.S. Military Compete With China’s Rooster-Dancing Capabilities? Uri Friedman Behold the awesome power of the People’s Liberation Army. The Chinese government clearly received the message when Donald Trump pledged to not only rebuild the U.S. military, but also show it off with parades down Pennsylvania Avenue and flyovers of New York City. In response, Beijing has sent America’s new president a signal that it too can play that game. That signal comes in the form of a rooster, which, in Chinese astrology, is associated with people who are hardworking, supremely confident, and demanding of attention. In marking the dawn of each new day, one Chinese scholar observes, roosters are in charge of “time.” The Chinese government’s point—at a time of serious tensions between the world powers over trade, Taiwan, and the South China Sea—is unambiguous: Trump may want to Make America Great Again, but the coming century belongs to China, not America. Continue Reading Ian Allen My President Was Black Ta-Nehisi Coates A history of the first African American White House—and of what came next In the waning days of President Barack Obama’s administration, he and his wife, Michelle, hosted a farewell party, the full import of which no one could then grasp. It was late October, Friday the 21st, and the president had spent many of the previous weeks, as he would spend the two subsequent weeks, campaigning for the Democratic presidential nominee, Hillary Clinton. Things were looking up. Polls in the crucial states of Virginia and Pennsylvania showed Clinton with solid advantages. The formidable GOP strongholds of Georgia and Texas were said to be under threat. The moment seemed to buoy Obama. He had been light on his feet in these last few weeks, cracking jokes at the expense of Republican opponents and laughing off hecklers. At a rally in Orlando on October 28, he greeted a student who would be introducing him by dancing toward her and then noting that the song playing over the loudspeakers—the Gap Band’s “Outstanding”—was older than she was.

Dakota has $4 billion saved from oil and gas taxes; Colorado has almost none Trump adviser calling for overhaul of “junk science” at EPA Colorado considers ending longtime switchblade knife ban By Barbara Ortutay, The Associated Press NEW YORK — The tech industry brought us self-driving cars, artificial intelligence and 3-D printers. But when it comes to racial and gender diversity, its leading companies are no trailblazers. Despite loudly touted efforts to hire more blacks, Latinos and women, especially in technical and leadership positions, diversity numbers at the largest tech companies are barely budging. In 2014, 2 percent of Googlers were black and 3 percent were Hispanic, numbers that have not changed since. The picture is similar at Facebook and Twitter . Microsoft is slightly more racially diverse (though not when it comes to gender) and Apple even more so, though still not reflective of the U.S. population. Amazon is more racially diverse still, although it counts a large, lower-wage warehouse workforce in its totals. Women, meanwhile, make up less than a third of the workforce at many companies — even less in engineering and other technical jobs. Tech companies themselves tend to blame a “pipeline problem,” meaning a shortage of woman and minorities with technical qualifications. But a number of academic experts, industry employees and diversity advocates say there’s a bigger problem. Silicon Valley, they argue, has failed to challenge its own unstated assumptions about what makes for great tech employees. “The people who are doing the hiring are not changing their thinking around what they view as qualified,” says Leslie Miley, engineering director at the message-service startup Slack. Hiring managers, he says, spend too much time worrying that applicants who don’t fit techie stereotypes aren’t “Google-y enough or Facebook-y enough or Apple-y enough or Twitter-y enough.” Miley, who is African-American, previously worked as an engineer at Twitter, Apple, Google and Yahoo. THE INDUSTRY IS TRYING Companies are spending a lot of time and money on improving diversity. Two years ago, Intel splashily set itself the goal of achieving full representation in its workforce by 2020. Despite committing $300 million to the effort and making some early progress , Intel acknowledges there is “a great deal of work to be done.” Similar programs are in place throughout the industry, from outreach at high schools and historically black colleges to internship and mentoring programs and sponsorships for coding boot camps. So far, to little avail. Why? Interviews with more than 30 tech workers, executives and diversity advocates suggest the blame lies with subtle biases in hiring, unwelcoming work environments and a paucity of diverse role models in top positions. Aniyia Williams, founder and CEO of the startup Tinsel, says companies should focus on their own culture rather than blaming external factors they can’t control, such as limited computer-science education in U.S. schools. It’s not enough to release diversity reports and say, “Oh, not a lot has changed, but it’s the world, not us that’s the problem,” she says. Williams, who is African-American, says she has made sure to hire women as well as underrepresented minorities. Tinsel makes tech jewelry targeted at women. WHY IT MATTERS Diversity isn’t just about fairness. It’s about having designers who reflect the diversity of the people they are designing for. For tech companies hoping to reach millions or billions of users, a lack of diversity could mean their products “will not appeal to a large population,” says Lillian Cassel, chairwoman of computer sciences at Villanova University. Diverse perspectives can also help prevent grievous errors — such as a problem that arose at Google in 2015, when a photo-recognition feature misidentified black faces as gorillas. Some related missteps: + Snapchat released two photo filters that contorted facial features into bucktoothed Asian caricatures or blackface. One was later withdrawn after public outcry. The other “expired,” and the company said it won’t put it back into circulation. + Airbnb initially took no steps to prevent hosts from discriminating against guests whose profile photos showed they were black. The practice was corrected after an outcry. + Twitter took nearly a decade to tackle the harassment of women and minorities on its service. In a New York Times opinion piece , Microsoft researcher Kate Crawford urged companies working on artificial intelligence to address diversity, warning that otherwise “we will see ingrained forms of bias built into the artificial intelligence of the future.” INTO THE PIPELINE Some 11 percent of computer science graduates were black and 9 percent were Hispanic in the 2013-14 school year, according to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Education. Yet only 4 percent of Google’s 2015 hires were black, and 3 percent were Hispanic. At Intel, fewer than 5 percent of hires were black and 8 percent were Hispanic. Numbers at other tech companies are comparable. Major tech companies have a long tradition of hiring applicants from top-tier universities — and those universities also have a problem with diversity, even if they’re doing slightly better than the companies. Some minority applicants, meanwhile, earn their computer-science chops through community colleges or coding boot camps instead — places often overlooked by recruiters. The few minorities hired into big tech companies can often feel alienated in overwhelmingly white (and sometimes Asian) environments. Unsurprisingly, they are sometimes reluctant to recommend their employer to friends, classmates and former colleagues, furthering the cycle of underrepresentation, Williams and others say. WHEN THE CULTURE DOESN’T FIT Silicon Valley startups like to talk about “culture fit” — in theory, the question of whether a job candidate’s attitude and behavior meshes well with a company. In practice, though, it can mean that since a lot of people are white and male, they “hire what they know,” says Dave McClure, a prominent angel investor in Silicon Valley. Larger companies such as Facebook publicly eschew discussions of “fit,” although the notion can unwittingly seep into hiring practices. For example, a 2013 study found that words used in engineering and programming job listings could serve to discourage women from applying. Words like “competitive,” ”dominant” and “leader,” can make a job seem less appealing to women in a field that is already male-dominated. Some companies, including Facebook, offer training on “unconscious bias” to combat the problem. But they don’t make such training mandatory for all employees. And once hired, people can get lost in the shuffle given the lack of role models and mentors in higher ranks — and thus find it difficult to advance. At many places, women and minorities face constant questions about their technical knowledge. They can’t help wondering if they would be taken “more seriously” if they were whiter and male, Williams says. MAKING CHANGE HAPPEN Nancy Lee, the Google official in charge of diversity efforts, says the gorilla face-recognition incident was a “wake-up call” for the company. “We need to include all voices from a multitude of backgrounds and experiences (when it comes to the) technology we create,” she says. “We firmly believe that good ideas don’t come out of echo chambers.” Lee says things are getting better, slowly, but that it can be “demoralizing” to those working on diversity issues to be pressured to do things quickly. “We want to solve this for the long haul,” she says. But Miley, the former Twitter and Google engineer, can’t understand why diversifying the industry’s workforce “seems to be such an intractable problem.” “I wonder if it is coming up against…the deep-seated belief that the people in these organizations are special and they want to keep out people who are not special,” he says. “In our country, increasingly the people who are not special are the people who are underprivileged.” Tags:  diversity gender equality tech Click for Digital & Home Delivery - 50% blog comments powered by Disqus More in Technology Technology back in driver’s seat in metro Denver January 27, 2017, 6:12 pm Jobs in information technology and software (IT-Software) increased 9.4 percent last year, the best showing out of 13 industries key to the northern Front Range economy, according to the 11th annual cluster study from the Metro Denver Economic Development Corp.

For Dell that list includes the 11.6-inch Latitude 11 and Chromebook 11, the 13.3-inch Latitude 13 and Chromebook 13 and the 11.6-inch Latitude 11 Convertible and Chromebook 11 Convertible. All of the new systems are reinforced for shock protection and have rubberized base trim so they can better withstand a drop off a desk. They also have fully sealed keyboards and touchpads to protect against spills. Dell is promising all-day battery life from them, too. The convertibles are able to be used as a traditional notebook or with the screen rotated around 360 degrees and used as a tablet. The Windows version supports input with Dell's Productivity Active Pen so students can write and draw on the screen, and it has a world-facing camera that sits above the keyboard so that it can be used when the Latitude is in tablet mode. The Dell Chromebook 11 convertible's screen rotates 360 degrees from laptop to tablet. Dell For the other Latitude and Chromebook models, the screens have 180-degree lay-flat hinges making them easier for students to gather around. Other than their larger screen size, the 13-inch models are available with or without a touch display, can be configured with higher-performance Core i3 or Core i5 processors (the 11-inch models run on Pentium and Celeron CPUs) and are available with mobile broadband (Windows only) allowing students to stay connected when Wi-Fi isn't available. All of the systems are expected to be available in early February. Pricing was not announced. Alongside the laptops, Dell announced two 4K-resolution touch displays for use in classrooms or offices. Joining the company's current 70-inch 1080p interactive touch monitor, the 55- and 86-inch displays use a new InGlass technology for a natural writing experience using the two included passive styluses according to Dell. Also, although the displays have room on back for a Dell OptiPlex Micro desktop that can be powered off the display, a Dell spokesperson said they can be used with any computer. Both will be available at the end of March at a price below $5,000 for the Dell 55 (roughly converted to £4,000 or AU$6,600) and below $11,000 for the Dell 86 (£8,800 or AU$14,500).

One phone after another failed to impress critics and consumers alike, and floudered in a marketplace utterly dominated by Apple and its key rival, LG's fellow Korean firm Samsung. Then something strange happened. LG launched the LG G2, and it was really rather good. A lot of people sat up and started paying attention to this new, fighting fit device which squarely took on Samsung's Galaxy range. Most importantly it caught Google's eye, and the Android giant brought LG onboard to create the Nexus 4 - a device so successful that Google had LG come back for the Nexus 5, which also sold like hot cakes. 2014 might have been a pants year for Samsung, LG had something of a belter –– and a lot of this success was to do with the LG G3. According to the latest stats, via The Korea Herald, LG shipped an estimated 59.6 million units, up 25.2 percent from the 47.6 million in 2013.  ---------------------------------------------- The LG G3 is Now Cheaper Than EVER Yes, the LG G3 is getting on a bit but that doesn’t mean it is no longer a solid handset; quite the contrary, in fact. Android phones are specced to the gills and this makes them very future proof. This handset has tons or power and a great camera which makes it a very sensible option in 2017 for those looking for exceptional value.   ---------------------------------------------- "Announcing its financial results for the three months between July and September," notes CNET, "LG identified the G series and L series as big hits. The number of phones shifted by LG rose by over a third in this period, hitting 16.8 million devices, while the company's operating profit hit $450 million -- more than double the figure from the same time last year." Industry watchers point to LG’s ever-popular G line of handsets as leading the surge in performance, with the LG G3 –– 2014’s flagship –– taking the lion’s share alongside the G3 Stylus and G3 Beat. And the company doesn’t seem to be wasting any time in 2015 either, having already launched the LG G Flex 2.  The LG G3 follows on from LG's impressive LG G2 flagship, and it has more than a handful of showy tricks up its sleeves. Do they benefit the experience or is the phone all mouth and no trousers? LG G3 Review: Design & Display At a glance the LG G3 is an attractive beast with some qualities not seen elsewhere on the smartphone market. Primarily, it’s all about that massive touchscreen, being one of very few offerings available which could genuinely be described as “edge-to-edge”. I can’t even begin to put together the mathematics to prove it as fact, (because writing for a living means that maths is basically wizardry) but to me it feels as though bezel width is directly proportional to phone attractiveness, ie: the narrower it is the better looking the phone becomes. But the really curious thing seems to be how much LG appears to have been listening in on consumers’ wants and desires, vis-a-vis what everyone was saying prior to, during, and after the launches of the Samsung Galaxy S5 and HTC One M8. That’s really the only conclusion I can reach when what we have here is a phone which goes to great lengths to make itself look like metal, but is in fact plastic, though not the kind of crap-feeling plastic which seems like it’s been reconstituted from all the unwanted drinks straws thrown away by fast-food chains. Yes, LG earns some major cool points on the build front. The shape of the device looks different enough from most rivals with an overall angular profile. I suppose the nearest look-alike would be the LG-made Nexus 5, although the back panel has a more pronounced curvature on the G3. It’s also not using any of that soft-touch plastic, this is solid stuff with a smooth, though not overly glossy finish and a brushed metal-effect texture. As I’ve come to expect from the last few LG flagships, the build quality is solid and it’s quite a robust device. However, while it’s likely more durable than aluminium, and it did survive a few heavy drops, I have noticed a bit of scuffing to the plastic finish in one of the corners. The LG G3 handles reasonably well on the whole but it’s worth pointing out the tapered edges don’t give the best grip, combined with the size and the fact that, while not glossy, the material finish is quite smooth and slippery, those with smaller hands may struggle to hold onto the device. While it may look like a unibody device, the back panel is in fact removable, revealing a removable 3,000mAh battery and card slots inside. Meanwhile, LG has pulled the same trick it performed on the LG G2 in streamlining the phone’s exterior and isolating the controls to the top centre of the back panel, just below the camera port. This comprises a central power button housed in the middle of a volume rocker, just as before, although it’s been made to look a bit flashier than the LG G2 in-line with the rest of the phone’s metallic theme. The power key has a brushed effect and the volume rocker has a small dimpled texture, both of which are physical rather than simply visual and therefore make the keys a bit easier to locate on the back of the handset. I maintain it’s still not as easy to operate as a regular side or top-mounted power key and volume rocker, however, and for some reason on our review unit the power key had a tendency to stick or jam slightly. I've also found over time the power button can behave oddly, powering on the handset only to shut the screen off again immediately - as many as three or four times in a row before it actually decides to play nice and keep the screen on. What about the display? Well, it’s pretty stunning really. It is incredibly sharp, thanks to LG further refining its use of IPS+ LCD with a denser sub-pixel arrangement and an insanely high-resolution at 2560x1440 pixels QHD. At 5.5-inches on the diagonal that gives a pixel density of 534 pixels-per-inch, meaning there’s little else on the market that comes close in terms of clarity. Colour is also nice and vivid, whites are very pure and there doesn’t appear to be any tint throwing off the whole setup. Blacks and dark tones have good depth, although are not the deepest compared to something like an OLED setup, but brightness is excellent in general use. Viewing angles aren't too bad either, and it’s a similar story for bright sunlight, with the G3 besting most of its high-end Android stable mates. Generally speaking though, it’s a film or game lover’s dream in terms of usability as your own little portable cinema screen – viewing multimedia is a joy. LG G3 Review: Software & User Experience The LG G3 uses Google’s Android software, it launched with Android 4.4 KitKat but has since been updated with Android 5.0 Lollipop. It has LG’s own custom UI layer on top, which presents an interesting, if somewhat idiosyncratic, set of features – some of which are tied into hardware functionality. One of these is the return of the Knock On feature seen on the LG G2, which allows the user to wake or sleep the phone by double-tapping on the display. This is now joined by Knock Code, but I’ll come back to that in a second. Now, previously I made a rather glib comment during our LG G2 video that Knock On was “gimmicky”, which I’ve since come to regret as it actually does have it uses and is not a bad little feature. It’s not without its problems, however. Firstly, LG suggests it operates via a double-tap, but in practice I've found it only really responds consistently to a triple-tap.  Secondly, it's a bit overly sensitive – enough so that I quite often found the phone would wake up in my pocket. That led to one of two scenarios, either I’d take the phone out to use for something else, only to find it already on, and perhaps pratting about inside an app (I haven’t sent so many nonsensical “zzzjsdhdhdhd” style text messages by accident since the early 2000’s). It also gets pretty hot too. And that should give you an ominous indication of the next scenario: last week I noticed something burning a frigging hole in my chest. Alarmed, I investigated only to discover it was the phone. Screw wearables, this thing will bring about a glorious cyborg union much earlier, whether you want it to or not, when it fuses itself to your ribcage or hip. Less dramatically: think of the battery drain. I’ve encountered this before, with a similar feature aboard the HTC One M8, but the key difference there is that HTC lets you toggle it on or off. I’ll concede I may have missed it, but I looked long and hard through the LG G3’s UI and found no such toggle – you can’t switch off Knock On, it seems. Which means the only real way to stop such tomfoolery is to activate Knock Code or some other security lock instead. Knock Code acts as another unlock option alongside the usual run of PIN, password or pattern unlocking. It’s similar to pattern unlock, except that it lets you set a knocking pattern for tapping the screen in order to unlock it (rather than a swiping pattern), using specific sections of the display. It’s a bit like having a secret knock, and it works very well. This can be a remedy to the aforementioned overactive-in-your-pocket scenario caused by regular Knock On, simply because the odds of it hitting the right code while jumbling about in your pocket are pretty damn slim – it might still activate the display, as that still works on a double tap, but your code isn’t likely to be entered, which means you won’t get into apps, tax the processor, drain the battery, or start sending derpy messages. And even if it is activated in this case, if you don’t input your code it will time out from the lockscreen. Remember what I said about getting bitten in the ass? Yeah, that was it. I understand the good intentions behind this feature, but from a practical standpoint it falls flat on its face. What about the rest of the UI design? Well, as seems to be the trend of late, Android 4.4 KitKat has seen a lot of phone makers which have conventionally slapped a thick layer of brand flavour icing onto things opting instead for something a bit more reserved and, dare I say it, “true to Google”. The LG G3’s UI is very much in-keeping with KitKat – it has flatter app icons, white notification elements, transparent bars at top and bottom, a translucent app drawer and plenty more along these lines. The Quick Settings section of the drop-down notifications menu is particularly noteworthy for its neat little circular toggle icons. Meanwhile, there’s customisation a-plenty with the ability to change the Quick Setting toggles, adjust the full Settings menu viewing mode (tabs or list), and select a custom font. The keyboard has its own bag of tricks, as well as offering a Swype-like text input you can customise the height of the keyboard – either condensing it down or spreading the keys out a bit. You can also toggle one-handed operation where you can flip the keyboard to one side of the handset or the other with a swipe, which is nice. A neat feature is the “Dual Window” functionality accessible via the multitasking screen. Rather like Samsung’s Multiscreen, you can share the display between two apps – you can even set this up so that links and image attachments will automatically open in the Dual Window mode. The handset also features a built-in File Manager application, QuickMemo+, and a configurable “Guest Mode” to give restricted access to whoever you might hand your phone to. One little quirk is the “Smart Bulletin”, which is rather similar to some of Samsung’s stuff and HTC’s BlinkFeed as a panel positioned on the far-left of your set of homescreens. It comprises two panes, one for the LG Health suite (which is pretty much like all the other helath suites being pushed right now) and one for “Smart Tips”, which can guide you in how to use certain features aboard the phone. The whole Smart Bulletin feature can be handily toggled off in Settings should you wish to be rid of it. Performance wise this is as buttery smooth as I’ve come to expect having handled the LG G2 last year, and subsequently a boatload of Qualcomm Snapdragon 801-based handsets. It’s crazy fast and doesn’t skip a beat. But importantly the UI operation appears to have been well optimised. There are a lot of similarities in look, feel, and animation style and fluidity, with HTC’s Sense 6 UI, which is a very positive thing as I wrote enthusiastically about that in my HTC One M8 review. It’s rewarding to operate and view, and it’s fluid too. LG G3 Review: Connectivity &  Hardware All the connectivity options you might expect from a high-end smartphone are aboard the LG G3, including full 4G LTE and 3G mobile data (via a Micro-SIM), dual-band Wi-Fi (with Wi-Fi Direct and Hotspot), Bluetooth 4.0 and microUSB. It also packs DLNA, an infrared blaster, NFC, A-GPS (GLONASS), and an FM Radio. On the storage side of things, the UK version has 16GB onboard with microSD support for cards up to 128GB. Not a massive amount of onboard space, but should be adequate for most apart from the power users, the card capacity is nice for media aficionados to hot-swap music, image and film collections. A 32GB model does exist but is currently only available in Asia. At the heart of the phone is Qualcomm’s Snapdragon 801 quad-core chip based on its Krait 400 architecture, specifically the MSM8975AC model clocked at 2.5GHz. It carries an Adreno 330 graphics processing unit (GPU) and again the UK model has 2GB of RAM, while buyers in Asia can enjoy 3GB alongside their 32GB of onboard storage space. The LG G3’s smooth running interface is one thing but it’s also a dab hand at more intensive tasks thanks to that engine block. It handles high-end gaming such as Asphalt 8 effortlessly and with no performance lag, while multitasking a large number of apps is also no problem. I did notice the handset tended to heat up rather a lot even during relatively light workloads, meaning intensive use turns it into quite the little burner, but that’s not unusual for Snapdragon 800/801 devices by any means. LG G3 Review: Battery LG’s gone for a removable 3,000mAh cell, which is handy as it enables hot-swapping of spare packs, if you’re that way inclined. Battery life seems quite variable, I ran our video test with Django Unchained from 100% charge – the film runs 2.45 hours. With full brightness on (bearing in mind this is a massive, high-resolution and ultra-bright display) and Wi-Fi enabled, streaming the film for its full duration ran the charge down to 37%. Not great. However, re-charging to 100%, pre-loading the film and then running it on the same settings saw the phone come down to a more respectable 50%. Not bad. That display is no doubt taking a fair share of the juice, but you’ll have to be careful with other power drains if you want to get a decent run from the LG G3. Being careful, it should manage around five hours of continued video playback (pre-loaded), but streaming significantly less. As expected, I found with moderate to heavy use the handset needed a charge by the end of a working day from 100%. Considering the demand that screen no doubt puts on the phone it’s actually impressive that it manages this kind of performance, which is fairly typical of several high-end devices with generous batteries these days. LG G3 Review: Camera As LG’s tech is so often very similar to that of Samsung’s, it should perhaps not be surprising that the camera performance is very reminiscent of what we’ve seen from its fellow Korean phone-maker. By that, I mean that it’s got a clean, easy-to-use UI, and has been calibrated to produce slightly more vibrant images than you might get on sensors which aim for very true-to-life contrast and colour accuracy. That’s not to say the results looks unreal, because they don’t, but they have a lot of pop, meaning there’s little need to use apps such as Instagram if you like a striking image. The sensor is a 13-megapixel back-illuminated (BSI) setup with a 1/3” sensor size and an f/2.4 aperture. It has a dual-LED two-tone flash, optical image stabilisation (OIS+) and laser autofocus. LG claims the laser autofocus means it’s able to focus and capture a snap faster than you can blink, and this does indeed seem to be the case – it’s very quick on operation. That, combined with its easy UI means it’s great for fast and effortless point-n-shoot purposes while delivering great results. The OIS+ seems to help too as image quality seems to be a wee bit sharper and more detailed than Samsung’s 16MP ISOCELL, while dynamic range and contrast are both excellent and it handles low-light quite well. The LG G3 supports HDR mode, panoramic capture and voice activation, as well as geo-tagging, face and smile detection, and burst mode. Video capture supports 1080p and 4K Ultra HD quality and is incredibly sharp and smooth, while a 2.1-megapixel front-facing secondary can be used for selfies and video calls in 1080p quality. If you're interested in how the LG G3's imaging capabilities stack up against key rivals (*spoiler*: it did rather well), head over to our big flagship cameraphone shootout where we put it through its paces alongside the likes of Samsung's Galaxy S5, Nokia's Lumia 1020, and Sony's Xperia Z2, amongst others: Which Smartphone Has The Best Camera?: LG G3, Samsung Galaxy S5, HTC One M8, HTC One Mini 2, Nokia Lumia 1520, Nokia Lumia 1020 AND... The Sony Xperia Z2 Compared LG G3 Review: Conclusion The LG G3 is a really quite impressive device and I’ve enjoyed using it. It has one or two odd little quirks which hamper the experience a bit – for me these have been relatively minor gripes which I’ve been able to cope with, but I can imagine them being more irritating for some users. Despite some initial concerns during my first hands-on, I think the software experience is great, as I mentioned, there are parallels to be drawn with HTC devices and it’s really just a pleasant UI to look at and operate. A spoonful of customisation options never hurts, and some added functionality, such as the Dual Screen mode and built-in File Manager are most welcome indeed. I do think the Knock On feature is a bit of a stumbling block though, it just needs better implementation and may annoy more users than it pleases due to its tendency to activate the phone in your pocket. The LG G3 could benefit from more onboard storage, and while the battery life can be quite reasonable, if you’re not super-careful there’s quite a risk of getting caught short. The display, camera and general performance, however, are all superb, as is the design and build. A highly recommendable handset, with a few caveats.

On Wednesday, Google announced it had reviewed some 550 sites since its policy changes, permanently banning nearly 200 published sites and temporarily cutting off another 140 sites from the company ad dollar source, according to Variety. Among the typical culprits was a conspiracy blog that appeared as the first item found for the search “who won the popular vote,” which suggested Donald Trump had won the popular vote. Another was a made-up story about President Barack Obama supposedly seeking a third term. Google has banned 200 publishers in the three months since it passed a new policy against fake news https://t.co/2Qhq3bQNBe— Recode (@Recode) January 25, 2017 Google regularly weeds out advertisers for false and misleading claims, but the search giant has now booted publishers off its ad network for fake news. The company responded to criticism that it supported fake news by changing its Adsense policy, prohibiting sites that “misrepresent, misstate, on conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose” of the site from using Google ads for monetization. An annual report of ad violations shows that Google took down 1.7 billion ads for various policy violations in 2016, including 17 million ads for illegal gambling, 5 million payday loans and 80 million misleading or shocking ads. The company declined to release a list of the banned sites. Facebook also announced it is overhauling its “trending topics” box, as part of its effort to curb fake news. Beginning on Wednesday, its software will track only topics that have been covered by a significant number of credible publishers. “If just one story or post went viral, it wouldn’t make it into the trending as it might previously,” Will Cathcart, a Facebook vice president of product management told the Wall Street Journal. “It really takes a mass of publishers writing about the same topic to make the cut.” Facebook tweaks 'Trending Topics' to fight fake news https://t.co/wnf2fuMdwZpic.twitter.com/ACugTvOVoq— POLITICO (@politico) January 25, 2017 Facebook will take into account how long a publisher has maintained a presence on the social network. The trending feature appears in a box on the right side of the Facebook page. The change, however, will do little to affect what is reflected in users’ newsfeeds.

A ransomware sample that was recently discovered embedded in an Android application on Google Play Store suggests that threat actors may have found a dangerous new way to get extortion malware on mobile devices. The malware, dubbed Charger, is believed to be the first instance of ransomware being successfully uploaded to Google's official mobile application store. So far there have been no reported incidents of similar uploads on Apple’s App Store. Security vendor Check Point software found Charger embedded in an Android batter- saving app called EnergyRescue when inspecting a quarantined device belonging to an employee of one of its enterprise clients. Google has since purged the rogue application from Play Store so it no longer poses a threat to Android users. Still, the incident is a reminder that official mobile app stores, while considered much safer than third-party stores, are not immune from security risks and that enterprise users downloading apps from such stores cannot automatically assume the software will be malware free. In an alert, Check Point described Charger as malware designed to surreptitiously steal SMS messages and contact information from an infected device, lock up the device, and then demand a ransom in return for unlocking it. The extortion note threatened victims that all personal data extracted from their phone would be sold to cybercriminals if they didn't pay a ransom of 0.2 Bitcoin, or around about $180. The note reassured victims that their locked files would be restored after payment was received and warned them that it was futile to power off and restart their phone. "TURNING OFF YOUR PHONE IS MEANINGLESS, ALL YOUR DATA IS ALREADY STORED ON OUR SERVERS! WE STILL CAN SELLING IT FOR SPAM, FAKE, BANK CRIME etc…," the note said. The ransom amount that the authors of Charger want is considerably higher than the $15 ransom demanded by those behind DataLust, another recent and prolific Android ransomware sample that targeted users of porn apps, Check Point security researchers Oren Koriat and Andrey Polkovnichenko wrote. Malware previously uploaded to Google Play typically only contained a dropper for downloading the real payload from elsewhere on victim devices. EnergyRescue, on the other hand, contained all the malicious code for Charger with it, making it bulky and somewhat easy to spot, the researchers said. So in order to compensate, the authors of the malware employed multiple advanced techniques to evade detection, they added. For example, the malware encoded strings into binary arrays making it harder for researchers to inspect them. The malware also dynamically loaded code from encrypted resources, preventing detection engines from inspecting it. Charger also checked to see if it was being run in an emulator before beginning malicious activity. In a statement, a Google spokesman thanked Check Point for noticing the problem and disclosing it. "We've taken the appropriate actions in Play, and will continue to work closely with the research community to help keep Android users safe," the statement noted. Like Apple, Google has implemented a variety of measures over the past several years to prevent people from uploading malicious and potentially harmful apps to Play Store. The company uses a combination of automated and manual inspections and ratings systems to vet applications for security issues before permitting them to be uploaded. Google also has a Google Play App Security Improvement (ASI) program under which it offers guidance to help developers avoid common security pitfalls so their apps cannot be maliciously exploited. Earlier this month, Google claimed that the ASI program has helped about 90,000 Android app developers fix security problems in some 250,000 apps over the past few years. The fact that attackers are still able to upload malware like Charger indicates that even such measures as an ASI are not always enough. "This incident indicates that attackers are getting better in developing and employing advanced evasion techniques that manage to bypass the ever improving security measures," says Daniel Padon, a security researcher at Check Point.   "Users should not rely on official app stores as their sole protection against malware," he says. They should also consider other measures such as threat emulation and detection, he says.

The Charger malware was bundled with an SMS-snooping app called EnergyRescue that pawned itself off as a battery management utility, according to Check Point security researchers. Check Point says it found the malicious app three weeks ago and that since then, Google has removed the offending software from Google Play. The app, researchers said, represents a bold win for cybercriminals peddling ransomware via Google Play. By a large majority, most Android malware is distributed via third-party apps stores. Related Posts Threatpost News Wrap, January 27, 2017 January 27, 2017 , 12:30 pm Google to Block .js Attachments in Gmail January 26, 2017 , 9:53 am Half of Ransomware Victims Pay Criminals’ Demands to Recover Data January 26, 2017 , 7:00 am “Charger could be an indicator of a wider effort by mobile malware developers to catch up with their PC ransomware cousins,” wrote Oren Koriat and Andrey Polkovnichenko, both Check Point security analysts. “EnergyRescue has the largest arsenal of evasion methods we’ve seen to date,” Check Point researchers told Threatpost. According to Koriat and Polkovnichenko, most malware that does manage to make it onto Google Play is malicious adware where cybercriminals profit via ads and app referrals. However, with Charger, the target is the user. The infection path began after downloading the EnergyRescue app which steals the target’s contacts and SMS messages. Next, the app attempts to trick phone owners into granting EnergyRescue admin permissions. “If granted, the ransomware locks the device and displays a message demanding payment,” according to their research report “Charger Malware Calls and Raises the Risk on Google Play.” Payment of 0.2 Bitcoins ($180) is demanded. A rambling ransom note makes a number of different demands and threats. “You need to pay for us, otherwise we will sell portion of your personal information on black market every 30 minutes,” reads the ransom note. Attackers also guarantee “files will be restored” after they receive payment and that they will delete all personal data they have in their possession. “We collect and download all of your personal data. All information about your social networks, Bank accounts, Credit Cards. We collect all data about your friends and family.” Attackers do not encrypt data on the targeted devices, rather the phone is locked – only displaying the ransom note demanding money. “Most malware found on Google Play contains only a dropper that later downloads the real malicious components to the device. Charger, however, uses a heavy packing approach which makes it harder for the malware to stay hidden, so it must compensate with other means,” wrote Koriat and Polkovnichenko. That evasive compensation includes techniques such as encoding strings into binary arrays, making it hard to inspect them. Another tactic includes “loading code from encrypted resources dynamically, which most detection engines cannot penetrate and inspect.” Making it even more difficult to decipher the app’s true intent, code is flooded with meaningless commands that mask the actual commands passing through, according to researchers. Lastly, the malware will stay dormant if it detects being run in an OS emulator. “This means that static analysis engines, such as Bouncer, will not be able to analyze the encrypted parts of the code which contain the malicious activities,” researchers said. Check Point said mobile ransomware is still a relatively new phenomena with most infections taking place via side-loaded apps from third-party app stores. In a brief statement to Threatpost Google stated: “We appreciate Check Point’s efforts to raise awareness about this issue. We’ve taken the appropriate actions in Play, and will continue to work closely with the research community to help keep Android users safe.” Google said apps on Google Play are specifically reviewed for compliance against our Google Play Developer Content Policy and Developer Distribution Agreement, which prevents bad actors from passing off apps impersonating legitimate companies or that exhibit deceptive behavior. On its Android security page it touts: “All Android apps undergo rigorous security testing before appearing in the Google Play Store. We vet every app developer in Google Play and suspend those who violate our policies. So even before you install an app, you know we’ve checked that it’s safe.” Still Google points out it also relies “on the community of users and developers to flag apps for additional review.” Check Point said as far as it’s aware EnergyRescue is the only app that contained the Charger ransomware. “We believe this was only an effort to test the waters by the malware authors, and we expect to see more of it in the future,” said Check Point. On Monday, Check Point disclosed it found a HummingBad variant, known as HummingWhale that was being distributed via 20 camera, music, flashlight and adult apps on Google Play. 0Categories: Malware, Mobile Security Leave A Comment Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Courtesy Seven News. He thought he saw a dark shape nearby, but continued as his father Chris - a lifetime surfer - took photos from the shore. The dark shape also caught the eye of Mr Hasson, a real estate agent, as he stood on rocks at the northern headland. He continued snapping away as Eden rode the wave to the beach and started paddling out again. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link Eden Hasson surfs at Samurai Beach in Port Stephens on January 24, as a shark rolls in the wave behind him. Photo: Chris Hasson Then he zoomed into the photograph and saw it - the head of a 2.5-metre great white shark in the face of a wave, with Eden surfing next to it. He immediately called Eden back to the shore. "Check its mouth," Mr Hasson wrote shortly afterwards on Facebook. "It's rolled over having a good look at his yummy yellow new wetsuit." Advertisement The extraordinary photograph was shot on Tuesday night as Eden and four other surfers were enjoying the last of the waves. Mr Hasson told Fairfax Media that Eden was in the water with his sister Olivia and a friend when a storm approached, prompting Olivia and the friend to paddle to shore. SHARE Share on Facebook SHARE Share on Twitter TWEET Pin to Pinterest PIN Link The picture of the 2.5-metre shark was taken from the shore. Photo: Chris Hasson Five people were left in the water, including the "talented" and "competitive" young surfer. "I took the camera onto the rocks and started taking photos when I noticed a dark shape," Mr Hasson said. "I was just about to call everyone in when Eden took off on the wave in the picture and I took a number of shots. SHARE Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Pin to Pinterest Link Chris Hasson, pictured with Eden, 10, said his son has already been back in the water and sharks must be respected. Photo: Chris Hasson "Eden rode the wave to the beach. I quickly zoomed in on the second photo and was shocked when I saw the image. Eden was halfway out and I called everyone in. I showed them the photo and everyone was in awe, laughing. "One of the surfers said just before the wave a large school of mullet arrived." Eden said he also saw the shape, and felt something beneath the water, but didn't realise it was a great white shark. "When I took off I thought I saw something and when I went to do the first snap off the top I hit something and I thought it was seaweed," he said. "Then when [Dad] called me in I thought it must be a shark because there was a big school of fish." The experience hasn't scared the Hassons or other locals who surf on the Tomaree Peninsula - they have always known they were sharing the water with sharks. "I've always taught the children about respecting the ocean and that sharks are to be respected, not feared," Mr Hasson said. "Eden is not deterred and has already paddled out for a surf the next day. He loves surfing and the ocean. It's only created a greater awareness." Mr Hasson said he has surfed in the area for 30 years and sharks "have always been there, and always will be". "I've seen quite a few in that time and simply paddle in if we see one and regroup for another beach or day," he said. Marine ecologist and shark expert Danny Bucher said he believed the shark may have been startled by Eden. "They will roll after biting into, say, a whale carcass in order to tear off pieces," Dr Bucher said. "Rolling on approach would take the surfer out of the shark's field of vision, so I don't interpret this move as particularly aggressive or predatory. "Quite the opposite, it may have been startled by the rapid approach of the board and has broken the surface in a rapid change of direction away from the surfer."

Google planning AI tools for Pi makers this year Posted Jan 25, 2017 by Natasha Lomas (@riptari) 0 SHARES Next Story Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella is joining the Starbucks board Google is intending to expand the dev tools available to makers using the Raspberry Pi microprocessor to power their projects this year — potentially offering software tools for face- and emotion-recognition, speech-to-text translation, natural language processing, sentiment analysis, predictive analytics and more. The company is currently running a survey for Pi makers asking about the sorts of tools they would like it to develop. You can access the survey via the Raspberry Pi Foundation’s website. “We at Google are interested in creating smart tools for Makers, and want to hear from you about what would be most helpful,” it says in this survey. Tech areas that can be selected during the survey include home automation, drones, IoT, robotics, 3D printing, wearables and machine learning — so the company is casting a pretty wide net here. We’ve reached out to Google and the Pi Foundation with questions and will update this post with any response. Update: Pi co-founder Eben Upton tells TechCrunch: “For me, the big opportunities are around deep learning and AI. Google are very strong in this area, particularly after the DeepMind acquisition, and there are obvious benefits to being able to connect their services to the real world using Raspberry Pi. It will be interesting to see the outcome of the survey, and what they choose to develop in response.” The UK-based not-for-profit Pi Foundation has been wildly successful with its low cost microprocessors, passing more than 10 million sales back in September — four and a half years after its initial release, when it had expected to sell just a few thousand over the lifetime of the board. There are a wealth of existing dev tools for Pi makers to make use of, and ways to tap into — for example — the OpenCV computer vision library to build projects utilizing facial recognition. But Google bringing a set of its own AI tools to the platform could accelerate development on that front by enabling Pi users to more easily tap into, for example, the TensorFlow machine learning open source library which was originally developed by researchers at the company. Google has had a long term interest in the Pi, gifting $1M worth of the microprocessors to 15,000 UK schoolkids back in 2013, for example, via its philanthropic arm — with its ongoing business needs obviously aligning with the Foundation’s core mission to encourage more youngsters to take up coding. It’s also previously developed an open source tool for turning a Pi into a basic web server. And Google’s Android Things IoT platform includes support for the Pi 3, the current most powerful Pi. And while there is currently no official version of Android for the Pi, although there are ways to run the platform on Pi hardware (albeit with some limitations), there are signs Google is working on the real deal there too. On this prospect, Upton adds: “No news on ‘official’ Android at present: we remain very focused on PIXEL and Raspbian as our in-house software platform.” A Google spokesperson said the company does not have any specific details to share regarding its plans for Pi dev tools at this point, adding: “We’re excited to keep sharing more open source machine learning tools with the community — stay tuned for more this year.” 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Google Founded 1998 Overview Google is a multinational corporation that is specialized in internet-related services and products.

Sign up now close ​No free lunch with free Android VPN apps, CSIRO finds Liam Tung (CSO Online) on 26 January, 2017 10:37 0 - - - - print email If you installed a free Android VPN app to view geo-blocked content on your phone, there’s a high chance it was harboring malware, according to new research. A VPN, or virtual private network, on your PC should provide additional security and privacy by tunneling encrypted traffic between your device and an intermediary server that connects to the website you want to reach. Outsiders who want to track you on the web would merely see the server of your VPN provider. This can boost security, assuming your VPN provider is trustworthy. However, many Android apps that promote VPN functionality on Google's Play Store don't live up to their promise, according to research by computer scientists at UNSW, the University of California Berkeley, and Data 61, a research unit in Australia’s CSIRO that announced the research on Tuesday. Not only this, many of these apps also contain malware. The project looked at 293 Android VPN apps and found that 75 percent contained an ad-tracking modules. Additionally, 38 percent probably contained malware, as defined by the Google’s crowd-sourced malware classification service, VirusTotal. All of these apps had at least a four-star rating on Google Play, suggesting an app’s reputation isn’t necessarily a great indicator for the security of apps. “We analyze the public user reviews available on Google Play for all the VPN apps to sense whether their users are aware of possible malicious activities in their apps. Our analysis reveals that only a marginal number of VPN users have publicly raised any security and privacy concerns in their app reviews. The researchers however singled out a subset of 4 percent of analysed malware that, based on VirusTotal ratings, were most likely either adware or a trojan. These included OkVPN, EasyVPN, SuperVPN, Betternet, CrossVPN, Archie VPN, Hat VPN, sFly Network Booster, OneClick VPN, and Fast Secure Payment. The research also found that 16 percent of the apps were likely to have forwarded traffic through other users rather than through a cloud-hosted server maintained by the provider. It also notes that “18% of the apps do not mention the entity hosting the terminating VPN server.” The same proportion implemented ran the VPN service without encryption, which was worse when looking at IPv6 traffic. “Approximately 84% and 66% of the analyzed VPN apps do not tunnel IPv6 and DNS traffic through the tunnel interface respectively due to lack of IPv6 support, misconfigurations or developer-induced errors. Both the lack of strong encryption and traffic leakages can ease online tracking activities performed by in-path middleboxes (e.g., commercial WiFi access points harvesting user’s data) and by surveillance agencies.” Though VPN apps are a fraction of the 1.4 million Android apps available on Google Play at the time of the study, 16 percent of the VPN apps were downloaded by at least one millions users. Read more ​Android HummingBad malware returns to Google Play All the VPNs apps request a service on Android called BIND_VPN_SERVICE, which utilizes a VPN feature Google built into its mobile OS in 2011. While the service can be employed to help users stay anonymous online, it can also be abused to harvest private information from mobile devices. The researchers note the Android VPN service coincided with a 10-fold increase in the adoption of the functionality over the following two years. ___________________________________________________________________________________ Sorting out your calendar for the year?

However, Chrome 56 is introducing a new timer to help throttle background pages. The intent of these timers is to improve battery life and overall browser performance. How will these timers work? First, each WebView will have a budget for running timers in the background. Once the timer starts, its run time is subtracted from the budget, however, it is important to note that the timer is only able to run if the budget is non-negative. Last, the budget will regenerate at a rate of 0.01 seconds per second. The only pages without an allocated time budget are ones that play audio. Google developers hope that the timers will help users switch seamlessly between web pages while cutting down on excessive background CPU usage. This is not the first time Google has tried to tackle Chrome’s power consumption. This past October, developers began to optimize Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine so that its parser and compilers made better use of memory, particularly on mobile devices. At the time they were able to reduce peak zone memory consumption by 40 percent. Chrome 55 officially launched this past December and also finally made a major step forward in deprecating support for the much despised Adobe Flash. Some web developers, however, are concerned about Chrome’s new timer. BitMEX.com’s Samuel Reed argued that web application timers may be delayed by a couple of minutes and affect applications like Slack and Discord. He also contended that background applications can be quite useful and often aid in syncing data and reading delta streams. Another web developer questioned whether some affected sites and services would attempt to skirt around the timers. He argued that some of these sites could try to add in inaudible audio file loops in order to avoid throttling. Chrome 56 is currently available in beta. The stable version was supposed to be released this month, however, there is no official release date at the moment.

It is an intelligent computer operating system, a variance of AI envisioned by the high technology developers of today. We are still far away from creating AI capable of thinking and learning for themselves, not to mention living in symbiosis with them. However, Intelligent Virtual Assistants can be perceived as a step towards the fulfillment of the idea. What are Intelligent Virtual Assistants? How can they assist us? What benefits can they bring to their users and what's contributing to their increasing popularity? The industry's top executives have been asking themselves these questions, and there were a lot of ongoing conversations on the subject in 2016. Virtual Digital Assistants (VDAs) Alexa, Google, Cortana, and Siri are the names you've probably already heard of. The current "fantastic four" when it comes to voice-activated digital assistance. These platforms or applications are able to assist their human users because they understand natural language in spoken or written form. VDAs are activated by voice and powered by artificial intelligence algorithms, and major tech companies are putting them into multiple products. What they want is to (potentially) add sources of revenues by tangling us further in their tech ecosystems. The capabilities of virtual assistants used to be pretty much limited, as they lived "inside their own bubbles". For example, Siri was mostly cut off from other apps, but it could gather info from Rotten Tomatoes, Yelp, and other external services. Google couldn't interact directly with third-party services and apps but could deliver search results from the open web. Over the years, they have been improved to become better at connecting. Some Windows apps now support Cortana voice commands; Amazon's Alexa got a "Skills kit" almost two years ago, which lets developers personalize their voice commands; Google also opened its Assistant to developers, while Siri began to work with a handful of third-party apps in iOS 10. The "Fantastic Four" The most obvious thing is that the future lies in the machine's ability to recognize and process speech. It will be an integral part of the Internet of Things world, from home automation to wearables and connected cars. However, even though they are the current leaders in the world of digital virtual assistance, they all don't work the same way. Apple Siri – Siri has smart home controls but supported only for devices in the HomeKit ecosystem. On the other hand, it supports a lot of uses, such as messaging, video and audio calling, photo search, workouts, payments, and ride booking. The flow of conversation is controlled by Apple, which limits users' options and Siri's responses. Google – Google shares the Apple's vision of playing a gatekeeper role. They decide about the specific keywords that'll be used for activating a specific third-party service. The developer takes control of the interaction once an approved keyword is spoken by using API.ai (or other AI tools) to carry a conversation out. Microsoft – Now, Microsoft's future plans for virtual assistant development are somewhat hazier. Cortana does work with third-party apps in Windows 10, but a system for non-Windows devices won't be launched until this February. Microsoft mentions that Cortana will be able to present skills to users proactively, in the appropriate context (perhaps to offer additional info in the middle of a conversation). Amazon Alexa – Amazon was the up-and-comer in 2016, with millions of Alexa devices sold worldwide and sales of their Echo devices increased ninefold over the year. The system includes to-do lists and smart home controls, but it doesn't seem that its developers are going to stop soon. More capabilities are added to Alexa each week, like checking sports scores, hearing the local weather forecast, calling for an Uber, ordering a pizza from Dominos, or finding some cocktail and food recipes. The Growing Market It's simple — if machine voice interaction starts being used for so many different purposes, then there will be a huge demand for it. When there's enough demand, any market is "sentenced" to expansion. Business-wise, investing in an AI-focused customer care system can definitely provide your company a competitive advantage, and the recent evolution of VDA systems gives us proof. Besides the virtual assistant developer giants, certain specialized VDAs have been emerging, especially in the business world, such as virtual receptionist assistants. According to eMarketer, 31% of 14-17 year-olds and 23% of 18-34 year-olds use a VDA on a regular basis. On the other hand, GIA (Global Industry Analysts) expects an expansion of the global market for multi-touch screens driven by a combination of smart computing devices and mobile computing. The market will, according to their research, reach $8 billion by 2020 from $3.5 billion in 2013. Should VDA adoption take off, we could see slower growth for the touch-based interface market. VDAs aren't just used on devices like Google Home and Amazon Echo and smartphones. According to Tractica's recent report, even though the best-known offerings right now are smartphone-based consumer virtual digital assistants, VA technologies are beginning to emerge. They are more and more implemented in PCs, automobiles, fitness trackers, smart watches, and other device types. By Nate Vickery, Consultant. More blog posts from Nate Vickery can also be read here.

How To Transfer Files To & From Your NVIDIA SHIELD 2017 More Chromebooks Coming with USB-C Charging January 25, 2017 - Written By Alexander Maxham Google and their partners have already announced a slew of new Chromebooks with USB-C charging in 2017 (and a few in 2016). You’re going to see plenty more coming in the pipeline, as Google is wanting all Chromebooks to use USB-C for charging. As the company explained in their blog post on Tuesday, many schools and even classrooms have different Chromebooks. And with most Chromebooks having different proprietary chargers (like traditional laptops), it makes it harder to charge students’ Chromebooks, especially when not everyone in the classroom has the same one. That issue is gone with USB-C though. Google is focusing on Education right now with Chromebooks, and USB-C has a whole bunch of advantages over proprietary chargers. The big one being the fact that all Chromebooks can use the same cable for charging. Another is the fact that it is reversible. So no matter how the child attempts to plug in their Chromebook, it’ll just work. Unlikes with micro USB and even USB-A. Which is pretty important in a education setting. On top of all Chromebooks having USB-C for charging, they are also working on super-fast charging over USB-C for all Chromebooks. So that Chromebook carts can quickly charge any Chromebook, no matter who the manufacturer was. This way students can use their Chromebooks longer, without needing to be plugged in. On top of this, all Chromebooks released in 2017 will feature Android Apps through the Google Play Store. Now this isn’t a huge surprise, given the fact that Google did announce the Google Play Store for Chrome OS last summer at Google I/O. But it was only available for a handful of Chromebooks, and the roll out to older Chromebooks has been quite slow. Luckily all new Chromebooks will get it out of the box. Including the Samsung Chromebook Pro and ASUS Chromebook Flip C302 that was announced at CES 2017 earlier this month. Things are really starting to look up for the Chromebook world. Google and their partners are announcing more and better Chromebooks, and also making them a bit more powerful and high-end, which is also important for anyone looking to switch from a PC or Mac to Chrome OS.

Today, those limitations have apparently been lifted, with access for publishing Daydream apps available to all Android developers.  On a webpage posted to the official Google Developers website, Google highlights the steps necessary to take in order to create good VR applications (it’s a long list), plus the process of getting them published onto Google Play. Most importantly, Google reminds all developers that, “you must opt-in to Daydream from the Pricing and Distribution section of the Developer Console.” If you happen to develop apps for Android and have been waiting to get your feet wet in the world of virtual reality, have at it!

Google holds an annual conference for developers, engineers, executives, and the media -- so that it can discuss all-things Google and Android-related. Developers and engineers use information from this show to get their apps and products up to date with Google's latest innovation, while the rest of us drool and look forward to what's coming in the months ahead. It's early days still, but we already have an inkling of what to expect. Now that the dates have been confirmed, we're updating this guide to keep you informed of all the latest news, announcements, and rumours. We will also continue to update as Google I/O gets closer, so keep checking back. When is Google I/O 2017? Google I/O 2017 will take place between 17 May 2017 and 19 May 2017 at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California. Google I/O 2017 developer event will be held on 17-19 May Yep, it's true: I/O'17 will be at Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, CA on May 17-19. See you in 110 days :) #io17 pic.twitter.com/vVlvx1N5mJ — sundarpichai (@sundarpichai) January 26, 2017 How much are Google I/O 2017 tickets? Google hasn't announced how much tickets are or when they will go on sale. Last year, it did a lottery system, meaning anyone could apply to get tickets, but only a few were accepted. In order to register, you needed to go to the Google I/O website during the registration period, sign in with your Google account, and have your credit card details ready. General admission tickets were priced at $900, while academic tickets were $300. Where can you stream Google I/O 2017? Google live-streamed last year's keynote, which you can playback here, so we expect it do the same for this year's I/O keynote. We will update this page with a link to the live stream if and when it becomes available. What can you expect from Google I/O 2017? Google's I/O webpage has yet to be updated with a countdown clock or a full schedule. However, based on last year's main topics covered at the conference, as well as the company's patterns and various industry rumours, here's what we expect to see at Google I/O 2017: Android O Pocket-lint Google usually uses Google I/O to tease improvements to Android. Last year, it talked about the split-screen mode, ability to reply to texts from notifications, and an update to the Doze batter saver. It also teased Android N. Google will more than likely mention the next version of Android at this year's show, so expect to hear something about Android O/8.0. Any guesses as to what the final, dessert-themed name will be? Android Wear Pocket-lint Google unveiled Android Wear 2.0 last year, and it hasn't even released yet. We're now expecting it to launch in early February, followed by a few new Android Wear devices, including two LG-made watches from Google. We think Google might take time to discuss the roll out of Android Wear 2.0 at this year's show, or it might even announce new features. Either way, it'll at least mention its OS for wearables. Daydream VR Pocket-lint At Google I/O 2016, Google showed us it was interested in going beyond Google Cardboard by introducing a new mobile, approachable to virtual reality in the form of Google Daydream. Since then, we've seen Google introduce a Daydream VR headset, Pixel phones with Daydream support, and other manufacturers add support for Daydream. We're hoping to see more hardware and software announcements. Oh, keep in mind Google is rumoured to be developing a high-end VR headset along the lines of HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. Unlike the Daydream View, it would be an all-in-one experience that doesn't require a phone. Also, on 26 January, HTC's design lead announced that he joined the Google Daydream platform. Claude Zellweger, according to his Twitter, is the maker of the HTC Vive VR headset and HTC 10.  We suspect more leaks in the coming months if Zellweger is indeed working on the secretive project. Chrome OS Pocket-lint Chrome OS now works with full Android apps. And, recently, a few new Chromebooks have been announced. Other than that, the Chrome OS space has been pretty quiet. Google has of course denied the rumours of a full OS merger between Chrome and Android, but maybe Google will use Google I/O 2017 to announce new features coming to the operating system or new Chromebooks and Chrome OS devices in the pipeline. Android Auto Android Auto is Google's attempt at getting Android into vehicles. We will likely see more manufacturers announce new car models compatible with Google's system, but it would be nice to see Google executives discuss new innovations for the platform as well. In 2015, Waze (which is part of Alphabet) executives suggested the intelligent navigation system could be added to Android Auto. Maybe we'll hear more on that? Pretty please? Google Assistant Pocket-lint Last year, Sundar Pichai, Google's CEO, talked a lot about machine-learning advances and artificial intelligence, as well as how they benefit its new Google Assistant. The service is an extension of Google Now. With it, you can ask conversational questions using the "OK Google" command. In the past 12 months, it has been added to the Google Home speaker, Allo chat app, and Pixel flagships. We're betting it'll be updated. Google Home Pocket-lint Speaking of Google Home, Google unveiled the voice-activated speaker at Google I/O 2016, but it's only been available for a few months now, letting you manage everyday tasks, ask questions, control select connected devices, and more. We're not expecting Google Home 2.0 to debut at this year's show, but maybe Google will announce new features and integrations. It might even copy Amazon and do a Dot-like version. Google Allo Pocket-lint Google unveiled its Allo messenger app at Google I/O 2016, though it hasn't done much with it since. The app is able to create smart replies you can use, and it can decipher information from photos to help provide a relevant response, and it even includes a limited version of Google Assistant. It'd be interesting to see the app offer a full-fledged version of Assistant, or at least add more cool tricks. Google Duo Pocket-lint Google also unveiled about Duo at I/O 2016. It's a one-to-one video calling app that works on both Android and iOS. Like Allo, it hasn't made a big impact since launch. Google might use this year's conference to discuss the latest on the app, and perhaps address its confusing approach to messaging/calling. So far, it offers Duo, Allo, Hangouts, and Google Voice. Google could try to combine Duo with Hangouts. Project Tango Lenovo Augmented reality was hot last summer, and it's expected to continue being popular. Keep in mind Google has long been working on Project Tango tech, which uses motion-tracking and depth sensing to build a 3D world onto physical surroundings, and at CES 2017, many manufacturers made announcements about AR devices, apps, and accessories. We therefore expect to hear more about Project Tango. Project Fi Google Google's cross-carrier network, Project Fi, which automatically switches carriers in order to provide more reliable access to mobile data, is now available for Pixel, Nexus ,and a few other devices. At Google I/O 2017, Google may announce more compatible devices. Is that it? Yep. Google's self-driving car project as been spun into a standalone business known as Waymo. At Google I/O 2017, we could learn some more details about what’s next, but we wouldn't count on it. Also, Google has reportedly suspended all plans to launch a Project Ara modular smartphone. The interchangeable phone concept has been shelved to streamline the company's hardware strategy, it is claimed.  Sections Google Apps 7 best encrypted messaging apps for all the Edward Snowdens out there Yo is an actual at-home male fertility test you just use with your phone Google I/O 2017: When is it, where to watch, and what to expect Snapchat adds universal search: Here's how it lets you quickly find friends...

 What to expect from Alphabet's Q4 earnings: Pay attention to those 'other' bets Steve Kovach Jan. 26, 2017, 9:41 AM 6,991 facebook linkedin twitter email print Alphabet CEO Larry Page.AP Google's parent company Alphabet will announce its fourth quarter earnings on Thursday afternoon. Here's what you need to know, starting with Wall Street's expectations, according to analyst estimates compiled by Yahoo Finance: Revenue: $25.2 billion, up 18% year-on-year. EPS (adjusted): $9.67 Besides the numbers, here's what else you should be looking for in Alphabet's earnings report: Hardware Last quarter's results will represent the first time Google significantly ramped up its hardware efforts. Its first-ever phone, the Google Pixel, launched to universally positive reviews, but has struggled to meet demand. Google also released Google Home, a capable Amazon Echo competitor, and Daydream View, a virtual reality headset for the Pixel and a small number of other Android phones. That was just the first step in Google's ambition to become a hardware company and to bring order to the fragmented world of mobile devices using different versions of its Android software. It's very similar to Microsoft's Surface program. Google does not break out sales figures for its hardware business (hardware revenue is lumped into the "Other Revenues" line item, which includes everything from app store sales to corporate cloud business contributions). But as the hardware effort starts to gain momentum, Google may provide more details about the sales of its growing catalog of devices. The Google Pixel.Hollis Johnson/Business Insider Other bets This is the big story at Alphabet. Outside of the core Google business are Alphabet's "Other Bets," the separate companies exploring ambitious new businesses, from self-driving cars to drones. There has been a lot of turmoil throughout the Other Bets companies in recent months as Alphabet shutters or rejiggers some of the projects and attempts to keep costs in line.  Alphabet's Other Bets reported $197 million in revenue and an operating loss of $840 million during the third quarter last year. Investors will be looking for signs of progress in some of these businesses, as well as an update from Alphabet on its commitment and broader strategy for these Other Bets in the wake of the all the recent changes. To recap: Google Fiber's CEO stepped down and the company has ended its expansion plans to provide high-speed internet to new cities. There has even been speculation that Alphabet might try to sell its Google Fiber business to a traditional internet service provider.  The head of Project Wing, the drone delivery effort from Alphabet's X "moonshot" division, also stepped down. Later, some members of Project Wing were either laid off or moved to other projects. A Titan Aerospace drone.Titan Aerospace We also learned that X canceled Titan, the solar-powered internet-beaming drone, some time last year. Some Titan staffers are now working on Project Loon, the X project that wants to use high-altitude balloons to beam high-speed internet to earth. Finally, Alphabet is said to be exploring a sale of Skybox, a satellite imaging company it bought about three years ago for $500 million, according to Bloomberg. Alphabet has lost several other top executives from its other bets companies over the last year. But it wasn't all bad news. In December, Alphabet's self-driving car project spun out of X into its own company called Waymo. Waymo's goal is to partner with car companies and provide them with the technology needed for self-driving cars. It already has a deal with Chrysler.

The European Commission believes there are competition concerns involved with combining personal data from multiple sources to deliver more personalized ads. In June, a line was added to Google’s privacy policy reading: ”Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.” Previously, Google stated it would not combine data from its DoubleClick ad network with data from Google user profiles — such as search history, YouTube viewing history, and so on. Google announced a change to that policy in June, which went into effect in October. Oracle, which coined the phrase “Super Profiles”, tells the Wall Street Journal no other ad platform is able to efficiently compete when Google has access to so much data. A crucial point being left out is that existing users have to opt-in to the new policy. However, new users are being opted in to the policy by default. Google doesn’t mince words when responding with its thoughts on Oracle’s complaints: “Oracle claims to be the world’s largest audience data marketplace, so it knows how competitive digital advertising is. Its complaints, and those of its proxies, are frivolous.” Google users can check if they’re opted-in to the new advertising policy by visiting the My Activity page, then navigating to Activity Controls. From there, users can decide how much of their personal activity data is being collected.

If not, I’ll try to catch you up because a new version is incoming. Contributor was a service that allowed you to pay a flat monthly fee (up to $15) to Google to get rid of some ads on some (or all) of the sites you visited across the web. The thought was that internet ads are terrible and spammy and everywhere these days as websites (like this one) try to continue to provide free content and still make a living. Contributor would take the fee you paid and then distribute it around to websites you visit, while also showing friendly placeholders in ad spots.  It was a decent idea, assuming you could get enough people to pay for an ad-free experience on the web and still support publishers you enjoy. Unfortunately, Contributor never caught on or publishers weren’t making enough money or Google found some other flaw in the system, so they killed it. Well, they killed that original form. To learn more about how the original Contributor worked, you can read this full guide we put together. In somewhat good news, though, we are expecting a new Contributor to arrive at some point in the near future. Google’s Contributor site (here) now just shows a placeholder talking about a “new and improved” version that will be here some time in early 2017. It also includes a sign-up link to be notified when that time comes. What could they change? I honestly don’t know. I’m certainly interested as both a consumer of loads of online news and a publisher who would love to give readers an ad-free experience. Post navigation Previous StoryPresident Donald Trump Still Uses an “Old, Unsecured Android Phone” Next StoryGoogle Opens Up Daydream App Development to All SA_NYC I work for an advertising technology company so I know a lot about this stuff. I think the Contributor program is a great attempt (I was going to say idea, but this concept has been bandied about for so long it’s hard to call it that at this point) to essentially share the subscription model across multiple digital publishers. I hope it catches on. I’m going to sign up, even though it runs contrary to what I do for work. And on the subject of ad blocking, I totally get why people would be into it — really, who wouldn’t from a pure experience perspective?. But the reality is that most people who use blockers don’t take the time to exempt sites (like this one) that are respectful with their advertising. As a result, sites like this don’t get paid. And we all know what eventually happens to products that people don’t pay for. One last point on Adblock Plus specifically: they’re really less about user experience and more like a mafia protection racket. They may have started out idealistic, but now as an advertising provider you can simply pay them to exempt your ads. They shake you down for a a massive vig, in the range of 35%. And you need to meet some minimal standards for non-invasiveness in your ads, but the standards are indeed minimal and from what I’ve heard they’ll even look the other way on that if there’s enough $$ on the table. So that’s something ABP users should consider. Tim Buchanan Straight up, DL, thank you for keeping your website looking so clean. Other Android blogs (even ones that claim “Authority”) are ad swamps. JRUIV I count 7 different ads on this page :/ stolzyboy As do I, on a mobile device, so not too sure what ad free experience DL is talking about. JRUIV supposedly it was google ads free when you paid the $15 a year… Ilya Kolodiychik Chrome + AbBlock Plus and I have 2 ads, but they are non-invasive. JRUIV Yes, I’m using adblock on desktop and there is only 1 ad. I only turned it off to verify how many ads i’d see Good_Ole_Pinocchio That’s not the point. Are those Ads intrusive? Are they blocking content? Jessica Durden 9 for me, but non intrusive SA_NYC Yeah, true. D.J. Marcolesco Wrap this in with YouTube Red and I’m all in. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Stop being cheap.

Here are the first few things you need to do January 25 GOOG: 835.67 11.80 Review: The Nvidia Shield TV is essentially the perfect set top box, and it’s only going to get better [Video] Ben Schoon - Jan. 25th 2017 2:54 pm PT @NexusBen Feature Android Android TV Nvidia Shield TV Nvidia View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit As more and more people cut cable, the battle for the home entertainment center has only become more and more intense. There are dozens of great options from the Roku, to the latest Apple TV, and even Google’s Chromecast streaming stick. However, the Chromecast isn’t Google’s only entry into this market. Android TV has been around for a few years now, but it’s never really caught on despite offering what is, at least in my opinion, the best looking TV interface available today. Part of the reason for that has been lack of content, another part, the lack of compelling hardware. The new Nvidia Shield fixes both of those issues. Hardware | Seriously It’s So Small At a glance, the new Nvidia Shield TV looks just like the previous version, until you get a little closer. As I noted in our hands-on from CES, the new Shield TV is small. Really small. Considering the specs inside of this machine, it’s actually quite impressive just how tiny this device is. Going around the Shield, you’ll find the polygon design on top with the signature Nvidia green LED, and a non-slip texture coating the bottom of the device. The Shield is designed to be lying down on a table, but you can still stand it up vertically as I did, you just lose that grip unless you buy the $20 stand. Ports Around the back, the standard Shield has an assortment of ports including the power port, full-size HDMI, two USB 3.0 ports, and an ethernet port capable of gigabit speeds. On the larger Shield Pro, which is the same size as 2015’s Shield TV, you’ll get the addition of a microUSB port and a microSD card slot. It would’ve been nice, though, if the Shield had included an HDMI cable in the box. Granted, all you need for most TVs is a cable capable of 4K which can be picked up for as little as a few dollars. The actual build of the Shield isn’t all that impressive, being nothing more than a slab of matte and glossy plastic. However, it does look great sitting next to a TV, especially when it’s standing up vertically. Peripherals | The hardware of the Shield, though, is probably the least important aspect. What you’ll be holding every day while using the Shield is one of two items — the Shield Controller or Shield Remote. Shield Controller For the 2017 reboot, Nvidia has introduced a brand new Shield Controller which is leaps and bounds better than the company’s previous controller. Not only is this new model more ergonomic, but it’s also better looking and easier to use. Plus, it’s rechargeable via microUSB which is appreciated. Personally, I don’t game on controllers much, but I adjusted from my usual Steam Controller to the Shield’s Controller quickly and found myself preferring the ergonomics of Nvidia’s option. My sole complaint on this controller, though, was the placement of the navigation buttons. While I love that I can control the entire experience, including the volume, through the game controller, I didn’t at all enjoy the fact that the buttons were in my way while playing certain games, constantly causing me to pull up the homescreen while I was playing. Shield Remote Included in the box with the new Shield as opposed to being a $50 add-on is the Shield Remote. There’s not a whole lot to say about it except that on this new model it supports IR input for most major TV manufacturers, has a new volume control strip on the lower half, and no longer features a rechargeable battery. Nvidia claims that the remote will last about a year on the included batteries, but I would’ve prefered a simple microUSB port for charging. The buttons on the Shield Remote are also fairly tactile and well laid out, but the thinness of this remote is more of a curse than it is a blessing. The sharp edges of the design on this remote don’t lend the device to a very comfortable feel in the hand, and I constantly found myself moving it around to get a good grip. Android TV & Streaming | While the main aspect of the Shield is gaming, which yes, we’re getting to, entertainment in general is just as important. The Shield TV runs on top of Google’s Android TV platform which has remained my favorite smart TV platform since its debut. The clean interface is a pleasure to use, and everything is laid out well for easy navigation. On the homescreen, users will find a row of recommended content including games, TV shows, movies, and more, with their apps and games directly below. Going down a bit further you’ll find various settings as well. Realistically speaking, Android TV hasn’t changed much since it’s debut a few years ago, but that’s not a bad thing — it’s a great OS, especially on Nougat which includes features like multitasking, a revamped settings menu, support for multiple accounts, and more. However, the OS isn’t the most important thing when it comes to home entertainment, it’s the apps. This is where Android TV has always fallen a bit short, but the Shield TV helps in this area. Not only does it come with Google’s apps and giants like Netflix, Hulu, and Sling, but it also has access to hundreds of Android TV apps in the Google Play Store. The app gap for Android TV is getting smaller all the time, but there’s one big player left out, Amazon Video. Well, not anymore. Amazon Video is on the Shield TV, and that’s a big deal Nvidia has worked out a deal with Amazon to bring the company’s Instant Video service to an Android TV set top box for the first time. This opens the door to even more fantastic content, including 4K movies and TV shows like one of my personal favorites, The Grand Tour. The Shield, of course, also features full support for 4K content via Amazon Video, Netflix, VUDU, and other apps available via the Play Store. Further, the Shield is the first Android TV box to support HDR, further future proofing the device. Amazon Video, and all of the other streaming services I used on the Shield, also worked perfectly even when pushing 4K HDR. At this point, you can’t go wrong with most streaming boxes for a home entertainment setup, but with the addition of Amazon Video, the Shield takes one big step forward compared to other Android TV options that are available today and keeps it up there with competitors like the Roku and Apple’s own set top box. Gaming | Where the Shield really shines, though, is in gaming. Nvidia isn’t shy about how game-orientented the Shield is, and for good reason. The company’s powerful Tegra X1 chipset is more than capable of running high quality games via Android that match that of some previous generation consoles. That’s something other set top boxes can’t handle. To put the power of the Shield in perspective a bit, the Tegra X1 not only powers Google’s Pixel C tablet, but also Nintendo’s upcoming Switch console. The chipset has more than enough power to push 4K HDR video content, as well as Android games. Nvidia does take things a step further, though, with two extra services. The first is GameStream which takes advantage of your local network and your Nvidia-powered PC, if you happen to have one. Personally, I run a Windows 10 gaming rig which is powered by a GTX 1060. With everything hooked up via Ethernet, I had no performance issues streaming games from my PC to the Shield, and things even ran smoothly over a wifi connection. GeForce Now However, since not everyone has access to a gaming PC, Nvidia has an alternative. For about $8 a month, the company will open up access to its GeForce Now streaming service which essentially brings the power of the company’s epic GTX 1080 graphics card and crams it into the Shield. GeForce Now has a library of PC games which includes popular, high quality titles like Tomb Raider, Batman: Arkham Orgins, The Witcher 3, ABZU, No Man’s Sky, and many more. Those titles are available to stream directly on the Shield and as long as you have a solid internet connection, you’ll never notice you’re streaming the game. During my testing, I tried an assortment of games with GeForce Now which included graphic intensive options like ABZU all the way down to fairly basic games, like those from the LEGO collection. Regardless of the title, the results were smooth, fun gameplay that rarely brought any issues. I can easily say that if you’re not looking to drop hundreds on a gaming PC or console, the Shield TV is a viable replacement in just about every way. Just keep in mind you’ll be paying a monthly fee for access to GeForce Now, as well as the upfront cost of many of the games. Granted, over 70 are included with your subscription. Final Thoughts & What’s Coming | For now, that’s pretty much all there is to say about the Shield TV. After using the device I can say without a doubt it’s the best Android TV box money can buy, but it also might be the best set top box on the market today. Not only does it offer one of the most cost-effective gaming experiences available, but it also offers all of the major streaming services all in one clean, easy-to-use software experience that is also very affordable at just $199. However, the fun doesn’t stop there. In the coming months, Google will be bringing Google Assistant to all Android TV devices, including the Shield. However, on the Shield, Assistant gets a boost. First of all, the game controller will act as a medium for always-listening support, essentially turning the Shield into a Google Home on the big screen. Assistant on Android TV works as you’d expect, enabling searches, home control, and the ability to search for, play, and control your media. Further, Nvidia will be offering the “Spot” once Google Assistant integration is available. The Spot is a $50 device which plugs into your outlet and extends the reach of that always-listening support anywhere in your Home. Needless to say, we can’t wait for this to debut. What’s more, Nvidia also has plans to turn the Shield into a hub for Samsung SmartThings in the coming months. Considering the fact that the Shield costs just $199 and does the job of devices worth hundreds more, this is not only a smart buy as a streaming box, but it’s also potentially the best smart home hub money can buy. However, that’s all to come, but you can be sure we’ll be talking about the Shield yet again once all of this is available… Where To Buy | Amazon Best Buy Nvidia Guides Android Breaking news for Android.

One way to remedy many issues is to do a Factory data reset. While this definitely shouldn’t be your first course of action when having trouble with your phone (be sure to check our Android Basics guide for that!), it’s a good last-resort if you think you might need to send your phone in for repair. Sometimes your problem could be as simple as a software glitch… How to perform a Factory data reset The gist of the process is pretty simple, but if you haven’t done it before, you might not be aware: Open the “Settings” app. Scroll down to the “Personal” section Below that, you’ll find the option “Backup & reset”. Tap it. Tap “Factory data reset”. Tap “RESET PHONE” after reading the disclaimer Enter your password or PIN if you have one Be careful when doing this, because if you didn’t already know, this method completely wipes your phone’s storage. Everything that is physically on the device, except the things that are also stored on various services such as Google Photos or Gmail, will be deleted. This means that you probably want to back up your photos or media before going through with the reset. Once you have entered your PIN or password, your phone will reset itself, and you will be prompted with the normal setup process upon reboot. How to back up Google Pixel data to Google Drive The easiest way to back up your device before doing a factory data reset is to use the built Google Drive backup tools. This might not back up everything on your phone (since it’s very possible that you could have data or information within third-party apps that Google Drive won’t be able to touch). You can access this section of the Settings app using a similar process: Open the “Settings” app. Scroll down to the “Personal” section Below that, you’ll find the option “Backup & reset”. Tap it. Tap “Backup” Enable Google Drive backup if it isn’t already On this page you’ll be able to find the content on your phone that’s backed up to Google Drive. This includes Apps, Call history, Device settings, Google Calendar, Google Contacts, Photos & videos, and SMS messages. You can also change the Google account that you want to use for backups from this page by tapping “Backup account”. You can manage backups from the Google Drive app. Guides Android Basics View THe Guide Google Pixel View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Now dont let a "one size fits all" marketing approach prevent you from meaningfully connecting with them. Klaviyo's email personalization & automation platform puts your data to work for more money. Sign up Now. Google on Wednesday said it removed 1.7 billion bad advertisements from its various sites in 2016, more than double the prior year's totals. Google took several steps to crack down on the deceptive advertising, including updating its policies to protect users from "misleading and predatory offers." It also beefed up its technology to help identify misleading ads and remove them, according to Scott Spencer, Google's director of product management, sustainable ads. A free and open Web is a vital resource for individuals and businesses around the world, and advertising plays a role in making sure users have access to accurate, quality online information, he noted. Bad ads can ruin that experience for customers, Spencer warned. "Ultimately bad ads pose a threat to users, Google partners and the sustainability of the open Web itself." Industry Crisis Bad ads have been a big headache for Google and a host of other social media sites and search engines, because they erode the trust they have with their customers and advertisers. "For [Google], Facebook, and a host of others, it's an ongoing issue," said Rick Edmonds, media business analyst at Poynter. "Advertisers are justly upset if lots of the impressions for which they are charged are fraudulent or served to computer bots rather than potential human customers," he told the E-Commerce Times. Among specific changes Google instituted was a ban on advertising certain types of loan offers. Starting last July, it prohibited ads for loans that would come due within 60 days. Within the U.S., it banned ads on loan with an APR of more than 36 percent. Both restrictions were part of an overall crackdown on deceptive payday lending practices. The company has disabled more than 5 million payday loan ads in the six months since the ban began, according to Spencer. Google also enhanced its technology to crack down on "trick to click'' ads that often appear as system warnings and deceive users into downloading malware. The company detected and disabled more than 112 million of those ads -- six times more than the year before. As part of a crackdown on advertising for illegal pharmaceuticals, Google axed 68 million healthcare ads for violations -- up from 12 million a year ago. The firm also took down more than 17 million bad ads in violation of gambling laws. Another part of the crackdown involved misleading ads -- for example, miracle weight loss cures. Google took down 80 million deceptive and misleading ads of that type, according to Spencer. Self-clicking mobile ads -- that is, advertising that popped up on mobile phones and pushed users to the app store -- were another focus. More than 23,000 self-clicking ads were detected and removed in 2016, a major increase from 2015, according to the company. Fake News Another 7 million ads that were designed to trick the company's detection systems were taken down, Google said. One version of this type of activity involved an increase in "tabloid cloakers," which involved scammers that hid ads behind news links or trending stories. Google suspended the accounts of more than 1,300 of those scam artists, according to Spencer. During a single sweep in December, the company took down 22 cloakers that were responsible for ads viewed by more than 20 million people. Google did not disclose how much revenue it may have lost as a result of the crackdown. Its actions ultimately should benefit the company, however, by making customers feel more confident that links they might click on are legitimate, suggested Michael Jude, a program manager at Stratecast/Frost & Sullivan. "Consumers are primed to ignore all ads once they have had a few bad experiences," he told the E-Commerce Times. "It might actually protect revenue if Google and others can maintain a reputation for legitimate and useful advertising." David Jones is a freelance writer based in Essex County, New Jersey.

As Google’s developer site notes, anyone can make and submit a Daydream app through the Play Store, similar to any other Android app. The move isn’t totally unexpected, given that Google had previously promised to open up the platform to all developers in 2017 back when Daydream was announced, but it’s a welcome change nonetheless. In order to ensure that Daydream apps meet a certain level of quality, Google has also published a page of Daydream app quality requirements to ensure that any VR experiences meet Google’s standards. Developers will also be required to provide some unique assets for a VR app, including a 360-degree photosphere and VR icon, along with a Motion Intensity Rating.

Samsung Mobile by Gordon Gottsegen January 25, 2017 2:33 PM PST Up Next Meet Jon Hamm, the hologram (aka the holohamm) Competition may be good for the soul, but so is collaboration. Samsung said at an earnings call earlier Wednesday that working with its often-partner, sometimes-rival Google will make artificial intelligence better on a range of devices. "Samsung and Google will have to continue to maintain their strategic partnership to nurture the AI and the market for the emerging technology," Samsung Mobile VP Lee Kyeong-tae said, as reported by The Investor, a South Korean publication associated with The Korea Herald. The call to collaborate comes at a time when Samsung is rumored to bring the AI assistant "Bixby" to its Galaxy S8 phone this April. The use of AI is heating up on phones, with phonemakers from Huawei to HTC introducing their own takes. Google, too, has already gotten a head start with its Google Assistant for the Pixel phones. If Google's AI played a role in the Pixel's success, then it be a win-win for Samsung and Google to work together: Samsung gets the smarts, Google gets more data to keep improving. Did Samsung just leak the Galaxy S8? Two new videos from Samsung's display division show off a new phone that might be the upcoming Galaxy S8. by Lexy Savvides 1:09 Close Drag Samsung's AI assistant wouldn't be limited to the Galaxy S8, either. Bixby could come to the company's tablets, TVs and laptops, too. In addition, Samsung may offer its AI to third-party developers, much as Amazon did with Alexa, The Investor noted. Investing in AI may also be a way for Samsung to diversify its efforts. After Samsung was (almost literally) burned by the Note 7, the company said it will work on other technology in addition to phones. "Although the growth of the global smartphone market is expected to slow this year, new services such as artificial intelligence will be a differentiating factor," Samsung said in a press release. Adding features like AI to high-end models is one way for the company to try to outpace competitors.

By Patrick Kulp2017-01-25 22:53:11 UTC Google has shut out nearly 200 websites from its advertising platform since announcing it would purge fake news publishers last November. The search giant released the number as part of its annual fraudulent advertising report, in which the company recaps its efforts to fight scams, malware and other harmful ads over the course of the past year.  SEE ALSO: Google brags it's keeping you safe from weight-loss scams and malware Those efforts now extend to deceitful publishers too, thanks to a recent change in the rules governing Google's AdSense network, which places ads across thousands of third-party sites. The update was first announced in the wake of the presidential election as Google and other online platforms came under increased scrutiny for their role in spreading deliberately fake news. Google now avoids using the term "fake news," however, because the label has become too ambiguous, according to a company spokesperson. Instead, it prefers "misrepresentative content." The company recently edited a section of its advertising guidelines to reflect that wording.   The spokesperson said all of the sites in question were flagged specifically because of the rule change, though that wasn't necessarily why they were ultimately punished. The platform's policy also bars sites that engage in other nefarious activities like pornography, piracy and gambling. Each of the sites is now permanently forbidden from accessing Google's advertising service — a more serious penalty than the temporary blacklisting measure the platform often uses to enforce its rules.   Including the bans, the company says it has disciplined a total of 340 publishers in some manner since November. The report comes weeks after progressive watchdog group Media Matters accused Google of failing to act against 20 publishers it claims routinely broadcast hoaxes, conspiracy theories and other false stories. In addition to the fake news crackdown, Google also said that it blocked 1.7 billion fraudulent ads last year — nearly twice as many as it did the previous year. Those included everything from weight loss scams and fake products to malware-laced pop-ups and phishing hoaxes. Google's decision to ban all ads from payday lenders last year was part of the reason for the uptick.  "A free and open web is a vital resource for people and businesses around the world. And ads play a key role in ensuring you have access to accurate, quality information online," Scott Spencer, Google's director of product management for sustainable ads, wrote in a blog post. "But bad ads can ruin the online experience for everyone."

Android Police has performed an APK Teardown of the latest update to Google Fit and they’ve noticed several changes. First up is the addition of hip size and waist size to measurements you can add inside the app. Height and weight have been there since the beginning, but now Google Fit will use the additional information to provide more accurate estimates when you use the app. Aside from the new measurements, the app also contains several new references to detailed information about your body that can be measured by sensors. These new fields include: Body fat percentage Body temperature Basal body temperature Basal metabolic rate Blood glucose Blood pressure Blood oxygen saturation Another interesting new aspect of the app is that Google seems to be focusing on women’s health too, which is something Apple was criticized for with the release of the Apple Watch. The new Fit .apk includes references to things like cervical mucus, cervical position, ovulation test results, floor changes, menstruation, and vaginal spotting. This means it’s likely that women won’t have to use a third party solution like Clue to manage their reproductive health once Google Fit 2.0 goes live.

Google holds an annual conference for developers, engineers, executives, and the media -- so that it can discuss all-things Google and Android-related. Developers and engineers use information from this show to get their apps and products up to date with Google's latest innovation, while the rest of us drool and look forward to what's coming in the months ahead. It's early days still, but we already have an inkling of what to expect. Now that the dates have been confirmed, we're updating this guide to keep you informed of all the latest news, announcements, and rumours. We will also continue to update as Google I/O gets closer, so keep checking back. When is Google I/O 2017? Google I/O 2017 will take place between 17 May 2017 and 19 May 2017 at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, California. Google I/O 2017 developer event will be held on 17-19 May Yep, it's true: I/O'17 will be at Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View, CA on May 17-19. See you in 110 days :) #io17 pic.twitter.com/vVlvx1N5mJ — sundarpichai (@sundarpichai) January 26, 2017 How much are Google I/O 2017 tickets? Google hasn't announced how much tickets are or when they will go on sale. Last year, it did a lottery system, meaning anyone could apply to get tickets, but only a few were accepted. In order to register, you needed to go to the Google I/O website during the registration period, sign in with your Google account, and have your credit card details ready. General admission tickets were priced at $900, while academic tickets were $300. Where can you stream Google I/O 2017? Google live-streamed last year's keynote, which you can playback here, so we expect it do the same for this year's I/O keynote. We will update this page with a link to the live stream if and when it becomes available. What can you expect from Google I/O 2017? Google's I/O webpage has yet to be updated with a countdown clock or a full schedule. However, based on last year's main topics covered at the conference, as well as the company's patterns and various industry rumours, here's what we expect to see at Google I/O 2017: Android O Pocket-lint Google usually uses Google I/O to tease improvements to Android. Last year, it talked about the split-screen mode, ability to reply to texts from notifications, and an update to the Doze batter saver. It also teased Android N. Google will more than likely mention the next version of Android at this year's show, so expect to hear something about Android O/8.0. Any guesses as to what the final, dessert-themed name will be? Android Wear Pocket-lint Google unveiled Android Wear 2.0 last year, and it hasn't even released yet. We're now expecting it to launch in early February, followed by a few new Android Wear devices, including two LG-made watches from Google. We think Google might take time to discuss the roll out of Android Wear 2.0 at this year's show, or it might even announce new features. Either way, it'll at least mention its OS for wearables. Daydream VR Pocket-lint At Google I/O 2016, Google showed us it was interested in going beyond Google Cardboard by introducing a new mobile, approachable to virtual reality in the form of Google Daydream. Since then, we've seen Google introduce a Daydream VR headset, Pixel phones with Daydream support, and other manufacturers add support for Daydream. We're hoping to see more hardware and software announcements. Oh, keep in mind Google is rumoured to be developing a high-end VR headset along the lines of HTC Vive and Oculus Rift. Unlike the Daydream View, it would be an all-in-one experience that doesn't require a phone. Also, on 26 January, HTC's design lead announced that he joined the Google Daydream platform. Claude Zellweger, according to his Twitter, is the maker of the HTC Vive VR headset and HTC 10.  We suspect more leaks in the coming months if Zellweger is indeed working on the secretive project. Chrome OS Pocket-lint Chrome OS now works with full Android apps. And, recently, a few new Chromebooks have been announced. Other than that, the Chrome OS space has been pretty quiet. Google has of course denied the rumours of a full OS merger between Chrome and Android, but maybe Google will use Google I/O 2017 to announce new features coming to the operating system or new Chromebooks and Chrome OS devices in the pipeline. Android Auto Android Auto is Google's attempt at getting Android into vehicles. We will likely see more manufacturers announce new car models compatible with Google's system, but it would be nice to see Google executives discuss new innovations for the platform as well. In 2015, Waze (which is part of Alphabet) executives suggested the intelligent navigation system could be added to Android Auto. Maybe we'll hear more on that? Pretty please? Google Assistant Pocket-lint Last year, Sundar Pichai, Google's CEO, talked a lot about machine-learning advances and artificial intelligence, as well as how they benefit its new Google Assistant. The service is an extension of Google Now. With it, you can ask conversational questions using the "OK Google" command. In the past 12 months, it has been added to the Google Home speaker, Allo chat app, and Pixel flagships. We're betting it'll be updated. Google Home Pocket-lint Speaking of Google Home, Google unveiled the voice-activated speaker at Google I/O 2016, but it's only been available for a few months now, letting you manage everyday tasks, ask questions, control select connected devices, and more. We're not expecting Google Home 2.0 to debut at this year's show, but maybe Google will announce new features and integrations. It might even copy Amazon and do a Dot-like version. Google Allo Pocket-lint Google unveiled its Allo messenger app at Google I/O 2016, though it hasn't done much with it since. The app is able to create smart replies you can use, and it can decipher information from photos to help provide a relevant response, and it even includes a limited version of Google Assistant. It'd be interesting to see the app offer a full-fledged version of Assistant, or at least add more cool tricks. Google Duo Pocket-lint Google also unveiled about Duo at I/O 2016. It's a one-to-one video calling app that works on both Android and iOS. Like Allo, it hasn't made a big impact since launch. Google might use this year's conference to discuss the latest on the app, and perhaps address its confusing approach to messaging/calling. So far, it offers Duo, Allo, Hangouts, and Google Voice. Google could try to combine Duo with Hangouts. Project Tango Lenovo Augmented reality was hot last summer, and it's expected to continue being popular. Keep in mind Google has long been working on Project Tango tech, which uses motion-tracking and depth sensing to build a 3D world onto physical surroundings, and at CES 2017, many manufacturers made announcements about AR devices, apps, and accessories. We therefore expect to hear more about Project Tango. Project Fi Google Google's cross-carrier network, Project Fi, which automatically switches carriers in order to provide more reliable access to mobile data, is now available for Pixel, Nexus ,and a few other devices. At Google I/O 2017, Google may announce more compatible devices. Is that it? Yep. Google's self-driving car project as been spun into a standalone business known as Waymo. At Google I/O 2017, we could learn some more details about what’s next, but we wouldn't count on it. Also, Google has reportedly suspended all plans to launch a Project Ara modular smartphone. The interchangeable phone concept has been shelved to streamline the company's hardware strategy, it is claimed.  Sections Google Apps 7 best encrypted messaging apps for all the Edward Snowdens out there Yo is an actual at-home male fertility test you just use with your phone Google I/O 2017: When is it, where to watch, and what to expect Snapchat adds universal search: Here's how it lets you quickly find friends...

SUBSCRIBE SEO priorities for the new year It's easy to get caught up in the day-to-day of your SEO campaigns, but columnist David Freeman advises you to stop for a moment and take a look at the bigger picture. David Freeman on January 25, 2017 at 12:40 pm More With New Year’s Day still fresh in our memories, there is no better time to step back and take stock of your SEO campaigns. Look for any quick wins and identify the larger projects that will help you start the year in great shape. Hygiene: Quick wins These are the actions you can do tomorrow.  In my view, there are two keys areas to focus on. 1. Google Search Console review Google Search Console is often neglected, but it can be one of the best sources of information for identifying quick wins. Working through Search Console’s navigation from top to bottom, I would look for any errors or warnings. The main areas to review include: Structured data. Ensure there are no errors within your markup. HTML improvements. Revising duplicated or lengthy meta descriptions and page titles can be an easy method of increasing CTR for your existing rankings, especially if you work closely with your paid search counterparts to identify their top-performing ad copy. Mobile usability. Mobile traffic now represents a significant percentage of site traffic, if not the majority for many sites. As such, ensuring your sites have an optimum mobile experience should be a priority. Blocked resources. Complete a quick check to ensure that any resources the search engines need to render your pages are not being blocked. Crawl errors. Identify and resolve any 404 or soft 404 errors to ensure a strong user experience and to redirect any link authority pointing to redundant URLs. While the above is not a comprehensive site audit, it provides an action list of easy-to-implement, quick wins (when presented with the appropriate business case rationale). 2. Content gap analysis Staying relevant to consumer search behavior is vital at both the top and the bottom of the funnel to increase visibility across the full spectrum of search terms. A quick content gap analysis is the ideal method of focusing your attention on the easy content wins. From there, you can build a content development road map to enable you to fill the highest priority gaps throughout the first quarter of the year. Larger projects In conjunction with the quick wins, it’s important to take a fresh look at the larger projects that are on your road map and, if necessary, re-prioritize them based on what you believe you can realistically do in the first quarter of the year. These are the projects that will likely make a real difference to performance in 2017 and shouldn’t be overlooked. While every project is unique and has its own priorities, three main areas are important to dial up the consumer-centricity of your SEO campaign. 1. Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) On September 20, 2016, Google began rolling out accelerated mobile pages across the main mobile search results; this global rollout was expected to be completed by the end of 2016. In short, they are no longer restricting AMP to the Top Stories carousel. While there will be no rankings benefit from implementing the AMP framework, it provides the opportunity to offer a much faster mobile experience to consumers — and thus increased engagement and potential conversions. Personally, I believe that the pared-back AMP experience is a good thing, but the user experience that AMP offers needs to be assessed on a site-by-site basis to ensure that it enhances the mobile experience. 2. HTTPS This holds importance on three fronts: Consumers are seeking a more secure and trustworthy online experience, and HTTPS is the ideal way of delivering it. This will become even more important with Chrome now flagging insecure sites. HTTPS is a Google ranking factor. It is a prerequisite for implementing HTTP2, which will allow sites to load significantly faster than with the legacy HTTP protocol. To understand this speed increase, take a look at this video, which demonstrates in five seconds how a web page loads faster in SPDY, the HHTP/2 protocol. The benefits may seem small, but with HTTPS being a prerequisite for HTTP2, I see real value in the page load time improvements delivered across both desktop and mobile. 3. Mobile experience Many sites offer strong mobile experiences these days, but there is still room for improvement in terms of usability. As we move through 2017, mobile traffic is going to continue to increase, which places even more importance on delivering a great mobile experience. In conjunction with mobile usability errors in Google Search Console, there is value in reviewing your mobile site and ensuring it delivers as strongly as possible. It is important to review your site with the eyes of a consumer and check for any pain points, including: Is the end-to-end site mobile-friendly? Are you able to access the same depth of content across devices? Does the navigation fit to screen size without the need to scroll? Are all the links big enough to allow you to click through? Are rich media assets slowing down page load time? If anything is uncovered at this stage, note that it will likely be a lengthy process to make changes to the mobile site template. However, it is still absolutely worthwhile, regardless of time frame. Conclusion It is all too easy to get absorbed into the day-to-day running of your SEO campaigns and lose sight of the bigger picture. The tasks above should be prioritized to progress the wider strategy and increase performance both in the short and long term. Periodically, it is incredibly useful to step away from the day-to-day and apply a fresh lens by going back to basics. This is especially relevant to kick-start 2017 on the best possible footing.

Here's what investors need to know. Steve Symington (TMFSymington) Jan 25, 2017 at 4:08PM Google parent Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is set to release fourth-quarter 2016 results Thursday after the market closes. With Alphabet stock up 16% over the past year and trading at an all-time high as of this writing, the market will be listening closely to what the internet search behemoth says. So what should Alphabet investors be watching this time around? "G" is for Google. Image source: Alphabet, Inc. Alphabet's headline numbers First, Alphabet isn't in the habit of providing specific quarterly financial guidance. So for perspective -- even though we don't usually pay close attention to Wall Street's short-term demands -- consensus estimates predict that Alphabet will see revenue climb 18.3% year over year, to $25.2 billion, and translate to 11.5% growth in earnings per share, to $9.67. It should also be kept in mind the latter may be bolstered by any stock buybacks made under Alphabet's massive $7 billion-plus share repurchase plan approved last quarter. Digging deeper This will also mark Alphabet's fifth quarterly report since shifting to a segment-based reporting model early last year. Though the bulk of Alphabet's revenue and earnings are derived from its core internet search and advertising business, its "Other Bets" segment -- comprised of a handful of early stage, primarily pre-revenue businesses that operate across several disparate industries -- has grown by leaps and bounds, and now materially affects its results. As such, and as Alphabet continues to plow financial resources into these other bets, the company proactively sought this new reporting structure "to bring increased focus, accountability, and transparency" to shareholders. As it stands, the majority of Other Bets revenue will likely come from a combination of Nest connected home products, Fiber high-speed internet, and Verily longevity solutions, with limited sales from the remaining bets like Calico life sciences products, self-driving cars, and Alphabet's "X" moonshot initiatives. We also shouldn't be surprised if Other Bets remains solidly unprofitable. The segment generated an operating loss of $865 million last quarter, though it's worth noting that was narrowed from an operating loss of $980 million in the same year-ago period. In short, Alphabet's focus here remains on fostering the long-term potential of these promising businesses. On Big "G" Of course, we can't forget Google, the money-making machine that enables Alphabet to invest in those other bets. Last quarter, Google saw sales climb over 20% year over year, to $22.254 billion, representing around 99% of Alphabet's consolidated revenue. And the primary driver within that total was advertising sales, which climbed just over 18%, to $19.82 billion, or 88.3% of total revenue. Those numbers show that the relative health of Google's ad business is crucial to its ability to continue thriving. Alphabet will provide a number of useful ad metrics, including growth in advertising revenue from Google's own websites (up 22.9%, to $16.09 billion last quarter), and that of Google Network Members' sites (up 1% last quarter, to $3.73 billion). Google's mobile ads will likely remain a powerful protagonist, as a growing number of consumers turn to its massively popular mobile-friendly products like Search, YouTube, and Maps. We should also look for stats on the effectiveness and volume of Google's ads, including growth in aggregate paid clicks (up 33% year over year last quarter), which will be similarly broken down between Google's own sites (up 42% last quarter) and those of network members (up 1% last quarter). That said, there may be continued declines in Google's aggregate cost-per-click (down 11% last quarter), a key metric that helps measure how much Google makes from each ad. To Google's credit, however, recent declines in aggregate cost-per-click have largely stemmed from rapid growth of YouTube TrueView ad impressions. Because TrueView ads usually reach consumers earlier in the purchase funnel, they tend to monetize at lower rates than traditional web-based advertisements. Given YouTube's immense volume advantages, this is one enviable "problem" Google doesn't mind working to improve over time. Next, listen for updates on the performance of Google's non-advertising products, primarily Google Play, Cloud, and hardware devices like Chromecast. Last quarter, non-advertising sales within Google increased 38.8% year over year, to $2.43 billion, offering a solidly profitable source of incremental growth. Looking ahead Finally, I wouldn't hold my breath for specific guidance on the coming year. But more than anything, investors want to know that Alphabet's core business remains healthy, which in turn allows the company to continue expanding its reach and making its products indispensable to consumers around the world. If Alphabet can continue working toward that end, its shareholders should enjoy more all-time highs going forward.

Next: All PayPal accounts were 1 click away from hijacking by Lisa Vaas 0Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share on Reddit Remember back in 2013, when Ticketmaster – the world’s largest online ticket retailer – decided to stop torturing people’s eyeballs by making them decipher blobs of melted characters in order to prove that they’re human? Likewise, Google’s now too stabbing a fork into CAPTCHA, the aggravating test that’s supposed to determine if we’re robots or scripts used by spammers or other online misdeed-doers, or if we are instead real, live, warm-blooded simians. CAPTCHA came out of Carnegie Mellon University and stands for “Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart”. The tests are designed to be hard for robots, easy for humans. They typically consist of typing letters and/or digits from a distorted image. Or, as the case may be, messages to go pleasure yourself. Or, then again, mathematical problems that make your brain bleed. Ten years into using CAPTCHA to keep robots from engaging in dirty tricks online, the “supposed to weed out bots” has now turned into “utterly stink at weeding out bots”. That’s because advances in Artificial Intelligence have resulted in robot creations that are now able to solve even the most difficult variant of distorted text with 99.8% accuracy, according to Google’s recent research. Not that Google’s going to stop testing site visitors to weed out bots, mind you. Rather, as it announced on Wednesday, Google’s going to move away from asking users to read blobby text and type it into a box, as it’s been doing, like this:  And instead will simply ask us, “Are you a robot?” with what it’s calling the “No CAPTCHA reCAPTCHA” API, like so: Asking us to check off a box saying that “I am not a robot” will be an effective way of determining whether or not we’re robots because humans move their cursors in a humanlike way. Specifically, the difference between bot and human can be revealed in clues as subtle as how a user (or a bot) moves a mouse in the brief moments before clicking the “I am not a robot” button, according to Vinay Shet, the product manager for Google’s Captcha team. Without realizing it, humans also drop clues that can establish whether we’re automated or not: IP addresses and cookies show our movements elsewhere on the Web and can help prove that we’re not a bad actor. Wired quotes Shet: All of this gives us a model of how a human behaves It's a whole bag of cues that make this hard to spoof for a bot. He said that there are other variables that will help make the determination, but those have to be kept secret, lest botmasters figure out how to work around them and once again learn how to slip past Google’s filters. Google’s been integrating automated bot-detection into its CAPTCHAs since at least 2013. In October 2013, Google revealed that it had developed what it called its Advanced Risk Analysis backend for reCAPTCHA to filter out bots. The backend doesn’t just look at whatever gobbledygook we type into the box. Rather, it observes our entire engagement with a CAPTCHA, from start to finish – before, during, and after we type into the box – to determine whether we’re carbon-based. On Valentine’s Day, Google gave us a taste of what reCAPTCHA can do, presenting us with chocolates and flowers and throbbing hearts – the first two of which were rendered in text that was simple (for humans) to read. It sounds great, but it’s not yet time to kiss the inscrutably distorted CAPTCHA blobs goodbye. Over the past week, Google’s tests on sites that use CAPTCHA have verified most humans, but it still missed quite a few. As Wired reports, about 60% of WordPress users and 80% of users at video game sales site Humble Bundle got past the CAPTCHA with only the simple checkbox. When Google’s Advanced Risk Analysis engine can’t figure out what we are with a mere click, it’s going to back up the test with a pop-up window that will present users with the same old distorted text we’ve been enduring for years. For mobile users, things haven’t gotten quite so simple as a single click. But when they face a CAPTCHA on their mobile phone or tablet, they’ll now have a much easier hurdle to leap: rather than having to type in text, they’ll be asked to select all the images that correspond with a clue image. Like Google says, it’s a lot easier to tap photos of cats or turkeys than to type in a line of text on a phone: And if you’re worried about the privacy implications of Google analyzing where your mouse moves on a page, Shet pointed out that Google will only be tracking your movements over the CAPTCHA widget when it appears on other sites, not on the entire page. This is how he put it to Wired: You don’t have to verify your identity to verify your humanity. Besides, as we’ve noted before, tracking movement is not just a Google thing. Facebook, Twitter, Gmail or any webpage can track everything you do and could be keylogging your every pointer movement or keystroke. Logging keystrokes is no super secret, privacy-sucking vampire sauce. It’s plain old Web 1.0. This is not news, but it’s certainly worth repeating: anybody with a website can capture what you type, as you type it, if they want to. The reality is that JavaScript, the language that makes this kind of monitoring possible, is both powerful and ubiquitous. It’s a fully featured programming language that can be embedded in web pages, and all browsers support it. It’s been around almost since the beginning of the web, and the web would be hurting without it, given the things it makes happen. Among the many features of the language are the abilities to track the position of your cursor, track your keystrokes and call “home” without refreshing the page or making any kind of visual display. Those aren’t intrinsically bad things. In fact, they’re enormously useful. Without those sort of capabilities sites like Facebook and Gmail would be almost unusable, searches wouldn’t auto-suggest and Google Docs wouldn’t save our bacon in the background. In the case of Google’s advances with reCAPTCHA, such an ability can stop a lot of bad bots from doing things that can be worse than the annoyance of having to endure typing in text from a blobby image. Think bots that harvest email addresses from contact or guestbook pages, site scrapers that grab the content of websites and re-use it without permission on automatically generated doorway pages, bots that take part in Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, and more. I’ll take the kittens, please!

In the era where the mouse is becoming obsolete Google are going to rely on user mouse movements or clicks to define whether a person is human or not. There are some pretty big gaming communities that have been scripting human like mouse behavior for years. It’ll be interesting to see how this progresses.

Reply Paul Ducklin says: September 9, 2016 at 5:40 pm I thought a hamburger was called “a hamburger” in the US :-) By definition, of course, even in British English, a hamburger *is* a sandwich. At any rate, there seems to be no suggestion in any of the Oxford lexicons (British or American) that sandwiches can’t be circular. Two pieces of bread with an edible filling in between is all you need to pass the test. I guess the CAPTCHA folks were hoping a robot wouldn’t be able to handle the subtleties… Having said that, if you tried to order a hamburger by asking for “a sandwich” in Maccas, I think you would get, errrrrrrr, either a sandwich, served in the form of a square cut into two triangle, or a word from the security guard (depending on how strongly you argued the case, and whether it was after 1am).

In a blog post detailing how it dealt with fake news in 2016, Google said it banned 200 publishers and dealt with bad ads. In 2016, Google said it took down 1.7 billion ads [that’s huge] that violated its policies on ads. That figure, according to the company, more than double the number of ads banned in 2015: “In 2016, we took down 1.7 billion ads that violated our advertising policies, more than double the amount of bad ads we took down in 2015. If you spent one second taking down each of those bad ads, it’d take you more than 50 years to finish. But our technology is built to work much faster,” said Scott Spencer, Google Director of Product Management Sustainable ads. Weeding out bad publishers is nothing new to Google—the company often gets rid of policy violators in order to maintain its standard. Publishers who often violate the company’s policy by making false claims are kicked out of the AdSense platform. Google’s hardline stance is based on recent development and criticism from people following the last US election. Experts are of the view that the US election was heavily influenced by fake news; a development that is still generating ripples across the country. Recall that Google was criticized for placing a false story claiming that Republican candidate Donald Trump had won the popular vote. Fake news sites weeded out by Google included those that personated real news organizations. Sometimes, these [fake] sites take advantage “.co” domains; appearing similar to legitimate news sites that end with a “.com” extension. Google said it stepped up its war against bad ads in 2016 by expanding its “policies to better protect users from misleading and predatory offers.” The second step it took to broaden its war against bad ads was stepping up its technology to enable it “spot and disable bad ads even faster.” “For example, “trick to click” ads often appear as system warnings to deceive users into clicking on them, not realizing they are often downloading harmful software or malware. In 2016, our systems detected and disabled a total of 112 million ads for “trick to click,” 6X more than in 2015.” Google also clamped down tabloid cloaking; suspending 1,300 accounts in 2016. Tabloid cloaking is gaining popularity these days, and Google knows it has a big task on its hands if it truly wants to bring an end to it. Below are some examples of common policy violations Google saw among websites: 47,000 sites were banned for promoting content and products related to weight-loss scams. Google took action on more than 15,000 sites for unwanted software and disabled 900,000 ads for containing malware. The company suspended around 6,000 sites and 6,000 accounts for attempting to advertise counterfeit goods, like imitation designer watches. In July, Google added a policy to prohibit ads for payday loans, which it considered predatory. Google disabled roughly five million payday loan ads in the last six months of 2016.

Credit: iStock Most Popular Google said it blocked 1.7 billion "bad ads" in 2016, or more than double what it did the previous year. Ads that are misleading, inappropriate, promote misleading products or trick users into installing harmful software are generally deemed "bad," Google said. The company also blacklisted ads that were once considered acceptable in 2015. Payday loans that carry an annual interest rate higher than 36%, for example, were banned from appearing as Google search ads last year. The company was applauded for its move, as the measure was expected to cost Google millions in revenue. Yet digital loan sharks quickly adapted to Google's newfound rule, as many loan companies now offer payday loans with an APR as high as 35.99%. That means a $5,000 loan with an APR of 35.99% would cost a borrower $13,745 over a seven-year span, which is a common time allotment offered by the predatory loan companies Google is trying to blacklist. Still, Google said it blocked 5 million payday loan advertisements from appearing in 2016. Scott Spencer, director of product management at Google, said it takes time for the company to adapt to new schemes. Meanwhile, the company said the biggest trend to come out of 2016 was the rise of "tabloid cloakers," a new type of ad that tries to game Google's system by pretending to be news. One example the company shared was about an ad showing Ellen DeGeneres and aliens. However, consumers who click on ads like this are taken to a site selling weight loss products, for example. Google said it suspended 1,300 accounts for tabloid cloaking last year. In one sweep, the company took down 22 accounts that were responsible for displaying 20 million cloaker ads over a one-week period. The company added that it also removed 112 million ads that aim to deceive users into downloading apps or malware, six times more than what it did in 2015. The company said it removed 68 million ads for healthcare violations in 2016, up from 12.5 million in 2015. Another 17 million ads were removed for promoting illegal gambling, Google said. About 900,000 ads were disabled for containing malware. And an additional 6,000 accounts were suspended for attempting to advertise counterfeit goods, the company said. From November to December, Google said it reviewed 550 sites that were suspected of misrepresenting content or were impersonating as news organizations like CNN. Of those, Google took action against 340 of them for violating its policies. An additional 200 publishers were also permanently banned, Google said.

This week, Google took steps to remedy that by announcing integration with Honeywell, Belkin and WeMo smart home accessories. The trio of smart home heavyweights joins Nest, Philips Hue and Samsung SmartThings, which were supported upon launch. Related: Google Home vs Amazon Echo In a post on its official blog Google wrote: “With Honeywell and your Google Assistant on Google Home, you can conveniently manage your home’s temperature without leaving the comfort of your covers—just say "Ok Google, turn the temperature up downstairs.” And when you’re headed out the door, Belkin Wemo and your Google Assistant can help you remember if you turned off the lights—just say “Ok Google, did I leave the bedroom lights on?” Google Home owners will be able to incorporate those devices using the Google Home app. From Settings users can browser to Home Control and then click ‘+’ next to new devices. Google also said Home Control will come to the Pixel phone soon. Video: Amazon Echo vs Google Home Will you be buying Google Home when Google decides to release it outside of the US?

The company banned the publishers from its AdSense network, an ad placement service that automatically serves text and display ads on participating sites based on its audience. The ban was part of an update to an existing policy that prohibits sites that mislead users with their content. Google regularly weeds out advertisers for false or misleading claims, but impersonating news sites became an addition following the rapid rise of fake news, or propaganda sites. After the election, Google was blasted for placing a false story from a fake news site claiming Donald Trump had won the popular vote. (He had 2.8 million fewer votes than Hillary Clinton.) Not all 200 publishers were swept up as part of the effort to root out fake news sites. Publishers were banned in November and December and included sites that impersonate real news organizations through shortened top-level domains, according to Google’s 2016 “bad ads” report, normally released at the beginning of each year. So-called fake news publishers will sometimes take advantage of “.co” domains by appearing similar to legitimate news sites that would normally end in “.com.” Google declined to provide a listing of the banned sites. Separately, the annual report on violations of advertising policy also included data on ads removed by Google. The company reported that in 2016 it took down 1.7 billion ads for violations, compared to 780 million in 2015. Google attributes the increase in ad removals to a combination of advertiser behavior and improvements in technology to detect offending ads. Google added a policy mid-year to prohibit ads for payday loans, considered predatory. Roughly five million payday loan ads were disabled over the latter six months of 2016. Also among those the removed ads were what Google calls “tabloid cloakers.” These advertisers run what look like links to news headlines, but when the user clicks, an ad for a product such as a weight loss supplement pops up. Google suspended 1,300 accounts engaged in tabloid cloaking in 2016. Correction: the original headline stated 200 publishers were banned in a three month period, when it was actually less than two months.

The entire experience is incredibly smooth on modern hardware (BlueStacks has been around for years and what was originally a pretty rocky alpha-software experience is now quite polished) and even things that previously didn’t works so well (like access to the host computer’s web cam or issues with applications that require GPS data) now work surprisingly well. There are only two small quirks. First, the current version of BlueStacks only runs Android 4.4.2 KitKat, so if you need something newer than that, you’ll need to install the Android SDK instead. Second, multitouch is missing, unless you’re using BlueStacks on a computer with a touch screen monitor. If you are, you can use multi-touch, but otherwise you’re out of luck if the app you’re using requires it. How to Install BlueStacks To get started with BlueStacks, simply head over to their downloads page and grab an appropriate installer for your computer. We’re using Windows in our example, but the process for Mac should be pretty similar. Once the installer has finished downloading, launch it. You’ll be taken through the usual app installation process, confirming at the end that you want BlueStacks to have access to the App Store and Application Communications. Make sure those two options are checked. Next, you’ll be prompted to create a BlueStacks account using your Google account to sign in. A BlueStacks account gives you access to some interesting features (like chatting with other BlueStacks users while they’re playing the same games as you), but the best feature is that it syncs your settings across devices—so if you install BlueStacks on your desktop and laptop, everything is the same regardless of where you’re using it. Once you complete the profile setup, you’ll be presented with the BlueStacks GUI and your now-running (emulated) Android device: Just as if you turned on a new Android tablet for the first time, you’ll be run through the basic setup. Select your language, sign in with your Google account (for access to the Play Store and other features), and all the other usual stuff you do when setting up an Android device for the first time. Speaking of signing in, be forewarned: as you perform the two above steps (creating a BlueStacks account and signing into your Google account for the first time) you’ll get two security alerts from Google indicating that you just signed into Firefox on Windows and a Samsung Galaxy S5 device. This is because the BlueStacks wrapper is identifying itself as a Firefox browser and the emulation signature it’s using for its Android hardware identifies itself as an S5—neither of those security emails are anything to worry about. How to Use BlueStacks to Run Android Apps Once you’ve finished the Android setup process, it will dump you right into the home screen of your new emulated Android device. Everything you know about using an Android device applies here: the settings menu is still there, the Play Store is there, and you can click on apps to launch them or open the settings menu by clicking on the app drawer. Simply use your mouse like you would use your finger on the screen (or, if you actually have a touch screen monitor, feel free to use your actual finger). Let’s start by clicking on the Play Store icon to download some apps. You can immediately start browsing apps by category as well as by entering search terms in the white search box at the top of the screen. If you already have an Android device you use regularly, however, there’s an even faster way to get the apps you use on your phone or tablet onto your emulated copy of Android—click on the menu icon, highlighted in red above. Within the slide out menu, select “My apps & games” in the sidebar. There, by selecting the “All” tab, you can see all the apps you’ve downloaded using your Google account across all your different devices including both free and premium apps you’ve purchased. After scrolling through our list of apps, we found a perfect Android app we really liked, but that we hadn’t found a good replacement for on the desktop: Pomodroido, a Pomodoro Technique timer. All we need to do is click “Install” and boom, we’ve got access to Pomodroido on the desktop. It’s that simple. So what about the rest of BlueStacks’ interface? There are two things you’ll want to take note of: the toolbar down the side, and the navigation bar across the top. Let’s start at the top, using the screenshot above as a reference point. First, you’ll note that there are tabs. Rather than force you to use a poorly emulated button combination to call the task switcher up, BlueStacks simply presents each individual Android app in a tabbed format across the top. Click on any given tab to switch to that app. On the right hand side of the navigation bar, you’ll see a blue arrow icon. This is the “Upgrade to BlueStacks Premium” button. BlueStacks is free, but it does come loaded some sponsored games (and downloads new ones periodically). If you don’t want to deal with the sponsored promotions, you can subscribe to BlueStacks for $24 a year. Next to the premium icon, you’ll see a tiny little icon in the shape of the WASD keys on the keyboard (a nod to the role those keys play in so many PC games). This icon is grayed out unless you are playing a game. It allows you to map functions to a game controller, as seen below with Clash of Clans. For more details on using the key mapping function, check out this help file. Next down the row, you’ll see an envelope icon. Clicking on this icon pulls down your notifications, just like when you’re using Android on a mobile device, where you can then read and clear them. The next icon, a gear, is for the settings menu. Here you can restart your emulated Android device, check for updates, change the settings for BlueStacks (found under “Preferences”) or jump to the actual settings of the emulated Android device (by clicking “Settings”). The last three icons are standard Windows interface icons for minimizing the app, going to full screen mode, or closing it. Finally, let’s turn our attention to the sidebar where we find a host of useful functions. The top two icons on the left hand side, blue and green, are for BlueStacks-specific functionality and allow you to watch other BlueStacks user’s streams (or create your own) and chat with other BlueStacks users, respectively. The next icon down allows you to change the rotation of the screen (it’s only active in apps that support rotation). The next icon, a little phone that looks like it is vibrating, is a button that emulates shaking your device for apps that use a shaking motion to trigger some event. The camera icon is for taking a screenshot of your Android device and beneath that you’ll find a map marker icon—if you click the marker you can set a fake GPS location for your device allowing you to place it anywhere in the world. The “APK” icon allows you to sideload applications that aren’t in the Play Store, provided you have the installer file on your PC. The folder icon launches the Windows file browser so you can select files to import to your emulated Android device. Finally, the last three icons are for copying text or images from the Android device onto your computer’s clipboard, pasting from your computer’s clipboard into Android, and adjusting the volume. At this point, your Android emulator should be up and running smoothly. You know how to install new apps (and old favorites), and you’ve got a nice interface to help smooth over the bumps between your PC interface and the Android interface. Now go download your favorite apps and enjoy them on your big, spacious desktop PC!

Freiburg im Breisgau, Germany - January 25, 2017 /PressCable/ -- Ahead of the launch of its new Dominating 1st Page of Google For Chiropractors Service, CE Internet Service is making public 5 as yet unreleased facts about the service, set to go live Monday 23rd January, which fans and consumers within the Dominating 1st Page of Google For Chiropractors space will find interesting...

The Dominating 1st Page of Google For Chiropractors Service has actually been in development for 7 months. And had a team of 3 working on it. Which is considered small by industry standards. This goes to show that with the same resources but real passion, amazing things can happen. CE Internet Service almost wasn't able to bring the Dominating 1st Page of Google For Chiropractors Service to see the light of day, when the business ran into a major cash flow issue.

CE Internet Service has done something different compared to other businesses in the Dominating 1st Page of Google For Chiropractors space. By using an experimental new technology. The Dominating 1st Page of Google For Chiropractors service will be released as part of CE Internet Service's greater plans to donate enough to sustain an entire village in South America.

With five years prior experience in the Dominating 1st Page of Google For Chiropractors world, Christian Ermlich decided to go ahead and start in 2009. Christian Ermlich is quoted saying: "We like to do things to connect with our consumers and customers. Things like publishing a regular weekly newsletter. And releasing these little factoids ahead of our Dominating 1st Page of Google For Chiropractors Service launch are what make a difference."

The Podesta Group -- whose chairman, Tony Podesta, is a major Democratic fundraiser and the brother of Clinton’s former campaign manager -- is no longer lobbying on behalf of Google, public disclosures show. The change coincided with Google’s bid to hire someone for “conservative outreach,” according to a December job advertisement. Veteran lobbyists say it’s not unusual to see such shifts after an election. U.S. companies are responding to a power shift in Washington that put Republicans in charge -- but with a president who sometimes departs from party orthodoxy on issues like taxes and trade. President Donald Trump’s practice of calling out companies for cost-overruns on government contracts and decisions to move jobs overseas has also changed the stakes for corporate lobbyists. The tech industry in particular has a rift to bridge. Silicon Valley was a hotbed of Clinton support during the election, and several executives openly expressed concerns about Trump’s plans to curtail immigration, punish American companies with overseas operations and block possible terrorists from accessing the Internet. More than 140 tech industry executives published an open letter last summer saying Trump “would be a disaster for innovation.” Tech Meetings Since the election, tech leaders including Facebook Inc.’s Sheryl Sandberg, Amazon.com Inc.’s Jeff Bezos and Tesla Motors Inc.’s Elon Musk have met with Trump in a bid to ease tensions. Alphabet Chief Executive Officer Larry Page and chairman Eric Schmidt also attended the meeting. “Companies have to get over the assumption of a Hillary presidency and pivot to the new world under President Trump,” John Scofield of lobbying firm S-3 Group said in an e-mail. “Big companies don’t necessarily move on a dime, and it takes a little effort for their operations to pivot to the new regime.” Some of that shift appears to be well underway. Podesta Group, which employs lobbyists from both major parties, lost seven clients, which it had billed for $460,000 during the final four months of the year, according to the disclosures. The lobbying group took in $80,000 from Google in the final three months of 2016, according to quarterly disclosures. Podesta Group didn’t respond to a request for comment. Google spokeswoman Becca Rutkoff declined to comment. ‘Start Switching’ Citigroup Inc. terminated a relationship with Subject Matter, a mostly Democrat-affiliated lobbying firm, which lost six clients by the end of 2016, including the National Football League, totaling more than $250,000 in business. Steve Elmendorf, Subject Matter’s co-founder, said companies always make changes at the end of the year based on their legislative priorities and the composition of the congress. “It’s not unusual,” he said. “The minute the election is over, you just have to start switching,” said Paul Miller, the president of the National Institute for Lobbying and Ethics, a professional association for lobbyists. “If you’re doing your job right, that’s what you do.” Meanwhile, the change in administration is a boon to some firms. Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, a group that lobbied for debt relief for the island, re-upped its contract with Prime Policy Group, where Charlie Black is chairman, the disclosures show. Black was previously a partner of Paul Manafort, Trump’s former campaign manager, and Roger Stone, a decades-long Trump adviser. Puerto Rico’s governor Ricardo Rosselló also hired former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski, Bloomberg News reported. Businesses, trade associations, interest groups and the lobbyists who represent them also disclosed lobbying on issues including trade, health care, immigration, taxes and the environment, as well as the appointees who will be implementing them -- all issues that arose in the first weeks after Trump’s election.

The National Manufacturers Association, lobbied on the transition of leadership at the Consumer Product Safety Commission, which regulates the products of many of the trade association’s members. Some progressive, labor and civil-liberties groups -- including the National Education Association, the American Federation of Teachers, and the American Civil Liberties Union -- said they also plan to lobby on issues related to the transition, including LGBT rights and the nomination of Representative Tom Price to head the Department of Health and Human Services. The biggest spender for the quarter was the National Association of Realtors, which reported almost $20 million in lobbying during the quarter, about $5 million more than the same period in 2015. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce came in second, spending almost $19 million, up from about $15 million from the last three months of 2015. The U.S. Chamber Institute for Legal Reform also spent almost $6 million. Before it's here, it's on the Bloomberg Terminal.

TeamIndus among top 5 finalists to compete for Google Lunar XPRIZE by landing rovers on Moon Google Lunar XPRIZE contest organisers say they will now abide by the current timeline, according to which the teams are required to launch on or before December 31. By News Nation Bureau  |  Updated On : January 25, 2017 05:45 PM Google Lunar XPRIZE: TeamIndus among top 5 finalists who will land their spacecrafts on Moon New Delhi :   TeamIndus has yet again made all the Indians proud as it has made it to the list of five finalists who will be competing in a $30 million Google Lunar XPRIZE competition that requires them to land on the Moon and operate their unmanned robotic spacecrafts on the lunar surface. The XPRIZE Foundation announced on Tuesday that five teams have been shortlisted for the competition. XPRIZE and Google also announced on Tuesday that a $1 million Diversity Prize will be distributed among 16 Google Lunar XPRIZE teams. Five teams have successfully verified launch contracts and are now moving forward to the final phase of the competition. The foundation said that the contenders now require to launch their respective spacecraft until December 31. The competitors previously completed various activities on Moon, such as having their vehicles run 1,640 feet (500 meters) and broadcast HD video by the end of the year. The Google Lunar XPRIZE contest was announced in 2007 following which 33 teams originally signed up to compete for the $20 million first prize.  Alphabet, Google's parent company, has also created a documentary series about the Lunar XPRIZE competition. Japan's Hakuto will be carried bt Indian PSLV launcher along with TeamIndus. The original 2012 deadline for the Google Lunar XPrize has been extended three times. However, contest organisers say they will now abide by the current timeline, according to which the teams are required to launch on or before December 31. “XPRIZE and Google have been awestruck by the educational outreach activities conducted by all of the competing teams and have decided to split the $1 million Diversity Prize across all 16 teams to recognize each of their unique approaches and initiatives over the years,” said Chanda Gonzales-Mowrer, senior director, Google Lunar XPRIZE. “Each of these teams has pushed the boundaries to demonstrate that you don’t have to be a government superpower to send a mission to the Moon, while inspiring audiences to pursue the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.” The following five teams have made it to the final phase of the Google Lunar XPRIZE competition: 1. SpaceIL (Israel): SpaceIL is a non-profit organisation and it will be traveling on board the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. The aim of SpaceIL is to make an educational impact and to create “Apollo Effect” for the next generation in Israel. 2. Moon Express (USA): Moon Express has entered into a multi-mission launch contract with Rocket Lab USA for no less than three lunar missions by 2020. The goal is to open up the vast resources of the Moon for humanity. They also aim to establish new avenues for commercial space activities beyond the orbit of the Earth. 3. Synergy Moon (International): Team member Interorbital Systems will be the launch provider and will use a NEPTUNE 8 rocket to carry a lunar lander and rover to the Moon. Synergy Moon involves individuals from more than 15 countries. They aim at making manned orbital travel, personal satellite launches and Solar System exploration cost effective and accessible. 4. TeamIndus (India): TeamIndus entered into a commercial launch contract with the Indian Space Research Organization’s Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle (PSLV). TeamIndus’ spacecraft will be launched from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre in Sriharikota. 5. HAKUTO (Japan): HAKUTO will share a ride with TeamIndus that will carry the four-wheeled rover to the Moon on board the PSLV. Hakuto aims at exploring holes that are thought to be caves or ‘skylights’ into underlying lava tubes, for the first time in history. This could result in important scientific discoveries and possibly identifying long-term habitats to shield humans from the Moon’s hostile environment. What is Google Lunar XPRIZE?

Alphabet GOOGL, -1.39% GOOG, -1.06%  is expected to show an increase in ad revenues despite ongoing pricing pressure exasperated by a decline in the amount Google receives when customers interact with an ad, a metric called cost per click. Management will likely be upbeat on the growth of video engagement and sales of its artificial intelligence products. See also: Google’s Pixel business could be bigger than Fitbit and GoPro combined This quarter will also be the first to include sales of the Pixel smartphone, which was released in October. Not all analysts are convinced the new Android phone performed well in a market saturated with the likes of Apple Inc.’s AAPL, +0.01%   iPhone and Samsung Electronics’ 005930, +1.27%  Galaxy line. Here’s what to expect: Earnings: Sell-side analysts surveyed by FactSet expect Alphabet to report adjusted profit of $9.64 a share, compared with $8.67 in the year-earlier period. Contributors to Estimize, a software platform that uses crowdsourcing from hedge fund executives, brokerages and buy-side analysts to predict earnings, expect Alphabet to report adjusted earnings of $9.76 a share. The company has surpassed both consensus estimates in four of the past five quarters. Watch: Google’s self-driving cars equipped with new sensors Revenue: The company is expected to report revenue of $20.6 billion, compared with $17.3 billion in the year-earlier period, according to the FactSet and Estimize consensus estimates. Alphabet has topped both expectations in three of the past four quarters. Stock reaction: Shares of Alphabet have underperformed the market since its last earnings report, increasing 3% in the past three months and 16% in the past year. The S&P 500 index SPX, -0.09%  , by comparison, is up 7% in three months and 22% on the year. The average rating on Alphabet’s stock is the equivalent to buy, while the average 12-month price target is $960.59, according to a FactSet survey of roughly 30 analysts. Shares of Alphabet closed $858.45 at Wednesday. They traded down 0.4% to $854.79 Thursday afternoon. What to watch for: This will be the first quarter to highlight Pixel smartphone sales, the company’s iPhone rival that sells at a similarly premium price point. In a note to clients last week, Mizuho analyst Neil Doshi raised his estimate on Alphabet’s Pixel phone to 1 million units for the quarter. The Pixel outlook prompted Mizuho to raise its revenue estimate slightly, to $20.5 billion from $19.9 billion. Will augmented reality or virtual reality win?(3:11) Augmented and virtual reality are growing into multibillion-dollar businesses that will transform how users shop, work and communicate. Intel, HTC, Lenovo and Alphabet showed their latest innovations at CES in Las Vegas. However, Doshi, who has a buy rating and $1,025 target on the stock, said he’s “somewhat skeptical that the Pixel can gain material near-term share,” particularly since Verizon is the only wireless carrier that sells the phone to its customers. The global smartphone industry has decelerated significantly in recent years as customers wait longer to upgrade their phones and purchase unlocked and refurbished phones from third-party retail sites. Meanwhile, Google continues to face advertising pressure amid declines in its core search product. The growth of paid clicks on ads across its sites is expected to increase 26.2% this quarter, according to the FactSet estimate. That would mark a deceleration from 33% last quarter and 31% in the year-earlier period. Read also: Google says driverless cars are ready to make money, but we won’t know if they do Pacific Crest analyst Andy Hargreaves said management could begin to shift the focus to its newer business lines in addition to its legacy products, such as its cloud services and new video programs. In 2017, YouTube is expected to introduce a multichannel video programming distributor service, enabling Google to provide cable-like television services. “Momentum in other businesses with large opportunities will likely be important to maintaining sentiment around Google as the core search business slowly decelerates over the near to medium term,” he said.

(Screen capture) On the occasion of 68th Republic day in India, search engine giant Google has unveiled its doodle honouring the event. The doodle is a great rendition of Lutyen’s open area where the colourful parade will happen in the morning with President Pranab Mukherjee, Prime Minister Narendra Modi and honoured guest Crown Prince of Abu Dhabi Sheikh Mohamed bin Zayed Al Nahyan gracing the event on Rajpath. The doodle is highlighted by large green lettering that spells out ‘Google’ and is placed in a manner that suggests it is part of the pageant with crowds at the extreme ends of the graphic. It has a pleasing look to it except the fact that the spelt out name of the US tech corporate giant is quite big and jars a little. The Constitution of India came into effect on January 26, 1950 and this date is marked every year with a march past where India showcases its armed might as well as its rendition of folk art and other themes that are current in the country. India became a republic after it won freedom from the British Empire (Independence day is August 15, 1947) and chose the Parliamentary form of government with Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru becoming the first Prime Minister of the country. You may also like to watch On such an occasion India also signed a storage deal with the United Arab Emirates (UAE) for storing crude oil at a fascility near Mangalore. Since India’s crude oil imports accounts for around 80 percent of it’s requirements, it becomes particularly necessary to safeguard the inventory at a time of an unforeseen eventuality. This agreement is also seen as a means to further the relationship with UAE in terms of hydrocarbons which has been an effort by the Narendra Modi government. UAE is India’s fifth largest supplier of crude oil and third largest supplier of natural gas. Please Wait while comments are loading...

(Kim Jin-a/Associated Press) Matthew Braga Senior Technology Reporter Matthew Braga is the senior technology reporter for CBC News. He was previously the Canadian editor of Motherboard, Vice Media's science and technology website, and a business and technology reporter for the Financial Post. Email: matthew.braga@cbc.ca @mattbraga SecureDrop (to contact CBC anonymously) PGP Key (for encrypted emails) Related Stories Facebook wants to 'support journalism,' educate readers Facebook introduces tools to combat fake news It's a bad time to be in the fake news business too In the waning months of 2016, two of the world's biggest tech companies decided they would do their part to curb the spread of hoaxes and misinformation on their platforms — by this point, widely referred to under the umbrella of "fake news." Facebook and Google announced they would explicitly ban fake news publishers from using their advertising networks to make money, while Facebook later announced additional efforts to flag and fact-check suspicious news stories in users' feeds. Psychologists say they can inoculate people against fake news How successful have these efforts been? Neither company will say much — but Google, at least, has offered a glimpse. In a report released today, Google says that its advertising team reviewed 550 sites it suspected of serving misleading content from November to December last year. Of those 550 sites, Google took action against 340 of them for violating its advertising policies. "When we say 'take action' that basically means, this is a site that historically was working with Google and our Adsense products to show ads, and now we're no longer allowing our ad systems to support that content," said Scott Spencer, Google's director of product management for sustainable ads in an interview. Nearly 200 publishers — that is, the site operators themselves — were also removed from Google's AdSense network permanently, the company said. Not all of the offenders were caught violating the company's new policy specifically addressing misrepresentation; some may have run afoul of other existing policies. In total, Google says, it took down 1.7 billion ads in violation of its policies in 2016. Questions remain No additional information is contained within the report — an annual review of bad advertising practices that Google dealt with last year. In both an interview and a followup email, Google declined to name any of the publishers that had violated its policies or been permanently removed from its network. Nor could Google say how much money it had withheld from publishers of fake news, or how much money some of its highest-grossing offenders made.  Some fake news site operators have boasted of making thousands of dollars a month in revenue from advertising displayed on their sites. 'I always say the bad guys with algorithms are going to be one step ahead of the good guys with algorithms.' - Susan Bidel, senior analyst at Forrester Research The sites reviewed by Google also represent a very brief snapshot in time — the aftermath of the U.S. presidential election — and Spencer was unable to say how previous months in the year might have compared. "There's no way to know. We take action against sites when they're identified and they violate our policies," Spencer said. "It's not like I can really extrapolate the number." A bigger issue Companies such as Google are only part of the picture. "It's the advertisers' dollars. It's their responsibility to spend it wisely," said Susan Bidel, a senior analyst at Forrester Research who recently co-wrote a report on fake news for marketers and advertisers.  That, however, is easier said than done. Often, advertisers don't know all of the sites on which their ads run — making it difficult to weed out sites designed to serve misinformation. And even if they are able to maintain a partial list of offending sites, "there's no blacklist that's going to be able to keep up with fake news," Bidel said, when publishers can quickly create new sites. Until advertisers have more insight into where their ads run, Bidel said, it's left to advertising platforms such as Google and Facebook to weed out offending sites. In an email, Facebook declined to answer specific questions on its efforts — specifically, how many fake news publishers it has suspended or taken action against, the names of publishers or the amount of revenue Facebook has withheld from publishers of fake news. Instead, the company provided a statement, attributed to an unnamed spokesperson: "It is still early days, but we're looking forward to learning and continuing to roll this out more broadly soon" — "this" referring to its previously announced tools and efforts to address fake news. "I always say the bad guys with algorithms are going to be one step ahead of the good guys with algorithms," Bidel said. "I don't know that you're ever going to be able to eradicate this form of fraud, or any other form of fraud. But it can be brought to some acceptable level — and that level needs to be determined by the industry."

Co-Founder of Clever.do. http://clever.do 4 days ago How to build the next Trello and sell it for $425 million or more Atlassian bought Trello for $425 million. Because Trello was on trajectory to kill Atlassian. So, how do you build the next Trello and get rich? By not building a Trello clone. Why? Trello is a classic example of a disruptive innovation. If you deal with disruptive innovation, the first mover takes everything. Atlassian bought Trello for $425 million not because of its brand or its user base, but because Trello was a big threat to the company’s future. That’s why Google and other companies make similar acquisitions. If you want to build a $400 million startup, build something simple. This essay explains why! The rationale behind Trello’s acquisition. Fog Creek launched Trello in 2011, and six years later sold it for $425 million. It was Atlassian’s biggest acquisition ever. But why did Atlassian pay so much money for Trello? Because Trello disrupted the project tracking space. Products based on disruptive technologies are typically cheaper, simpler, smaller, and more convenient to use. Trello brings a different value proposition to the market. Its value proposition is collaboration and simplicity. Jira’s value proposition is different. It seems that Atlassian is a well-managed company. Its managers did everything according to the books. They listened to their customers, and created a better and more complicated product. By adding new features, they sought to capture new customers. They went upmarket. While the company’s revenue grew, its product became overly complicated and difficult to maintain. By moving upmarket, Atlassian created a vacuum at lower price points into which competitors with disruptive technologies could enter. This is what Trello did. Trello created a cheaper, simpler, and smaller version of Jira. It marketed its product to segments of customers, such as marketers, designers, and managers, which weren’t a focus for Atlassian. In 2011, there was no competition for Trello and it filled the vacuum created by Atlassian. Because Atlassian overshot the market. In their efforts to stay ahead by developing competitively superior products, many companies don’t realize the speed at which they are moving up-market. They fail to recognize that they’re over-satisfying the needs of their original customers as they race the competition towards higher-performance, higher-margin markets. And they fail to see that in doing so, they’re creating a vacuum at lower price points into which competitors employing disruptive technologies can enter. (See Clayton Christensen’s writings in The Innovator’s Dilemma.) Trello Board Example Zapier.com Jira Board Example Atlassian.com At the same time, Jira became expensive. But its mainstream customers would accept fewer features for better pricing. That’s how Atlassian became vulnerable to attack from competitors with cheaper, simpler, and more convenient products. By adding more features, Trello will also move upmarket and cross the mainstream market needs (the blue line). When it crosses the blue line, Jira’s mainstream customers will switch to Trello. This is how disruptive innovation overtakes established products. It happened to other industries, such as disk drives and mainframe computers. It will happen in the project tracking industry too. That’s why Trello became the biggest threat to Atlassian’s future. Trello became an attacker. Its product had less features. It was simple. And it was fucking cheap. It was disruptive! I’m not working for Atlassian. I have no connections to its employees. But I know how it feels when disruptive innovation meets a 15-year-old company. It sucks in all areas! The CEO of Atlassian did it right. Instead of trying to fight the disruptive technology, he accepted it and bought Trello. In an interview, he said: All companies fit into one of two buckets: either becoming a software company or being disrupted by one. Every industry is being fundamentally altered by software. I’m sure many of Atlassian’s employees don’t understand this decision. Because it makes no sense for them. In their minds, Trello is a shitty product compared to Jira. But Atlassian’s CEO secured their jobs and salaries by buying Trello. Because Trello was on trajectory to kill Atlassian! The market reaction was positive. Atlassian’s share price went from $25.03 on January 9th (the date of the announcement) to $28.03 January 23rd. Atlassian failed to build its own Trello. According to Clayton Christensen, leadership in disruptive technology has been very important. Companies that entered the market first were six times more likely to succeed than those that entered later. Therefore, if Atlassian would even create its own version of Trello, there’s no evidence to suggest that product would succeed. Atlassian wasn’t a first mover. But there is a bigger reason than the missed first-mover advantage. Atlassian is a public company. The company needs to grow its business by 30% per year. Therefore, everyone in the company needs to make money. Lots of money. And to make lots of money, you need big customers. In 2016, Atlassian generated $458 million in revenue. To grow 30% in 2017, it needed to generate an additional $137 million. In its shareholder letter, it forecast a total revenue in the range of $597 to $603 million. According to Forbes.com, Trello generates around $10 million in annual recurring revenue. A clone of Trello is not going to help Atlassian reach its goal. Atlassian has many good managers, it seems. Good managers would never allocate resources to build another Trello, because doing so would not solve the company’s main problem: the question of how to grow revenue. Instead, they will do everything necessary to satisfy their biggest customers’ needs. Over time, they have created a set of values. They don’t care about a potential $10 million in revenue. They need an additional $137 million. Therefore, everyone at Atlassian has a focus on big customers and their needs. And big customers want a bigger, better, more complicated product. As we’ve learned, products based on disruptive technologies are typically cheaper, simpler, smaller, and more convenient. That’s the opposite of what Atlassian does. Atlassian’s set of values has no room for Trello’s disruptive innovation. So what happens after the acquisition of Trello? I remember when Google bought Android. Android’s operations were not fully integrated into Google’s main business. Even Google’s employees had no access to the Android offices. As we can see, it was one of the Google’s best acquisitions. But why didn’t Google integrate Android into its main business? Simple. Because Google’s processes, values, and culture would have killed Android. That’s one of the main reasons for not integrating newly acquired companies. Atlassian is a 15-year-old-company. It has established processes, values, and culture. It works with different customer segments than Trello. Atlassian has 1,700 employees. Its executives now need to make a decision: Should the company integrate Trello or not. If Atlassian’s executives are smart, they will not integrate Trello into their main business. And for Trello employees: If you hear that integration is on the way, start looking for a new job. If integration happens, it’s the beginning of the end. Because Trello is not a part of Atlassian’s values. If something is not a part of a company’s values, there is no priority for it! The values of an organization are the criteria by which decisions about priorities are made, and the prioritization of decisions affects employees at every level. The values of successful firms tend to evovle in a predictable fashion in at least two dimensions. The first relates to acceptable gross margins. The second dimension along which values predictably change relates to how big a business must be in order to remain interesting. (Again, please see Clayton Christensen’s work in The Innovator’s Dilemma.) Trello has created a new emerging market. There are no $800 million emerging markets. When emerging markets are small, they are least attractive to large companies. Therefore, Trello will become underserved in money and resources inside Atlassian. Trello will become the new Jira! In a blog post, the CEO of Atlassian wrote: “Trello will become an important part of the Atlassian portfolio.” I guess it’s too early to tell the truth. It will be the other way around. In a few years, Trello will cross the blue line. Everything that mainstream customers want will be available in Trello. It’s the tipping point for customers of Jira. They will start to migrate to Trello. By crossing the blue line, Trello will enter the mainstream market. Trello will start to drive huge profits for Atlassian. The revenue generated by Trello will be higher than the revenue generated by Jira. This is the simple reason why Trello will become the new Jira! Of course, many of you think I’m crazy. But this is how disruptive innovation works. The weaknesses of Trello today will become strengths tomorrow. These are the next $400 million startups. Zapier published statistics about the fastest growing apps. In first place was Airtable, with a growth rate of 682%. I hadn’t heard of Airtable, and I was curious to know what it does. I checked out its website and learned that it’s basically a cheaper and simpler version of Microsoft Access. As we established earlier, products based on disruptive technologies are typically cheaper, simpler, smaller, and more convenient to use. What about Quip, the cloud-based word processing app? It was founded in 2012 and sold to Salesforce for $750 million. Quip is similar to Trello. Both are simple in terms of functionality. Quip is a disruptive innovation to Google Docs and Google Sheets. Just like how Google disrupted Microsoft Office not that many years ago. While some companies move upmarket and create complex products, others use the vacuum for innovation as an entry point. Through observation, you can find a vacuum in many industries. By filling the vacuum with simpler and cheaper technology, you can build a $400 million startup. There are some interesting industries waiting for disruptive innovation. One is the almost $4 billion marketing automation industry. Many years ago, the leaders in the marketing automation software field overshot the market. The same happened to the accounting software market. Scott Cook, Intuit’s founder, decided that the makers of accounting software for small businesses had overshot the functionality required by that market, thus creating an opportunity for a disruptive software technology that provided adequate but not superior functionality (and which was simple and convenient to use). Quickbooks proceeded to capture 70% of the market within two years of its introduction (Christensen). Create something new, but simpler and cheaper. Make something the mainstream market doesn’t want now, but will want later. The weaknesses of today will become the strengths of tomorrow.

Is the Internet still an equal playing field, or are the megacorps taking over? Sebastian Anthony (UK) - Jun 13, 2015 10:50 pm UTC Sebastian Anthony reader comments 144 Share this story LONDON—At Shoreditch Town Hall on Thursday, at an event hosted by Intelligence Squared and Vanity Fair, the longevous British broadcaster Jeremy Paxman of University Challenge fame asked the audience of few hundred: "Is the Internet a failed utopia?" He asked us to vote on the matter by raising our hands. About two-thirds of the audience disagreed with the statement, a fair few (including myself) were undecided, and only a smattering of people actually thought the Internet was a failed utopia. It was then the turn of four panellists, in the style of an electoral hustings or stump speech, to change our minds. In the failed-utopia camp were Andrew Keen and Frank Pasquale; in the not-a-failed-utopia faction were Peter Barron and Beth Noveck. They took it in turns to deliver quite rousing speeches. The naysayers obviously had the harder job from the outset—we were at an event that was specifically tailored for fans of the Internet, after all—but they did a good job of reminding us that the Internet, as it stands, is not the elysium that we were all promised at its inception. Keen warned us that, while we think the Internet is an idyllic plateau where everyone is on an even footing, where two guys in a garage can compete with the monolithic, infrastructure-owning giants, we're all deluding ourselves: just like the real world, the Internet is now ruled by big corporations. The utopian speakers, Barron and Noveck, mostly focused on all of the cool things that wouldn't have been possible before the Internet and World Wide Web were created. Noveck, who was a driving force behind President Obama's Open Government Initiative, reminded us that, with a smartphone in your pocket, you have access to more information than the president of the United States did 25 years ago. Barron, who is a public affairs bod at Google, spoke about the equality of opportunity on the Internet—and of course, about all the free services that we get to enjoy. After the speeches concluded, there was a Q&A session. Barron, who I'm sure has spent a not-insignificant amount of his career defending the contradictory nature of Google's "don't be evil" motto and the pressure his company has come under from EU antitrust investigations, was viciously attacked by Keen: "You argue that you're doing good, but you're not, you're just doing business." Barron, who was visibly a bit rattled, couldn't do much more than assure us that Google never sells your data, and does its utmost to keep its databases secure. Enlarge / The venue for the digital summit, Shoreditch Town Hall, was rather magnificent. Sebastian Anthony A loaded question Eventually, Paxman called another vote, to see if the speeches and questioning had swayed us at all. To the credit of the audience, a lot of people changed their minds: there was still a majority against the question of the Internet being a failed utopia, but now almost all of the undecideds had swung to the failed utopia camp. I was one of the few remaining undecideds. Putting aside the faulty premise of the argument—"is the Internet a failed utopia?" is a completely loaded question—the main reason I was undecided is that it's too soon to decide if the Internet has been a success or failure. The real question should've been: is the Internet going in the right direction or not? When you look at it through that lens, it becomes a much more complicated issue, but the answers that you might stumble upon by working through it are probably more useful. Is the Internet an equal playing field where anyone can be successful, or should we worry that the Facebooks and Googles of the Internet are in the process of divvying up cyberspace into the same megacorp-monopolised tranches that we see in the capitalist real world? Do we truly have freedom of speech and expression on the Internet, or will the world's governments pass legislation that keeps the Web firmly under control? Even if the Internet does feel like it's swinging towards capitalism and consolidation, should we worry? Again, if we zoom out a little, the Internet is still very young. Things—cultural changes, societal shifts, the emergence of disruptive technologies—happen very quickly nowadays. I don't think it's a coincidence that the Deep Web has grown as quickly as it has. Likewise, I don't think it's surprising that we've seen an upswell of community-owned or local-government-operated broadband networks, and apps like FireChat that allow for ad hoc device-to-device mesh networks. That's the whole point of the Internet. It's a network of networks. The Internet isn't the work of a single company or country; Google's network can exist on the same Internet as the UK's hyper-surveilled network, which in turn can exist on the same Internet as the Tor-shadowed Deep Web. If it looks like a country or company is starting to get a little too powerful, it doesn't mean that the Internet has failed; it's just the digital equivalent of teenage growing pains. Ultimately, despite any misgivings about the current state of the Internet, I don't think anyone disputes that it has made a wealth of human knowledge freely available to billions of people. Knowledge that, among many other things, includes the details of how to build another Internet. If this Internet becomes a failed utopia, then someone will just make another one and try again.

Ron Amadeo - Jan 10, 2017 12:20 am UTC reader comments 72 Share this story One of Google's early self-driving car prototypes. Note the giant roof-mounted LIDAR sensor, the black radar box on the front fender (one of four), and the "wheel encoder" mounted on the back wheel. There were also video cameras inside the cabin. This model had $150,000 worth of extra equipment. KAREN BLEIER/AFP/GettyImages A big component of Google's early prototypes was the LIDAR sensor, a Velodyne HDL-64E, which costs around $75,000. Velodyne Since 2009, Velodyne has worked on cheaper and smaller LIDAR products, too. The "Velodyne LIDAR Puck" (right) is down to $8000. Velodyne In Google's (now Waymo's) custom-built cars, everything is more integrated. The black radar sensors live in the "nose" and side mirrors, the wheel encoder is integrated and invisible, and the Google-designed LIDAR rig is down to a little fez hat. The stumpy shape of the car lets the LIDAR sensor see all around the car without having to be propped up on a riser. Google The Waymo Chrysler Pacifica moves back to retrofitting an existing design, which leads to radar warts on the fenders and grill, and the large size means the LIDAR sensor is back on a riser. Waymo It looks like, due to the large size of the minivan, Waymo and Chrysler had to add some extra sensors to the back of the roof. Waymo Right now self-driving cars are a technical challenge. No amount of sensors and mapping can currently produce a 100 percent reliable self-driving car, but plenty of companies are working on it. When this technology does hit the market, the inevitable question is going to be "how much extra does it cost?" Waymo, the Alphabet self-driving car division that was recently spun off from Google, is working on getting that cost as low as possible. According to a recent article from Bloomberg, the company has spent the last 12 months working on "scalability." The company's efforts have lead to a "90 percent" decrease in the cost of the LIDAR sensor, which is typically the most costly item in a self-driving car solution. On a self-driving car, the LIDAR  sensor is a spinning cylinder that usually sits on the roof. By bouncing a laser off an object and measuring the time of flight, LIDAR can tell how far away something is. Thanks to the spinning, these sensors can "see" in 360 degrees. Most self-driving car solutions use LIDAR as the major sensor, giving the car a "big picture" view of the world so it can see pedestrians and other vehicles. The first public Google Self-Driving Car prototype, built on a Toyota Prius, is a good example of how everything works. The biggest component was the Velodyne HDL-64E LIDAR sensor, which cost a whopping $75,000. The LIDAR sensor needed to be up high to see around the vehicle, so Google mounted it on a large riser. This 360 degree sensing was good for a distance view, but not great at detecting up-close objects, thanks to a dead zone around the LIDAR and obstructions from the car body. To fix this, Google augmented the LIDAR input with several black radar boxes stuck to the front and back of the vehicle. These boxes filled in the blanks for close objects. Google tried roof-mounted GPS sensors, but GPS isn't accurate enough for self-driving. So, for movement tracking, Google used a "wheel encoder:" an exposed wire ran out of the roof, down the side of the vehicle, and connected to a metal stick that was mounted to a spindle on the wheel. The encoder measured wheel revolutions, which was a dead-simple way of measuring lateral movement. In addition to that, there was a video camera mounted in the cabin and a computer for recording, processing, a cloud communication. At the Driverless Car Summit in 2012, Google disclosed that its self-driving cars used $150,000 in extra equipment. Cutting down on costs will be a major factor in getting self-driving cars to the masses. John Krafcik, Waymo's chief executive officer, told Bloomberg "We've made tremendous progress in our software, and we're focused on making our hardware reliable and scalable. This has been one of the biggest areas of focus on our team for the past 12 months." Krafcik also told Bloomberg the new sensor package on the Waymo Chrysler Pacifica is "highly effective in rain, fog, and snow," which have typically been trouble for LIDAR systems thanks to the reflective nature of water in the air. If we do a bit of math and apply Krafcik's "90 percent" reduction claim to the $75,000 LIDAR sensor Google's self-driving car originally used, we end up with a $7500 price tag. While Waymo isn't using Velodyne sensors anymore, Velodyne has been hard at work cutting down on the cost of LIDAR sensors, too. The company's newest sensor, the Velodyne LIDAR Puck, is also down to $8000, and Velodyne is working on even cheaper "solid state" LIDAR solutions that don't offer a 360-degree view. Cutting costs on these LIDAR devices also cuts down on their capabilities, though. So the major question is, how does Waymo's sensor resolution compare to Velodyne's? How the Velodyne LIDAR sees the world. The "64" in "HDL-64E" refers to the number of channels. There are 64 lasers, so you get 64 lines of data. Also note the center deadzone of data—you're going to need more than just LIDAR if you want to see close to the vehicle. Velodyne The $75,000 Velodyne HDL-64E is $75,000 because it uses 64 lasers and 64 photodiodes to scan the world (a laser/photodiode pair is a "channel" in LIDAR parlance). This results in 64 "lines" of data output, which you can see in the image above. The $8000 Velodyne Puck only has 16 channels, so while it is cheaper and less complex, you're also getting a much lower resolution view of the world. Eventually you can cut a LIDAR system down to something cheap enough to fit in sub-$1000 consumer devices like the LIDAR-powered Neato Botvac robotic vacuum, which uses a single-laser system for a 2D view of the world. At what point does the system become too low resolution to be useful for a self-driving car, though? Waymo seems to favor a higher-detail view of the world, with Krafcik saying "The detail we capture is so high that, not only can we detect pedestrians all around us, but we can tell which direction they’re facing. This is incredibly important, as it helps us more accurately predict where someone will walk next." The Bloomberg article doesn't dive into the technical specs of a Waymo's LIDAR sensor. Since Waymo is making its own hardware and software, it can find the right balance between cheap-but-not-too-cheap hardware and pair it with software that can make sense of the data.

It could be just the thing for virtual reality. Cameras by Stephen Shankland January 24, 2017 5:00 AM PST @stshank Up Next Meet Jon Hamm, the hologram (aka the holohamm) Enlarge Image The five-lens PMast, shown here in a computer rendering Distant Focus If you're trying to create immersive virtual-reality video today, you've got a problem: choosing between a camera that's compact or a bulkier one that offers sharp imagery. Researchers at the University of California at San Diego, though, have found a way to get the best of both worlds. It's a camera called PMast. The camera is just a prototype today, a cube bulging with lenses and laced with fiber-optic cables. But the design eventually could help bring immersive video to movies, sports and concerts. That's critical as virtual reality -- the technology to digitally transport you into an African safari or an Himalayan ascent -- starts to take off with high-profile backers like Facebook, Google and Samsung all investing in different headsets. Hollywood's also dabbling in VR, looking for fresh tech spins on traditional storytelling. At the Sundance Film Festival this week, virtual reality's one of the attractions in movies like "Dear Angelica," which wants to get you inside a painter's brain. But while there are a number of different setups, from the high-end $600 Oculus Rift from Facebook to Google's $50 Daydream headset, there's still insufficient VR content to tempt mainstream consumers. While a handful of companies are starting to build smaller, more convenient 360-degree cameras, PMast is as compact as a handful of cheap GoPro action cameras but can capture the rich, high-resolution imagery that professionals need, said Joseph Ford, a UCSD professor who helped lead the project. Enlarge Image The five-lens PMast, upper right, is about the size of a conventional SLR but can capture many more megapixels of wraparound video. UCSD "Ultimately we'd love to work with a camera developer," Ford said. "When they've reached the point where the lens is a significant part of the weight and bulk and obtrusiveness of the camera, then our lens offers a solution." Camera frontier PMast's creators, the Photonic Systems Integration Laboratory and Distant Focus Corporation, aren't the only ones tackling the problems of 360-degree video. Google's Jump technology is designed to make it easier for videographers to build their own VR camera designs. GoPro is a prominent Jump partner with its GoPro Odyssey camera rig, and Imax and Yi also have Jump designs. Other makers of wraparound camera include Jaunt and Nokia, whose high-end Ozo costs $60,000. It's not clear yet whether 360-degree video will grow up from today's niche uses like virtual tourism. You can watch panoramic video on sites like Facebook and YouTube, but it can be tough telling where you should be looking when the action can be all around you. VR headsets offer a better way to watch wraparound video, since it's easy to turn your head to see what's going on, but few people own them and image quality so far isn't very high. Given the visceral impact of the medium, though, plenty of technology companies and video creators are seeing what's possible. Pricing for the PMast design is hard to pin down -- it was designed for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) and not as a commercial project. But it won't be cheap. Cinema-grade cameras typically cost tens of thousands of dollars. Curvaceous PMast, a cubic design about the size of a conventional SLR, combines unusual spherical lenses with even more unusual bundles of carefully engineered fiber-optic strands. Five faces have spherical lenses bubbling out and large 25-megapixel sensors within. The sixth face has a camera mounting stalk and a fiber-optic link that sends data to computers that stitch the images into a single wraparound video. A core innovation in the PMast is a lens that looks more like a marble than the convex and concave disks you'll see in conventional camera lenses. The 16mm sphere is smaller in diameter than a dime and provides excellent optical performance. "Spherical lenses are insanely good at focusing light," Ford said. Enlarge Image The diagram at left shows how light travels through the spherical (monocentric) lens then focuses on the inner surface of the fiber-optic bundle. The image at right shows the fiber-optic bundle itself, about an inch on edge. UCSD Well, insanely good as long as you throw out a fundamental design principle of today's camera. Mainstream lenses are complicated in part because they have to focus an image on a flat image sensor. Spherical lenses are no good at focusing an image on a plane. But the PMast team figured a way around the problem using fiber optics, superthin threads of glass that can transmit light along their length. A bundle of high-end fiber-optic strands, bent inward the way your fingertips converge when you're trying to pick up a tiny screw you dropped on the floor, provides the concave spherical surface on which the lens focuses its image. Those fibers then carry the image to the flat surface of the sensor. Five lens-sensor modules are mounted onto the PMast's cubic frame. Electronics there pull the data off the sensors, but most of the grunt work of image processing -- tasks like correcting color and contrast -- takes place on an accompanying cart with five beefy computers. The cart's bulk contrasts with the compactness of the camera, but the good news is that the computers can be hidden away thanks to a long fiber-optic line. That's perfect if you're shooting a movie with some future version of PMast. And someday, Ford hopes, he'll see that movie. "Nothing could be more satisfying than go to a Hollywood premiere," he said. CNET Magazine: Check out a sampling of the stories you'll find in CNET's newsstand edition, right here.

Ron Amadeo - Aug 21, 2013 3:55 am UTC The Google Helpouts invite page reader comments 51 Share this story Google has quietly launched a website for "Google Helpouts," a new p2p video chat helpline service. Anyone can sign up to receive or provide help, and providers can make money off chat sessions. While Helpouts has yet to launch, a good deal of information can be gained from the support site. Anyone can sign up to provide help; just enter in your skills, availability, qualifications, and pricing, and Google will match you with people in need of your assistance. You can even include an introductory video of the services you'll be providing. Once you're all set up, customers can schedule a video chat session during your available hours. Of course, the service requires a Google+ account. If you choose to charge someone for your time, payments will be handled by Google Wallet, and Google will take a 20 percent cut. The support pages confirm support for desktop browsers, Android, and iOS, and Google is promising a 100 percent money back guarantee for unhappy customers. The setup for some helpout listings can be pretty elaborate. This page shows that you can style your helpouts like a structured course, including any preparation or materials the person might need before starting. Google even has a process in place to verify medical certificates and licences. If this at all sounds interesting to you, head on over to helpouts.google.com and request an invite.

Peter Bright - Sep 4, 2015 9:55 pm UTC SHANLISS_SNAPPER reader comments 113 Share this story While the Chrome browser is extremely popular, it has gained something of a reputation. What hippos are to little plastic balls, Chrome is to memory: hungry, hungry. Chrome 45, released earlier this week, should make Google's browser a little lighter. The company described some improvements yesterday that should reduce the browser's footprint. Perhaps the most significant change for tab hoarders such as myself is new behavior when reloading all your tabs when you first launch the browser. Chrome 45 does a couple of things differently. First, it loads the tabs from most to least recently used. This should mean that the tabs you're most interested in and want to use first will be the first to load. Second, if your system is low on memory, it will stop restoring tabs in the background. Clicking the tab to view it will, of course, load it, but otherwise it'll remain dormant. Idle tabs, too, should see reduced memory usage, especially when they're used to run complex Web applications with lots of JavaScript. JavaScript is a garbage collected language; the JavaScript engine periodically scans its memory for unused objects and frees all those that it finds. The Chrome JavaScript engine, V8, in common with many other typical garbage collectors, also compacts memory; during garbage collection, objects are packed to be closer together to eliminate or reduce the number of gaps between objects. This in turn allows the garbage collector to free up larger blocks of memory and return those to the operating system. In Chrome 45, the garbage collector has been tuned to detect when a page is idle and then be more aggressive about collecting and compacting memory. The result is that background tabs should over time have their memory usage trimmed to become closer to the minimum possible usage. Google has a video demonstrating this in action; two Gmail tabs are opened, one in Chrome 45, the other in Chrome 43. While initially the memory usage is very similar, as the tabs are left to idle for longer, the Chrome 45 tab starts shrinking its memory usage aggressively. After a couple of minutes spent idle, Chrome 45's JavaScript memory is about 55 percent of Chrome 43's. That's a substantial savings. While this obviously won't do much for simple static pages, popular long-running Web apps like Gmail and Slack are likely to reap big rewards. Chrome 45 also includes a power-saving feature that was first turned on in Chrome betas in June. The browser attempts to distinguish between Flash content that's essential to a page—an embedded video, say—and Flash content that's non-essential—typically, ads. The important content will continue to play normally, but with the new power feature enabled; the unimportant content will be automatically paused. Google says that its preliminary testing of this feature has shown positive results, with as much as 15 percent longer battery life, and it will be turned on by default over the next few weeks. This is not to say that Chrome is now actually a slimline browser. It's still greedy, and the jokes about it swallowing all your memory aren't going to stop any time soon. Nonetheless, it's encouraging that Google is working to make this problem—arguably one of Chrome's biggest issues—a little bit better. Peter Bright Peter is Technology Editor at Ars.

Google issues warning of critical Windows vulnerability in wild Privilege escalation bug in Windows kernel is “being actively exploited." Sean Gallagher - Oct 31, 2016 9:00 pm UTC Enlarge / Win32k.sys has some problems. Again. reader comments 134 Share this story Recently, Google’s Threat Analysis Group discovered a set of zero-day vulnerabilities in Adobe Flash and the Microsoft Windows kernel that were already being actively used by malware attacks against the Chrome browser. Google alerted both Adobe and Microsoft of the discovery on October 21, and Adobe issued a critical fix to patch its vulnerability last Friday. But Microsoft has yet to patch a critical bug in the Windows kernel that allows these attacks to work—which prompted Google to publicly announce the vulnerabilities today. “After 7 days, per our published policy for actively exploited critical vulnerabilities, we are today disclosing the existence of a remaining critical vulnerability in Windows for which no advisory or fix has yet been released,” wrote Neel Mehta and Billy Leonard of Google’s Threat Analysis Group.”This vulnerability is particularly serious because we know it is being actively exploited.” The bug being exploited could allow an attacker to escape from Windows’ security sandbox. The sandbox, which normally allows only user-level applications to execute, lets programs execute without needing administrator access while isolating what it can access on the local system through a set of policies. But by using a specific type of call to a legacy support Windows system library generally used for the graphics subsystem—win32k.sys—malicious code can escalate its privileges and execute outside of the sandbox, allowing it to execute code with full access to the Windows environment. Win32k.sys has been a problem before: Microsoft issued a warning back in June about a similar privilege escalation problem that had not yet been exploited, and another arrived in August. Google Chrome already blocks this sort of an attack on Windows 10 using a modification to the Chromium sandbox called “Win32k lockdown.” That approach explicitly denies access to the library. However, code executed in other Web browsers or otherwise launched outside Chrome could still exploit the vulnerability. Sean Gallagher Sean is Ars Technica's IT Editor.

Jennifer Baker (UK) - Nov 10, 2016 2:41 pm UTC Illustration by Aurich Lawson reader comments 89 Share this story Google—as expected—has dismissed the European Commission's charge that the ad giant abused Android’s dominance to block its competitors in the market. Further ReadingWhy Google’s monopoly abuse case in Europe will run and run The company is accused of using Android’s position as the dominant smartphone operating system in Europe to force manufacturers to pre-install Google services while locking out competitors. Competition commissioner Margrethe Vestager sent a so-called Statement of Objections to Google in April. On Thursday, the multinational corporation defended its position and spoke of the open source nature of the Android operating system. It also compared a typical Android smartphone to rivals Apple and Microsoft. According to Google, 39 out of 39 pre-installed apps are from Apple on iPhone 7, and 39 out of 47 pre-installed apps on the Microsoft Lumia 550 are from Microsoft. In a blog post on Thursday, Google general counsel Kent Walker said: "The response we filed today shows how the Android ecosystem carefully balances the interests of users, developers, hardware makers, and mobile network operators. Android hasn’t hurt competition, it’s expanded it." The 100-plus page response to the commission focuses on metrics in an attempt to add weight to the claim that it hasn't abused any competitive advantage. Walker said: The commission’s case is based on the idea that Android doesn’t compete with Apple’s iOS. We don’t see it that way. In fact, 89 percent of respondents to the commission’s own market survey confirmed that Android and Apple compete. To ignore competition with Apple is to miss the defining feature of today’s competitive smartphone landscape. Walker claimed that possible remedies to resolve the case could create fragmentation in the mobile ecosystem. "The commission’s preliminary findings underestimate the importance of developers," he said. Walker continued: The commission argues that we shouldn’t offer some Google apps as part of a suite. No manufacturer is obliged to preload any Google apps on an Android phone. But we do offer manufacturers a suite of apps so that when you buy a new phone, you can access a familiar set of basic services. Android’s competitors, including Apple’s iPhone and Microsoft’s Windows phone, not only do the same, but they allow much less choice. Vestager can fine the search behemoth up to 10 percent of its global turnover—around $7.4 billion (£5.9 billion)—if she finds Google guilty of wrongdoing. Google is currently appealing against a similar case in Russia after authorities fined the company approximately 438 million rubles  ($6.8 million, £5.25 million) in an almost identical Android antitrust case earlier this year. Yandex, Russia's biggest search engine and the main complainant in that case, is also one of four complainants in the EU case. Google rivals Microsoft, Nokia, and Oracle—under the Fairsearch umbrella organisation—lodged the first complaint against Android in 2013. Fairsearch said in a statement to Ars: Google says there's no problem because Android is 'open.' The truth is that Android is today a closed operating system, and any claim to the contrary is disingenuous. Any manufacturer or network operator seeking to differentiate its devices or services is prevented from doing so by the web of Google's contractual restrictions. Google imposes severe sanctions on those who defy its insistence on conformity. For example, a phone maker that offers even a few phones that do not comply with Google's straitjacket faces a cut-off from all of Google’s branded products. US ad-blocking firm Disconnect and Aptoide, a rival Portuguese Android app store, have also complained. None had responded to requests for comment from Ars at time of publication. Google separately faces antitrust charges on favouring its own search services and price comparison offerings over those of its rivals and for allegedly breaching competition rules with its mammoth ad business. Last week, Google rebuffed both of those charges.

Peter Bright - Nov 16, 2016 3:30 pm UTC reader comments 175 Share this story NEW YORK—At its first Connect event in 2013, Microsoft released Visual Studio 2013. In 2014, it announced the open sourcing of .NET and in 2015, the open sourcing of the Visual Studio Code editor. The big news this year? Microsoft, the company that has built an empire on proprietary, closed-source software, has joined the Linux Foundation as a platinum member. Microsoft has been a big contributor to Linux over the past several years, primarily focusing on improving support for its Hyper-V hypervisor. Jim Zemlin, executive director of the Linux Foundation, said that in becoming a member, "Microsoft is better able to collaborate with the open source community to deliver transformative mobile and cloud experiences to more people." Microsoft's increasing commitment to open source has been met with some cynicism (and please, beloved commenters—try to refrain from "embrace, extend, extinguish" posts, as the very concept is preposterous when it comes to Linux), but, with projects such as Visual Studio Code and .NET, it is starting to win hearts and minds. The company does appear to be a reasonably good open source citizen, not merely publishing source code repositories that are occasionally updated from an internal development branch, but actually performing development in the open, accepting community contributions and seeking community consensus when it comes to new features. This leads to a second surprise membership: Google is joining the .NET Foundation and will be part of the Steering Group. While some parts of Google have been very warm to some Microsoft projects—in particular, the developers of the Angular framework are fans of the TypeScript language and Visual Studio Code—this nonetheless feels like a surprising move. Google has shown little interest in .NET and, with Android, is in fact heavily invested in Java, .NET's major competitor. However, .NET is still a major part of corporate development, and it would likely serve the company well to improve .NET support in Google Cloud Platform, if nothing else. Samsung is already a member of the .NET Foundation and has .NET news today, too: the company is releasing a preview of Visual Studio Tools for Tizen, allowing developers to build .NET applications for Samsung's non-Android smart devices, such as TVs, wearables, and Internet of Things gizmos. One of the pieces of news that Microsoft hoped would make a big splash was the release of Visual Studio for Mac; unfortunately the company spoiled the surprise itself, by publishing the news prematurely. The name is a little misleading, as the new Mac development environment is a derivative of Xamarin Studio rather than a port of Visual Studio. As we wrote on Monday, they're not completely separate: core portions are identical between the two, and Mac and Windows developers will be able to share projects between platforms with ease. Again spoiled by Redmond, the next version of Visual Studio has a name, too: it's Visual Studio 2017, and a release candidate is out today. SQL Server 2016 Service Pack 1 is also out today. This would normally not be tremendously interesting news, but this Service Pack has a difference. Traditionally, the different versions of SQL Server (Express, Standard, and Enterprise, from smallest to largest) have offered different features. They're all built on the same core engine, but some capabilities, such as in-memory transactional databases, were only available in the more expensive versions. This made it hard for developers to justify using those features; if customers may be using a mix of Standard and Enterprise, for example, many developers will stick with the Standard feature set and ignore Enterprise capabilities. Service Pack 1 makes all SQL Server versions functionally identical. They still have differences in terms of the number of processor cores and amount of RAM they can use, but going forward, that's the only difference between SKUs. Microsoft's hope is that this will result in greater adoption of previously high-end features such as data warehousing and transparent database encryption. The company made a similar change with Windows Server licensing a few years ago, broadly unifying features across SKUs, using the different price points to govern hardware scaling and virtual machine licensing. Alongside this, the company is releasing a preview edition of the next version of SQL Server—for Windows and, for the first time, Linux. In developing SQL Server for Linux, the company says that it has strived to make the database engine work and act like a native Linux application to as great an extent as possible. Installation, for example, will use RPM or DEB packages (depending on distribution), and it will support running within Docker containers. Microsoft is not offering full feature parity in this release, but it says that all the major engine features, including the in-memory capabilities and encryption, will be cross-platform. Major administration will continue to use the Visual Studio-based tooling that the Windows edition uses; for most intents and purposes, the two versions should be interchangeable, with few differences visible to developers. The initial announcement of SQL Server for Linux caught many off guard, as it wasn't immediately clear who would want to use it, or why. That's now becoming somewhat clearer: avoiding Oracle. SQL Server has a rich and diverse feature set (especially with the feature unification across SKUs) and is typically somewhat cheaper than Oracle. That makes it appealing even to Linux shops.

Peter Bright - Dec 20, 2016 8:15 pm UTC Enlarge / The view from Mount Wycheproof. It's not very spectacular. Prince Roy reader comments 24 Share this story Google's Project Wycheproof is a new effort by Google to improve the security of widely used cryptography code. Many of the algorithms used in cryptography for encryption, decryption, and authentication are complicated, especially when asymmetric, public key cryptography is being used. Over the years, these complexities have resulted in a wide range of bugs in real crypto libraries and the software that uses them. Google's ambition with Project Wycheproof is to ensure that these known flaws are eradicated. The open source project contains a number of test cases that check for these known flaws; currently, there are more than 80 tests for 40 different defects. The project is limited in scope and realistically attainable, hence the name that Google has chosen: Mount Wycheproof is a hill that some claim is the world's smallest mountain. Its peak is 237 meters above sea level and just 43 meters above the surrounding plain. Scaling such a mountain is a straightforward proposition. Here's an example of the kind of thing that Google is testing for: one set of tests is for the elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key agreement protocol that's used to securely share an encryption key between a client and a server without risking that an eavesdropper learns of the key. Both the client and the server have their own private key that they need to keep secret from one another. The algorithm has an implementation vulnerability: if a malicious client structures its key in a particular way, it can trick the server to which it's connecting into disclosing its private key. This malicious behavior can be detected as long as the server performs certain checks on the client's key, but not all libraries do this correctly. Project Wycheproof includes a test for this flaw, and the development of this test has already yielded fruit. The popular Bouncy Castle crypto library didn't handle the malicious client key situation correctly. Hence, it was vulnerable to leaking the server's private key. Aiming at encryption libraries gives the project particularly high bang for its buck: these libraries are used and reused by thousands of other pieces of software, so their bugs can have an impact that runs far and wide. Fixing these flaws at the source gives a high return on investment. Presently, Wycheproof only contains Java tests, written to test crypto libraries that use the Java Cryptography Architecture. Java is designed so that crypto libraries can be developed and act as drop-in replacements for one another, as long as they all conform to a particular API. This enables one set of tests to easily be used against multiple different libraries. It's also of particular relevance and interest to Google due to Android's use of the same Java APIs. Google intends to expand the tests to other languages and libraries in the future. Peter Bright Peter is Technology Editor at Ars.

Amazon's Alexa dominated 2017's Consumer Electronics Show, Google Assistant is woven into the fabric of all Google services, Siri accessible with one-tap on everything from the iPhone to AirPods, and Microsoft's Cortana could represent the future of Windows' mobile strategy. The boom in personalized AI products implies a macro trend towards voice-controlled computer interface products that, if embraced by business and consumers, could portend a profound shift in how humans interact with machines. More about Innovation How Seattle wants to avoid becoming a 'dumb smart city' 10 Amazon Alexa skills to add to your Echo today Transhumanism: Should we use robotics to enhance humans? Subscribe to TechRepublic's Next Big Thing newsletter Due to the prevalence of mobile devices, it's easy to forget that Apple, Google, and Microsoft all offer sophisticated voice-controlled virtual assistants for PCs as well. Microsoft's speech recognition AI is not perfect but is a cornerstone of Windows 10, and with the right software and speech training can be used to control a bevy of desktop applications. SEE: Windows spotlight: 30 tips and tricks for power users (Tech Pro Research) Gaming helped push the limits of PC speech interface innovation. Late last year an inspired developer discovered how to use Amazon's Echo to control the space simulator Elite:Dangerous. Amazon recently launched a game engine called Lumberyard and attracted Elite:Dangerous competitor Star Citizen to the cloud platform. Soon Amazon could offer game and PC controls as a core ingredient of the Alexa platform. Elite: Dangerous and Star Citizen voice controls both rely on a Windows application called VoiceAttack. Though it was developed to control video games VoiceAttack can use Microsoft's speech recognition software to launch and control many Windows 10 applications. Getting started: First, prepare your machine to install the program. VoiceAttack supports and updates the software, but as with any installation make sure you back up your machine and make sure your Windows 10 install is bug-free. Next, point your browser to https://voiceattack.com/#download-1 to download the latest version of the software. Note that VoiceAttack offers a free trial and costs $9.99 for the premium version. Free users can try out every feature available to premium users but are limited to a total of 20 voice commands. Finally, install the software and follow the configuration prompts. Make sure to read and follow the instructions carefully and avoid quickly skipping through the wizard. Image: Microsoft Setup: Attach a Windows 10-compatible microphone to your computer. This can be your webcam mic, a high-quality external mic, or a desktop mic. Generally, the better your microphone the better Windows will recognize your voice. This story was produced using the Logitech C920 webcam microphone. Before you continue with VoiceAttack configuration, you will train Microsoft's speech recognition software. In the Windows 10 Cortana search menu type, speech and click the microphone icon. This will launch the Windows Speech Recognition application. Follow the speech recognition fine-tuning instructions and make sure to save or print the Windows Speech Recognition commands reference sheet. As with the VoiceAttack installation, do not skip the tutorial. Image: Microsoft Next, configure Windows Voice Training and follow the prompts to speak to your computer. Windows will walk you through a tutorial session that involves reading several paragraphs out loud. Each session takes approximately 10 minutes to complete. This is the most time-consuming but important part of the process. For best results, make sure you tune Windows voice recognition two or three times. Now you're ready to configure and use VoiceAttack. Launch the application. You will likely be met with a prompt to close Microsoft's Speech Recognition. Click Yes and allow VoiceAttack to be your primary voice recognition application. VoiceAttack will rely on the Windows voice training but operate as the default front end application. Image: VoiceAttack Launch VoiceAttack and issue a spoken command, like open Slack. VoiceAttack will show you a log of recognized and unrecognized commands. VoiceAttack also allows you to select and customize various input methods and applications. Add custom commands by clicking the + icon in the application menu. Here you can add custom commands, or import premade commands. The VoiceAttack forums are loaded with Windows commands. Practice. It takes time to train Microsoft and VoiceAttack to understand your unique vocal patterns. The more you use the applications, the better they respond. If you encounter problems or hiccups refer to the VoiceAttack Quick Start guide and How-To guide. Bonus: Replace the default voice with William Shatner. HCS Voice Packs creates audio packages that can replace the default Windows and VoiceAttack voices. Our favorite, of course, is the William Shatner voice pack. The legendary Star Trek captain produced hours of dialogue for both Elite: Dangerous and Windows and at your command will share information about the Big Bang, black holes, and other cool space facts. Image: HCS Voice Packs Speech interface devices are in their infancy and sure to improve with time. The more you train Microsoft's voice software, the better your results will be. Though limited now, the number of applications compatible with voice commands is rapidly growing. Using applications like VoiceAttack is not just fun and convenient, the process also helps us understand the evolution and potential future of computing.

The third party app developers will be able to make their apps available to iPhone users with Android Wear watches. Google said in a blog post that “To do so, just set the standalone=true flag in your watch app manifest. This lets the Play Store know that your watch app doesn’t require an Android phone app, and therefore can appear in the Play Store on watches paired to iPhones.” Prior to this, the Android Wear watches could only access apps that Google distributed through the Android Wear iOS app. The final Wear 2.0 build further enables iOS devices to perform phone hand-off flows like OAuth and Remote Intent in order to launch a web page on paired iOS device, the company said. In addition, the update makes it easier to access the new Navigation Drawer, and adds support for NFC Host Card Emulation. This should pave the way for Android Pay on supported watches, according to The Verge.  The latest developer preview also brings along some bug fixes as well. Android Wear 2.0 Watches Google hasn’t revealed an exact date for the Android Wear 2.0 public release. Previous reports peg February 9 as the possible date. Google plans to launch two new smartwatches with the new software next month. Rumors suggest that Google will release LG manufactured devices with a side button mimicking the Digital Crown function in Apple Watch. TechnoBuffalo leaked the purported images of the upcoming wearables from LG. One watch is dubbed LG Watch Sport (Black) while a smaller version is dubbed LG Watch Style (Gold). These resemble the designs leaked by Evan Blass on the Venture Beat report. The larger model is a 1.38-inch 480×480-pixel round LG Sport smartwatch and will come with 430mAh battery and 768MB of RAM. The smaller watch will come with a 240mAh battery and 512MB of RAM. It also has a 1.2-inch 360×360-pixel display. For further updates and information on Android Wear 2.0, stay tuned.

Alan Zeichick - Jan 19, 2017 12:30 pm UTC Enlarge / Fly, legacy app code! Off to the cloud! reader comments 64 Share this story Cloud Academy Cloud Bottlenecks: How Pokémon Go (and other game dev teams) caught them all SaaS to the max: The limits of shifting from on-site to cloud services View more stories Over the past decade, companies have virtualized more and more of their IT. We’ve moved to cloud services and “DevOps” to build and deploy bundles of our new applications. But a significant portion of most organizations' applications still run inside the corporate firewall today. Such setups use tried and true technologies, like 32-bit Windows code and enterprise Java, that were developed without any consideration for the cloud. Let’s get one thing perfectly clear: the best way to have a butt-kicking cloud-native application is to write one from scratch. Leverage the languages, APIs, and architecture of the chosen cloud platform before exploiting its databases, analytics engines, and storage. This will allow you to take advantage of the wealth of resources offered by companies like Microsoft, with their Azure PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) offering or by Google Cloud Platform’s Google App Engine PaaS service. Sometimes, however, that’s not the job. Sometimes, you have to take a native application running on a server in your local data center or colocation facility and make it run in the cloud. That means virtual machines. Before we get into the details, let’s define “native application.” For the purposes of this exercise, it’s an application written in a high-level programming language, like C/C++, C#, or Java. It’s an application running directly on a machine talking to an operating system, like Linux or Windows, that you want to run on a cloud platform like Windows Azure, Amazon Web Services (AWS), or Google Cloud Platform (GCP). What we are not talking about is an application that has already been virtualized, such as already running within VMware’s ESXi or Microsoft’s Hyper-V virtual machine. Sure, moving an ESXi or Hyper-V application running on-premises into the cloud is an important migration that may improve performance and add elasticity while switching capital expenses to operational expenses. Important, yes, but not a challenge. All the virtual machine giants and cloud hosts have copious documentation to help you make the switch... which amounts to basically copying the virtual machine file onto a cloud server and turning it on. Many possible scenarios exist for moving a native datacenter application into the cloud. They boil down to two main types of migrations, and there’s no clear reason to choose one over the other: The first is to create a virtual server within your chosen cloud provider, perhaps running Windows Server or running a flavor of Linux. Once that virtual server has been created, you migrate the application from your on-prem server to the new virtual server—exactly as you would if you were moving from one of your servers to a new server. The benefits: the application migration is straightforward, and you have 100-percent control of the server, the application, and security. The downside: the application doesn’t take advantage of cloud APIs or other special servers. It’s simply a migration that gets a server out of your data center. When you do this, you are leveraging a type of cloud called Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS). You are essentially treating the cloud like a colocation facility. The second is to see if your application code can be ported to run within the native execution engine provided by the cloud service. This is called Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). The benefits are that you can leverage a wealth of APIs and other services offered by the cloud provider. The downsides are that you have to ensure that your code can work on the service (which may require recoding or even redesign) in order to use those APIs or even to run at all. You also don’t have full control over the execution environment, which means that security is managed by the cloud provider, not by you. And of course, there’s the third option mentioned at the beginning: writing an entirely new application native for the cloud provider’s PaaS. That’s still the best option, if you can do it. But our task today is to focus on migrating an existing application. With all that said, let’s look at two cases: porting a Win32 “classic Windows” application from a Windows Server to Microsoft Azure and porting a Java application to Google Cloud Platform. First, A Note about Security If you're developing applications for on-premises servers, you typically get some help with security. Part of your IT department’s job is to protect the servers, whether those servers are in the data center, in a test lab, or sitting on a software developer’s credenza. In some cases, developers are involved with security. But generally, network administrators and the office of the chief information security officer (CISO) take care of firewalls to protect from external attack virtual LANs (VLANs) and Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) to ensure that only authorized systems can access sensitive resources and servers, and so-on. For example, a VLAN might ensure that only authorized test and deployment front-end servers can directly access a back-end database server. Similarly, the CISO and networking folks are keeping track of authorized user lists, are logging accesses, and are analyzing logs for signs of intrusion or data exfiltration. But migrating applications to a public cloud provider is a different story. While a cloud host might offer some defense against broad-spectrum attacks, like a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack, the rest is up to you. It’s your job to ensure that access controls to virtual servers and custom cloud applications are properly configured and kept up to date. It’s your job to configure and protect VLANs that link cloud applications to your or other cloud applications. This is where organizations get into trouble. Often, the CISO and network team are not brought into the loop when cloud resources are licensed, created, tested, or even deployed. Thus, security may not be properly configured or even activated. This leads to vulnerabilities in the cloud server (which could be wide open to hackers) and its data. But if hackers pwn your cloud server, that might present a possible pipeline back into your network and data center. Many cloud hosts offer security services; some are free, some are paid options. Many firewall companies also license so-called “virtual next-generation” firewall products designed specifically to run as instances on your cloud servers. Get your CISO involved in choosing and using these products—or if you don’t have specialized staff, get a consultant. This is not an area where you want to fool around or fake it. Given how good attackers are, an effort that’s “good enough” is not even close.

Laptops by Joshua Goldman January 24, 2017 7:00 AM PST @ByJoshG Up Next Meet Jon Hamm, the hologram (aka the holohamm) New Chromebooks made for education from Acer, Asus and other Google partners are headed to market. Google Google just made it a no-brainer for school districts to kick Apple and Microsoft to the curb. At the education technology conference Bett, the search giant announced two new Chromebooks from Acer and Asus that basically offer low-cost, secure alternatives to iPads and Windows notebooks in one device. Google has been pushing hard into the education market for the past few years with software and services as well as with its Chromebook laptops and other hardware running on the company's Chrome web-based operating system. Chromebooks are attractive for their affordable pricing, simplicity and shareability, but they typically don't offer the same level of interactivity as an iPad or the durability of some Windows systems. The two new Chromebook models -- the Acer Chromebook Spin 11 and the Asus Chromebook C213 -- are convertible laptops that can be used as tablets, as traditional notebooks, or in tent or display positions. Both are built to military standards for drops with the Acer featuring a spill-resistant keyboard and touchpad and the Asus, a modular design for easy onsite repairs. Both Chromebooks include a low-cost, battery-free stylus made to feel like a No. 2 pencil. Google Along with the sturdy construction, the Chromebooks have three key features. One is the included stylus, which Google said is inexpensive, doesn't require charging and doesn't need to be paired before use. Wacom EMR (electromagnetic resonance) technology and the stylus will let students write, draw and erase directly on the screen with little lag. Each has a world-facing camera. Along with a camera above the screen, there is one also above the keyboard deck so that when they're in tablet mode students can use it to capture photos and video with the screen as the viewfinder. Lastly, they both charge off of USB-C, so there's no need to keep track of a specific power adapter. Tent mode for easier app use for groups or in tight spaces. Google What's really going to drive sales, though, is the addition of Android apps. Up until late last year, Chromebooks were limited to using web apps. For 2017, though, all Chromebooks will be able to run apps from the Google Play store, which will allow students to use the systems whether or not they have an internet connection. Adobe is even making a suite of Creative Cloud apps optimized for Chromebooks, including Photoshop Mix, Lightroom Mobile, Illustrator Draw, Photoshop Sketch, Adobe Comp CC and Creative Cloud Mobile. Google said it worked with other app developers as well to make sure apps scale properly for larger displays such as the 11-inch touchscreens on these two models. I really want one of these for my kids, but unfortunately for now they are only available to education and commercial buyers. However, although these new Chromebooks won't start rolling out until late spring (in time for the following school year), the Android apps will begin to arrive for this list of managed Chromebooks starting this month. And if you don't like these, Google said HP, Dell, Lenovo and Samsung will have options, too.

Dan Goodin - Jan 23, 2017 9:39 pm UTC Enlarge portal gda reader comments 51 Share this story A virulent family of malware that infected more than 10 million Android devices last year has made a comeback, this time hiding inside Google Play apps that have been downloaded by as many as 12 million unsuspecting users. Further Reading10 million Android phones infected by all-powerful auto-rooting appsHummingWhale, as the professionally developed malware has been dubbed, is a variant of HummingBad, the name given to a family of malicious apps researchers documented in July invading non-Google app markets. HummingBad attempted to override security protections by exploiting unpatched vulnerabilities that gave the malware root privileges in older versions of Android. Before Google shut it down, it installed more than 50,000 fraudulent apps each day, displayed 20 million malicious advertisements, and generated more than $300,000 per month in revenue. Of the 10 million people who downloaded HummingBad-contaminated apps, an estimated 286,000 of them were located in the US. HummingWhale, by contrast, managed to sneak its way into about 20 Google Play apps that were downloaded from 2 million to 12 million times, according to researchers from Check Point, the security company that has been closely following the malware family for almost a year. Rather than rooting devices, the latest variant includes new virtual machine techniques that allow the malware to perform ad fraud better than ever, company researchers said in a blog post published Monday. "Users must realize that they can no longer trust in installing only apps with a high reputation from official app stores as their sole defense," the researchers wrote in an e-mail to Ars. "This malware employs several tactics to keep its activity hidden, meaning users might be unaware of its existence on their device." As was the case with HummingBad, the purpose of HummingWhale is to generate revenue by displaying fraudulent ads and automatically installing apps. When users try to close the ads, the new functionality causes already downloaded apps to run in a virtual machine. That creates a fake ID that allows the perpetrators to generate referral revenues. Use of the virtual machine brings many technical benefits to the operators, chief among them allowing the malware to install apps without requiring users to approve a list of elevated permissions. The VM also disguises the malicious activity, making it easier for the apps to infiltrate Google Play. It has the added benefit of installing a nearly unlimited number of fraudulent apps without overloading the infected device. Until now, Android malware that wanted advanced capabilities typically had to trick users into approving sometimes scary-sounding permissions or exploit rooting vulnerabilities. Ginning the ratings Further Reading1 million Google accounts compromised by Android malware called GooliganTo implement the VM feature, the malicious APK installation dropper used by HummingWhale uses DroidPlugin, an extension originally developed by developers from China-based company Qihoo 360, Check Point said. HummingWhale has also been observed hiding the original malicious app once it's installed and trying to improve its Google Play reputation by automatically generating posts disguised as positive user comments and ratings. Gooligan, a family of Android malware that came to light in November after it compromised more than 1 million Google accounts, contained similar abilities to tamper with Google Play ratings. People who want to know if their Android devices are infected can download the Check Point app here. A separate app from Check Point competitor Lookout also detects the threat as a variant of the Shedun malware family. More technically inclined people can detect infections by seeing if a device connects to a control server located at app.blinkingcamera.com. Package names for infected apps typically contain a common naming structure that includes com.XXXXXXXXX.camera, for example com.bird.sky.whale.camera (app name: Whale Camera), com.color.rainbow.camera (Rainbow Camera), and com.fishing.when.orangecamera (Orange Camera). Google officials removed the malicious apps from the Play market after receiving a private report of their existence. A company representative declined to comment for this post. Post updated to correct role of Qihoo 360.

Sean Gallagher - Jan 4, 2017 12:00 pm UTC Enlarge / Alexa, how do I create something that combines AI with a creepy 1980s toy? Sean Gallagher reader comments 90 Share this story It's been 50 years since Captain Kirk first spoke commands to an unseen, all-knowing Computer on Star Trek and not quite as long since David Bowman was serenaded by HAL 9000's rendition of "A Bicycle Built for Two" in 2001: A Space Odyssey. While we've been talking to our computers and other devices for years (often in the form of expletive interjections), we're only now beginning to scratch the surface of what's possible when voice commands are connected to artificial intelligence software. Meanwhile, we've always seemingly fantasized about talking toys, from Woody and Buzz in Toy Story to that creepy AI teddy bear that tagged along with Haley Joel Osment in Steven Spielberg's A.I. (Well, maybe people aren't dreaming of that teddy bear.) And ever since the Furby craze, toymakers have been trying to make toys smarter. They've even connected them to the cloud—with predictably mixed results. Further ReadingBearDuino: Hacking Teddy Ruxpin with Arduino Naturally, I decided it was time to push things forward. I had an idea to connect a speech-driven AI and the Internet of Things to an animatronic bear—all the better to stare into the lifeless, occasionally blinking eyes of the Singularity itself with. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Tedlexa: a gutted 1998 model of the Teddy Ruxpin animatronic bear tethered to Amazon's Alexa Voice Service. Introducing Tedlexa, the personal assistant of your nightmares I was not the first, by any means, to bridge the gap between animatronic toys and voice interfaces. Brian Kane, an instructor at the Rhode Island School of Design, threw down the gauntlet with a video of Alexa connected to that other servo-animated icon, Billy the Big Mouthed Bass. This Frakenfish was all powered by an Arduino. I could not let Kane's hack go unanswered, having previously explored the uncanny valley with Bearduino—a hardware hacking project of Portland-based developer/artist Sean Hathaway. With a hardware-hacked bear and Arduino already in hand (plus a Raspberry Pi II and assorted other toys at my disposal), I set off to create the ultimate talking teddy bear. To our future robo-overlords: please, forgive me. His master's voice Amazon is one of a pack of companies vying to connect voice commands to the vast computing power of "the cloud" and the ever-growing Internet of (Consumer) Things. Microsoft, Apple, Google, and many other contenders have sought to connect voice interfaces in their devices to an exponentially expanding number of cloud services, which in turn can be tethered to home automation systems and other "cyberphysical" systems. While Microsoft's Project Oxford services have remained largely experimental and Apple's Siri remains bound to Apple hardware, Amazon and Google have rushed headlong into a battle to become the voice service incumbent. As ads for Amazon's Echo and Google Home have saturated broadcast and cable television, the two companies have simultaneously started to open the associated software services up to others. I chose Alexa as a starting point for our descent into IoT hell for a number of reasons. One of them is that Amazon lets other developers build “skills” for Alexa that users can choose from a marketplace, like mobile apps. These skills determine how Alexa interprets certain voice commands, and they can be built on Amazon’s Lambda application platform or hosted by the developers themselves on their own server. (Rest assured, I’m going to be doing some future work with skills.) Another point of interest is that Amazon has been fairly aggressive about getting developers to build Alexa into their own gadgets—including hardware hackers. Amazon has also released its own demonstration version of an Alexa client for a number of platforms, including the Raspberry Pi. AVS, or Alexa Voice Services, requires a fairly small computing footprint on the user's end.  All of the voice recognition and synthesis of voice responses happens in Amazon's cloud; the client simply listens for commands, records them, and forwards them as an HTTP POST request carrying an JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) object to AVS' Web-based interfaces. The voice responses are sent as audio files to be played by the client, wrapped in a returned JSON object. Sometimes, they include a hand-off for streamed audio to a local audio player, as with AVS's "Flash Briefing" feature (and music streaming—but that's only available on commercial AVS products right now). Before I could build anything with Alexa on a Raspberry Pi, I needed to create a project profile on Amazon’s developer site. When you create an AVS project on the site, it creates a set of credentials and shared encryption keys used to configure whatever software you use to access the service. The Amazon Developer Console, where you create the configuration for a prototype Alexa device. First, it needs a name. The next step in creating a configuration: the generation of a security profile. These are used to authenticate the device via OAuth with Amazon's Alexa back-end. These source addresses for the device are required to allow local setup details to be passed via OAuth to Alexa. The first set of URLs under each setting here are for the AWS sample app's configuration; the second set (including the third address) are for the AlexaPi code I used on this project. Note they're not HTTPS—something to fix later. Amazon wants some more details on your "product" to finish the configuration profile. Once you've got the AVS client running, it needs to be configured with a Login With Amazon (LWA) token through its own setup Web page—giving it access to Amazon's services (and potentially, to Amazon payment processing). So, in essence, I would be creating a Teddy Ruxpin with access to my credit card. This will be a topic for some future security research on IoT on my part. Amazon offers developers a sample Alexa client to get started, including one implementation that will run on Raspbian, the Raspberry Pi implementation of Debian Linux. However, the official demo client is written largely in Java. Despite, or perhaps because of, my past Java experience, I was leery of trying to do any interconnection between the sample code and the Arduino-driven bear. As far as I could determine, I had two possible courses of action: A hardware-focused approach that used the audio stream from Alexa to drive the animation of the bear. Finding a more accessible client or writing my own, preferably in an accessible language like Python, that could drive the Arduino with serial commands. Naturally, being a software-focused guy and having already done a significant amount of software work with Arduino, I chose…the hardware route. Hoping to overcome my lack of experience with electronics with a combination of Internet searches and raw enthusiasm, I grabbed my soldering iron. Plan A: Audio in, servo out My plan was to use a splitter cable for the Raspberry Pi’s audio and to run the audio both to a speaker and to the Arduino. The audio signal would be read as analog input by the Arduino, and I would somehow convert the changes in volume in the signal into values that would in turn be converted to digital output to the servo in the bear’s head. The elegance of this solution was that I would be able to use the animated robo-bear with any audio source—leading to hours of entertainment value. It turns out this is the approach Kane took with his Bass-lexa. In a phone conversation, he revealed for the first time how he pulled off his talking fish as an example of rapid prototyping for his students at RISD. "It's all about making it as quickly as possible so people can experience it," he explained. "Otherwise, you end up with a big project that doesn't get into people's hands until it's almost done." So, Kane's rapid-prototyping solution: connecting an audio sensor physically duct-taped to an Amazon Echo to an Arduino controlling the motors driving the fish. Enlarge / Kane texted me this photo of his prototype—audio sensor and breadboard taped atop an Amazon Echo. Brian Kane Of course, I knew none of this when I began my project. I also didn't have an Echo or a $4 audio sensor. Instead, I was stumbling around the Internet looking for ways to hotwire the audio jack of my Raspberry Pi into the Arduino. I knew that audio signals are alternating current, forming a waveform that drives headphones and speakers. The analog pins on the Arduino can only read positive direct current voltages, however, so in theory the negative-value peaks in the waves would be read with a value of zero. I was given false hope by an Instructable I found that moved a servo arm in time with music—simply by soldering a 1,000 ohm resistor to the ground of the audio cable. After looking at the Instructable, I started to doubt its sanity a bit even as I moved boldly forward. I need sanity check on this Instructs le: wtf with the soldering? https://t.co/Mc3HlqqNtW — Sean Gallagher (@thepacketrat) November 15, 2016 Me, after a few hours with a soldering iron. pic.twitter.com/16aaWkI4Em — Sean Gallagher (@thepacketrat) November 15, 2016 While I saw data from the audio cable streaming in via test code running on the Arduino, it was mostly zeros. So after taking some time to review some other projects, I realized that the resistor was damping down the signal so much it was barely registering at all. This turned out to be a good thing—doing a direct patch based on the approach the Instructable presented would have put 5 volts or more into the Arduino’s analog input (more than double its maximum). Getting the Arduino-only approach to work would mean making an extra run to another electronics supply store. Sadly, I discovered my go-to, Baynesville Electronics, was in the last stages of its Going Out of Business Sale and was running low on stock. But I pushed forward, needing to procure the components to build an amplifier with a DC offset to convert the audio signal into something I could work with. It was when I started shopping for oscilloscopes that I realized I had ventured into the wrong bear den. Fortunately, there was a software answer waiting in the wings for me—a GitHub project called AlexaPi. Page: 1 2 Next → Sean Gallagher Sean is Ars Technica's IT Editor.

Ron Amadeo - Jan 18, 2017 1:30 pm UTC reader comments 74 Share this story Further ReadingThe (updated) history of AndroidWhen Android was brought to market, it was pitched as an open, customizable OS that was the antithesis of Apple's lock-down smartphone platform. While both OSes have moved closer together over the years, the high customizability of Android is still around. Last year's beginner's guide to Android customization slightly grazed the surface of what's possible with a truly adaptable OS. And now it's time for part two, diving into more advanced customization methods. Keyboards Gboard is probably the best all-around keyboard on Android. Check it out if it's not already the default on your device. Google also has a crazy handwriting keyboard. Swiftkey's auto correct is powered by lots and lots of your data. Fleksy has an interesting extension system and swipe gestures, and it lets you search through gifs. One of the earliest Android customizations was a user-replaceable keyboard. Most devices from third-party OEMs are going to come with some kind of non-Google keyboard—either an AOSP derivative branded by the OEM or a pack-in app that was sold to the highest bidder. So if you're not using Google's keyboard, Gboard, you should probably give it a shot. It's a great basic keyboard that allows you to type or swipe. The recent update to "Gboard" gave Google keyboard Gif and Emoji search, along with the ability to perform regular Google searches right from the keyboard. There are also nice settings like an always-on number row, a one-handed mode, and auto correct for multiple languages. If you're looking for an alternative input method to tapping or swiping, Google also has a crazy "handwriting" keyboard that lets you draw letters and emoji. For third-party offerings, Swiftkey is a popular option. By collecting lots and lots of your data, this keyboard tries to learn how you write and provide a better auto correct. This involves sending tons of your data to Swiftkey. It wants to scan all your e-mail, all your SMS messages, and everything on your Facebook, Twitter, Google+, and Evernote accounts. It also has themes, a permanent number row, swiping, and all sorts of fun typing stats. There's also Fleksy, an interesting keyboard with a ton of extensions for things like press effects, custom hotkeys, phrase expansion, and even an app launcher. Fix Android's auto-rotate Ultimate Rotation Control. The app icon may be ugly, but it works great. Auto-rotate on the lock screen! Woo! Most apps handle forced rotation fine, with the exception of some games. You can always lock rotation or just not rotate your phone, though. Sure lots of customizations add or replace something, but how about fixing a part of Android that has always been oddly inconsistent? Auto-rotate on Android has never made a ton of sense. Even with auto-rotate on, it's not uncommon to run into parts of the interface that inexplicably refuse to rotate. Today on a Pixel phone, the lock screen is still locked to portrait no matter what, and in many phones the home screen and phone apps are trouble spots, too. Landscape mode support is so poor that for a primarily landscape device like the Pixel C, it is a constant problem. This can be fixed with an app called "Ultimate Rotation Control," and it doesn't even require root. There are lots of "rotation control" apps out there, but my favorite thing about this particular app is that you can swap out the system's "auto-rotate" function with "forced auto-rotate." This will make every single screen support auto-rotate no matter what, and the vast majority of them deal with being rotated just fine. Swapping out the system function for forced auto-rotate means you can turn off every single piece of the app's UI and just use the regular system rotation control in the Quick Settings—install the app, enter the right settings, and then forget about it. For the invisible auto-rotate correction, you'll want to uncheck just about everything in the app, and the magic setting is under the "System rotation settings." Just change "System auto rotation" to "Forced Auto," and now you can use the regular auto-rotate quick settings control to switch between locked portrait and the new forced auto-rotate mode. Under "special cases," you also might want to set the lock screen to "Use Global Setting," so that it rotates, too, when you have auto-rotate turned on. With the system auto-rotate turned on, everything will rotate. Yes, it's crazy that you need an app for this, although if you want to dive into the settings even more, you can set up per-app rotation settings. Make your own Quick Settings tiles Making a new tile, step one: Pick a function, in this case, a Google Maps shortcut. Next pick an icon. There are thousands of built-in icons to choose from, and thankfully you can search through them. It works! Tap on the "Work" button and Google Maps loads up. Android's Quick Settings panel is that row of power toggles that sits above the notification panel. Out of the box, you can usually "customize" the settings by changing the order of the packed-in tiles, but with some apps it's possible to make your own tiles entirely. Custom Quick Settings is the best tile app I've come across. It works natively on Android 7.0 and 6.0, and with root it will work on Android 5.0 and 5.1. Root and Xposed support also give you access to things you can't do natively, like reset the phone, change the CPU frequency, show a live weather widget, or start up ADB. The out-of-the-box features that don't require root are some of the most useful, though. You can set a Quick Settings tile to open any app, shortcut, widget, or website, and after picking a function you just give it a name and icon. There are thousands of built-in icons to choose from, which all perfectly match the usual quick settings style. If you really can't find what you're looking for, you can also load a custom image. Tiles can have tap and long-press actions, too. From here the sky is the limit. I have a good amount of smart home equipment, so I was able to make a tile that unlocks my doors and one that shuts the house down for the night. Through the "shortcuts" function, you can make a tile that uses a Google Maps shortcut to navigate to a place, like your house.

Jon Brodkin - Dec 16, 2013 7:57 pm UTC grendelkhan reader comments Share this story Google's quest to build a fiber network in Austin, Texas has hit a snag in the form of AT&T. AT&T owns about 20 percent of the utility poles in Austin, with the rest of them being owned by the city. Instead of increasing congestion by adding more poles, the City Council was expected to vote last week "to force AT&T to allow Google Inc. use of its utility poles to install its planned high-speed Google Fiber network in the city," as the Austin American-Statesman reported last Tuesday. The Council drafted a new ordinance making it easier for communication service providers to secure pole attachments at reasonable prices. The vote was postponed until January 23, 2014, however. AT&T and Google are expected to negotiate an agreement before that date, but AT&T's public stance is that it doesn't have to let Google use its poles. “Google has the right to attach to our poles, under federal law, as long as it qualifies as a telecom or cable provider, as they themselves acknowledge," AT&T Public Affairs VP Tracy King told the American-Statesman. "We will work with Google when they become qualified, as we do with all such qualified providers." Further ReadingAT&T offers gigabit Internet discount in exchange for your Web historyAT&T was chided by DSLReports for "whining" about sharing utility poles with Google. But AT&T's argument seems to be legally sound, and it will likely allow the company to win payments from Google, similar to a previous outcome in Kansas City. AT&T did not answer questions from Ars, but a city official explained what's going on. "Basically, the current regulations require companies with utility poles in the public rights of way to provide access to certified telecommunications providers and to TV/cable companies," Paul Lewis, assistant manager of telecommunications and regulatory affairs in Austin, told Ars. "Google is not a certified telecommunications provider, and it's a video service provider as opposed to a television/cable company." If Google were to apply to the Public Utility Commission of Texas to become a qualified telecom, "It would make them subject to all of the state and federal telecommunications regulations," Lewis said. Telecom in this context essentially "means the same thing as telephone service," Matt Wood, policy director at consumer advocacy group Free Press, told Ars. That excludes pure Internet services, even though Google and many other companies such as Microsoft's Skype provide voice calling over the Internet. Telecom providers are subject to more regulation, which Google wants to avoid. Google would probably not have to promise universal service, because that requirement "usually goes to the incumbent" rather than a challenger, Wood said. But there would still be "state oversight of the rates you might charge." Google also hasn't positioned itself as a cable provider, not because it uses fiber instead of coaxial cable, but because federal communications law defines cable service as "one-way transmission to subscribers of video programming or other programming service." Google Fiber delivers IPTV, which counts as a two-way network because "A subscriber to an IPTV service uses a set-top box to request specific individual video signals from the IPTV service provider," telecom attorney Michael Glaser writes. "Thus, the subscriber controls the video signals he or she wishes to access." Google: “We're happy to pay” For those reasons, AT&T appears to be on solid ground in claiming that Google isn't a telecom or cable provider. That means federal law doesn't give Google guaranteed pole attachment rights at the reduced rates charged to telecom and cable companies. AT&T has argued that telecom regulations are outdated and too restrictive and that they should be eliminated or dramatically reduced as the nation moves from traditional phone networks to all-Internet Protocol networks. But those rules still exist today, and AT&T doesn't want Google to gain the benefits of being a telecom provider without the regulatory risks, especially in a market where Google is trying to lure away AT&T's Internet customers. Google's entry into Austin led to AT&T building its own fiber network in the city. The companies will probably come to some agreement in Austin. City Council member Mike Martinez wrote on Facebook, "After hard work, lots of meetings and tons of input—AT&T and Google agree to negotiate their issues with the city." The delay of the Council vote gives time for those negotiations to happen. Something similar happened in Kansas City, the first city with Google Fiber. While no specific details of the Kansas City deal were revealed, the companies "entered into an agreement whereby Google Fiber Inc. can attach to AT&T’s poles in the Kansas City, Kansas, and Kansas City, Missouri, city limits," AT&T told the Kansas City Business Journal last year. Google told the Austin American-Statesman that it "would be happy to pay for access (to utility poles) at reasonable rates, just as we did in our initial buildout in Kansas City." If negotiations with AT&T fail, Google will bank on the City Council forcing AT&T's hand. "Our biggest concern is making sure that Austin citizens don’t have to deal with unnecessary disruption and extra infrastructure," a Google spokesperson told Ars. "We’d be thrilled to reach this outcome regardless of whether it comes about from a City Council ordinance or from signing reasonable pole attachment agreements with pole owners." Promoted Comments MrSkippyWise, Aged Ars Veteran jump to post As unpopular as this is, ATT has a point. They spent a lot of money to build out the infrastructure and they have to operate under a pretty strict set of rules. In Google's case they don't operate under the same set of rules and the are really and truly looking to compete against ATT using ATT's own infrastructure. All things considered ATT has a pretty good reason to fight this one. They don't want to compete against Google but if they do, they'd like it to be done using the same sets of rules for both companies. ATT might be rat bastards most of the time, but today they've got a fairly compelling argument. 145 posts | registered Oct 29, 2012 flyingemberArs Legatus Legionis jump to post Salacyous wrote: Put it underground.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Google has removed 200 publishers permanently from its AdSense network as part of an update to its policy on banning sites that intentionally mislead viewers, according to a Google blog post.  In November and December, Google banned sites that faked real news sites, such as using the domain ".co" and faking sites that end in ".com." The company did not release a list of the sites that it had banned, according to Recode.  Google also removed 5 million payday loan ads in 2016. New technology allowed Google to disable 112 million "trick to click" ads that contained malware, the blog said. Ads for illegal products were also targets in 2016, Google reported. The site disabled more than 68 million ads for healthcare violations and 17 million ads for violating illegal gambling rules, according to the blog post. The company reported that in 2016 it took down 1.7 billion ads for violations of its policies, more than double the amount of ads it removed in 2015. The site suspended more than 1,300 accounts for "tabloid cloaking," which fakes legitimate news articles and sends users to sites advertising weight-loss or other products. 47,000 sites were banned for weight-loss scams, Google's blog said. "Users don't want to be misled by the content they engage with online," Google's policy on misleading ads states. "For this reason, Google ads may not be placed on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about you, your content or the primary purpose of your web property." The website Snapchat has also cracked down on fake news, issuing restrictions Monday to keep the site "informative, factual, and safe."   Related Stories: Pope on Fake News, 'Alternative Facts': Tell Positive Truth Obama Calls Voter Fraud Claims 'Fake News'   © 2017 Newsmax.

Credit: Ore Huiying/Bloomberg/Getty By Elias Leight 3 days ago More News Facebook Partners With Fact-Checkers to Fight Fake News Watch Samantha Bee Meet 'Assh-le' Behind Fake News Websites Larry Wilmore Backs 'Purveyor of Fake News' Brian Williams All Stories In a report released on Wednesday titled, "How we fought bad ads, sites and scammers in 2016," Google announced that it took action against 340 sites "that deceive people with their content" – including purveyors of fake news – in 2016. Close to 200 of these sites are no longer allowed to use Google ads.   Related How a Fake Newsman Accidentally Helped Trump Win the White House Paul Horner thought he was trolling Trump supporters – but after the election, the joke was on him After Google, Facebook and other tech companies caught flak for failing to prevent the spread of potentially harmful false news stories during last year's presidential election, these organizations took steps to slow the spread of incorrect information. Google went after fake news sites' ad revenue in November by adopting a new AdSense policy that explicitly prohibited sites propagating "misrepresentative content" from using Google Ads. "Users don’t want to be misled by the content they engage with online," the new language reads. "For this reason, Google ads may not be placed on pages that misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about you, your content or the primary purpose of your web property." According to a report from Scott Spencer, director of product management for Sustainable Ads, Google investigated more than 500 sites for potentially violating this rule in under two months last year. "From November to December 2016, we reviewed 550 sites that were suspected of misrepresenting content to users, including impersonating news organizations," he writes. "We took action against 340 of them for violating our policies, both misrepresentation and other offenses, and nearly 200 publishers were kicked out of our network permanently." "The battle doesn’t end here," Spencer continues. "As we invest in better detection, the scammers invest in more elaborate attempts to trick our systems. Continuing to find and fight them is essential to protecting people online and ensuring you get the very best from the open web." Facebook also took initial action against fake news sites last year. In December, the social media platform created a new tool so that fact-checkers at outlets like Politifact and the Associated Press can analyze posts that are suspect of conveying false information. If these stories are determined to be untruthful, they will be tagged as "disputed," and they will appear lower in Facebook users' news feeds.

Internet by David Katzmaier January 25, 2017 7:49 AM PST @dkatzmaier Up Next Meet Jon Hamm, the hologram (aka the holohamm) Google said it suspended more than 1,300 accounts for tabloid cloaking in 2016. Google Every year Google removes a lot of ads that violate its policies, but 2016 was the worst year yet. The search giant, which earns billions as the web's largest purveyor of digital advertising, said it removed 1.7 billion so-called Bad Ads in 2016, up from 780 million in 2015. The offending ads range from payday loan ads, which Google banned in July, to ads for illegal products like black market pharmaceuticals and gambling sites. It also includes ads the company deems "misleading," such as one asking "Are you at risk for this rare, skin-eating disease?" Google also removed a large number of what it calls "tabloid cloakers," aka fake news. The Bad Ads report, released Wednesday, says: Cloakers often take advantage of timely topics--a government election, a trending news story or a popular celebrity--and their ads can look like headlines on a news website. But when people click on that story about Ellen DeGeneres and aliens, they go to a site selling weight-loss products, not a news story. To fight scammers, Google said it removes the offending stories and bans them from advertising again. The company suspended more than 1300 such accounts in 2016. Late last year, Google and Facebook came under fire for not doing enough to squelch fake news. Google even admitted it messed up when a fake news story about Donald Trump winning the popular vote appeared prominently in the search engine's widely-read news section.

Image Credit: Jordan Novet/VentureBeat Google today confirmed the date and location of its 2017 I/O developer conference: May 17-19 at the Shoreline Amphitheatre venue in Mountain View, California. That’s the same place where I/O was held last year, following a long run of Google hosting the event at the prominent Moscone Center in downtown San Francisco. This time around, Google yesterday provided developers with a treasure hunt to guess the date and location of I/O 2017 through the website savethedate.foo. Around the world, from here to there, to the most clever minds, the secret will share. #googledevs #savethedate https://t.co/0zwCbSLzVy pic.twitter.com/0O2vNDWZx2 — Google Developers (@googledevs) January 24, 2017 A Google spokesperson today confirmed that the information that people collectively figured out — which was subsequently reported by several media outlets — was correct. Google traditionally announces many new products and features at I/O. Last year, for instance, Google introduced Google Assistant, Google Home, the Allo messaging app, the Duo video calling app, and the Google Daydream high-end mobile virtual reality platform. At previous I/O shows, Google introduced Google Cardboard, Google Fit, Google Now, Google Photos, and Google Wave, among other things. It does not appear that Google has started accepting registrations for I/O 2017 yet. The company will do that in the next few months. The event will inevitably be livestreamed for those who can’t make it. We’ll provide coverage on site, so stay tuned.

It wasn’t too long ago that the only real digital assistants to speak of were Apple’s Siri and Google Now, the predecessor to the new Google Assistant. Now, however, every manufacturer seems to be working on their own assistant — and Samsung, which has dubbed its creation Bixby, is no exception. In fact, Bixby is only weeks away from its rumored debut in the Samsung Galaxy S8, and it’s increasingly looking like the assistant will be a major competitor to Google Assistant — something that Google can’t be too happy about. Still, Samsung claims that this competition is actually a good thing — and that it will help push artificial intelligence forward. More: It’s official — Samsung accidentally confirms AI assistant to be named Bixby Despite the fact that Bixby will only run on Samsung products, the competition between Bixby and Assistant may cause Google and Samsung to try and outdo each other — which would help make their respective assistants better and better. We may already be seeing that, as Bixby is rumored to include a number of promising features that Assistant doesn’t offer. According to reports, it’s not all about the competition. South Korean publication The Investor notes that Samsung wants to “collaborate as well as compete” with Google to help push AI ahead. “Samsung and Google will have to continue to maintain their strategic partnership to nurture the AI and the market for the emerging technology,” said Lee Kyeong-tae, a member of Samsung’s mobile division, in the report. Samsung and Google aren’t the only companies building digital assistants. HTC just announced its own digital assistant, called the Sense Companion. The new assistant will feature in the HTC U Ultra, HTC’s new flagship device that’s now up for pre-order in the U.S. from HTC’s website. It will be interesting to see how all these assistants help push AI.

Google is a multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related services and products. [Denis Linine / Shutterstock, Inc.]    5442912 Google booted 200 publishers from its advertising network partly due to the outcry of fake news spreading throughout the Internet. Google announced Wednesday that it reviewed 550 sites in roughly two months, and took action against 340 of them for violating policies. Two-hundred publishers were kicked out of its network permanently. It is common practice for Google to continuously filter out marketers that make fraudulent or misleading claims — like “weight-loss scams,” “imitation designer watches” —  but certain sites that potentially publish dishonest information are now on the chopping block. “In 2016, we saw the rise of tabloid cloakers, a new type of scammer that tries to game our system by pretending to be news,” Scott Spencer, the director of product management at Sustainable Ads, wrote in an official blog post (emphasis theirs). “Cloakers often take advantage of timely topics—a government election, a trending news story or a popular celebrity—and their ads can look like headlines on a news website. But when people click on that story about Ellen DeGeneres and aliens, they go to a site selling weight-loss products, not a news story.” Publishers that impersonate legitimate news organizations by abridging web addresses were also part of the banishment, signaling that its not mainly about purging misleading news. Specifically, 1.7 billion advertisements were removed, which is more than double the amount axed in 2015. “We support industry efforts like the Coalition for Better Ads to protect people from bad experiences across the web. While we took down more bad ads in 2016 than ever before, the battle doesn’t end here,” Spencer continued. Follow Eric on Twitter Send tips to [email protected] .

Fox News Fox Business Fox News Go Fox News Radio Fox Nation Fox News Insider Fox News Tech Expand/Collapse Search Home Video Politics U.S. Opinion Business Entertainment Tech Science Health Travel Lifestyle World On Air Tech Home Computers Google Video Games Military Tech War Games Slideshows Google Google entering Cuba is 'Trojan Horse' that could reinforce regime, residents say By Marta Dhanis Published January 25, 2017 FoxNews.com Facebook0 Twitter0 livefyre Email Print   HAVANA, Cuba –  In signing a deal with the Cuban authorities last December, Google took on the challenge of improving internet access in what many consider to be one of the worst places in the world to go online. But Havana residents are taking the development with a grain of salt. Recently Fox News spoke with some islanders who expressed doubts Google will make a success of it, at least anytime soon. “We call the internet a ‘Trojan Horse.’ The success of this government has been possible thanks to the people’s lack of information,” said a 57-year-old retired professor who requested anonymity for fear of retribution by the communist regime. “I would have a patrol car at my door tomorrow to monitor my life,” he said. On the other hand, he and others contend, this Trojan Horse is also providing the communist regime with technology that will empower the secret police with detailed reports of the users’ searches and profiles, right down to their location. “This means that Cubans generally, and Cuban dissidents in particular, will not only have their entire online lives to the last detail available, but also where they travel, who they meet with in the real world and many other details made available to Castro's intelligence services,” said John Suarez, an activist. Cubans starving for connection in Havana Google would not provide any comment on this and suggested visiting its blog for further details. The blog broadly states that the deal allows the state-owned telecommunications company ETECSA to use Google’s technology “to reduce latency by caching … popular high-bandwidth content like YouTube videos at a local level.” Google has additionally partnered with Havana’s Museo Orgánico Romerillo, a museum in Miramar, an upscale neighborhood dotted with embassies and mansions. The agreement is that the museum provides Google a space to showcase some of its products through the ETECSA network, but commits to grant internet access to all visitors. “We know, from the experience of many countries around the world, that new technologies and improved internet access can help people in their daily lives, provide new information and experiences, and help harness a country’s creativity and ingenuity,” Google says in its blog. Expand / Contract (Fox News/Marta Dhanis) However, connectivity in the communist nation continues to be extremely limited to the lucky few. In my visit to the island in early January I was mentally prepared to disconnect from the world -- which actually felt quite nice for a couple days. This is how it went down for me: My quest for internet started at the José Martí International Airport, where I started looking for the prepaid ETECSA card I had been told was the only way to get connection. The card costs around $5 and gives you approximately an hour of internet per dollar. ETECSA is an acronym for Empresa de Telecomunicaciones de Cuba Sociedad Anonima, and is the sole provider of internet access in the island. The day I landed, the airport had run out of the coveted cards so I had to manage to buy one the next day at one of the city's hotels. They are not easy to find. There are just a bunch of “official stores” that sell them, and luxury hotels also offer them but for five times the price. So, to my puzzlement, for the same $5 and the same exact card, I got access to only one hour online. Related News... Cuban-Americans both celebrate, deplore end of 'wet foot, dry foot' policy Ex-US diplomats urge Trump to rescind US-Cuba intelligence sharing Cuba sees economic slump despite US detente Around Havana, there are a few places where you can get Wi-Fi for your device. Your best bet are the “upscale” hotels, but even there be prepared for a signal too weak to make a call through WhatsApp, watch videos or even upload and download pictures. You can tell you have found an oasis by the dozens of people – both locals and tourists – glued to their phones for hours in front of these hotels. The government also approved some hotspots in public parks where you’ll also find internet junkies, but with very weak connection. “The access is very limited and we can’t enter opposition websites or read, for example, The New York Times,” said the retired college professor. “At home, all we can get to work is an email account. The government doesn’t want us to have internet.” The government, however, blames the U.S. saying the embargo has prevented the country from developing its telecoms infrastructure. In any event, so far Google’s deal doesn’t seem to have changed things much, as all the company has done is provide faster access to their services, like Gmail or YouTube -- and that’s only available to the privileged few who belong to the government elite anyway. To critics such as activist John Suarez, Google’s deal with the Cuban government is a “disturbing development” that will only modernize Castro's totalitarian regime. “Any technological improvements are illusions to us,” the retired professor added.  Marta Dhanis is a field producer for the Fox News Channel.

The update changed the application’s interface and also introduced new features. With this update, the app’s inbox is now split into separate tabs for text messages, calls and voicemails. In the Messages tab, conversations are organized into separate threads for each contact or group. Elsewhere, this update adds support for group and photo MMS, as well as the ability to send replies from within notifications. Finally, in a blog post, Google said it’s “starting to introduce voicemail transcription for Spanish and will improve accuracy over time.” This update is now rolling out to Google Voice users on iOS, Android and the web.

The app has since been removed by the Android team. In a blog post on the company’s website mobile cybersecurity analysts Oren Koriat and Andrey Polkovnichenko explained how, several weeks ago, Check Point Mobile Threat Prevention detected and quarantined the Android device of an unsuspecting customer employee who downloaded and installed zero-day mobile ransomware from Google Play dubbed “Charger”, which was found embedded in an app called EnergyRescue. “This incident demonstrates how malware can be a dangerous threat to your business, and how advanced behavioral detection fills mobile security gaps attackers use to penetrate entire networks,” they added. Apparently, the infected app steals contacts and SMS messages from the user’s device and asks for admin permissions. If granted, the ransomware locks the device and displays a message demanding payment of 0.2 Bitcoins (roughly $180). The malware uses several advanced techniques to hide its real intentions and makes it harder to detect: •    It encodes strings into binary arrays, making it hard to inspect them. •    It loads code from encrypted resources dynamically, which most detection engines cannot penetrate and inspect. The dynamically-loaded code is also flooded with meaningless commands that mask the actual commands passing through. •    It checks whether it is being run in an emulator before it starts its malicious activity. PC malware first introduced this technique which is becoming a trend in mobile malware having been adopted by several malware families including Dendroid. Tim Erlin, Sr director, product management at Tripwire, said: “Both Google and Apple put in quite a lot of effort to keep malicious apps out of their respective repositories, but no system is perfect. Criminals are constantly testing the defenses in place with new techniques to sneak malicious apps past.” Craig Young, security researcher at Tripwire, added that with 2.2 million apps in Google's Play Store, it is inevitable that some bad apples will get through, and whilst users can still trust the Play Store, they need to keep in mind a few tips to stay safe. “First of all, you should never ever grant administrator permission to any application without absolute trust for why it is needed. Also starting with the 2015 release of Android 6, applications started requesting permission at run time rather than install so it is very apparent when an app tries to steal contacts or other personal data. Unfortunately, he continued, only a little over 30% of Android devices are running this version or newer due to many low-end phones being neglected by vendors with respect to providing updates. “This is why it's important to buy Android devices from vendors with made commitments to keeping the product up to date for a specified amount of time. In today's market, the best choice for that would be Google's own Pixel phone which has essentially replaced their Nexus line. “It's also interesting to note that while this user was apparently running antivirus software, they were still infected. While many people perceive antivirus as a critical security control, many security professionals have been questioning its value for many years,” Young said.

Lee Kyeong-tae confirmed Samsung will work with Google to maintain their relationship while the AI market is blossoming. There was some speculation that Google would prevent Samsung from including its own AI solution in its Android phones due to its own Google Assistant taking precedent. Samsung says it has sights set on other markets for artificial intelligence too, not just the mobile market. The company plans on incorporating Bixby into its TVs and tablets, while “offering its solutions to outside companies and third-party firms.” That means it’s possible we’ll begin to see third-party electronics that feature Bixby, as we’ve seen with Amazon’s Alexa. local_offer    ai   Bixby   Google   Google Assistant   Samsung   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (1) stars Further Reading Google fixes contacts with latest Hangouts update Samsung files trademark for "Gear Fit Pro" The Galaxy S8 will feature a personal assistant Alphabet posts its Q4 2016 results Allo's newest bot will serve up GIFs when you ask for them stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertGalaxy S7 Edge owners reporting pink lines in display closePink lines showing up on some Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge displays Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge owners are reporting pink lines appearing in their displays.

These sensors can detect single protein molecules © AFP/Getty Images The Galaxy S8 will be announced in late March and go on sale around 21 April. Samsung’s Galaxy S8 will come in two sizes, have an almost bezel-less, edge-to-edge “infinity” display and an iris scanner, the Guardian has learned. The Galaxy S8 will be announced in late March and go on sale on or around 21 April, later than the originally planned launch at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February due to knock-on effects of the Note 7 fiasco. The two variants will have screens in the 5in to 6in region, with the devices having the same or smaller proportions of previous versions of Samsung’s flagship smartphone but with larger displays, according to several well placed sources talking to the Guardian. The S7 was available with either a 5.1in and 5.5in screen. The two smartphones are codenamed Dream and Dream 2, representing the smaller and larger Galaxy S8 respectively, according to two sources. Both versions will have screens that curve down at the left and right sides of the device similar to the Galaxy S7 Edge, two sources have said. The so-called “infinity display” will cover the majority of the front of the device, with very little body on the top and bottom of the screen not dedicated to the display. Two sources said there wasn’t even room to put a logo or brand name on the front of the device. Samsung has moved the fingerprint scanner to the back of the device, multiple sources said. The Galaxy S8 will have a traditional 3.5mm headphone socket, according to several sources. Several sources also confirmed that the iris scanning biometric technology launched in the ill-fated Samsung Galaxy Note 7 will be available on the Galaxy S8, allowing users to unlock and their smartphones and authenticate purchases with their eyes. The Galaxy S8 will have a similar “duo pixel” camera to last year’s Galaxy S7, situated on the back of the device according to two sources, with incremental improvements to image quality, low-light performance and speed. The camera will also feature built-in object recognition, similar to Google Goggles, according to several sources. The Galaxy S8 will have a new processor, this time built on the company’s 10nm technology making it one of the first to do so, said two sources. Chipmaker Qualcomm recently announced the Snapdragon 835, which is being built using Samsung’s new 10nm processes. According to two sources, the new device will also come with 64GB of storage built in, as well as expandable storage via microSD card, with support for cards up to 256GB in capacity. The phone will also have USB-C and a new version of Samsung’s Gear VR headset and Gear 360 camera. The Galaxy S8 will also come with an artificial intelligence assistant, which can perform tasks such as object recognition, using the smartphone’s camera similar to Google Goggles. Two sources also said that Samsung was partnering with others to include data sources for the AI assistant. Other information leaks have suggested that it could be called Bixby, based on the technology gained by the South Korean company in its acquisition of startup Viv Labs in October, but none of the sources talking to the Guardian could confirm the name. Whether the Galaxy S8 will also come with Google’s Assistant as well or instead in some markets was unclear. Samsung also plans a range of new accessories for the Galaxy S8. Two sources said a new dock and service that turns the Galaxy S8 into an Android desktop computer, connecting to a monitor, keyboard and other peripherals called DeX (desktop extension) will be available. DeX has been likened to Microsoft’s Continuum, which connects Windows smartphones to a desktop extension to allow them to be used as Windows PCs, but only with Windows Store applications. The below picture of a front glass plate is a good representation of what the Galaxy S8 will look like, according to two sources. W tym lepiej widać zagięcie. Lekkie zaokrąglenie jest też na gorze i u dolu #GalaxyS8pic.twitter.com/KXKfn6t9GO— DforDesign (@dfordesign) January 18, 2017 Android has had the capability to act more like a traditional desktop computer, with some devices including Remix OS-based desktops taking advantage, but none of the big players including Motorola have had much success pushing the idea of using the smartphone as desktop replacement. Whether Samsung will be different with Dex remains to be seen, but the company has attempted to bring greater synergy between its Windows PCs and Android smartphones, using connectivity services that sync data and allow control of Samsung Android smartphones through Windows apps. The sources spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity due to their relationships with Samsung. The Guardian believes their information to be correct at the time of publication and has double sourced all claims, but as is the nature of product development before the release of a smartphone or device, Samsung’s plans may change. Following the high-profile failure of the Note 7 due to two separate battery faults that caused explosive failures of the phone’s integrity, Samsung needs a hit on its hands to continue the momentum it built with the design shift to metal bodies and curved screens started with 2015’s Galaxy S6 series. Samsung is locked in a war over the so-called floating voter – the 20% of people likely to switch mobile operating systems - with Apple, but is also now fighting on a new front with Google and its own-brand Pixel smartphones. Since the launch of the Pixel and Pixel XL there have been two high-profile, advertising-backed top-end Android smartphone manufacturers trying to convince existing users to upgrade. At the same time China’s Huawei has been gaining marketshare by offering both premium and well-made budget devices that are undercutting Samsung’s market, placing Huawei as third largest smartphone manufacturer as ranked by analysts firms IDC and Gartner. A Samsung spokesman confirmed that the Galaxy S8 would not be unveiled at Mobile World Congress per its president of mobile communications DJ Koh’s comments on Monday. They added that Samsung does not comment on rumour and speculation. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN News Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem.

Name: Subject: Message: Deal: ASUS OnHub Wireless Router, with Google WiFi support, for just $100 ($90 off) Deals Newsby John Callaham3 days ago 2 220 7 Before Google launched its own WiFi mesh routers in late 2016, it partnered with other companies to release some impressive (sometimes pricey) wireless routers in 2015 under the OnHub brand. Today, the ASUS OnHub Wireless Router can be bought at Best Buy with a big discount. Best of all, this ASUS product will also work with your home Google WiFi mesh network if you have one set up. See also: Google OnHub router first impressions June 9, 2016 Right now, you can snag the ASUS OnHub Wireless Router for just $99.99 at Best Buy, which is a huge $92 discount from its normal $192 price tag. One of the nicer things about the OnHub products is that they are not super-ugly to look at. There are no boxes with big antennas poking out; instead, this device is a cylinder that gets slightly smaller at the top, making it look somewhat like a vase or air freshener, with no visible antennas at all. OnHub is also very easy to set up. All you really have to do is plug it in and then use the Google WiFi (formerly the Google On) app to complete the process. While hardcore tech fans won’t get a ton of options with OnHub, that’s not who this product was made for. Instead, it was created and designed for folks who would normally have difficulties figuring out some of a router’s deeper settings (the OnHub still has them available in Developer Tools if you really want them). However, this product from ASUS does have a few nifty features, such as an easy way to set up guest access to your WiFi network for visitors. You can even set it up so that when you wave your hand over it, the router will give priority access to one device for a certain period of time, in case you want to make sure your Xbox One has the best connection during a Halo 5 multiplayer match. Finally, if you own any of the Google WiFi mesh routers, the OnHub router can connect to them seamlessly with the Google WiFi app. All in all, this is an excellent price for a router that is both powerful and easy to use. Head to the Best Buy link below to take advantage of the deal.

Like previous Google I/Os, we can expect to receive new information about Google's initiatives at the event, including the future of Android, Home, Wear and more. Rather than announcing this information in a traditional fashion, Google instead created an elaborate puzzle that developers would have to solve before the details of Google I/O were revealed. This puzzle, which was released through a GitHub repository, was split into five parts and involved coordinates and a chess board. Around the world, from here to there, to the most clever minds, the secret will share. #googledevs #savethedate https://t.co/0zwCbSLzVy pic.twitter.com/0O2vNDWZx2 — Google Developers (@googledevs) January 24, 2017 Those who solved the puzzle were greeted with basic information relating to Google I/O 2017, and a link to Google's I/O website. Currently, the webpage for Google I/O has not been updated with these details; instead it advises people to "check back soon for more details". There is no word on when you'll be able to register for Google I/O 2017, but it's expected that Google will use a lottery system to allocate tickets, similar to previous years. The conference is highly popular among developers and fans of Google, and, with the exception of last year, Google has often given out brand new hardware to those that attend.

Thanks to a “save the date” page and the work of a bunch of nerds on a cryptic Tweet from Google, we are expecting Google to announce that I/O 2017 will be held May 17-19 at the Shoreline Amphitheatre.  Google held last year’s I/O at the exact same location, which just so happens to be across the street from Google’s campus. While the location is great for Googlers attending the event (because they can walk or bike to talks and presentations), I can’t help but wish Google was looking to return to downtown San Francisco for 2017 where lodging and transportation to and from are much simpler. Last year, the layout was kind of a mess, it was 125-degrees every day, lines for talks exceeded room limits without attendees knowing until they were shutdown at the door after waiting, and the whole thing just didn’t work that well, at least in my opinion. But hey, a new year could mean better planning! I’ll stop complaining now. The keynotes were at least fun, on the huge amphitheatre stage, right? Either way, mark your calendars. Before long, we should know when tickets will go up for sale and how you’ll go about purchasing one. UPDATE: Google has now confirmed the date and location.

Alphabet to sell Terra Bella satellite unit to Planet, also talked with Climate Corp. Posted Jan 25, 2017 by Ingrid Lunden (@ingridlunden) 0 SHARES Next Story Facebook Stories puts a Snapchat clone above the News Feed Sources tell TechCrunch that Google parent company Alphabet is in advanced discussions to sell its Terra Bella satellite business — originally acquired as Skybox Imaging in 2014 — to Planet Labs. Alphabet also considered a sale to at least one other company, Monsanto’s Climate Corporation, for around $300 million. A potential sale to Planet was first reported earlier this month by Bloomberg. Our sources say that the deal is in progress and have provided other details. The transaction, one source said, is “essentially already done” and will involve employees as well as satellite assets. We’ve not heard a firm price. Aside from the $300 million figure we heard, another described Terra Bella as essentially being “donated” to Planet. Google originally acquired Skybox in 2014 in a $500 million transaction as part of a bigger strategy to get direct access to high-quality images and video shot from Skybox’s satellites. But more recently, Google’s parent company Alphabet has been making several adjustments and closures across a number of businesses in its portfolio — shutting down the Titan high-altitude drone program, spinning off its self-driving car unit within Alphabet as Waymo, rethinking some of its robotics investments, and halting Fiber developments. At the time of the original deal for Skybox, the startup had only launched one satellite among its existing fleet and had another 13 on order. It looks like there were another four satellites launched by the group in September 2016 — after Google’s acquisition — but that also means that there may be more satellites yet to launch. This could be affecting the price of the deal. Planet Labs has raised just under $160 million to date from investors including Yuri Milner, Founders Fund and Data Collective, and it has positioned itself as a consolidator of sorts in the small satellite space. In 2015, the company acquired Blackbridge, another player in small satellites. If the valuation of Terra Bella is anything close to what Google paid for it, Planet might have to raise more capital — or, what may be more likely according to a source — acquire the assets in an equity deal, where Google could take a stake in Planet. This scenario could make some sense, as it would give Google a foothold in continuing to have a steady stream of mapping data, without the cost and challenge of owning a fleet itself. It would also be a fitting arrangement in another sense: back in 2014 sources told us Google also considered buying Planet Labs before it eventually acquired Skybox. Skybox’s unique selling point when the company was first launched was that its small “birds” were built using off-the-shelf components and therefore came in at a much lower price than other satellites, less than $50 million each. But those satellites could still take ultra-high quality images and short videos of the earth’s terrain, objects on it, the movement of people, and more. Its purpose is not just to collect images, but to combine those with machine learning to spot patterns in those pictures “to uncover signals that drive the global economy”, in the words of Terra Bella itself. Google acquired it to get more accurate mapping data for its own Google Maps, but it also saw opportunities to use the data for other projects, like improving internet access and disaster relief. But one area that might have been a home for some of Skybox’s IP and imaging — Earth Enterprise — was depreciated the year after Google acquired Skybox, and will cease to be supported in March of this year, underscoring how priorities and strategy are changing for the company. But even if Google is bowing out of the race to control better mapping data for enterprise applications, there are others still hot on the trail. “Climate is talking to every single micro-satellite company in the valley,” one source told us about the Monsanto-owned digital agricultural company. The Climate Corporation provides tools and a platform to measure and model weather, soil and field data to farmers to optimize their crop production. Getting a more direct source of imaging data, and more control of what is actually getting photographed and how, seems like a very logical strategy. Both Alphabet and Planet Labs declined to comment for this story. We have contacted Climate Corp. for comment and will update when and if we hear back. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Google Founded 1998 Overview Google is a multinational corporation that is specialized in internet-related services and products.

Close to 200 of those sites were permanently banned from using Google ads, the company said. Google, much like Facebook, has been under increased scrutiny for its role in the spreading of false and misleading news ever since the presidential election in November. The company responded to this the same month with changes to its Adsense policy, prohibiting sites that “misrepresent, misstate, or conceal information about the publisher, the publisher’s content, or the primary purpose” of the site to use Google ads for monetization. Google said on Wednesday that it had reviewed some 550 sites since those policy changes, resulting in permanent bans for nearly 200 and temporarily cutting off another 140 sites from the company’s ad dollar spigot. The company also revealed that it took down 1.7 billion ads for various policy violations in 2016. This included 17 million ads for illegal gambling, 5 million payday load ads and 80 million misleading or shocking ads. As much as cutting off ad revenue may hurt so-called fake news sites, critics are likely not going to be content with this step alone. Google has increasingly been criticized for the way its algorithms highlight certain news sources as well. For instance, in November, the first Google result for “who won the popular vote” was a conspiracy blog misrepresenting the outcome of the election. And in December, the search engine highlighted a made-up story about President Obama supposedly looking to a third term.   Filed Under: fake news Google Want to read more articles like this one?

Stephanie Hoover says: January 26, 2017 at 5:31 am My Google news page still offers absolutely ridiculous “sources” like AwfulAnnouncing (whatever THAT is) and PoliticusUSA which – and I’m a progressive – is nothing more than left-leaning opinion. When I go to a service calling itself “news” I expect real journalism. NOT websites who operate solely for the purpose of generating ad revenue for Google.

Every day I see hundreds of anti-Trump articles so if I want something fair, honest and intelligent, I’ll have to go read one of the few conservative outlets listed above. This is how Trump won the election. Liberal Biased News = FAKE NEWS. When you fail to properly criticize Trump, you only create more followers and fans. But don’t tell Democrats that.

Google Translate app can now turn Japanese text to English with a photo Lost in translation? Not any more. By Oliver Cragg January 25, 2017 17:11 GMT The latest Google Translate update will allow you to switch Japanese text into English using a smartphone camera.iStock Anyone planning a holiday or business trip to the neon-lit streets of Tokyo will want to keep their smartphone camera handy, as an upcoming update to Google Translate is set to add Japanese to its 31-strong list of languages to its image recognition suite. For those unaware of the feature, the Google Translate app can translate foreign text from almost any kind of written source, such as street signs and restaurant menus, using a single photo of the text via a smartphone or tablet camera. The instant recognition software has proved to be something of a boon for confused tourists, although up until now the majority of languages supported by the feature stuck to regular character types from foreign tongues derived from Latin. Considering the complexity of the Japanese language, being able to use a quick photo within Google's app to switch kanji and kana characters to English (and vice versa) is a huge boost to the celebrated app's killer feature and help visitors to the region becoming overwhelmed by the hefty language barrier. That being said, we suppose it would have made the 2003 film Lost in Translation a lot less interesting. The Google Translate app update (version 5.7) is steadily rolling out to Android users, although APK Mirror already has the latest update available to download. As ever, we recommend waiting for the official update via the Google Play Store, but if you have an imminent trip to Japan in the next few days, the unofficial link can be found here. An update to the iOS version of the app is likely to follow. For those wondering how to actually use the feature, here's how it works: How to use Google Translate to translate text in photos and images 1. Download Google Translate from the Google Play Store or Apple's iOS App Store 2. Open the app, tap the top left field and select the language you wish to translate. 3. In the right field, select the language you wish to translate to. 4. Tap the camera icon - if this contains a plus shape where the icon's lens then the app has already registered the text area, but if not drag to select the area in the photo with text once you've taken the snap. 5. Point the camera at the text you wish to translate and tap the eye icon. If Instant Translation is available and you have the language file already stored on your device then the translation will appear in a few seconds, otherwise you may need to download a language file over Wi-Fi or mobile data (available here on smartphone or tablet). 6. To translate an existing image tap the import icon instead of the camera drag to select the area in the photo with text.

In recent years we've seen brands like Red Bull, Netflix, GoPro, and Cisco achieve massive success with video, using the medium to build awareness, create emotional connection and develop loyalty among their customers.   Those businesses that aren’t taking advantage of videos are missing out on a big opportunity. Consider these stats: 90% of users say that product videos are helpful in the decision-making process - HubSpot 100 million users watch online videos every day - Video Brewery 80% of all Internet traffic will be streaming video content by 2019 - Cisco Online video now accounts for 50% of all mobile traffic - business2community But where video content is seeing the most success is in social media, with all the major players, including Facebook, Twitter and even LinkedIn, all introducing new tools to tap into the video trend. Even on Instagram, where video has not traditionally been the primary emphasis, the time users spend watching video on the platform has increased 150% in the last six months. It's clear that video is rising in importance, but there are also other benefits to video marketing which are not as immediately obvious. Video Marketing and SEO Can video content help improve your SEO efforts? Well, this is an interesting question, and my answer is: yes.  So how exactly does video impact on SEO practices? Take a look at this example. Here, the searcher has entered the query "how to do a parkour roll" into Google, which has provided the following results: Every one of these results is either a video or has a video embedded on the page. This underlines the importance of video content, and the preference Google puts on it - based on user behavior, Google has obviously determined that video results best match this query, so they, in turn, rank higher in related searches.  Video Strategy If you haven’t yet included video as a part of your content marketing strategy, then it's worth taking action before you get left behind. Infographics, eBooks, customer case studies, blog posts, guest outreach, email campaigning, slideshares - these are all effective elements of any content marketing strategy. But right now, nothing beats the impact of video when it comes to educating buyers, building trust, and improving customer satisfaction. That said, every business, whether small or large, has a pre-defined budget to allocate to different resources. It's therefore very important to consider every aspect of your efforts to get the most out of your investment.   Before implementing any video strategy, you first need to: Analyze the audience persona for whom you will create the video Research the stats of your business related to the types of content your target customers are more likely to watch, pain points of your business, etc. Track the success rate of your competitors who are using video-based marketing Analyze available opportunities based on your business’ nature and specifications Analysis of these important points will help you derive the best results out of your investment. Video Content Options Here are some examples of possible video options to consider. Business Intro Video – This kind of video generally includes a brief greeting or an introductory message on the home page for the visitors. In short, it tells visitors about who you are, what you do, and why customers should consider you. Product Demonstration Video – An explainer video that demonstrates your product or service and how users can avail the value and benefits associated with the product or services being offered.   Customer Testimonials – Show a real person who has already used your product to add life and authenticity to your business, thus being more convincing than text alone. Events and On-Demand Webinar Videos – If you're conducting webinars or hosting any business based events, then you can record and export the sessions to your website with transcribed text. This also provides SEO benefits. Video Blogs – Video blog (vlog) is basically a form of blog which consists of video content (either self-host, or use free services like YouTube and Vimeo, etc. to publish the content). Mostly, bloggers or businesses use this technique in a sequence covering a particular topic and publish it on the web depending upon the desired frequency (weekly, monthly or a stipulated time format).  Interview Based video – Interview videos are a great way to showcase your business proficiency with expert interactive session. The best thing about this format is that a certain amount of authority and trust (being an expert) already gets applied when we see someone being interviewed. Company Spotlight – Each business has their unique stories, in terms of achievements, successes, or failures. You can create video content around such events to showcase on your website, which can help build connections and drive brand awareness and interest among the consumers. Tutorial or Explainer Video – The primary objective of this video format is to show a customer or viewer how to do something more efficiently.  12 Optimization Techniques for Video Marketing Here are twelve key video promotion tips to help you get the most from your video efforts. 1. Embedding video on your website - Integration of the video on your website itself can make a significant SEO impact. With the increase in consumption and production of videos, search engines will continue to favor results based on good customer experience.  According to the report of tubularinsights, 73% of all consumers are more likely to make a purchase after watching videos explaining a product or service. 2. Use keyword labels and customize description - Including keyword labels and descriptive content helps search engines to identify your content and match it relevant search queries. 3. Try to keep Your Video Short - Different video formats require difference lengths - ask yourself, would you watch a 30 minute video on this subject? Obviously, when it's a tutorial or the like, you might consider it, but many people prefer shorter video content. 4. Add transcript to the video - Adding a transcript enables search engines to index the information of your video while also giving your visitors another consumption option 5. Host video on YouTube and get back link - To get a larger audience for your content and brand recognition, it’s a good idea to host your video on YouTube as well. Because YouTube is the second largest search engine, and is owned by Google, earning backlinks from the platform can work well for your website. In the “Add card” category, there's an option to include a link to an approved website to drive traffic. You can also paste your website link in the descriptions of the videos. 6. Share video on different social media channels - After adding the video to YouTube, you can more easily share it on different social media channels. According to insivia, 700 YouTube videos are shared on Twitter every minute. 7. Try video promotion via email campaigns - An email campaign is another great way to boost your video’s success, and e-mail is still the best choice to interact with and retain customers personally. Including videos to your email strategy can provide outstanding results if used correctly. 8. Add video schema markup for every video - To cope with the crawling, analyzing and indexing problems of video asset, Google launched the standard schema markup for VideoObject to assist publishers in providing appropriate information about the video, so that search engines can easily locate and index the visual content. 9. Use a customized graphic as the rich snippet for video - Rich snippet is the result that displays in Google SERP when someone types a particular query. Adding a customized thumbnail for your video helps in catching the attention of your audience when they're scrolling through search results. Check out this example:   Among all the results based on the query term “how to cook pasta”, this rich snippet provides additional information about the webpage, making it stand out from the other results.  10. Focus your video on a single topic - When creating a video, you should definitely focus on a single topic rather than mixing two or more. It can distract user from paying attention to your core objective. 11. Optimize for load times - Search engines, especially Google, include page performance in their algorithms metric to rank a particular webpage. Load time can adversely affect user experience and can thus affect your SEO activity as well. Don’t include the <no script> tags, as this may slow the loading time of the page. 12. Embed Video “Above the Fold” - This will help users to easily find the piece of content they’re looking for. If a user has to scroll down to see the video (for what they came to your site to see), that can impact on their experience. Conclusion The explosive growth of videos on the web has seen businesses quickly adopting creative marketing strategies and including more video content at every step of the buyers' journey. Making a video that's enticing, one that captivates customer attention, is becoming increasingly important. The above notes can help you incorporate videos content into your marketing strategy, which can improve customer experience and increase the power of your brand’s online presence.

Thanks, TC Team 10th Annual Crunchies AwardsTicket Prices For The Crunchies Increase In Just 5 Days Get Yours Today Cisco woos AppDynamics away from IPO: It’s The Daily Crunch Posted Jan 25, 2017 by Darrell Etherington (@etherington) 0 SHARES Next Story Cisco-AppDynamics $3.7 billion deal all about the data Every Monday, Wednesday and Friday our daily guided tour of the biggest tech stories from the past 24 hours will appear here on TechCrunch.com. To get The Daily Crunch in your inbox every day of the week, sign up here. Cisco buys big, Google gets aggro on bad ads and Zuckerberg is not the next president. But maybe the one after that? All this and more in The Daily Crunch for January 25, 2017. 1. Cisco buys AppDynamics just before its IPO Cisco has acquired application performance measurement company AppDynamics almost on the eve of its IPO, for $3.7 billion. The acquisition was surprising, for sure, as we were preparing to cover the company going public later this week. So how’d it come together? Basically renewed discussions between the two started up last week, and both possibilities were entertained until AppDynamics and Cisco arrived at an agreeable deal with considerable upside for the startup’s founders. 2. Google’s efforts to slow spread of bad info picked up in 2016 Google ended up taking down more than double the number of sketchy ads in 2016 vs. 2015. Whether that’s because there’s a general rate of decay in the quality of information going around on the internet in general, or because Google just saw a larger volume or got more serious about the task, it’s a sign of things to come. 3. The Bolt EV is the electric car done right The electric car that works for most people is actually already here, and Tesla isn’t the one that delivered it: Instead, it’s GM, with the Chevrolet Bolt EV, an affordable EV with class-leading range and a smart, useful interior and exterior design. It’s basically a good, appropriately priced car, where the fact that it has an electric powertrain is just a bonus. 4. No President Zuckerberg – at least not yet Mark Zuckerberg has been running his social media like a campaigning politician, but it’s not a sign he wants to run for president. The Facebook CEO told BuzzFeed he’s definitely not planning to run for the top government spot in the U.S. But plans change, Mark. Plans change. 5. Amazon wants to sell you a STEM subscription Retail giant Amazon has a new STEM subscription service that will send an educational toy to your house once a month for $13.99. That’s a pretty great way to keep your kid learning, and most parents probably buy their child at least a toy a month on average anyway. Maybe? I don’t know, I don’t have kids. 6. Amazon Echo is getting more mainstream Voice-based computing is still kind of a weird thing, but it’s getting less so – the Echo is selling to more mainstream consumers, instead of just to tech nerds like us. That’s great news for the future of voice interfaces, which should only get better with a broader range of users. 7. Backstage Capital raising a second fund Backstage Capital is currently raising a second fund, with the same aim as the first: investing exclusively in startups with founders from groups that aren’t well represented in tech, including LGBTQ people and people of color. Its first fund, a $5 million investment pool, closed at the end of 2016. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Newsletter Subscriptions The Daily Crunch Get the top tech stories of the day delivered to your inbox TC Weekly Roundup Get a weekly recap of the biggest tech stories Crunchbase Daily The latest startup funding announcements Enter Address Subscribe SEE ALL NEWSLETTERS » Latest Crunch Report Galaxy S8 Coming in March | Crunch Report Watch More Episodes Popular Posts Featured Stories Galaxy S8 Coming in March | Crunch Report VIDEO | 3:45 | Crunch Report Weekly Roundup: AppDynamics sells to Cisco ahead of IPO, CZI buys Meta 12 hours ago | Anna Escher Apple aims to up its AI smarts with iCloud user data in iOS 10.3 17 hours ago | Natasha Lomas Trump’s manufacturing council includes Elon Musk, Michael Dell and Mark Fields 18 hours ago | Darrell Etherington Alphabet’s bets beyond search are starting to pay off yesterday | Matthew Lynley Latest From TechCrunch Crunch Report | Galaxy S8 Coming in March 5 hours ago | Khaled "Tito" Hamze Snap will reportedly file publicly for its massive IPO late next week 9 hours ago | Matthew Lynley Twitter releases national security letters 10 hours ago | Kate Conger Zuckerberg defends immigrants threatened by Trump 10 hours ago | Josh Constine Comment moderation powered by Up Next Cisco-AppDynamics $3.7 billion deal all about the data Posted Jan 25, 2017 CrunchBoard Job Listings Senior Developer - 41399BR at Harvard University - Faculty of Arts and Sciences (Cambridge, MA, United States) Engineer: Client Support Center at Target (Brooklyn Park, MN, United States) Product Manager at Calldorado (Kongens Lyngby (Copenhagen), Denmark) IT Infrastructure Manager (m/f) at eGym GmbH (München, Deutschland; Berlin, Deutschland) Digital Strategies Manager at Berkshire Hathaway HomeServices Carolinas Realty (Charlotte, NC, United States) More from CrunchBoard Advertisement TechCrunch News Video Events Crunchbase TechCrunch Store About Staff Contact Us Advertise With Us Event & Editorial Calendar Send Us A Tip International China Europe Japan Follow TechCrunch Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Youtube Pinterest Tumblr Instagram StumbleUpon Feed TechCrunch Apps iOS Android Windows 8 Subscribe to The Daily Crunch Latest headlines delivered to you daily Subscribe to <span class="no-mobile">Subscribe to </span>The Daily Crunch Enter Email Address Subscribe © 2013-2017 AOL Inc.

By far and away the most popular search engine on the Internet is Google Search, but using it and many other of the well-known search engines does mean giving up some of your privacy. Only this morning I searched for a Micro SD card and inserted into the Google search results was a reminder I'd bought a Transcend card a few months ago. That's a little unnerving. There is an alternative, though, and it's celebrating 10 billion anonymous searches today. That alternative is called DuckDuckGo, and its stated mission is to be "the world's most trusted search engine." The 10 billion total was actually achieved at the end of 2016 (with four billion logged last year alone), but according to DuckDuckGo CEO and founder Gabriel Weinberg, new records are continuing to be set this year. For example, January 10 was the first day the search engine handled 14 million searches. DuckDuckGo certainly appeals to the privacy conscious. The search engine's homepage promises no personal information is ever stored, adverts are not going to follow you around the web, search history is not stored, and no tracking is done regardless of whether you are using a private browsing mode. Related Google to EU: Our Shopping Search Results Are Fair Google to EU: Our Shopping Search Results Are Fair This alternative way of offering search also proves it's possible to make money without needing to let advertisers track you. It certainly won't be the billion Google generates, but then DuckDuckGo is a much smaller organization and focused just on search. This revenue-generating ability is demonstrated by the fact DuckDuckGo last year donated $225,000 to nine organizations promoting online trust, including the Freedom of the Press Foundation, Freenet Project, OpenBSD Foundation, CryptTech Project, Tor Project, Fight for the Future, Open Source Technology Improvement Fund, Riseup Labs, and GPGTools. Whatever your views are regarding privacy online, why not try DuckDuckGo and see if it sticks? And if you start to miss Google, then just use bangs.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Adobe intros Creative Cloud Android apps for Chromebooks By Rei Padla - January 25, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter At the Bett conference in London, several OEMs are launching new Chromebooks. We’ve already seen Acer and ASUS and we’re expecting more in the coming days. These Chrome OS notebooks are powered by Google so it’s no wonder why you can find a lot of Google apps installed on default. Now that Google Play support is available, most Android apps can also run. Adobe wants to take advantage of this change by releasing updated Android apps optimized for Chromebooks. Adobe aims to bring more tools and applications to students and teachers to help them in learning and educating. No doubt technology is essential to learning. Not many people have access or can afford but for those who can, they have the advantage. We know Adobe is one of the most trusted developers of apps that allow productivity and efficiency in design and education. With the new Chromebooks and updates to the system, Adobe apps can now be approved and pushed to select Chromebooks. With the Google Admin console, any parent, teacher, or school administrator can approve apps that students are allowed to use in the classroom, school, or even at home. It is clear that Adobe values creativity. This, coupled with technology in the classroom, have the capacity to unleash the potential in every person. Adobe has updated its Creative Cloud apps optimized for Chromebooks. They are faster and simpler to use making them ideal for students or just about anyone who is willing to learn and improve. The suite includes the following apps: Adobe Comp CC, Creative Cloud Mobile, Illustrator Draw, Lightroom Mobile, Photoshop Mix, and Photoshop Sketch. Both Google and Adobe will show off the new apps at Bett in each of their booths this week.

Google parent Alphabet will report fourth-quarter earnings after the bell, and Wall Street expects adjusted earnings of $9.64 per share on revenue of $25.23 billion, according to a Thomson Reuters consensus estimate. Barring any adjustments, that would be up from earnings of $8.67 per Class A share on revenue of $21.33 billion in the year-ago period. The search giant, which makes most of its money from advertising, will share how new ad formats helped improve business. New options, like promoted pins on Google Maps, could help sustain double-digit revenue growth in 2017, according to JMP Securities analyst Ron Josey. "We expect the search business to be very constant," said James Wang, an analyst at ARK Invest. ARK Invest offers an internet innovation ETF composed of 3.36 percent Alphabet shares. "People have been questioning the trajectory since the IPO and it has sustained itself remarkably well," Wang said. "Even with mobile where they get paid less. You would never be able to tell — you would just assume it's been a beautiful organic growth over that period of time." But like its digital advertising rival, Facebook, Google has to make sure its advertisements don't overwhelm users, and may lead to fewer ads. "If you use YouTube today, there are a lot of ads," Wang said. "We would be interested to hear any concerns about inventory." Any slowdown in ad revenue growth could be offset by more cloud computing revenue and growing subscription revenue for YouTube, including its "Red" offering, Andy Hargreaves of Pacific Crest Securities wrote in a research note. In particular, a new live version of YouTube called "Unplugged" is reportedly in the works, and includes all of CBS' content, such as live NFL games, according to multiple media outlets. "I think [Alphabet] will remain quite cagey about performance numbers, but I think it is encouraging that YouTube Red is actually getting recent traction on the Play Store," Wang said. "Prior to that, we were wondering if it would get any customers — paying for YouTube seems like an oxymoron." Hardware and fiscal discipline The company could also share some statistics about the success of the new Pixel phone and Google Home, its competitor to Amazon's Echo, during the holiday season. Over the quarter, Google tried to furtherintegrate its hardware and software businesses, starting with its first in-house phone design, Pixel, which commercializes Google's push toward virtual reality and artificial intelligence. Neil Doshi, managing director at Mizuho Securities, estimates that Google sold about 1 million Pixels during the quarter. After Amazon's Alexa dominated artificial intelligence displays at technology tradeshow CES, ARK's Wang said he's eager to hear how the similar Google Home device has fared since its November debut. The call will also be an opportunity for the company to reiterate its improved fiscal discipline under CFO Ruth Porat, who joined in 2015. One of the company's big moves under Porat was to split core Google (including search, Android, Chrome and YouTube) from "other bets," such as the Nest home automation products, venture investments and self-driving car technology (recently renamed Waymo). In that "other bets" category, Porat has focused on projects that are "a sizable opportunity," trimming back projects that didn't show enough potential, such as the Fiber initiative, which was planning to deliver super-fast internet access to communities through fiber optic connections to homes. Wall Street has lauded the financial discipline, transparency and shareholder return of the Alphabet structure, even if the company has lost key staffers in the process. "If you were to be very objective in how their strategy has been with moonshots, they've been a barrier, to be candid," said Wang. "Other than their autonomous car division — which is not making money but is one of the lead contenders for the autonomous race — all the other segments, Boston Dynamics, drone delivery, health-care bets, have not yielded any results. Ruth is right to shut them down. ... From a shareholder perspective, facing the music is a good thing." "[Cutting other bets] is sobering, but a silver lining is they have conviction because they have found something under their nose where they can win: machine learning," Wang said. Disclosure: JMP Securities makes a market in shares of Alphabet and expects to receive or intends to seek compensation for investment banking services from Alphabet in the next three months.

The new interface has replaced categories with tags. It added a new way to post your cover photo, the profile photo and a your company’s logo. “While the profile photo interface is easy to use, it is still not clear whether Google will use that photo or override it with their algorithm based preferences,” Mike added. Here are some screen shots of the new interface. I should add, I currently do not see this interface for my business listing yet, but I guess it is rolling out slowly.

SUBSCRIBE Google’s 2016 Bad Ads Report: 1.7 billion ads removed, including fake news ads The company says efforts to crack down on payday loan ads, ads that look like system errors and fake news ads were among those that led to an increase in removed ads in 2016. Ginny Marvin on January 25, 2017 at 9:00 am More In its annual Bad Ads report, Google says it took down more than double the number of ads in 2016 that it did in 2015 by removing 1.7 billion ads, compared to the 780 million removed in 2015. Google credited several changes for the big increase in removed ads. The new policy of removing payday loan ads that don’t meet certain criteria went into effect in July. Google says it took down more than five million payday loan ads since that time. (If you’re wondering why ads are still showing on those search queries, we took a look last October.) Google also continued to make system updates to be able to spot bad ads more reliably, among them the “trick to click” ads that look like system error notifications to get users to download malware. Google says the number of “trick to click” ads it detected and removed increased six-fold from the previous year, to 112 million. Other efforts in 2016 included detecting more “self-clicking ads” on mobile devices. While small in comparison to some of the other detection efforts, Google says it disabled more than 23,000 of these ads in 2016, compared to just a few thousand in 2015. And in a year when “fake news” became news, it’s not all that surprising that fake news ads, or “tabloid cloaking” ads, proliferated. These are the kinds of ads that look like news or entertainment headlines and take users to sites selling things like weight-loss products. Google suspended more than 1,300 accounts in 2016 but says this type of ad is gaining traction because they get clicks. “During a single sweep for tabloid cloaking in December 2016, we took down 22 cloakers that were responsible for ads seen more than 20 million times by people online in a single week.” On the publisher side, Google updated its AdSense misrepresentative content policy in November and says it reviewed 550 sites suspected of misrepresenting content to users in ways that included impersonating news organizations. The company says it took action against 340 for violations and banned nearly 200 publishers from the AdSense network.

Internet by David Katzmaier January 25, 2017 7:49 AM PST @dkatzmaier Up Next Meet Jon Hamm, the hologram (aka the holohamm) Google said it suspended more than 1,300 accounts for tabloid cloaking in 2016. Google Every year Google removes a lot of ads that violate its policies, but 2016 was the worst year yet. The search giant, which earns billions as the web's largest purveyor of digital advertising, said it removed 1.7 billion so-called Bad Ads in 2016, up from 780 million in 2015. The offending ads range from payday loan ads, which Google banned in July, to ads for illegal products like black market pharmaceuticals and gambling sites. It also includes ads the company deems "misleading," such as one asking "Are you at risk for this rare, skin-eating disease?" Google also removed a large number of what it calls "tabloid cloakers," aka fake news. The Bad Ads report, released Wednesday, says: Cloakers often take advantage of timely topics--a government election, a trending news story or a popular celebrity--and their ads can look like headlines on a news website. But when people click on that story about Ellen DeGeneres and aliens, they go to a site selling weight-loss products, not a news story. To fight scammers, Google said it removes the offending stories and bans them from advertising again. The company suspended more than 1300 such accounts in 2016. Late last year, Google and Facebook came under fire for not doing enough to squelch fake news. Google even admitted it messed up when a fake news story about Donald Trump winning the popular vote appeared prominently in the search engine's widely-read news section.

Raspberry Pi has an incredible kick-start, a single-board computer revolution and through the years, the small PC-on-a-chip starting to build and become recognized as being the founder of a whole new tech niche. BBC reported that Google has a big plan for Raspberry Pi this year, as the low-cost credit-card sized computer will be getting the machine learning tools and artificial intelligence into its system. Raspberry Pi is now greatly used by the maker community for programming devices and widely used by schools. In determining future development paths for Raspberry Pi, Google addressed the makers asked to complete a survey regarding what smart tool would be so helpful. The survey question by the online titan served as a probe in order for them, Google can decide what particular tool could be very helpful for the development of the device. The survey suggests aiding emotion and face recognition, sentiment analysis, natural language, and speech-to-text translation.

The crackdown came specifically in the months of November and December, following a change of policy for Google’s ad network AdSense designed to punish sites that intentionally misrepresent who they are in order to deceive readers. The updated policy led to the review of 550 sites, including a considerable amount that were masquerading as legitimate news organizations. Google reported it took action against 340 of those sites and permanently banned about 200 of the violators from its advertising platform. The company also suspended more than 1,300 accounts for “tabloid cloaking,” a practice that became increasingly popular in 2016. The scam involves creating ads that purport to be news and information only to send users to a site trying to sell a questionable product when clicked. The ads are often targeted around current events. Google did not provide a fake news list, or name any of the offenders. Fake news became one of the primary stories to come out of the 2016 election after reports that false headlines and websites posing as legitimate news organizations managed to spread online, especially across social media platforms. Facebook received much of the scrutiny, but Google came under considerable fire as well, especially after a report found the search engine was surfacing bad information on a variety of searches, including producing results claiming the Holocaust was a hoax when queried about the topic. Related Stories Trump's False Claims Put Free Press In Jeopardy This Writer Plans To Stop The White House By Publishing Lies By punishing sites or kicking them off its advertising network entirely, Google is hoping to suffocate the fake news sources by taking away their primary source of funding. Whether cutting off the advertising dollars is enough or not is yet to be seen. Fake news was a small part of Google’s focus on bad ads in 2016. The company took down 1.7 billion advertisements that violated terms and services—about double the amount it took down in 2015. Included in that mess of malicious advertising was more than five million ads for payday loan companies. Google made the decision in July 2016 to start removing ads that promoted predatory lending practices, with a particular emphasis on the high-interest, short-term loans that often target vulnerable populations. Google also took offline 112 million “trick to click” ads that try to deceive viewers into clicking them, more than 68 million for healthcare violations, 17 million for illegal gambling and 80 million for misleading users.

Aliens & UFOs 0 0 0 January 24, 2017 UFO News: Alien Hunter Claims Own Abduction Recorded By Google Earth Satellite, Lens Flare Or Indisputable Proof? Simon Alvarez A recent UFO-related incident has caught the attention of numerous hunters worldwide, as a noted alien photographer discovered satellite images from Google Earth that appear to show an actual abduction taking place, complete with a Classic Grey on the ground. What’s more, the UFO photographer claimed that the person who seems to be in the middle of a confrontation with an extraterrestrial was none other than himself. The incident was first reported in the Torquay Herald Express, with UFO spotter John Mooner of Devon, UK, coming forward with his remarkable findings. Even more interesting is the alien photographer admitting that the dates of the satellite images coincided with a period when he experienced numerous episodes of missing time. If the satellite images are any indication, it would appear that there was a perfect reason behind Mooney’s strange experiences. 'Amazing evidence of my alien abduction' claims UFO spotter John Mooner – Torquay Herald Express https://t.co/4YXwbZXXkq #UFO #UFOS — __.uFo.__ (@Ufo_area) January 23, 2017 The Google Earth satellite images are a bit grainy, but they do have some strange attributes. For one, the photos appeared to have been snapped on a relatively clear day, but three distinctly bright lights could be seen prominently in the image. Of course, the fact that there is a figure of a man and a humanoid-looking creature in the frame makes the satellite image extremely compelling. Mooner himself described how his discovery of his forgotten abduction happened. “I was having trouble with the Google Earth app that was installed on my computer so I looked for an online option and found Google satellite maps. I thought to myself I will view the area where I was UFO spotted (sic) from last year and look for anything out of the ordinary. I was left speechless by what I saw.” “The satellite has captured a real alien abduction taking place. The shocking thing about this was that it’s me being abducted by a Grey alien and the satellite image clearly shows me trying to fight off the Grey alien by punching it in the face.” While details of the alleged Grey alien engaging in a fist fight with the UFO photographer could not be made out clearly due to the satellite image’s quality, it is quite difficult to deny that the particular photo from Google Earth was very interesting. After all, it is not every day that Google’s satellites would capture an image with three seemingly unexplainable lights in the same area. According to Mooner, the lights in the photos are three UFOs flying at different altitudes, according to an RT News report. [Image by Ana Aguirre Perez/Shutterstock] “The strangest thing about this captured incident is that I do not remember this taking place at all. I do, however, remember sporadic episodes of missing time throughout the year of 2016 and going back through the previous years. I do remember wearing a black baseball cap and shirt. This is definitely me on the satellite image.” “I also spotted three UFOs that were heading in my direction. The three UFOs were identical and appear to be flying in formation at different altitudes. The UFO that appears to be at the highest altitude has a green light emanating from it and appears to be leaving a faint contrail with a red glow behind it. The other two UFOs are glowing white.” While Mooner’s account and its accompanying Google Earth satellite images are undoubtedly compelling, critics and skeptics in the UFO community have so far been unimpressed, with many stating that the alleged UFOs on the images are nothing but reflections of light from the mirrors of houses in the area. Others, on the other hand, stated that the bright lights in the images are nothing but lens flares from the camera utilized by the Google Earth satellite. Unsurprisingly, Mooney’s supporters have stated that both scenarios are quite unlikely, especially since lens flares and reflections from objects on the ground rarely how up as bright as the lights in the satellite images. While the truth behind the mysterious photos and the even more mysterious incident behind it might never be fully explored, Mooner’s account becomes yet another compelling incident in this year’s ever-growing list of UFO-related reports. UFOs and other paranormal incidents might not be declassified governments anytime soon, but it is difficult to deny that almost every day, someone on this planet experiences a close encounter with something that is, without question, out of this world.

Here are the first few things you need to do January 25 GOOG: 835.67 11.80 Google removed over 1.7 billion ‘bad ads’ in 2016, cracking down on clickbait and scammers Justin Duino - Jan. 25th 2017 8:02 am PT @jaduino Google Google adwords View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit In a world full of fake news, clickbait headlines, and online scammers, Google is working hard to only display legitimate and trustworthy advertisements on its massive ad network. To achieve this, Google removed over 1.7 billion “bad ads” in 2016 — more than double the number of ads taken down in 2015… Google made two changes to Adwords in 2016. The first was an update to its advertisement policy which banned payday loan ads as these typically scammed users into high-interest loans with payments that they couldn’t afford. Since the policy change, Google was able to disable over 5 million payday loan ads. The second change was an update in the technology used to automatically spot bad ads. Specifically, Google started to target “trick to click” advertisements which would show fake system warnings and trick users into thinking the message from coming from their devices. In 2016, Google was able to remove over 112 million of these harmful advertisements. Google also went after advertisements that promoted illegal products (including pharmaceuticals), online gambling, and mislead users. These together accounted for over 165 million bad ads. Google noted that self-clicking advertisements on mobile had grown exponentially. These ads are the type that automatically forward you to another website that could potentially be harmful (and are annoying at the very least). In 2015, Google identified and removed only a couple thousand of these self-clicking ads but in 2016, over 23 thousand had to be taken down. Sometimes just taking down an ad isn’t enough, though. In 2016, Google had to start banning advertisers who were publishing “tabloid cloaker” ads. To paraphrase Google, these advertisers create ads that look like news headlines and then place these ads on different publications. Users, thinking that they are clicking to read another story, then get forwarded to a spam website that would attempt to sell them some sort of product. Over 1,300 accounts were suspended for tabloid cloaking. Lastly, Google is also cracking down on the websites that use the Adsense platform. Google does not permit its ads to be shown on sites that display weight-loss scams, unwanted software, or sell counterfeit items. Altogether, over 68 thousand sites were banned or had their Adsense account suspected for being in violation of one these policies. Google isn’t going to stop there, though. Knowing full well that scammers will continue to attempt to get around their safeguards, Google will continue to invest in technology to help detect and stop malicious advertisements. Additionally, Google supports different efforts such as the Coalition for Better Ads in hopes that ads will get better for both publishers and consumers.

Several leaks and rumors have pinpointed that the “Bixby” virtual assistant will debut on the S8, presumably as a rival to Google Assistant. Obviously, Google might not be thrilled about that development, but Samsung says that the competition could take AI “to the next level.” Even though the so called “Bixby” will only be running on Samsung’s products, apparently including TVs and appliances alongside smartphones, the competition with Google may force each virtual assistant to try to outdo the other. We’re already seeing this on Samsung’s front, as “Bixby” is rumored to pack a handful of features which other AI options, such as Google Assistant, do not. According to market rumors, Google may have even attempted to keep Samsung from installing “Bixby” on top of Android, similar to what it has done in the past with blocking the installation of certain apps and services. Korean publication The Investor learned during a Samsung earnings call yesterday that the company wants to “collaborate as well as compete” with Google to push AI forward. Lee Kyeong-tae, a member of Samsung’s mobile division, gave the following statement: “Samsung and Google will have to continue to maintain their strategic partnership to nurture the AI and the market for the emerging technology.” It will certainly be interesting to see how Samsung’s new AI assistant compares to Google’s and how the two will push each other forward through the year.

The tech giant has faced repeated criticism over its handling of fake news stories, including allowing a fake news website to rise to the top of its results displaying an incorrect story claiming that President Trump had won the popular vote. ADVERTISEMENT In his post explaining how Google attempted to crack down on “bad ads, sites and scammers,” Spencer explained that Google had expanded its policies against misleading websites in November, leading to the crackdown. “From November to December 2016, we reviewed 550 sites that were suspected of misrepresenting content to users, including impersonating news organizations,” Spencer wrote. “We took action against 340 of them for violating our policies, both misrepresentation and other offenses, and nearly 200 publishers were kicked out of our network permanently.” In total, Google took down 1.7 billion ads that they found in violation of their policies in 2016, more than double the 780 million they removed in 2015.    View the discussion thread.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google shows off new Chromebooks with Google Play support from Acer and ASUS By Rei Padla - January 25, 2017 1 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Ah Chromebooks. The world has moved from desktop computers to laptops to netbooks and now–Chromebooks. Well, at least for us within the Android community, we see the Chrome OS-powered notebooks as a necessity not only for the professionals and the enterprise but also for the students and teachers. Earlier this week, new Chromebooks designed especially for education were announced over at Bett, an important education technology conference, currently being held in London. Students today are very much lucky because they have all the tools they can get to learn and be educated. We’re not just talking about having access to the Internet and computer. There are more resources and devices like smartphones, tablets, media players, and VR headsets. Chromebooks are more preferred by most in the education sector because they are light, easy-to-use, and affordable. There may be expensive models and more high-specced ones now but Chromebooks are still categorized as lightweight laptops. Chromebooks are optimized for most of Google apps like Gmail, Google Drive, and Google Calendar. Google has launched the Classroom, as well as, the G Suite for Education to help students, administrators, and teachers. Google disclosed that there are over 70 million G Suite users and 20 million people taking advantage of the Chromebooks and Classroom. There are already dozens of Chromebooks available and we know more will be added especially after the Bett conference. Numerous OEMs have already announced new Chromebooks. There’s Asus, Acer, Dell, Lenovo, HP, and Samsung. Just yesterday, we said that Google will bring Android apps to all Chromebooks beginning this year. Android Nougat is also being prepped for Chromebooks. The last models introduced were those by Samsung introduced during the CES. Recently announced are two Chromebooks from Acer and Asus–the Acer Chromebook Spin 11 and the Asus Chromebook C213. The two models are expected to be available in Spring complete with an intelligent stylus, Optical Character Recognition, built-in camera, USB-C charging, and Google Play support for them to run Android apps. The Chromebooks are also getting the new Adobe Creative Cloud apps. Acer Chromebook Spin 11 Key Specs: • OS: Chrome OS with Google Play support • Processor: Intel Celeron quad-core processor N3450 or Intel Celeron dual-core processor N3350 • Display: 11.6-inch HD IPS • Dimensions: 296 (W) x 206 (D) x 20.5 (H) mm • Weight: 1.4kg • Battery: 10-hour battery • RAM: 4GB/8GB LPDDR4 memory 3 • Storage: 32GB/64GB onboard storage through eMMC flash • Connectivity: Bluetooth 4.2, 2X2 MIMO 802.11ac Wi-Fi, two USB Type-C ports • Others: U.S. MIL-STD 810G compliant, Wacom EMR, 360° dual-torque hinge design, MicroSD card reader We don’t have much information about the Asus Chromebook C213 but we know it boasts of an 11-inch display with Gorilla Glass 4, 46Wh-11 hour battery, modular design, and dual HD cameras. No information on pricing and availability of new Chromebooks have been provided either so we’ll wait and see.

Barry Levine on January 25, 2017 at 10:25 am More Purchased by Time, Inc. last February, ad tech company and Myspace-owner Viant has been focused on developing a people-based platform that can rival Google and Facebook. This week, Viant took another step in that direction, announcing it has agreed to buy Adelphic, a major mobile-oriented programmatic ad platform. Deal terms were not made public. While Adelphic is now a key part of the Viant vision, it will remain available to clients outside the Time/Viant family. People-based marketing means that the targeted audiences are identified as actual people. When Tim and Chris Vanderhook — the brothers behind Viant — use the term, they mean that ads are directed at John Doe, not an anonymous user or a John Doe who has been anonymized before being handed over to a demand-side platform for the ad campaign.

It's been a tale of two tech stories over the last 10,000-point gain for the Dow industrials index. The older gray chips stocks — think IBM, Cisco or even Apple — versus the newer, so-called FANGs — Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Google parent Alphabet: older tech companies founded before 1990 versus their younger brethren. It's well known that the high-flying FANGs have been outperforming their legacy peers over the last few years. But the extent to which they've been outperforming them — and the broader markets — since the Dow crossed 10,000 is staggering. Since Oct. 14, 2009 — the Dow's first significant close above 10,000 after the financial crisis — the FANG basket has returned more than 950 percent. The best performing FANG has been the "N" — Netflix, returning over 1,900 percent, followed by Amazon, up 740 percent since then. In that same period, the basket of gray chip tech companies has returned about 130 percent. The legacy laggards that pulled down the gray chip basket are Xerox, Cisco and IBM. All three have returned about 60 percent or less since October 2009. Some gray chips, though, have proved more agile than others, modernizing their businesses and pleasing investors along the way. Microsoft, for example, has made a big bet on its cloud business under Satya Nadella and returned nearly 170 percent. And Apple has been a Dow leader since 10,000, returning more than 370 percent. And one of the biggest gray chip winners may surprise you. Texas Instruments — which has benefited from the semiconductors surge — has returned about 250 percent during this period, performing even better than Alphabet. While FANG shares have flow high, so have their valuations during the Dow's historic march. Netflix has a price-to-earnings ratio of 324 while Amazon's is 189. Compare that to some of the underperforming older tech stocks. Xerox — which has risen less than 60 percent since October 2009 — has a P/E ratio of just 11. This year, there are signs that the market has been paying more attention to that discount in gray chips. Since the start of 2016, the older tech stocks have the FANGs beat. They've returned about 40 percent, double the nearly 20 percent average from Facebook, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet. Over the last 12 months, Symantec has climbed about 50 percent, and IBM is up more than 25 percent, and Advanced Micro Devices has surged 260 percent. By contrast, Google parent Alphabet has underperformed the S&P 500. Since the election, the divergence is has held. The gray chip basket has returned nearly 10 percent since President Trump's win while the FANGs are up 6.5 percent.

Mark Lennihan/AP/File | Caption Fullscreen Loading... David Dritsas Brad's Deals January 25, 2017 —Amazon Echo products were some of the top-selling items of the 2016 holiday season. This was due in no small part to Alexa, the voice-activated digital assistant who can play your favorite music, tell you about the weather and automatically order products from your Amazon account. But Google's recent entry to the digital assistant game, Google Home, is a very similar device that promises to do much of the same. Which one is actually worth your money? We decided to investigate. We got our hands on both a Google Home and an Amazon Echo Dot, and did a bit of a taste test. We rated both devices on price, responsiveness and overall skills. Here's what we found: Best price: Amazon Echo Dot Naturally, cost is a key point and here, and Amazon is ahead of the game. At $49.99, its entry level Echo Dot gives you the magic of a digital assistance for not a lot of money down. In fact, it's the only home assistant currently available for under $100, and we've seen it drop to $39.99 more than a few times. The drawback is that, while the Echo Dot does have a tiny built-in speaker, it's not the best sounding speaker you'll ever hear. If you want a better speaker, you'll need the full-blown Echo ($179.99 at full price) or the Tap ($129.99 at full price). Keep in mind the Tap model does not feature voice activation, so you'll need to press a button if you end up buying that. Conversely, Google Home is usually $129, and the lowest we've seen it go for is $99. Even at full price, that's cheaper than the Amazon Echo with the built-in speaker. So while, at the end of the day, Google Home has the better price for a decent, built-in speaker, I'm not sure that's the best way to look at things. In my opinion, while the Google Home's speaker sounds fine, it's not stereo or anywhere near audiophile quality. I found it to be too bass-heavy and there is no way to adjust any audio EQ settings. It's OK for listening to news radio, but it's not great for heavy music listeners. 10 best books of January 2017, according to Amazon's editors I gave this round to the Echo Dot, because you can connect it to an external speaker using Bluetooth or the built-in audio jack. There is no audio jack on the Google Home, which was disappointing to me because, as mentioned above, I was not impressed with its speakers. Using an external speaker for the Echo Dot doesn't override the microphone, so you can use Alexa as normal while it's hooked up to the speaker of your choice. I synched mine to my stereo A/V system, and it was my favorite set up when comparing the two devices. Perhaps ironically, the cheapest device gave me the best options for better audio. Most responsive: Google Home Perhaps the most important feature of any digital assistant is how well it understands and responds to you. In this, both devices perform quite well. Right out of the box I was impressed how well both devices understand not only myself, but other people. Set-up for both is very simple — all it takes is an app download to your phone or tablet and password inputs for a WiFi network. Both also had excellent recognition from a distance. Even from three rooms away, both were able to hear and understand me. Neither seems to be better than the other in this regard. If I had to pick a winner for intelligence, I would go with Google Home. Its response time to my queries and commands was noticeably faster than Alexa's. We're probably talking milliseconds, here, but it was enough that I could tell the difference. Google Home also seemed to be better at reasoning. While setting an alarm one night, I accidentally told Google Home to go off at 7 p.m., instead of 7 a.m. but the device was easily able to make the correction when I realized my mistake. When I reenacted this same command error with Alexa, it did not go as smoothly. Alexa did not understand what I was changing and I had to cancel the alarm and set a new one. As Google is more of a tech company and is Amazon more a retail company, I am not surprised by this. I expect that we'll see faster improvement from Google's digital assistant over time than we will see from Alexa. Google Home also has the edge when it comes to device synching — Google Home devices work better together, and support functions like multi-room group playback for music. This is not something that Echo supports, even thought it really should. Most overall abilities: Amazon Echo Dot The breadth of what your assistant can do is important. Both the Echo and Google home offer countless performable functions, some of which they approach the same way, and some of which they approach completely differently. Google Home integrates pretty easily with your Google account. That means it syncs automatically with events and reminders you set up in Google calendar, though you can't yet add things to it, which is disappointing. You can, however, keep lists with through Google Keep. It also streams music and radio from its own Google Play (the full version requires a monthly fee), as well as from services like Spotify and Pandora. I set up Google Play and Pandora accounts and both worked pretty seamlessly. If you have Chromecast, it can sync with that, too, and you can ask it to play shows and movies through that. The Echo line can't yet do that with compatible Amazon Fire TV devices. Google Home can also perform some home control, too, though it is limited to the products from Nest, Philips Hue, and Samsung SmartThings. This was disappointing, as it rendered the TP-Link smart plugs that I use for some of my lighting useless. They work great on Alexa, however. In fact, as far as skills go, Alexa outshines Google Home in several ways. For starters, it's compatible with more brands of home control devices, which allows you to find not only a better variety of products, but helps fit a wider variety of budgets. Music is readily available through Pandora, Spotifiy, Tune-In Radio, Prime Music, and a few other services. Alexa can also keep lists, but links them directly to your Amazon shopping account, making your shopping list a bit more efficient and useful than Google Home's. And, since it's tied to your Amazon account (Prime or regular), you can order directly through Alexa. Google Home has no retail feature yet. Shopping through Alexa can be handy, but I found this to bit a bit imperfect. Amazon offers Alexa-only deals, but when I tried to order one, it kept quoting me a higher price than what I saw online, so I gave up. There have also been reports of accidental orders by people's kids, even though there are supposed to be measures in place to protect against that. On top of all this, Alexa has a unique "Skills" section, which make it a bit more interesting than the Google Home. While both Alexa and Google home are pretty good about answering questions with answers found from basic internet searching, Alexa has a litany of customizable skills you can select, enable, and disable as you please. These include things like sailing forecasts for specific locations, interactive Jeopardy games (which I admit I play regularly), a short bedtime story you can personalize for your kid, and even a health tracker that can pair with your FitBit and analyze your fitness patterns. Not all the skills are great, but each one is subject to user reviews, so you can see what ones aren't worth your time. I have found this very helpful. Overall winner: Amazon Echo Dot In the end, I think both devices are good, but if you are just getting into this for the first time, I would recommend the Amazon Echo Dot. You'll save money and the device currently gives you more options for add-ons. You can also get a few Echo Dots for around the house at a much lower price than if you were to to buy multiple Google Home devices. Having more than one device around the house helps make voice-activated home assistance and control worthwhile, and makes it accessible in all parts of your home.

Sections Deseret NewsInDepth InDepth Why it's likely impossible to restore online privacy By Lois M. CollinsDeseret News@loisco Published: Jan. 25, 2017 8:30 a.m. Updated: Jan. 24, 2017 4:17 p.m. 1 Comment Once information is digitized and posted anywhere on the web, it has virtually become perpetual and eternal. —Randy Dryer, University of Utah professor Related Links Michelle Singletary: Are you doing enough to protect your privacy? Googling yourself now leads to personal privacy controls Folks online are worrying about a free genealogy site that lets users search for someone by name then provides the year the individual was born, possible relatives and associates and the person's addresses, past and present. The personal information available on the FamilyTreeNow.com site is taken from free public databases and can be readily found on other search sites, in various forms, many of which charge for the information. But an alarm was raised after a woman tweeted about it, friends and others shared the post and it went viral, prompting dozens of news stories. FamilyTreeNow.com has not responded to a request for an interview for this story. Privacy and information experts say that how people manage access to their digitized data will continue to be a challenge because that information never goes away. "Once information is digitized and posted anywhere on the web, it has virtually become perpetual and eternal," said University of Utah professor Randy Dryer, an expert in media, privacy and information law. "Even if it's removed shortly after it was posted, it's probably either cached on search engines or part of a backup that's maintained or else someone downloaded it. Once something's on the internet, there's permanency to it." It's also likely impossible to restore privacy that U.S. law never protected. "Privacy protection in the U.S., in general, is pretty weak," said Brigham Young University law professor Clark Asay, who teaches and writes about information privacy. "Once information is public, people take it and use it how they like," he said, acknowledging it's a "little more unnerving when information is presented in consolidated form." 'The new oil' Most people don't understand how much information is being collected. Dryer said personal information is gathered into massive databases regularly "and to a far more pervasive extent than most people realize, either voluntarily or involuntarily." Individuals readily provide information to Google, Facebook and other social networks. The sites' privacy policies — which most people opt into without actually reading — explain how they'll use the data. Some will sell it, sometimes in an individually not-identifiable form; some use it to target their advertising at specific consumers. Dryer said he's amazed at the sheer amount of information people provide in online surveys or when they register to win a free iPad. The issue has been known for a long time. In 2014, Jacob Morgan, a futurist, keynote speaker and author of “The Future of Work," wrote in a column for Forbes that "most of (us) use Facebook, have iPhones, use Twitter, search on Google, and use the hundreds of other tools and platforms that companies have so graciously given us access to. We subscribe to newsletters, buy things online, take quizzes, allow our apps to access third-party websites, enter contests, and register for conferences. Simply loading a web page of any kind tracks some kind of information about you.” Data that's directly provided allows those who collect it to infer other information, such as political affiliation, Dryer said. And collecting two piles of information that have something in common, like an email address, creates a fuller picture of the individual. "There's no such thing as free in the online world," he said. "There's no fee to open a Facebook account, but Facebook probably has more information about individuals than any other entity, including the government." He warned that unless folks log out each time they leave the site, it tracks movement elsewhere on the web. "It knows what websites you visited, how long you were there and if you made purchases, not to mention what you like and dislike based on the things you click on while on Facebook." Advertisers love that kind of information. "Say someone is putting together upscale vacations," Dryer said. "They can go to Facebook and get an ad targeted to everyone with a college education who is older than 15, has no children and earns over $200,000 a year. "Personal data is the new oil. It has value and people are giving it away all the time, sometimes knowingly and perhaps not." Risk and reward Before the internet, people "enjoyed a certain amount of practical anonymity," according to Asay. Someone would have to make more effort to get information because it was not all in one place. Still, Asay notes, "there are plenty of arguments that privacy concerns are exaggerated. Everyone says they're concerned about privacy, but if you give them 20 cents, they tell you whatever you want.  All the information allows us to do some amazing things." His list of amazing includes creating products that better meet consumer needs and that directly target the right buyer, too. It's a mixed bag. Data available online makes it easier to find an old friend, but it may also make stalking more simple, as critics claim. And the right data could be a tool for identity theft, among other things. Folks bent on that crime can even employ the kind of online quiz that individuals love. It's important to watch the kind of question being asked. Often, they're remarkably similar to typical security questions. Already there FamilyTreeNow isn't particularly special in terms of finding information. I spent 20 minutes looking up names of co-workers on various sites to get a sense of how FamilyTreeNow.com compares to others that mine and then share public information. FamilyTreeNow couldn't figure out who my husband was but did show that two colleagues use their middle names instead of their first names. As for possible relatives — for them and for me — it batted about 75 percent, similar to lists on other sites including the online white pages, 411.com and Spokeo. Most of the other sites I noodled names on offer a deeper dive into personal information, including phone numbers, emails and criminal background checks for a fee. The genealogy site only provided a current address, correctly some of the time. Crafting a careful Google search turned up similar information. When I looked up a friend's husband, I hit a virtual motherlode of data by following a Google search link to another data site I'd never heard of. It provided his current address, exact birthday, marital status, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn and Google Plus names, a list of 10 neighbors and their addresses, as well as names, ages and addresses of several relatives. Although more information was reportedly available for a fee, I didn't have to invest a penny to get all that. Hard to escape the past The U.S. government has tried to control use of some types of personal information. The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act governs the sharing of health information, among other things, and includes patient privacy protections. The Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule is overseen by the Federal Trade Commission with an aim to protect online privacy of children under age 13. It's why kids younger than 13 are not supposed to have a Facebook account, for instance, although the behemoth online media site has no mechanism to verify age. It's a far cry from protections created in the European Union, which has more rules governing data. "The EU views data as a commodity and says that the individual owns that commodity," Dryer said. In the EU, unless one provides "affirmative dissent" — yes, please do keep this information — companies and databases cannot collect and use certain data. It applies to all segments of EU society and industry, said Dryer. Europe also codified a "right to forget." America has not. Some U.S. media outlets are re-examining how to handle their story databases since the advent of search engines that pull up information quickly. Dryer and Asay point to instances where U.S. newspapers, for example, have been asked to take down old stories. Say a former drug user who was the subject of a story has since cleaned up his life, but whenever a prospective employer searches for the person online, the old story comes up. Asay said news organizations are frequently asked to remove such stories — a controversial request. 1 comment on this story "Even newspapers are thinking about the permanency of the internet — and an argument that one should not rewrite history," said Dryer, who noted that when he handled libel cases, "it used to be the only thing they wanted other than money was an apology. Now, more than money, they want the allegedly false story removed from online." The story doesn't have to be wrong. People want unflattering portrayals to disappear, too. But even if a news organization complied, it doesn't mean the story won't surface, courtesy of previously mentioned data-saving efforts like caches. That's led to the creation of another industry, Dryer said. People who call themselves "reputation managers" will try to get negative material online removed, or generate positive content so that the negative publicity is repressed. Sometimes it's a matter of creating enough good buzz that when the person's name comes up in an online search, any negative publicity is relegated to the third or fourth page of the search results. With short attention spans, most Americans don't scroll that far. Email: lois@deseretnews.com, Twitter: Loisco Related Links Michelle Singletary: Are you doing enough to protect your privacy?

Releasing two variations with smaller price tags: the Tap and the Echo Dot. Read More  at different price points. The Amazon Echo has been around longer than the Google Home and appears to have a leg up. There are a ton of third-party services and smart devices that are Alexa-compatible.

ByDanny Palmer | January 25, 2017 -- 15:06 GMT (07:06 PST) | Topic: Security Mobile ransomware dubbed 'Charger' somehow slipped through security to become available via Google Play. Image: Getty Images/iStockphoto A nasty form of mobile ransomware which steals data from its victims has been discovered on and now removed from the official Google Play store for Android. Dubbed 'Charger' by cybersecurity researchers at Check Point, the zero-day mobile ransomware was found embedded in EnergyRescue, an app supposedly designed to enhance battery-life of phones and tablets. Charger was detected on the device of an employee at a CheckPoint customer, who had downloaded the malicious app from Google Play. The cost of ransomware attacks: $1 billion this year And it's only the beginning, with file locking malware only set to grow and take larger role in cybercrime, warn researchers. Read More Once downloaded from the store, the app initially steals contact data and text messages from the device before asking the user for admin permissions, which if granted will run the ransomware, locking the device and displaying a note demanding payment. Like many cybercriminals behind ransomware schemes, the malicious actors behind Charger demand a ransom in Bitcoin, asking for 0.2 Bitcoin -- worth around $180 -- in return for unlocking the device. The message also threatens the victim, telling them that if they don't pay, the perpetrators will sell a portion of the information stored on the phone on the 'black market' every 30 minutes. "We collect and download all of your personal data. All information about your social networks, Bank accounts, Credit Cards. We collect all data about your friends and family," the ransom note claims. This is far from the first instance of Android malware and isn't even the first time it has been being discovered on the Google Play store. But in most cases, the malicious payload is hidden deep within the application code, only running at a later time. Charger, on the other hand, gets to work much faster and uses techniques such as ecoding strings into binary arrays -- making them harder to inspect -- and loading code from encrypted resources in order to avoid detection. Researchers haven't discovered who is behind the ransomware, but when installed on a device, Charger checks its location settings. If the device is located in the Ukraine, Russia, or Belarus, it doesn't run the malicious code, suggesting the cybercriminal operation behind the ransomware scheme might be based out of Eastern Europe. Android's security team was alerted to the existence of Charger and the EnergyRescue app is no longer available on the Play Store. The malware is thought to have only infected handful of devices. "We appreciate Check Point's efforts to raise awareness about this issue. We've taken the appropriate actions in Play, and will continue to work closely with the research community to help keep Android users safe," a Google spokesperson told ZDNet.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Google I/O, the company’s annual developer conference, will kick off on May 17, 2017, and will run for three days through May 19, 2017. We should expect the event’s big opening keynote, when Google typically discusses Android and other platforms on the first day of the show. Google I/O 2017 will be held at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California. Google hasn’t listed any of the schedules just yet, so we can’t really dig through and point out specific hot topics like Chrome OS, Android, Android Wear or some rumored hybrid between Chrome OS and Android just yet. My guess is that all three of those will be discussed, though, and it’s even possible we’ll learn more about Google’s next big Android update. Perhaps we’ll even learn a bit more about new hardware. Anyone else ready for a Pixel 2? Android Wear 2.0 coming soon You won’t need to wait until May for more Android news, though. Rumor has it Google will unveil two new Android smartwatches from LG, which we recently leaked, late next month. That should be enough to tide us over until I/O 2017.

The world’s biggest (and arguably best) web-search company is set to report last quarter’s results. Specifically, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is scheduled to unveil its fiscal Q4 results after Thursday’s closing bell rings. The corresponding conference call will begin at 4:30 pm EST. Source: Shutterstock Will the iconic outfit sustain what has become a multi-year growth trend for the top and bottom line, or will this be the quarter the company’s engine runs out of gas? It’s probably the former, but there are three overarching initiatives current and would-be GOOGL investors will want to get a firm grip on before and after the earnings report. Here’s your primer for the Alphabet earnings report. Alphabet Earnings Preview As of the most recent look, analysts collectively expect the company to report earnings of $9.63 per share on revenue of $25.22 billion. Alphabet posted earnings of $8.67 per share of GOOGL stock and a top line of $21.33 billion in the same quarter a year earlier. A beat, or even just a meet, would extend a (very) long-term streak of sales and earnings growth. While year-over-year comparisons have not been positive in every single quarter for the past several years, most have been positive. The organization has adapted well, maximizing the advent of broadband that made online video possible, and then capitalizing on the advent of web-enabled mobile phones by providing an open source operating system that allows Alphabet to serve as the proverbial gatekeeper for a wide swath of the technology’s users. Three Things GOOGL Investors Need to Watch Although Alphabet — the organization formerly known as Google — is a multi-faceted outfit, traders can only focus on about three hot-buttons at a time when deciding whether to buy or sell the stock. These hot-buttons change over time, but the three in play right now are clear. Google’s Proprietary Products Hardware like the new Pixel phone and Nest home-management tools is still only a tiny sliver of its overall revenue mix, but that may not be the case forever. Indeed, if the recent use of Google’s ad inventory is any indication, the company is quite serious about selling more hardware. As The Wall Street Journal notes: “ads for products sold by Google and its sister companies appeared in the most prominent spot in 91% of 25,000 recent searches related to such items. In 43% of the searches, the top two ads both were for Google-related products.” Alphabet is getting real serious about physical products. YouTube When Google acquired YouTube back in 2006, web-based video was a relatively new idea, and it wasn’t clear how to measure the successful monetization of it. That has changed in the meantime as the idea has matured. That maturation has forced GOOGL to rethink how it sells and displays ads at the popular video venue, and the company may finally have the math and metrics down to a science. Following the previously reported quarter, it was estimated that YouTube’s annual revenue was now in excess of $10 billion, and it was growing at an annual clip of as much as 40%. [Alphabet doesn’t offer such details.] That’s a sentiment that has persisted in the meantime. Barron’s recently opined that YouTube, in conjunction with digital ad business growth, could boost the value of GOOGL stock by 20%.

Image: John Kennedy Nasdaq’s Nordic markets are prepared for greater numbers of European tech IPOs, said president Lauri Rosendahl. It is probably Europe’s worst-kept secret, but the Nasdaq Nordic markets have outpaced London and the Deutsche Börse in Frankfurt as the most active and lucrative stock exchanges for IPOs in Europe. And, at a time when venture capital investment appears to be slowing, IPOs on markets with a sophisticated investor base could provide growing tech firms with the liquidity they crave. ‘On the one hand, you have entrepreneurs with great ideas and not enough money, and then you have investors with too much money, but very few ideas. It is all about bringing those together’ – LAURI ROSENDAHL Nasdaq Nordic was recently named the most active exchange in Europe, with €7.7bn raised from 69 IPOs. The largest IPO on the Nasdaq Nordic exchange was Dong Energy, which raised €2.3bn. I accompanied a number of entrepreneurs and investors from sectors including tech, medtech and energy on a fact-finding mission to Stockholm to see what this activity was all about. When you think of Nasdaq, you usually think of giant lit-up billboards in Times Square, New York, where the stock prices of Apple, Facebook, Google and seemingly countless other companies flow and glow with never-ending frequency. Instead, our journey led us to the docklands area of Stockholm on a brisk winter morning. Aside from the neon blue Nasdaq sign, there was little to suggest that the big industrial building in front of us was actually the busiest and most lucrative stock market in Europe. Fulfilling European tech IPO ambitions Nasdaq Nordic offices, Stockholm. Image: John Kennedy Inside the former Ford car manufacturing plant, the gigantic building feels and looks more like the inside of Google, as software engineers and suits mingle and talk in hushed tones around the numerous coffee stations. The only giveaway that this cavernous building is a stock exchange is the ornate and ancient bell, surrounded by giant screens, which has rang in Stockholm’s stock markets for over 200 years. The president of Nasdaq Nordic and Nasdaq Stockholm, and SVP of European equities for Nasdaq is Lauri Rosendahl, who explained that Nasdaq Nordic is an amalgam of several stock exchanges in the Nordic and Baltic countries, including Finland, Iceland, Norway, Estonia and Latvia. Nasdaq acquired the OMX network of exchanges in 2007 for $3.7bn. Its principal market is the Main Market and its market for smaller companies is First North. Nasdaq Europe is on the cusp of a potential rebrand and one of the suggestions mooted is for Nasdaq First Europe to increase interest and appetite among European companies in pursuing higher-profile IPOs. The Nasdaq Nordic exchanges believe they have something interesting and alternative to offer European fast-growth companies because of a sophisticated and established investor base as well as an appetite amongst ordinary Swedes for retail investment. “Stock exchanges are the mother and father of crowdfunding,” Rosendahl explained. “It is still the same mechanism going way, way back. On the one hand, you have entrepreneurs with great ideas and not enough money, and then you have investors with too much money, but very few ideas. It is all about bringing those together.” Rosendahl points out that Nasdaq Nordic is ahead of other exchanges, with €6.4bn raised among 56 IPOs between Q1 and Q3 of last year, dwarfing London (€3.8bn) and Euronext (€3.3bn). A crucial factor, Rosendahl explained, is the solid investor base made up of institutional and retail funds. The Swedish appetite for investment is helped by government policy, which encourages Swedes to invest at least 5pc of their retirement funds in shares. “The average return for the Main Market and the First North from IPOs has been 40.3pc and 22.2pc respectively,” Rosendahl explained. Blockchain to transform financial ecosystem worldwide I point out to Rosendahl that the Nasdaq building in Stockholm feels more like a technology operation than an actual stock exchange. “It is a tech hub,” he said matter-of-factly. “Stockholm is the biggest of four global tech hubs in the Nasdaq group and we have close to 750 people here and more than 400 are working in system development. ‘We believe blockchain is going to be one of the most disruptive technologies that will ever transform the whole financial ecosystem’ – LAURI ROSENDAHL “We build all of the Nasdaq trading, clearing and custody systems that are then provided to exchanges all around the world.” He said that exchanges as far afield as Australia, Hong Kong and Singapore use technology developed at the Nasdaq Nordic exchange. “When Nasdaq acquired OMX, we decided to build on our technology leadership and hold onto it.” In terms of the big technological trends sweeping the financial world, Rosendahl said that big data and deep computing are crucial. “We are taking Nasdaq’s technology into the next generation with the Nasdaq Financial Framework and that is based on a modular, plug-and-play system that is designed to make us and other exchanges ready for blockchain. “We believe blockchain is going to be one of the most disruptive technologies that will ever transform the whole financial ecosystem.” Rosendahl said that Nasdaq is actually leading the field in terms of how fintech companies are creating blockchain-based applications. The organisation already has one commercial application in the field called Linq, which enables private companies to digitally represent share ownership using blockchain-based technology. “We have plans for the second commercial application to launch this spring here in our region in Estonia, and it is taking care of AGM proxy voting; how shareholders vote at AGMs [is] going to be tracked and recorded in blockchain only. That’s revolutionary if you considered the old traditional way of handling AGMs.” Rosendahl said there is a strong pipeline of blockchain-based applications in the works. “We believe that this can be truly disruptive for the benefit of much more efficient markets. Blockchain has the promise to take out a lot of the friction and improve on the processes in securities trading and post-trading.” Funding and the start-up journey The Nasdaq bell in Stockholm is traditionally rung by new companies on their first day of trading. Image: John Kennedy Rosendahl said that crowdfunding platforms are becoming an essential part of the fundraising ecosystem. “I really think that it is an exciting part of the ecosystem that is evolving, especially the ones like Kickstarter and Indiegogo. We cooperate with them and don’t see them as a threat. “We all have our place in the ecosystem and we are mother and father of crowdfunding, but as a regulated exchange, there is a lot of regulation we need to fulfill, that investors need to fulfill, proper protection and listed companies need to fulfill. In the evolution for crowdfunding, we are a little further on because of regulation. “But I really see that cooperation is the way forward and there is an evolutionary path; from a start-up beginning its path, maybe through crowdfunding or venture capital, and then through a junior market like we have [with] First North and First North Premier, and then the Main Exchange market, as regulated by EU legislation. “Last year was the first year where we had two IPOs where the distribution of investors was via crowdfunding platforms. That is the evolutionary cooperation you can have. In Finland, we had a crowdfunding platform that actually took care of a share issue for a company that listed on the Main Market. “I think the distribution platforms can really be also used for exchange listings. “And one thing that the crowdfunding platforms will be needing over time will be a secondary market. They need to offer investors in different companies a way to have price formation and liquidity.” The other key part of the funding ecosystem for start-ups is venture capital, which despite being the lead mechanism for financing companies, is in trouble. According to CB Insights, worldwide venture capital deals and dollars declined 10pc and 23pc respectively in 2016, compared to full-year 2015. Rosendahl said that stock markets and venture capital have always been in competition with each other, especially for a share of investment from the massive pension funds. But ultimately, it is not so straightforward, and every company looking to raise funding has a different story to tell. “It is all about the journey and in particular, we have taken the holistic approach – the most important thing is that there is capital available for the companies. When they have a great idea, when they have a great opportunity, the ecosystem should be there to support them to raise capital, fuel their growth, do the investments they need to do and conquer the world. We are one of the alternatives. “If a company wants to come to the public market, we have a good set of advisers that can help companies on that journey, and a lot of great investor base with good demand for investment opportunities. The more the merrier in that instance, and I think that Sweden is a great ecosystem from the perspective that you have a business angel community that works really well, you have venture capital players in the market, you have private equity and you have an exchange that has a junior market, junior-premium market and a main market. “It is just a pick and choose, and go and conquer the world.” Looking ahead, he said that Nasdaq Nordics are getting bolder in encouraging more fast-growth companies from around Europe into an IPO, especially companies mulling a C or D round. “Some companies come to market early on in their development and some, it is later on. There is no one-size-fits-all solution. We listed over 75 companies last year and these included a lot of small, mid-sized and big companies, but also lots of small companies. “The smallest company I recall was actually a company that had eight employees, no revenue and it was an R&D project that had potential revenue coming in a few years. They listed on the public market and raised enough capital to finance R&D development up until 2020 when their first product reaches the market. That is at the extreme in terms of how small companies who come to market can be.” Crucially, Rosendahl said the market decides. “It is all about having a good equity story. It needs to be a good investment case and then it is up to the investors to decide.” The key difference from the high-octane trading that saw the tech market bubble implode in 2001, Rosendahl said, is the broader base of companies in different sectors, from fintech to biotech. “The broad base of firms is very well received by our investor community. That’s the strength of the ecosystem we have here.” Rosendahl concluded by saying that a stronger Nasdaq brand and presence is on the cards for Europe. “We are looking at it both from an ambition point of view and a position point of view. “We have been focusing our regional role and we have seven exchanges in the Nordic/Baltic region and we have been developing them from a technological perspective. “But now it seems like they are there and not only that, they are gaining traction from outside the region. Our view is let’s run with this and see where we end up.” Related: entrepreneurs, blockchain, funding and investment, Sweden, crowdfunding, medtech, fintech Editor John Kennedy is an award-winning technology journalist. editorial@siliconrepublic.com You May Also Like You May Also Like Start-ups Fintech start-up Flender achieves £500,000 crowdfunding target 13 Jan 201726 Shares Hiring Now Help develop the future of sales and trading Be part of a globally successful team Keeps files safe, synced and easy to share Life-changing career opportunities for you Companies Year-end takeaway: 10 sci-tech long reads to inspire you over Christmas 16 Dec 201614 Shares Enterprise The fintech future: Why 2017 will be the year of blockchain 28 Nov 2016389 Shares SUBSCRIBE TO OUR E-ZINE Sign up to receive weekly alerts bringing the best of Siliconrepublic.com straight to your inbox.

After the clues were gathered, the puzzle revealed the date and location for the next big developer conference. Starting on May 17th and lasting until May 19th, Google I/O will take place at the Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, California. This the same location that housed last year’s event where we learned about Android Nougat, Google Home, Daydream VR, and so much more. Previous rumors suggested that Google would be returning to Moscone for I/O 2017, but it’s obvious that Google likes the big space that Shoreline provides. The company has yet to open up registration for the event, but we’ll be sure to let you know once the floodgates are opened.

Name: Subject: Message: Developers can now publish apps and games to Google’s Daydream platform Newsby Mitja Rutnik3 days ago 8 315 16 Looks like Google is making some great changes to the Daydream Virtual Reality platform. So far, only selected partners have been able to publish apps for Daydream, which really limited the amount of available content. Now, that is about to change. In a note posted in the Google Play Developer Console as well as in an email sent to Daydream Access Program partners, Google announced that it has opened up the Daydream Access Program (DAP) to all developers. This is great news, as every developer can now publish an app or a game to the Daydream platform via Play. All of them will have to go through the usual approval process first, to make sure that they are compatible with Google’s requirements. The online search giant said in its Daydream guidelines that apps and games have to maintain high performance in order provide a comfortable experience as well as use the Daydream controller for user interaction. See also: Samsung says more than 5 million Gear VR headsets have shipped 3 weeks ago Allowing all developers to publish apps and games to the Daydream platform will rapidly increase the amount of content that is available. This will make the Daydream platform a lot more appealing to consumers and will probably boost sales of the Daydream View headset as well. But it is worth mentioning that the lack of content isn’t the only thing that’s holding Google’s Daydream back at the moment. The headset is currently only compatible with a few phones including, among a few others, Google’s own Pixel and Pixel XL, and Lenovo’s Moto Z. We expect that other manufacturers will soon announce more Daydream-ready smartphones, which is essential for the growth of the VR platform.

Davey Alba Business Date of Publication: 01.25.17. 01.25.17 Time of Publication: 9:00 am. 9:00 am Google Goes After Bad Ads and Bad Sites That Profit From Them Google wants you to know that it’s on a rampage against bad ads—a problem that has become especially pressing as fake news sites try to cash in on clicks. The world’s biggest digital advertising company says it took down more than 1.7 billion ads that violated its policies in 2016—more than double the number of bad ads it eliminated one year ago. The company disabled more than 780 million bad ads in 2015, 524 million in 2014, 350 million in 2013, and 220 million in 2012. Ninety percent of Google’s revenue comes from advertising—the company has good reason to want to keep its ad network clean. “In the past year, what’s really changed is that we’ve expanded our policies so we can better protect consumers against issues like misleading ads and predatory offers,” says Scott Spencer, Google’s director of product management for what the company calls “sustainable” ads. He says Google has also ramped up the technology it’s using to be able to spot and disable bad ads. Ninety percent of Google’s revenue comes from advertising—the company has good reason to want to keep its ad network clean. In 2011, Google agreed to pay $500 million to avoid Justice Department prosecution on allegations that it knowingly accepted illegal advertisements from Canadian online pharmacies for years. Last year, the podcast Reply All ran an episode in which the hosts try to track down a bad actor from a convoluted Google AdWords scam. Google knows the more aggressively it deals with these bad actors, the more it can build trust with its long-term customers, not to mention consumers surfing on Google’s turf—even if that does mean losing out on revenue from malicious ads and advertisers. Google says more than 1,000 of its 66,000 employees work to remove ads that violate its policies. These include prohibitions on ads for illegal products (pharmaceuticals, for example); misleading ads; ads that “self-click” or otherwise try to game the system; and ads that promote and profit from malicious sites (weight-loss scams, counterfeit goods, sites that contain malware). The company says it’s also removed more than 5 million payday loan ads since banning them in July. Bad Actors, Bad Ads Google also says it saw the rise of “tabloid cloakers” in 2016—scammy advertisers that make their ads look like headlines on a news website covering a particularly timely topic, like a government election or a trending news story. But when consumers click on those stories, they end up on sites that, say, sell dubious weight-loss products. In response, Google says it suspended 1,300 advertiser accounts—a stiffer penalty than kicking bad ads off one by one. Spencer says Google zeros in on such accounts by tracking a scammer’s traffic patterns, the content of their ads, and the web sites they link to to identify players who scam at scale. Related Stories Meet the Ad Companies Ditching Breitbart and Fake News Facebook Shouldn’t Bother Policing Fake News—It Should Go Local Instead How Photos Fuel the Spread of Fake News Google’s report does not break out one of the most serious issues of the moment: ads served on fake news sites. Google categorizes such content under its AdSense misrepresentative content policy, a series of prohibitions introduced in November that cover not just fake news sites, but also sites that phish for personal data and sell plagiarized term papers, among other sketchy activities. In the last two months of the year, Google says it reviewed 550 sites suspected of misrepresenting content to users, “including impersonating news organizations,” and took action against 340 of them. Google permanently kicked almost 200 publishers out of its network, the company said—though it’s unclear how many of these specifically peddled fake news. Right now, Google only pulls ads from clearly spoofed domains—say, a domain like FoxNews123.au, which poses as an official website. Otherwise, the company evaluates flagged sites individually, leading some to criticize the company for spotty enforcement. Google, for its part, says it is important to move slowly to make sure it executes the new policy correctly. It’s much easier to defend taking down ads from a site that’s clearly masquerading as another, after all, and harder to prove that the details contained in an article under a fresh domain are fake. Google walks a fine line between banning fake news sites and appearing to be censoring sites with strong or disagreeable opinions. Google thinks of bad ads not just in terms of malware, but in terms of the quality of the experience. The company tries to protect advertisers from incomplete display environments (non-viewable ads), criminal activity (such as the use of bots to drive clicks or page views), or running their ads in brand un-safe environments (such as having ads next to violent content). “Fake news is a relatively new type of brand un-safe environment, or at least one that advertisers are newly conscious of,” says Brian Wieser, a media industry analyst at Pivotal Research.“It falls under the ad quality issue rather than the bad ads issue.” But ultimately, it’s in Google’s interest to nix all the bad ads it can find. Without bad ads, the quality of any site that includes ads served by Google improve, and advertisers—as well as consumers—keep coming back for more. “Constant investment is required to keep up with all of the different types of bad actors,” says Spencer. “Our goal is to protect the consumer and the online advertising ecosystem, so that consumers can get access to good content in an open way.” It’s a virtuous cycle for the company that it has several billion reasons to protect as stringently as possible.

Oracle has registered several complaints with EU regulators that Google’s ad-targeting practices give them an unfair advantage. The software company has claimed that because Google is able to compile such a large amount of data from its myriad of sources and users, it allows the company to use that data to target consumers so precisely it creates an unfair competitive advantage. Google has announced plans that the service is soon to be expanded to include YouTube as well. The main point of contention for Oracle arises from the privacy update issued by Google in June of last year which allows users to opt-in, or out, of “Ads Personalization” which is designed to create a user profile in order to curate more relevant and more effective ads. Similar complaints were made to the FTC in the US by privacy adovacte group Privacy Rights Clearinghouse and Consumer Watchdog, who said: “On June 28, 2016, Google quietly changed its privacy policy to permit the combination of this data, and forced the change on users in a highly deceptive manner, without meaningful notice and consent.” “Google induced users to accept the change to its privacy policy by cloaking it in an offer to enable “new features” that purport to provide “more control” over users’ personal information. Unsuspecting users accepted Google’s offer in droves.” According to an official of the European Union they are taking the complaint regarding policy change “seriously”. Google responded to the complaint and said: “Oracle claims to be the world’s largest audience data marketplace, so it knows how competitive digital advertising is. Its complaints, and those of its proxies, are frivolous.” The two tech giants are also involved in an ongoing case in the US in which Oracle says Google used a copyrighted Java API in it’s Androids devices. The case was recently thrown out on “fair use” grounds though Oracle has state its intention to appeal the decision.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Security Chinese Ad Company That Turned Out to Be a Cyber Crime Group Is Back with “a Whale of a Tale” By Rafia Shaikh Jan 24, 2017 20Shares Share Tweet Submit Infamous Android malware returns - Infects millions First discovered in early 2016, security researchers have discovered a new variant of the HummingBad Android malware hidden in over 20 different apps on Google Play. HummingBad was highly sophisticated malware, employing a chain-attack strategy and a rootkit to gain complete control of an infected device. Spreading through third-party app stores, HummingBad had managed to infect over 10 million devices, generating at least $300,000 a month in ad fraud. Back in last summer, Check Point had revealed that the Chinese ad firm Yingmob – that claimed to offer ad support, including text, images, and video ads – was actually a cyber crime group. The group managed to get control of over 85 million devices, generating the company $300K/month in fraudulent ad revenue. While believed to have been a problem of third-party stores, researchers found out that the malware had finally found its way to Google Play. In 2016, HummingBad was considered to be the “most prevalent malware globally,” dominating the mobile threat landscape with over 72% of attacks. It is not a surprise then that researchers and Android users are worried what havoc the new variant of HummingBad would wreak on Google Play. Don’t worry, though, Google removed the apps after the folks at Check Point disclosed the issue to the company. But, before it happened the infamous malware was downloaded over a few million times! Android malware HummingBad becomes HummingWhale “It was probably only a matter of time before HummingBad evolved and made its way onto Google Play again,” Oren Koriat, Mobile Cyber Security Analyst at Check Point wrote in a blog post. He added the infected apps in this most recent campaign on Google Play “were downloaded several million times by unsuspecting users”. Ghost Push Returns with the Biggest Ever Theft of Google Accounts - Over 1 Million Accounts Hit Once a user downloads the malicious app, the APK operates as a dropper, downloading several additional apps. “This dropper went much further. It uses an Android plugin called DroidPlugin, originally developed by Qihoo 360, to upload fraudulent apps on a virtual machine,” CP wrote. DroidPlugin is used by developers to reduce APK sizes and run multiple instances of apps on the same device. But in the case of “HummingWhale”, fraudsters were using DroidPlugin to upload the malicious app on a virtual machine to generate fake referrer IDs. Advertisement “First, the command and control server provides fake ads and apps to the installed malware, which presents them to the user. Once the user tries to close the ad, the app, which was already downloaded by the malware, is uploaded to the virtual machine and run as if it is a real device. This action generates the fake referrer ID, which the malware uses to generate revenue for the perpetrators,” the research team explained. While Google has now removed all the malicious apps from Google Play, it is unclear whether the malware can still bypass the security checks put up by the store. Uses cutting edge techniques… This new variant that the security experts are calling “HummingWhale”, includes new, cutting edge techniques that allow it to perform ad fraud better than ever before. The security group says that the latest strain of HummingBad is more sophisticated than its predecessor as it can install apps without getting elevated permissions; it can disguise malicious activity which is how it can infiltrate Google Play; HummingWhale can also install a high number number of fraudulent apps without overloading the device, and it can hide the original app after installation. Over Half of Android Devices Still Vulnerable to Ghost Push Trojan Due to Delayed Updates To increase its chances of being downloaded, HummingWhale also tries to raise its reputation in Google Play using fraudulent ratings and comments. The HummingWhale Android malware can also be used to download and execute other apps. So, a long list of capabilities. Let’s hope this ad company finally bites the dust and never shows up again. But, looking at how quickly this latest Android malware has managed to evolve, it looks very likely that we would be hearing about another of its variants very soon.

Contributed photo By Neita Cecil As of Wednesday, January 25, 2017 Sign in to favorite this Discuss Comment, Blog about Share this Email, Facebook, Twitter Google is donating $140,000 to D21 so it can buy devices for every student at The Dalles Middle School, starting with sixth graders. The D21 board learned about the gift at a surprise announcement at its board meeting last Thursday. The $140,000 grant means all 578 students at the middle school will have their own device before the end of the current school year. “This grant will allow the School District to implement a critical piece of the District’s tech strategy and a program that we hope will enhance every student’s critical thinking skills and prepare them for our technology-driven world,” said Dave Karlson, the local operations manager for Google, in a press release. A group of middle schoolers approached each board member with a wrapped present. Inside was a Chrome book. It was a surprise to the board, facilitated by students, district staff and Google employees. Karlson told the board every sixth grader would get their own device, which will be checked out every morning and checked back at the end of the school day, “so they don’t turn into skate boards.” With each student having their own device, “the computer lab is under their arm,” Karlson said. North Wasco County School District 21 Superintendent Candy Armstrong said, “We are now launching, thanks to Google, our truly one-on-one course of every student having their own Chrome book.” The district ultimately hopes to have a device for every student in sixth through 12th grades. The devices offer greater access to the internet, digital course materials, digital textbooks and state testing. Karlson said the donation was a way to bridge the digital divide, for those students who may not be able to afford their own devices. “We’re just excited to here and thankful for the opportunity,” Karlson said. He said the first devices would arrive in a month or two. Board chair Carol Roderick, attending the meeting via phone, said, “Thank you so much, you guys are more than awesome.” Vice Chair Kathy Ursprung joked about getting a present she had to give back. “Back in the box?” she said of the device she was presented with.

Google took down 1.7 billion dodgy ads in 2016, over twice as many as in 2015 Posted Jan 25, 2017 by Ingrid Lunden (@ingridlunden), Jon Russell (@jonrussell) 0 SHARES Next Story Sign up for the chance to buy 2-for-1 tickets to Disrupt NY 2017 Google has been under the gun when it comes to the power of its massive ad network — the biggest on the internet — being used for nefarious purposes, but the search giant is intent on using its tech to battle that problem. Today the company published its latest update on how its fighting spam, bots and other problematic “ads” on its network, and said that in 2016 it took down 1.7 billion ads that violated its policies. As a point of context, this is more than double what Google took down the year before, it said. Google is no stranger to the issue of fake news that has swept the internet and likely influenced a lot of what people view as “fact” that may not, in fact, be true. In addition to accusations that its news-optimised search format elevated dodgy sites to the same level as legit news sources, the search giant was also compelled to update its policy after its ad network got used by iffy “news” sites to promote their stories and give them a lot more visibility. The company in 2016 changed its policies in terms of how it’s been tracking ads that are misleading or predatory. That’s included a policy introduced in July to ban payday loan ads, which led to five million ads being banned from its network. Google said it also has been improving its tech to spot and disable dodgy ads faster. You may have noticed, for example, that “Trick to click” ads now come with system warnings before you go to the site they are linked to, as they can lead to malware links. Why these ads are not just removed altogether is another question, but in any case Google said that in 2016, its systems “detected and disabled a total of 112 million ads for ‘trick to click,'” six times as many as the year before. Aside from tackling unethical ads such as unapproved pharmaceuticals — an issue that massively impacted Baidu in China — payday loans and counterfeit goods, and deceptive products, Google said it focused its efforts on clickbait advertising. The company refers to clickbait as ‘tabloid cloaking,’ in other words dressing an ad up as shocking news akin to a tabloid newspaper to get attention. It really isn’t hard to find examples of that across the world. The search giant claims it took down 1,300 accounts that were performing such scams. That doesn’t seem like a huge number, but it just takes a few bad actors to do a lot of damage. Case in point, the 22 “cloakers” it nabbed in December were responsible for serving up ads that were viewed over 20 million times online in a single week. Bad news though, that fight is very much ongoing. Google explained that tabloid cloaking is “gaining in popularity” because it is such an effective method to grab attention online, in much the same way that some websites have risen on the back of viral/shock news. “While we took down more bad ads in 2016 than ever before, the battle doesn’t end here,” Google said addressing the threat broadly. “As we invest in better detection, the scammers invest in more elaborate attempts to trick our systems. Continuing to find and fight them is essential for creating a sustainable, open web from which we all enjoy.” 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Google Founded 1998 Overview Google is a multinational corporation that is specialized in internet-related services and products.

Samsung’s Galaxy S8 will come in two sizes, have an almost bezel-less, edge-to-edge “infinity” display and an iris scanner, the Guardian has learned. The Galaxy S8 will be announced in late March and go on sale on or around 21 April, later than the originally planned launch at Mobile World Congress in Barcelona in February due to knock-on effects of the Note 7 fiasco. The two variants will have screens in the 5in to 6in region, with the devices having the same or smaller proportions of previous versions of Samsung’s flagship smartphone but with larger displays, according to several well placed sources talking to the Guardian. The S7 was available with either a 5.1in and 5.5in screen. The two smartphones are codenamed Dream and Dream 2, representing the smaller and larger Galaxy S8 respectively, according to two sources. Both versions will have screens that curve down at the left and right sides of the device similar to the Galaxy S7 Edge, two sources have said. The so-called “infinity display” will cover the majority of the front of the device, with very little body on the top and bottom of the screen not dedicated to the display. Two sources said there wasn’t even room to put a logo or brand name on the front of the device. Samsung has moved the fingerprint scanner to the back of the device, multiple sources said. The Galaxy S8 will have a traditional 3.5mm headphone socket, according to several sources. Several sources also confirmed that the iris scanning biometric technology launched in the ill-fated Samsung Galaxy Note 7 will be available on the Galaxy S8, allowing users to unlock and their smartphones and authenticate purchases with their eyes. The Galaxy S8 will have a similar “duo pixel” camera to last year’s Galaxy S7, situated on the back of the device according to two sources, with incremental improvements to image quality, low-light performance and speed. The camera will also feature built-in object recognition, similar to Google Goggles, according to several sources. The Galaxy S8 will have a new processor, this time built on the company’s 10nm technology making it one of the first to do so, said two sources. Chipmaker Qualcomm recently announced the Snapdragon 835, which is being built using Samsung’s new 10nm processes. According to two sources, the new device will also come with 64GB of storage built in, as well as expandable storage via microSD card, with support for cards up to 256GB in capacity. The phone will also have USB-C and a new version of Samsung’s Gear VR headset and Gear 360 camera. The Galaxy S8 will also come with an artificial intelligence assistant, which can perform tasks such as object recognition, using the smartphone’s camera similar to Google Goggles. Two sources also said that Samsung was partnering with others to include data sources for the AI assistant. Other information leaks have suggested that it could be called Bixby, based on the technology gained by the South Korean company in its acquisition of startup Viv Labs in October, but none of the sources talking to the Guardian could confirm the name. Whether the Galaxy S8 will also come with Google’s Assistant as well or instead in some markets was unclear. Samsung also plans a range of new accessories for the Galaxy S8. Two sources said a new dock and service that turns the Galaxy S8 into an Android desktop computer, connecting to a monitor, keyboard and other peripherals called DeX (desktop extension) will be available. DeX has been likened to Microsoft’s Continuum, which connects Windows smartphones to a desktop extension to allow them to be used as Windows PCs, but only with Windows Store applications. The below picture of a front glass plate is a good representation of what the Galaxy S8 will look like, according to two sources. W tym lepiej widać zagięcie. Lekkie zaokrąglenie jest też na gorze i u dolu #GalaxyS8pic.twitter.com/KXKfn6t9GO— DforDesign (@dfordesign) January 18, 2017 Android has had the capability to act more like a traditional desktop computer, with some devices including Remix OS-based desktops taking advantage, but none of the big players including Motorola have had much success pushing the idea of using the smartphone as desktop replacement. Whether Samsung will be different with Dex remains to be seen, but the company has attempted to bring greater synergy between its Windows PCs and Android smartphones, using connectivity services that sync data and allow control of Samsung Android smartphones through Windows apps. The sources spoke to the Guardian on condition of anonymity due to their relationships with Samsung. The Guardian believes their information to be correct at the time of publication and has double sourced all claims, but as is the nature of product development before the release of a smartphone or device, Samsung’s plans may change. Following the high-profile failure of the Note 7 due to two separate battery faults that caused explosive failures of the phone’s integrity, Samsung needs a hit on its hands to continue the momentum it built with the design shift to metal bodies and curved screens started with 2015’s Galaxy S6 series. Samsung is locked in a war over the so-called floating voter – the 20% of people likely to switch mobile operating systems - with Apple, but is also now fighting on a new front with Google and its own-brand Pixel smartphones. Since the launch of the Pixel and Pixel XL there have been two high-profile, advertising-backed top-end Android smartphone manufacturers trying to convince existing users to upgrade. At the same time China’s Huawei has been gaining marketshare by offering both premium and well-made budget devices that are undercutting Samsung’s market, placing Huawei as third largest smartphone manufacturer as ranked by analysts firms IDC and Gartner. A Samsung spokesman confirmed that the Galaxy S8 would not be unveiled at Mobile World Congress per its president of mobile communications DJ Koh’s comments on Monday. They added that Samsung does not comment on rumour and speculation. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN News Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry! There was a problem.

Google was not going to stand by and let spammers taint its most lucrative property. Every SEO provider, white hat or otherwise, learned to dread Penguin updates. But even SEOs who tried to do the right thing could find themselves caught up in a Penguin penalty. That was the life of an SEO before Penguin 4.0. Penguin Panic   Who in the industry hasn’t been there?! An update or refresh could come at any time. It could range from a minor blip to a calamitous bloodbath. The 2013 Penguin 2.1 update was particularly rough for many SEOs and webmasters. No well-intentioned SEO provider enjoyed calling a client to explain that the rankings had tanked because of a Penguin update. While you may have explained that you can neither guarantee rankings nor protect against all Google penalties, that didn’t cushion the blow. And those who were selling “Penguin-proof SEO” (BTW, not a real thing) probably had far more difficult conversations with their clients. Many SEOs took a long, hard look at their strategy at the time, and adjusted it to follow Google’s advice: The best way to get other sites to create high-quality, relevant links to yours is to create unique, relevant content that can naturally gain popularity in the Internet community. Creating good content pays off: Links are usually editorial votes given by choice, and the more useful content you have, the greater the chances someone else will find that content valuable to their readers and link to it. Penguin Had to Get Tougher   But Penguin updates didn’t ‘catch em all’. They weren’t perfect and didn’t come around that often. This meant a website could still benefit from link spam and hold steady for a while. Some less scrupulous SEOs used that to their advantage and played fast and loose with the rules, while leading clients to believe that everything was fine. And when the rankings subsequently tanked, the disillusioned client likely didn’t understand why, as the average business owner doesn’t know or care about Penguin updates. Meanwhile the SEO provider could walk away from the train wreck and take on another unsuspecting client. Once clients were burned by a concept that they didn’t understand in the first place, they were understandably distrustful of SEO. In my opinion, this really hurt the industry. Finally, Penguin 4.0 Brings the Hammer Down Link spam was once in the crosshairs of Penguin updates. Penguin 4.0, released in fall 2016, ignores it! Why is this a great thing? Now that Penguin is part of the core algorithm and works in real-time, Google does not reward link spam with improved rankings. Not even temporarily. Link spammers won’t get results and won’t fool clients with quick and precarious rankings gains. Any SEOs out there who continue using the link spam model (are there really any SEOs out there who are still spamming blog comments?!) will get nothing from Google. This is good news for ‘the good guys’ of SEO. More Good Things   Years ago, Google pushed the idea that content marketing was the proper path to top rankings and many SEOs went with that. Meanwhile, link spammers were still getting rankings and those who were trying to follow Google’s guidelines couldn’t help but feel frustrated. That shouldn’t be a problem anymore. Beyond that, how many SEOs followed Google’s directions and still got destroyed by a Penguin update? Plenty. That’s not going to happen anymore either. A site that has questionable links, for whatever reason, won’t be completely obliterated. Pages that are penalized can recover much faster than they would have when Penguin updates and refreshes were few and far between. Barry Schwartz of Search Engine Land explains: “As Google re-crawls and re-indexes pages–which happens constantly–those pages will be assessed by the Penguin filter. Pages will be caught and/or freed by Penguin as part of this regular process.” An Important Caveat When Google says that Penguin will no longer demote entire sites, bear in mind that this is only about Penguin. Google has other methods of dealing with websites that deliberately use spam to try to game the system. Pay close attention to this comment from Google’s Webmaster Trends Analyst Gary Illyes: “If we see that someone is systematically trying to spam, the manual actions team might take harsher actions against the site.” Link Disavow: Still Useful Now that Penguin won’t penalize an entire site, it might seem like a waste of time to disavow potentially harmful links. Not so. Jennifer Slegg of TheSEMPost writes: “John Mueller [Webmaster Trends Analyst at Google] is clearly saying that SEOs should continue using the disavow tool when they know they have spammy links from previous link building to the site. There is also the reason of manual actions – Google can still use any non-disavowed links for analysis when it comes to placing a manual action on any site for bad links. And Google has said that link quality is used in other parts of their search algo as well.” According to an SEO After Penguin 4.0 survey, more SEO agencies are planning to use disavow post-Penguin 4.0. Pre-Penguin 4.0, 35% of SEO agencies submitted link disavow files for their clients Post-Penguin 4.0, 48% of SEO agencies say they will submit disavow files A Hopeful Industry The survey also found that 59% of agencies believe that Penguin 4.0 is good for the SEO industry. Based on comments from survey respondents, those who are making a good faith effort to follow Google’s guidelines are relieved that they: Will no longer get caught in a Penguin sweep that was really meant to catch deliberate, incessant spammers. Can focus their efforts on building links through content promotion. They don’t have to fear that one or two outliers are links from a bad site. Conclusion Google has made great strides in counteracting link spam. Let’s hope that with Penguin 4.0, we’re going to see a big reduction in the number of SEOs who promise quick page one rankings. Penguin 4.0 will not let them deliver on that promise. And because spam doesn’t work anymore, life should be much easier for SEOs who are honest with clients about the time, skills and cost it takes to put together an effective SEO campaign.

The puzzle reveals that the Google I/O would be held at the Shoreline Amphitheater from May 17 to May 19.  ( Sean Choe | Flickr ) Advertisement Officially, Google may not have declared anything out in the open, but developers working in the company are having quite a gala time as they have come out with an interesting puzzle, which on solving would eventually reveal the dates of this year's Google I/O event. The company's Firebase and Google Developers' Twitter account posted the link to a few puzzles for the public to work out and find the dates. Around the world, from here to there, to the most clever minds, the secret will share. #googledevs #savethedate https://t.co/0zwCbSLzVy pic.twitter.com/0O2vNDWZx2 — Google Developers (@googledevs) January 24, 2017 The link on the Twitter account takes one to a hidden site. On clicking "GO" in the hidden site, it navigates you to a GitHub website, where a set of coordinates for a jungle in Brazil are available. The next puzzle takes us to an unlisted YouTube video. The caption in the video shares another set of coordinates. The third puzzle of the game reveals a location in Warsaw Poland and the fourth puzzle reveals a riddle, hidden in a corrupted image which leads to Thailand. Finally when all the pieces of the puzzle are available to an explorer, he or she can solve the same. The names of the countries if assigned to positions on a chessboard and adding and subtracting the value of the letters would provide the name "L IN E THEATRE SHO RE AM P H I". A bit of rearrangement would reveal the name Shoreline Theatre. The puzzle revealed that the Google I/O event will take place at Shoreline Amphitheater, just like last year with a bunch of tents around for guests to take a seat. It will again be a three-day affair starting on May 17 and wrapping up on May 19. The whole idea behind this interesting concept has been to lead and entice the audience online to employ a great deal of intuitive estimation and thinking to discover what the puzzle conveys. Sources and experts associated with Hacker News quickly worked out the possible dates linked to Google's 2017 I/O developer conference and the possibility of the event taking place. What To Expect? It was only last year, when Google ventured out into the open and hosted the Google I/O 2016 event outdoors, in its own backyard. It is being hoped that this time Google will learn from its past mistakes and will implement a proper system to avoid long queues for both the seeing panel and food stalls. It is still quite early to estimate what may be announced at this year's conference apart from the next version of Android.  Photo: Sean Choe | Flickr  TAG Google I/O, Puzzle, Google I/O 2017 © 2016 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

Around 3 million users seem to have played the augmented reality (AR) mobile game on its launch day in Korea on Tuesday, according to data by mobile application market researcher Wise App, Wednesday. The data also showed the number of downloads through Google Play alone reached 2.83 million on the day. Including 510,000 users who have already downloaded the "Pokemon Go" app through unofficial routes before its release here, about 3.34 million have "Pokemon Go" on their smartphones. Wise App researched 17,400 people who use Android-based smartphones. Because Niantic launched "Pokemon Go" for Apple's iPhone as well, the number of actual users in Korea would be higher. Wise App said the AR game's first day user attraction record is the 13th highest among all mobile applications for Android devices. The rank goes up to the top perch if the scope is narrowed down to games. Following "Pokemon Go" are Supercell's "Clash Royale" with 1.53 million downloads in second place and Netmarble Games' "Lineage 2: Revolution" in third with 950,000. "The record of Pokemon Go here is about three times more than about 1 million first-day user attraction of Lineage 2: Revolution, which was considered to have hit the jackpot," Wise App said. On Wednesday, "Pokemon Go" clinched the top perch in the free mobile game chart both on Google Play and Apple App Store. It also ranked No. 2 on Apple App Store's top-grossing chart, hinting that the game is starting to attract users here to open their purses. On Tuesday, Niantic unexpectedly released the megahit AR mobile game in the Korean market. Its launch comes about six months after the global release last July. Rumors had been that Niantic could not release "Pokemon Go" in Korea because it is based on the location information provided by Google Maps. Google has not been able to provide its map service properly here because it has failed to get detailed geographic data from the Korean government after repeatedly refusing to follow the government's precondition to blur locations of sites that it considers important for national security. Claiming that "Pokemon Go" became available through what it calls "publically accessible data sources" instead of map information from Google Map, Niantic said the delayed release was because it did not have enough time to deal with the explosive response on the global scale, not due to disagreements between its parent company and the Korean government. Adding to the delayed release, the launch was made amid sub-zero temperature. This has fueled negative expectations over the game, which is designed to be played outdoors. Market observers have shown mixed responses to "Pokemon Go" in Korea. "As a location-based game that has tapped into AR technology, Pokemon Go is a rare case to be successful in the Korean market," a source from the game industry said. "Though it will not be clear if it can garner meaningful results in Korea in the long-term perspective, it will obviously offer wider options for Korean gamers." Another game industry insider said, "In recent weeks, Korea's mobile game market has literally been dominated by Netmarble Games. The release of another megahit title may aggravate polarization of the mobile game market here." yoonsw@ktimes.com   K-pop group Wonder Girls disbands afte...

This has drawn a series of complaints, as growing numbers of internet users here opt for Google's browser, rather than Microsoft's Internet Explorer (IE). According to data by web traffic analysis firm StatCounter, Chrome topped the list of the local web browser market share with 55 percent, with IE coming in second with a 35 percent share as of last month. Microsoft's browser had once dominated the global industry, as it comes bundled with the firm's renowned cash cow operating system (OS) Windows. But with Google expanding its presence in the global mobile and online industry, IE has in recent years begun to lose its luster here, giving way to Chrome's simple and fast interface. The National Tax Service (NTS) said the agency is working to reduce its heavy reliance on IE, and would do its best to allow Chrome users to access the year-end tax settlement next year. "Chrome users will be able to file tax settlements next year," an NTS spokesman said. "We have so far failed to do so, due to a variety of reasons such as weak government budgets to push for the technical change." He said the NTS handles massive amounts of datasets for citizens here, which takes more time than banks or other private finance bodies. "On top of that, the datasets are much more sensitive than any other government bodies," he said. "We know years-long controversies surrounding the government's inept handling of financial information with a heavy reliance on ActiveX, an IE-only plug-in. "With our years-long bid to put an end to the dispute, we plan to offer the Chrome-version of tax settlement services next year, even if we come up short of the government budget to conduct the Chrome-based services," said the official. Contrary to most of the government agencies, local banking players are embracing the platform shift in the internet industry by launching a series of Chrome-based financial services. They include KB Insurance and Hanwha Life Insurance, which unveiled new non-Active X homepages and services last year, as part of their efforts to ease the burdens of local customers who have stepped up their criticisms through the years over the IE-only online banking environment here. mhlee@ktimes.com   K-pop group Wonder Girls disbands afte...

This allows Google to gain ground on Amazon Echo, which has beaten it to the market for about two years.  ( Google ) Advertisement There are still no figures available yet that reveal smart home assistant adoption and usage, but the competition continues to heat up between Google Home and Amazon Alexa. The former just got its stable beefed up with an announcement Jan. 24 that Honeywell and Belkin WeMo have already joined its ranks. "With Honeywell and your Google Assistant on Google Home, you can conveniently manage your home's temperature without leaving the comfort of your covers," Google said in a blog post. "And when you're headed out the door, Belkin Wemo and your Google Assistant can help you remember if you turned off the lights." Connecting To Google Home If you own Google Home and recently bought Honeywell and Belkin WeMo, they can easily be connected to the smart speaker. Just head to the Settings section and add the devices in the Home Control panel. Along with the Honeywell and Belkin WeMo support, Google also shined on the service called IFTTT. This is a platform that will allow Google Home users to tweak Google Assistant commands. For example, instead of saying "Ok Google, turn off my lights," you can use a custom command like "Ok Google, goodnight." Overall, Google seems bent on providing an alternative experience and additional options to lodge a credible challenge to Amazon's Alexa and its thousands of skills. On Google Home Partners The addition of Honeywell and Belkin WeMo seems to be just the beginning. Google indicated that more partners are coming and these will ensure that the platform will be covering a wide-ranging area of your home. At present, Google Home partners also include Spotify, Pandora, TuneIn, and Google's own Play Music. Smart home products like Philips Hue, Nest, and Samsung SmartThings, among others are already on-board. There are also reports that Sony speakers and Android TVs that support Chromecast can be connected to the home assistant. The number, however, still pales in comparison to those supporting Amazon Echo. To provide a simple context, Alexa has been controlling Samsung SmartThings, Honeywell, and Belkin WeMo for some time. One should note, however, that Google is still playing catch up. Amazon Echo has a two-year leg-up so it is understandable how it can manage to boast of around six platforms at this point to Amazon's more than a dozen of partnerships. According to CNET, Google Home's list of partners could increase soon as indicated by the way it is expanding Weave. This is the technology or language, if you will, used by smart home appliances to communicate with each other. In a December announcement, Google has listed several companies producing Internet of Things devices that use Weave. The list includes Lifx, Wink, TP-Link, and First Alert.

Firefox 50 released Video Making diversity in tech work for you Firefox 51 released The Firefox developers at Mozilla have been hard at work on a new version of the popular web browser. Firefox 51 has just been released, and you can download it from the official Firefox site. [ The InfoWorld review: 6 slick open source routers. | Track the latest trends in open source with InfoWorld's Linux Report newsletter. ] Michael Larabel reports for Phoronix: Firefox 51 isn't a big feature release for end-users but notably does have support for FLAC audio, at long last! Great to see the web browsers finally shipping support out-of-the-box for this open-source audio codec. Also notable for Firefox 51 is WebGL 2.0 by default. Also, they have enabled Skia content rendering by default in the Linux build too. Some other changes include improved video performance when not using GPU acceleration, the zoom indicator is now shown in the menu bar, turning on e10s multi-process Firefox for users with extensions that are not explicitly marked as incompatible, improvements to Firefox's password manager, and various CSS/JavaScript/ES2015 developer improvements. More at Phoronix The news about Firefox 51 hit the Linux subreddit and the folks there shared their thoughts about it: Charwinger21: “Interesting that Firefox and Chromium are both making such a big push for codec support right now. FLAC, WebP, WebM/VP9 (and soon AV1), APNG (lots of activity on the Chromium bug tracker), Opus, etc.” Elocutionisto: “FLAC is not your typical web standard, interesting.” Juser6553591: “It is the best lossless audio format, with smaller file sizes than WAV and good surround sound support.” Bubblethink: “Do chromium and firefox both have flac now ? This might push streaming services (google music, spotify etc.) to use flac as well. Right now, they all top out at mp3 320 kbps. Not a big difference audibly, but nice to have.” Natanael_L: “The real reason to have it is for music libraries, where you have the bandwidth and support to not need re-encoding.” RedditCantBeTrusted: “…for the past year it's felt like they've just been running in circles making unnecessary changes like adding pocket and hello. These are changes that have very real impacts and feel innovative and I hope Mozilla has more in store for 2017.” More at Reddit Get started with a VPN in Linux A VPN can be an invaluable tool for many Internet users, including those who run Linux on their computers. A writer at TechRadar has a helpful overview on how to get started using a VPN in Linux. Arthur Baxter reports for TechRadar: The internet was supposed to be open and permissionless, transcend borders and make the world a smaller place. Some of that has been achieved, but there is also a creeping feeling that ISPs (Internet Service Providers), nation states, and web services are increasingly locking down their networks, imposing censorship and discriminating based on computer, browser, and IP address. Many technologies aim to free information from censorship and geo-restrictions. Most restrictions are only placed on the internet artificially and superficially, and can easily be circumvented. Even poorly configured networks are something that often have to be bypassed using tools otherwise created to break censorship—as anybody knows who’s had trouble connecting to their server via SSH with airport Wi-Fi. The most popular way to circumvent censorship is with a VPN (Virtual Private Network). More at TechRadar Google Voice updated Google Voice is one of Google’s most popular services. It has gotten a significant update, including a visual overhaul that puts it in the same league as Google’s other apps. Chris Welch reports for The Verge: Google just announced the new and improved Google Voice that the company teased a few weeks ago. Today you’ll find updated versions of Voice available for Android, iOS, and on the web. The service has been given a much-needed visual refresh, bringing it in line with Google’s other apps. According to Google’s blog post on the changes, “your inbox now has separate tabs for text messages, calls and voicemails. Conversations stay in one continuous thread, so you can easily see all your messages from each of your contacts in one place.” Aside from simply bringing Voice up to date aesthetically, the upgraded app carries over some features that until now were only available for users who had switched to Hangouts for some Voice functions like texting and voicemail. For one, photo MMS is now supported by Google Voice on all platforms and across pretty much all major carriers. Images show up inline in your conversations, and firing off your own is as easy as any other texting app. That sounds like basic functionality, but MMS has been a longtime sore spot for Voice. No more emails with MMS attachments or other weird workarounds. Group texting has also been added to the main Voice apps — no Hangouts required. This is another crucially important feature to many people that Google Voice has been bad at until now. With today’s update, group conversations are labeled very clearly and should work as you’d expect them to. More at The Verge Did you miss a roundup?

Reuters/Tyrone Siu HTC U Ultra and Google Pixel XL are top-end smartphones that are evenly matched in terms of hardware specs. This can be pure coincidence or simply because HTC has assisted Google in designing the Pixel XL. Thus, choosing between the two will depend on software as well as personal preferences. Price will also be a deciding factor as the Google Pixel XL is an expensive smartphone costing $1269 for the 32GB option and $1419 for the 128GB version. HTC U Ultra’s price is not yet disclosed but will definitely be cheaper than the Pixels. According to Stuff, a big advantage of the Google Pixel and Pixel XL phones is their unlimited storage space for photos and videos. This option is not available in any other Android handset. It’s totally free of charge and stores all photos and videos at original size and quality. In terms of battery capacity, the Pixel XL has a 3,450 mAh battery but with all the premium specs and apps to run, this may not seem like a big deal. Wireless charging is also absent. On the other hand, the 64GB and 128GB HTC U Ultra packs a 3,000 mAh battery that still needs to be tested. It seems that Pixel XL will beat the HTC handset on the battery front. The HTC U Ultra does not have a 3.5mm headphone jack. It is expected to provide a wonderfully light experience, bloat-free and zippy, when running on Android 7.0 Nougat OS. The Pixel XL delivers super-fast performance with the Nougat system. It will perhaps beat the HTC smartphone via its Google Assistant as HTC’s Sense Companion may not be as smart as Assistant. Both devices pack 4GB of RAM and Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processors. In terms of camera specs and performance, the Google Pixel Xl may beat the HTC U Ultra though there may be a shocker in store. But on paper, the Google phone has an impressive 12.3MP sensor with large, 1.55μm pixels and a quick f/2.0 aperture lens. Both outdoor and indoor and daylight and night time photos are stunning. The HDR+ mode has been praised by experts. There’s no optical stabilisation but the phase detect and laser autofocus combination delivers in-focus snaps. The HTC U Ultra comes with a 12MP sensor, laser autofocus, OIS and maximum aperture of f/1.8.

Google is also bringing 'Home Control' to Pixel smartphones soon. "With Honeywell and your Google Assistant on Google Home, you can conveniently manage your home's temperature without leaving the comfort of your covers," said Gummi Hafsteinsson, Product Lead, Google Assistant, in a blog post on Tuesday. When you head out, Belkin Wemo and your Google Assistant can help you remember if you turned off the lights, just say "Ok Google, did I leave the bedroom lights on?" added Hafsteinsson. "Looking for more ways to get things done at home? Try IFTTT, a platform that lets you combine hundreds of different services in new ways. With IFTTT on Pixel and Google Home, you can create custom voice commands for your Google Assistant. So instead of saying 'Ok Google, turn on the living room lights,' you can say 'Ok Google, I'm home' (or another command of your choice) to turn the lights on," elaborates Hafsteinsson. To set up 'Home Control' from your Google Home, go to the Google Home app, select settings and then select 'Home Control', and click "+" to add a new device. Last year, Google announced that Nest, Philips Hue and Samsung SmartThings are all available on Google Home to help you control your lights, thermostats and switches.

Until last June, Google explicitly stated that behavioural data from its giant DoubleClick ad network would not be merged with a user's Google search or YouTube viewing histories, or SMS logs. The old privacy policy used to pledge: "We will not combine DoubleClick cookie information with personally identifiable information unless we have your opt-in consent." That was deleted and a line added, explaining: "Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google's services and the ads delivered by Google." Google still hasn't made the leap, but last year's privacy policy changes mean the user has now granted consent for such co-mingling. And it surely will. As we noted in October, users may have been opted in without realising it. The concerns were raised with EU antitrust regulators by Google's eternal tormentor, Oracle, the WSJ reports [paywalled]. Big Red's argument is that no other ad platform can compete effectively with ad targeting once Google merges these epic data stores, which Oracle calls "super profiles". The database giant has the Chocolate Factory in its sights, and boasts that it helped fund research which revealed the incestuous ties between the Obama administration and Google at the Google Transparency Project. FoIs also revealed Obama's office had kept Google closely informed of an antitrust probe by the "independent" agency FTC. Last week Peter Thiel, the nearest Silicon Valley has to a shop steward with Team Trump, said Google had more influence in Obama's administration than Exxon had over George W Bush's. Social networks are a gift to authoritarian governments. "Super profiles" permit a government to build a far more extensive data store than it would otherwise have. China is allowing its private sector to trial a "social credit" score to audit each citizen's "trustworthiness". ® Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 27 Comments More from The Register Oracle slurps enterprise cloud API wrangler Apiary Time for REST... and it's only January Solaris continuous upgrades have already begun, says Oracle But Big Red's staying schtum about the new cloud services on its recently-updated roadmap 4 Comments Oracle crashes AWS and Azure UK cloud data centre party London base in global expansion 18 Comments Resistence is futile: HPE must face Oracle over Solaris IP Terix partnership pulls PC maker into Larry's crosshairs 14 Comments Not an Oracle user?

Chromebox Mini and Chromebase Mini are designed for long-time use in retail operation. The two mini PCs are relatively inexpensive, US$189 for Chromebox Mini for example, and thus likely to be adopted by retail operators. Google cooperated with AOpen for the first time to launch Chromebox in 2016.

Despite loudly touted efforts, the tech industry is making very little progress in diversifying its workforce, especially in technical and leadership positions. NEW YORK — The tech industry brought us self-driving cars, artificial intelligence and 3-D printers. But when it comes to racial and gender diversity, its leading companies are no trailblazers. Despite loudly touted efforts to hire more blacks, Latinos and women, especially in technical and leadership positions, diversity numbers at the largest tech companies are barely budging. In 2014, 2 percent of Googlers were black, and 3 percent were Hispanic, numbers that have not changed since. The picture is similar at Facebook and Twitter. Microsoft is slightly more racially diverse (though not when it comes to gender) and Apple even more so, though still not reflective of the U.S. population. Amazon is more racially diverse still, though it counts a large, lower-wage warehouse workforce in its totals. Women, meanwhile, make up less than a third of the workforce at many companies — even less in engineering and other technical jobs. Tech companies themselves tend to blame a "pipeline problem," meaning a shortage of woman and minorities with technical qualifications. But a number of experts and employees say there's a bigger problem. Silicon Valley, they argue, has failed to challenge its own assumptions about what makes for great tech employees. "The people who are doing the hiring are not changing their thinking around what they view as qualified," says Leslie Miley, engineering director at the message-service startup Slack. Hiring managers, he says, spend too much time worrying that applicants who don't fit techie stereotypes aren't "Google-y enough or Facebook-y enough or Apple-y enough or Twitter-y enough." Miley, who is African-American, previously worked as an engineer at Twitter, Apple, Google and Yahoo. THE INDUSTRY IS TRYING Companies are spending a lot of time and money on improving diversity. Two years ago, Intel set itself the goal of achieving full representation in its workforce by 2020. Despite committing $300 million to the effort and making early progress, Intel admits there is "a great deal of work to be done." Similar programs are in place elsewhere, from outreach at high schools and historically black colleges to internship and mentoring programs and sponsorships for coding boot camps. So far, to little avail. Why? Interviews with tech workers, executives and diversity advocates suggest the blame lies with subtle biases in hiring, unwelcoming work environments and a paucity of diverse role models in top jobs. Aniyia Williams, founder and CEO of the startup Tinsel, which makes tech jewelry for women, says companies should focus on their own culture rather than blaming factors they can't control, such as limited computer-science education in U.S. schools. It's not enough to release diversity reports and say, "Oh, not a lot has changed, but it's the world, not us that's the problem," she says. Williams, who is African-American, says she has made sure to hire women as well as underrepresented minorities. WHY IT MATTERS Diversity isn't just about fairness. It's about having designers who reflect the diversity of the people they are designing for. For tech companies hoping to reach millions or billions of users, a lack of diversity could mean their products "will not appeal to a large population," says Lillian Cassel, chairwoman of computer sciences at Villanova University. Diverse perspectives can also help prevent grievous errors — such as arose at Google in 2015, when a photo-recognition feature misidentified black faces as gorillas. Some related missteps: — Snapchat released two photo filters that contorted facial features into bucktoothed Asian caricatures or blackface. One was later withdrawn after public outcry. The other "expired," and the company said it won't put it back into circulation. — Airbnb initially took no steps to prevent hosts from discriminating against guests whose profile photos showed they were black. The practice was corrected after an outcry. — Twitter took nearly a decade to tackle the harassment of women and minorities on its service. In a New York Times opinion piece , Microsoft researcher Kate Crawford urged companies working on artificial intelligence to address diversity, warning that otherwise "we will see ingrained forms of bias built into the artificial intelligence of the future." INTO THE PIPELINE Some 11 percent of computer science graduates were black and 9 percent were Hispanic in the 2013-14 school year, according to the latest data from the U.S. Department of Education. Yet only 4 percent of Google's 2015 hires were black, and 3 percent were Hispanic. At Intel, fewer than 5 percent of hires were black and 8 percent were Hispanic. Numbers at other tech companies are comparable. Major tech companies have a long tradition of hiring applicants from top-tier universities — and those universities also have a problem with diversity, even if they're doing slightly better than the companies. Some minority applicants, meanwhile, earn their computer-science chops through community colleges or coding boot camps instead — places often overlooked by recruiters. The few minorities hired into big tech companies can often feel alienated in overwhelmingly white (and sometimes Asian) environments. Unsurprisingly, they are sometimes reluctant to recommend their employer to friends, classmates and former colleagues, furthering the cycle of underrepresentation, Williams and others say. WHEN THE CULTURE DOESN'T FIT Silicon Valley startups like to talk about "culture fit" — in theory, the question of whether a job candidate's attitude and behavior meshes well with a company. In practice, though, it can mean that since a lot of people are white and male, they "hire what they know," says Dave McClure, a prominent angel investor in Silicon Valley. Larger companies such as Facebook publicly eschew discussions of "fit," although the notion can unwittingly seep into hiring practices. For example, a 2013 study found that words used in engineering and programming job listings could serve to discourage women from applying. Words like "competitive," "dominant" and "leader," can make a job seem less appealing to women in a field that is already male-dominated. Some companies, including Facebook, offer training on "unconscious bias" to combat the problem. But they don't make such training mandatory for all employees. And once hired, people can get lost in the shuffle given the lack of role models and mentors in higher ranks — and thus find it difficult to advance. At many places, women and minorities face constant questions about their technical knowledge. They can't help wondering if they would be taken "more seriously" if they were whiter and male, Williams says. MAKING CHANGE HAPPEN Nancy Lee, the Google official in charge of diversity efforts, says the gorilla face-recognition incident was a "wake-up call" for the company. "We need to include all voices from a multitude of backgrounds and experiences (when it comes to the) technology we create," she says. "We firmly believe that good ideas don't come out of echo chambers." Lee says things are getting better, slowly, but that it can be "demoralizing" to those working on diversity issues to be pressured to do things quickly. "We want to solve this for the long haul," she says. But Miley, the former Twitter and Google engineer, can't understand why diversifying the industry's workforce "seems to be such an intractable problem." "I wonder if it is coming up against...the deep-seated belief that the people in these organizations are special and they want to keep out people who are not special," he says. "In our country, increasingly the people who are not special are the people who are underprivileged."

University’s first diversity chancellor takes the reins On a recent morning, as I was waking up, I was greeted to a briefing not unlike the one that Jarvis gives in the Iron Man movies. “Today the high will be 50 degrees with a low of 34 degrees, clear with a zero percent chance of rain,” echoed my Google Home. “Today you have thermodynamics at 11:00 a.m.-,” “OK Google, that’s enough!” I sleepily proclaimed. If I had wanted, I could have been woken up to a flashing light display put on by my Philips Hue lights that synchronized with my alarm. Over the break, a good friend of mine demonstrated this to me, but it seems to be a little exuberant (and creepy) for my tastes. It was like waking up in a horror movie … try sleeping through that. The point is, there is so-called smart technology out there today that can improve productivity and can ensure one sticks to a schedule. On a more serious note, however, these companies can use all this information about you to market products specifically tailored to you.  Google knows that I am taking thermodynamics this semester, so what was the next advertisement when I opened up Google Chrome?  A thermodynamics textbook. Once one spoils themselves with these technologies, it kind of starts to snowball.  You will find yourself in bed one evening, you just turned the lights off with your iPhone, and you think, “Hmm. It sure would be nice if I could lower the thermostat a couple degrees from here.” Then you order the Nest Thermostat from Amazon Prime.  It will be there in two days.  Unbelieveable. Smart technologies do make managing a faster-paced lifestyle a lot easier, but there are certain dangers we need to be aware of.  Currently smart tech is only in a handful of homes, but before we know it, it will be the standard. The marketing potential and the sheer knowledge companies can acquire about individuals is staggering, and there needs to be legislature implemented now about the extent to which compiling and sharing this information can extend. It is transforming from an issue of how much benefit can we gain from the use of these items, to the privacy we lose because of them. The problems can be physical, too. Excessive screen time has been shown to lead to dry spots on the eyes, and eventually, migraines and muscle strain. Too much technology can lead to an “information overload” and take away what should matter most to us, like conversation and family time. Technology, like most things, should be consumed in moderation for personal use. Too much of a good thing can transform into a very bad thing quite easily.

The company however this time around hasn't actually announced the dates or venue but has instead dropped few hints on GitHub for people to figure out. Much like 2016, the Google I/O 2017 will be held in Mountain View, California on May 17 through May 19. The hints were dropped on Twitter by Google Developers and Firebase accounts who shared the same tweet with a link to a dedicated savethedate website. The tweet read, "Around the world, from here to there, to the most clever minds, the secret will share" and were accompanied hashtags #googledevs and #savethedate. One of the hints at GitHub also confirms that the I/O 2017 will take place at Google's Shoreline Amphitheatre in Mountain View. This will be the second consecutive year when Google I/O event will take place at the company's backyard. The dates and venue were confirmed after solving the five puzzles at GitHub repository. The dates and venue was first revealed by few enthusiasts at Hacker News. Unfortunately, the official I/O website hasn't listed the dates or venue for the annual event and still notes, "Check back soon for more details." Google can be expected to reveal the registration process for the I/O 2017 event soon. Much like previous years, Google this year can again be expected to utilise the event to reveal the next Android version for mobile device and make it available to developers and enthusiasts as a preview build. Last year, the company revealed Android N (later named as Nougat). Additionally, Google can be also expected to announce changes to apps and its cloud products.

With bug fixes and further enhancements on board, Android Wear 2.0 is expected to go live in early February.  ( Maurizio Pesce | Flickr ) Advertisement Google has released the fifth developer preview for Android Wear 2.0, which is also the final one and includes iOS support. The final developer preview for Android Wear 2.0 also bring bug fixes and some enhancements.   Android Wear 2.0 is expected to be outed next month, but an exact date of release for the OS which powers wearables is not known. "As Android Wear 2.0 approaches its final release in early February, we would like to thank you for your continued feedback during the developer preview program. Your input has helped us uncover bugs as well as drive critical product decisions. Thank you!" says Hoi Lam of Google. Since this is last developer preview for Android Wear 2.0, the features it brings are likely to make their way to the final release. Here's a detailed look at the enhancements and new features Android Wear 2.0 will bring. iOS Support From 2015, users have had the ability to pair their iPhones with the Android watches. However, with the updated version, users will be able to distribute the apps to the watches paired with the iPhones. This feature will alert the Play Store that the smartwatch does not need an app for Android phones. It can "appear in the Play Store on watches paired to iPhones." There are chances that the standalone apps' network bandwidth is lower than users' expectations as the Android Wear 2.0 platform will essentially balance the bandwidth with battery saving. Bug Fixes And Improvements Google has confirmed that the Wearable Support Library shall be another addition in Android Wear 2.0. However, the company has not yet divulged much information about the emulator or watch image for the release. The fifth developer preview also contains several enhancements and bug fixes such as an improved Navigation Drawer. This enhancement will enable users to shift to single page, icon-only drawer. With this improved feature the navigation process becomes quite seamless. As Google has been working hard to bring an enhanced version of Android Wear for its users, it has also tried to incorporate the Near Field Communication (NFC) HCE support along with the ProGuard configuration. Thanks to the ProGuard configuration the "data container classes" will not be complicated any more. Its addition also offers a fix for the error ClassNotFoundException, which occurs when a watch face is attempting to access information provided by the complication data server. Release Even though Google merely states that Android Wear 2.0 will be made available in the first half of February, previous reports have pointed to a Feb. 9 release for the OS. It remains to be seen if Android Wear 2.0 indeed goes live on this date or if a longer wait is in store.

Freedman | January 23, 2017 08:45 am MORE Back in May of last year, Google announced that Chromebooks would start supporting Android apps. Now, every single Chromebook going forward will have access to the Google Play Store. The news comes from a single line of text in Google's list of Chromebooks that can support the programs: "All Chromebooks launching in 2017 and after as well as the Chromebooks listed below will work with Android apps in the coming future." Below that is a list of older Chromebooks that will also run Android apps. We knew this would eventually come, and now isn't terribly surprising timing. There are more Chromebooks with touch screens than ever, including the Asus Chromebook Flip C302CA and Samsung's upcoming Chromebook Plus and Pro, all of which were announced at CES in Las Vegas. MORE: Best Chromebooks Available Now Many non-touch Chromebooks can also support Android apps, but the experience probably won't be as good. See the full list here.  Adding Android apps makes the Chrome ecosystem significantly larger. Chrome OS' bare app selection has been mostly limited to web-based programs, but now Chromebooks will run the most popular mobile apps you can find. ✖ Chromebook Guide How to Use Your Chromebook: Tips and How-Tos The Best Chromebooks Available Now The Best Chromebook Games My Month with a Chromebook: The Good and Bad Should I Buy a Chromebook?

However, as I got it in January 2015 I guess it is the older model that won't be getting them. booch221 Says: January 23rd, 2017 at 10:29 pm Every time I try to follow the instructions to enable Android apps on my Toshiba Chromebook 2:2. Sign in to the Google Play Store Click the status area, where your account picture appears. Click Settings Settings. In the "Google Play Store" section, check the box for "Enable Google Play Store on your Chromebook." In the window that appears, click Get Started. You’ll be prompted to agree to the Terms of Service. Once you’ve read and agreed, click Agree. To confirm your current Google account, click Sign In. You’ll see the Google Play Store app open. In the box that appears, click Accept. I don't see any of this stuff. It would be nice if they had some screen shots in the directions! CajunMoses Says: January 23rd, 2017 at 10:56 am Wow, Microsoft loyalists, most of whom obviously know next to nothing about the Chrome OS containerized implementation of Android, are lashing out desperately at Google and their Chromebooks with vicious, slanderous, and absurd aspersions. Suddenly, they're waking up and feeling terribly insecure and threatened by this insignificant "challenger." It Goliath quaking with fear at David. People toying with Play Store apps on Chromebooks might actually stubble upon the secret that Chromebooks are easily the most secure, maintenance-free, responsive, reliable, affordable, easy-to-used, and portable laptops on the market. James Kissel Says: January 23rd, 2017 at 10:41 am Considering that Android Apps are 'sandboxed' via containers (LXC), I would imagine that "low-level VPNs and firewalls with direct hosts file access" will not work under Chrome OS. JuanSoto Says: January 23rd, 2017 at 9:39 am I wonder how system level apps are handled in this scenario. Things like low-level VPNs (that can route even the Chrome browser), firewalls with direct hosts file access, WiFi apps that protect against mitm attacks, etc. Not a ChromeOS user or really on top of these changes but the Android support sounds like virtualization. If so where dealing with some basic security issues that are still not addressed (or even considered important) by Google. In the modern world where every device and website is under constant attack, Google needs to start putting customer concerns before greed.

However despite Samsung planning on debuting their own AI, they want to work with Google on developing the technology further. Speaking at a recent conference, Samsung mobile division’s Lee Kyeong-tae was quoted as saying, “Samsung and Google will have to continue to maintain their strategic partnership to nurture the AI and the market for the emerging technology.” This is an interesting stance considering that Bixby would be kind of a competition to Google Assistant. Samsung isn’t the only one who plans on using their own technology, or at least technology that isn’t Google’s. Recently Huawei confirmed that the Huawei Mate 9 will be launching with Amazon’s Alexa, something that Google apparently wasn’t too happy about which was one of the reasons why Google is apparently planning to bring Android One handsets into the US. In any case it does make sense that if there could be some kind of standard, or at least if companies pooled their knowledge, AI could no doubt advance much further, but then again it does give them the competitive edge so what exactly will be the result of this partnership remains to be seen.

By Rishabh Jain On 01/25/17 AT 7:38 AM Close Samsung is expected to replace its S-Voice functionality with an artificially intelligent Bixby voice assistant in its upcoming S8 device. But, how would Bixby fare in comparison with Google Assistant — the U.S. tech giant's Artificial Intelligence enabled voice assistant? “Samsung and Google will have to continue to maintain their strategic partnership to nurture the AI and the market for the emerging technology,” Lee Kyeong-Tae, corporate strategy planning vice-president, Samsung Electronics told The Investor on Tuesday. Samsung has in the past come out with devices having two voice assistants, S-Voice and Google Voice. But this time, the company seems to have different plans for Bixby. The voice assistant is expected to be integrated throughout the S8 interface including individual apps.  While the company hasn’t clearly spelt out its plans, Bixby’s compatibility with Android software features is important for this. Related Stories Google AI Firm DeepMind Develops App to Help UK Doctors Samsung Files Galaxy S8 Trademark Application The Samsung executive's conversation  hints at the company collaborating with Google on AI rather than competing with it. The exact outcome of this collaboration and its effect on both companies’ voice assistants is not known yet. Google was previously rumored to request Samsung to avoid conflicting Bixby with Assistant.  Besides Samsung, tech companies such as Amazon, LG, Honor and HTC either have, or are working on, their own Artificial Intelligence (AI) enabled voice assistants.

World Trademark Review Login Reset password Toggle navigation Home Home Magazine Blog Market intelligence Top TM professionals Research Legal updates Events International directory Media Keep it simple, stupid: study reveals how simplicity boosts customer affinity and economic performance 25 Jan 17 < Back to Blogs Trevor Little New research from brand consultancy Siegel+Gale has analysed nearly 900 brands to create a ranking of those which succeed due to brand promise simplicity. While the survey found that consumers are more willing to pay a premium for goods and services from companies that boast a simple brand promise, achieving simplicity remains an uphill battle for many brands.   The research is based on a survey of 14,000 consumers across nine countries, with a total of 857 brands rated by respondents. A brand simplicity score was than calculated based on inputs including  how they rated on the simplicity/complexity of products, services, interactions and communications in relation to its industry peers, how consistently the brand experience and communications were rated across respondents and how aligned non-user and user perceptions were. Amongst the key findings of the study were: 61% of consumers stated that they were more likely to recommend a brand because it is ‘simple’. 64% of consumers are willing to pay more for simpler experiences (in the electronics sector 30-40% of consumers stated that they would be willing to pay more for simpler experiences, with 20-30% willing to spend more on simple products/services in the appliances, health insurance, restaurants, internet retail, fashion, grocery and banking sectors). Since 2009, a stock portfolio comprised of the publicly traded simplest brands in the global top ten has outperformed the major indexes (S&P, DAX, Dow and FTSE), boasting a portfolio growth of 433% and outpacing the indexes by 330%. As to which are the most simple global brands, the top 20 is: Aldi Lidl Google Netflix Ikea Amazon KFC YouTube McDonalds Subway Burger King Hilton Pizza Hut Carrefour Hyundai Sephora Miele H&M Lenovo Samsung So what makes these brands ‘simple’? Aldi has topped the list for four straight years, with competitor brand Lidl also in the top three. In terms of grocery retail brands then, the key seems to be a clearly communicated focus on affordable goods with the promise that quality or taste is not sacrificed. In addition, Aldi scored points because it mostly carries exclusive products, meaning that customers don’t have to choose between an array of brands and prices. On the tech side it is all about the simplicity of interfaces and the way that their core offering simplifies everyday activities for customers. For instance, YouTube’s navigation offering, the use of a ‘two click’ system and Amazon Dash buttons by Amazon and the alternative to channel surfing that Netflix’s service represents were key factors in their high ratings. Meanwhile, Google was praised for offering a user experience that is “intuitive and easy to understand”, with the use of Google Doodles (the daily logo illustrations) showcasing the brand’s personality. While such simplicity should be expected as Google’s search offering arguably has one key function to perform, Yahoo! dropped 37 places, the report noting that “search isn’t always simple”. At the other end of the scale, the 10 brands identified as the most complex were as follows (with AXA identified as the most complex brand for the second year running): AXA Aviva BUPA LinkedIn Avis MetLife Hertz HSBC Ryanair Budget That financial services and travel brands figure heavily in the most complex brands highlights the difficulty facing some brands as they seek to achieve simplicity. While the key offering/brand proposition – and regular touchpoint with customers to keep that proposition front of mind – of say, Google, Netflix, Aldi and McDonalds is simple to convey, for those organisations that offer a more complex array of products and choices, and have less regular interaction with customers, the challenge is far greater. Clearly not all brands can be truly ‘simple’. Additionally, it is important to note that simplicity is just one factor that contributes to brand affinity amongst customers and solid economic performance. While a number of top ten ‘simple brands’ have been evidenced to outperform the major indexes, in addition to this simplicity there may well be other traits that these brands have in common that are a bigger contributor to revenues and profitability (and the report doesn’t make a similar analysis of the ten most complex brands to see if their complexity had a negative impact). Ultimately, the premise that brands that make and deliver on a simple brand promise will be successful is wholly logical and you arguably don’t need a study to tell you that. However, the research does provide another dataset that serves as an endorsement of the work carried out by those tasked with building the legal foundations on which brands are built. The activities undertaken by counsel to secure protection for brands and slogans, clear advertising, monitoring social media brand use and ensuring that competitors and counterfeiters are prevented from damaging reputation are at the heart of creating, maintaining and communicating the brand promise. Therefore the study – alongside data showing that the most valuable brands similarly outperform a range of financial indices – serves to highlight the importance of an effective brand strategy and can be used by counsel to demonstrate the value they bring and support. Until detailed studies are undertaken to ascertain the correlation between the size of trademark and design portfolios and economic performance, such data is a useful tool to have in your toolbox.  Channels Brand strategy Brand value Brand Comments Please log in or register to leave a comment.

Consisting of millions of websites, advertisers can display their ads to a wide range of audiences using many targeting options. Although it can reportedly reach of 92% of all Internet users in the US, hesitation to use it is not uncommon. For example, when your target audience is browsing websites, they may not necessarily be in ‘shopping mode’, in comparison to when they are using Google Search. So to get the most from your GDN budget, you need to be smart about who you are going to target and how. In this post, I outline six tips that will help you harness the potential of display advertising (including how to get the most from a limited budget). 1. Remarketing Campaigns An obvious one, but this is by far the biggest opportunity: if you’re ever going to see any kind of return on the display network, you’re most likely to see it from remarketing. Remarketing allows you to deposit a cookie via the browser of your website visitors.  You will then be able to display ads targeting those website visitors whenever they visit other sites also on the Google Display Network. It might sound slightly creepy, but it works due to the fact the people seeing your ads are already familiar with your brand. What’s more, remarketing has been proven to deliver lower CPAs, so it’s a great option for advertisers operating on a smaller budget. Here’s how to setup a basic remarketing campaign to target users that have previously visited your website: Set up remarketing and add a remarketing tag to all pages of your website. Set up remarketing lists using the audiences tab within the AdWords shared library: Within a few days, your “All visitors” list will begin to populate. You can monitor this via the audiences tab in AdWords, as outlined above. Once your chosen list has gained at least 100 visitors within 30 days, you’re ready to start remarketing. To set up a new campaign, click +Campaign and select “Display Network only”: To enable all features, select ‘No marketing objective‘ and ‘All features‘: Choose a target location, language, bid strategy, budget, and campaign name. Click Save and continue. Name your first ad group, set your default CPC bid. Click Interests and remarketing under ‘Choose how to target your ads’: In the ‘Select a category’ drop-down menu, choose Remarketing lists: Choose one of the remarketing lists you previously created via the audiences tab. In this example, we will be targeting ‘all website visitors’: Click Save and continue if you want to create your ads, or Skip ad creation if you want to do this later. Once your ads have been created, they’re eligible to be served to all previous website visitors whenever they’re browsing sites on the GDN. There are many useful posts on how to optimize remarketing campaigns, including how to set up appropriate frequency capping and how to monitor performance. If you’re keen to learn more about remarketing strategies, this post from the guys at KlientBoost highlights more than 30 strategic remarketing campaigns. 2. Target Similar Audiences The Similar Audiences feature within Google AdWords attempts to find people with similar interests and browsing habits as your remarketing audiences. If you have already set up remarketing, I would recommend targeting Similar Audiences in their own ad groups to see if you can boost performance. To target similar audiences, set up a new display campaign and select the ‘Similar to remarketing lists‘ option within the Display Network targeting settings: You should then be able to click the arrows » next to each similar audience that you want to target: Similar audiences allow you to increase the reach of existing remarketing campaigns to drive new users to your site who have similar browsing habits as previous website visitors. Protip: I would always recommend segmenting remarketing lists and similar audiences into separate ad groups to monitor relative performance, rather than grouping them into a single ad group. 3. Focus on Placements Of all the targeting options available to advertisers on the Google Display Network, the best way of gaining granular control over where your ads are being served is by using managed placements. If you use targeting methods like interests or topics, Google is essentially guessing which sites are relevant, meaning there’s a risk that your ads may be served on irrelevant websites. By targeting placements, you’re able to select exactly which sites you want your ads to be displayed on, so it’s a safe option for advertisers just branching out into display advertising. To set up placement targeting, navigate to the targeting settings of your display network campaign and choose ‘placements‘ from the Ad targeting drop down: You can then choose specific placements from the list by searching for keywords or specific websites: If you have a list of high performing placements (websites), you can start to separate them into individual ad groups. Then you can more effectively manage your bids on the placements that are providing the best return. 4. Look Out for Mobile Games Are you using keyword, topic, or interest targeting? Has it been awhile since you monitored the placements your ads are being served on? If so, chances are mobile games are wasting a huge chunk of your budget. This is an issue that has appeared largely due to kids using their parents’ mobile apps, which often leads to ads being clicked by accident. How to check whether mobile games have been taking up a slice of your display budget: Navigate to your display network campaign, click Display Network tab for the campaign, and then the Placements sub-tab: Luckily, the guys over at Wordstream have written a guide on how to exclude mobile games from your display campaigns, so you’re not wasting your budget. 5. Target In-Market Audiences In-market audiences are people whom Google has determined to be most interested in what you have to offer based on their browsing behavior and activity. This audience comprises of users who are actively searching and comparing products and services matching those you offer. To see if in-market audiences are a successful targeting method for you, set up a campaign via the ‘Interests and remarketing‘ tab. Select In-market audiences from the drop down before checking which type of audience you’d like to target: Protip: To get a true reflection of whether this targeting method could work for your business, make sure you split your in-market audience targeting into a separate ad group. Then pay close attention to the placements report to further refine performance over time. 6. Test Gmail Sponsored Promotions One of the most cost effective types of display campaigns is Gmail Sponsored Promotions. Gmail sponsored promotions are ads that appear in a Gmail inbox, above emails. Designed to look like a regular email, once clicked they expand to a full ad. Here’s an example of how the ads appear in my inbox, before being clicked: Once clicked, the expanded version of the Nike ad looks like this: For Gmail Sponsored Promotions, advertisers must create one ‘collapsed (text based) ad’ and one ‘expanded ad‘. They can be created using custom HTML, per the Nike example above. Advertisers are charged on a cost per click basis. Note that the click is counted whenever someone expands an ad. Not just when they click through to the website from an ad. Advertisers will only pay for the first click. They are not charged again when a user clicks through to their website. It’s worth noting that these ads are only eligible to appear in standard Gmail accounts. They will not appear in accounts that are part of a paid G suite business account. For B2B advertisers, it’s worth bearing this in mind, as you’ll only be able to reach business users on their personal Gmail accounts. In terms of targeting options, you can target (or exclude) using any combination of the following: Display keywords (this is based on content of the last 300 emails a user has received) AdWords customer match Location targeting (one per campaign) Topics (based on the user’s inbox) Demographics (age / gender / parental status) For more information, I’d strongly recommend checking out this detailed guide from Tara West. Conclusion The Display Network is indeed colossal. In order to generate optimal returns, advertisers need to make use of the ever-expanding targeting options to enable them to get their ads in front of potential customers. I would recommend keeping on top of the latest features as well as testing some of the tips outlined above, to see if they can deliver results for your business.

By Agamoni Ghosh January 25, 2017 11:30 GMT Google will hold its annual developers conference from May 17-19 this year at Shoreline Amphitheater in Mountain View, CAReuters The dates and venue for Google's annual developer conference I/O have been revealed. The company chose a rather unique way to divulge the details by publishing five puzzles for developers to solve. First, the company posted on the Google Developers G+ page, revealing another hidden site which would further redirect to a GitHub repository, with a set of coordinates to a remote jungle in Brazil. Another puzzle links to an unlisted YouTube video, with the captions translated to another set of coordinates. An then there is a third and a fourth puzzle that reveal locations, in Warsaw, Poland, and Thailand. The company expected the developers to crack the puzzle, which they did successfully by assigning the name of these countries to positions on a chess board, while adding/subtracting from the letter values provided and the result came as "L IN E THEATRE SHO RE AM P H I." It translates to the Shoreline Amphitheater, which is situated at Google's Mountain View campus in California, US. Some developers who cracked the puzzles also found out the most likely date for the event are - May 17-19. At this point, until Google sends out a formal invite and the date of the event, it is difficult to be certain about what the company will unveil this year. Some speculations point towards a new version of the Pixel and Daydream, although Google has stayed away from major hardware-related announcements at this event. On the software front, however, we saw Nougat being unveiled last year so there is a high chance that the next OS, which shall be abbreviated as Google O may also be previewed.

IE Home Nation World Opinion Sports Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Gadgets Review Photos Videos Mobile & Tabs Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Tech News As BHIM downloads touch 5 million, ‘teething problems’ hit payment app As BHIM downloads touch 5 million, ‘teething problems’ hit payment app A common complaint about the Bhim app not being able to generate a mobile PIN for debit cards that do not have expiry dates By: IANS | Published:January 25, 2017 5:49 pm Launched on December 30, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI)-based BHIM is currently available only on Google’s Play Store With over five million BHIM apps having been downloaded, users are facing several “teething problems” that need to rectified. However, experts believe what is really required is an “awareness drive” to help the masses use the app. Launched on December 30, the Unified Payments Interface (UPI)-based BHIM, an acronym for Bharat Interface for Money, is currently available only on Google’s Play Store (it is yet to make an appearance on the Apple iOS platform) — and users have been registering their complaints there. A common complaint is about the app not being able to generate a mobile PIN for debit cards that do not have expiry dates. One user criticised the “very very poor app establishment”, citing the inability to generate a PIN using the Maestro debit card. Asking the authorities to “please look into the matter at the earliest”, he contended that some 30-40 per cent of account holders have debit cards without expiry dates. Watch all our videos from Express Technology Another, an account-holder with State Bank of India, lamented that the condition of his ATM card — which does not have an expiry date — was “very good” and that he would have to pay Rs 500 to get it changed to new one. There also appear to be “certain server-side bandwidth issues”, say experts, which have caused problems such as the Virtual Payment Address (VPA) not being identified, leading to some failed transactions. Overall, however, the experts described the glitches as “initial teething problems” that would get addressed with time. “We have to dwell deeper into the nature of complaints to assess the exact reason of their occurrences. As people are increasingly using digital transactions, we must bear in mind that users need to be informed about being intelligent in their usage,” Thomas George, Senior Vice President and Head of CyberMedia Research (CMR), a Gurgaon-based market research firm, told IANS. “When they initiate transactions, the business loses control of a large portion of the transaction interaction as customers use a variety of devices, operating systems and browsers to access the app or e-commerce sites. “The (problems) could be from any of these, or outside these too. These complaints are initial teething ones and they will get addressed,” George added. According to Saket Modi, CEO & Co-founder, Lucideus — the IT risk assessment and digital security services provider behind the security for BHIM — the architecture in which the app works is a complex one where you are doing inter-bank transactions in real-time with an intermediary — the National Payments Corporation of India — and a simple application sitting on your mobile phone. “As you can see, there are multiple parties involved in doing the actual transaction. There are certain server-side bandwidth issues which result in problems such as Virtual Payment Address (VPA) not being identified or some failed transactions,” Modi told IANS. However, Modi too said these were “one-time problems” and would be sorted out soon. Read: Reliance Jio primary data connection on mobiles in India: Report For a successful BHIM transaction, two PINS are required. One is the app PIN which is stored locally on the phone and is required every time a person starts BHIM. The other is the UPI PIN with which you set up an UPI account or a VPA, which is required only when a transaction is taking place or you request to see your account balance on the BHIM app. “The app has a three-factor authentication, hence is superior both from a technology standpoint as well as a convenience perspective in comparison to mobile wallets,” Modi noted. The binding of the BHIM app with a user’s device ID and mobile number has never happened in any other conventional net banking or mobile wallet apps. “So it is safe to say that BHIM app is by far the most innovative technology in terms of digital payments. The authentication mechanism is tightly secured yet convenient and I am sure will be replicated globally,” Modi told IANS. According to George, in the coming days, UPI-based apps could displace the cash-on-delivery (COD) payment method in e-commerce — currently accounting for close to 60 per cent of all transactions. This will be a major boon for companies like Amazon, Flipkart and Snapdeal which currently incur huge costs on logistics and working capital because of the prevalence of COD and related problems. Read: India smartphone market slips 18% in Q4 as Chinese brands dominate “Having said all that, a lot more awareness… an education drive needs to be carried out to really connect UPI with the masses,” George emphasised. According to Pavel Naiya, Senior Research Analyst (Devices and Analytics) at New Delhi-based Counterpoint Research, there are people who have had complaints regarding failed UPI-based transactions, but this was rare. “Many of these problems may have occurred owing to a wrong UPI PIN entered or an off-base payment address entered. In some cases, this may have happened due to less than required mobile memory left for app to function correctly,” Naiya told IANS. As the chorus grows for people to adapt to digital payment methods in the post-demonetisation era, their success will depend not only on technology and bandwidth — but on users who are well-informed and aware.

I know it sounds harsh, but honestly, it’s long overdue and you’re taking up valuable space on the internet. Stop prolonging it. I was dismayed to hear this week that you’re pushing back Verizon’s US$4.8 billion purchase of your core business until the second quarter. That’s at least another three months of remembering how you messed up a good thing and how you became what is quite possibly the worst internet company of all time. Please don’t get indignant. I assure you – it was all you, not me. Our relationship started innocently enough. Like many other 20-somethings in the mid-1990s, I was only just starting to use the internet when you first arrived. I might never have found all those important Smashing Pumpkins fan pages and Fresh Prince of Bel Air episode guides without your help. I also liked your email service, which was better than the decrepit Lotus Mail my employer at the time forced on us. Your email was modern and accessible from any computer. You were "cloud" before it was cool. You were the veritable king of the world in those days. On April 12, 1996, your shares closed at $33 each, up nearly 300 per cent from their initial public offering price. Nearly five years later, those same shares would hit an all-time high of $475. Somewhere around the turn of the millennium – I can’t remember exactly when – it started to go sour. A colleague came over to my desk and told me to type the address of a new website into my Netscape browser. "G-O-O-G-L-E dot-com," he spelt out. Up came a minimalist white page with a text field and little else. I think we all know how that turned out. Historians will point to the arrival of Google as the stake through Yahoo’s heart. Unlike your Web directory, which was largely curated by humans, Google was powered by coldly efficient algorithms that determined the value of sites based on how many other pages linked to them. It was a genius system that worked brilliantly with the exponentially growing Web, which humans were quickly losing the capacity to index themselves. Amazingly, your leadership decided against buying Google for a mere $1bn when Larry Page and Sergey Brin offered it to you in 2002. The only more boneheaded move of the era was Ross cheating on Rachel. By the time you reconsidered the purchase, the asking price had skyrocketed to $3bn, which again was too rich for you. Isn’t it funny that Google is now worth $576bn? Sure, conventional wisdom suggests that fateful decision led to your undoing, but for me it was email. I really did like Yahoo Mail, but it was hard to ignore the ever-increasing spam that was seeping into it. When Gmail arrived in 2004, it was clean, searchable and, most importantly, devoid of junk. That was it for me and millions of other users. Unlike Ross on Friends, we never looked back. With the search and email battles lost, it was curtains for you. Still, the bad decisions kept coming. You acquired Flickr in 2005, then did nothing with it while Facebook and Instagram became the de facto online photo-sharing apps. You rejected a whopping $44bn takeover bid from Microsoft in 2008, despite having as much a chance of making a comeback as Hootie and the Blowfish. In 2012, you began reorienting your focus towards mobile. Good move, but about four years too late. Through it all, you hired and fired a string of forgettable chief executives, desperately looking for someone who would rekindle your glory days. Look, I don’t normally wish ill on old flames, but you’ve really made a case for it of late. In December you disclosed that a billion of your email accounts were hacked in 2013. That was just three months removed from a similar admission of another half-billion breaches. And then there was the revelation in between that you had built software for US intelligence officials to secretly scan users’ emails. Are you kidding me? Lack of foresight, bad decisions, inferior products and an attitude toward users that has bordered on hostile – yes, I do think it’s fair to consider you the worst technology company of all time. That’s why I can’t wait until you’re gone. You will be remembered, but you won’t be missed. Goodbye, Pete The tech week’s winner and loser Winner of the Week: Samsung. The company came clean about the battery manufacturing problems that caused Galaxy Note 7 phones to catch fire. While Samsung is ultimately guilty of poor quality assurance, its investigation of the issue earns points for thoroughness and transparency. Loser of the Week: Net neutrality. The US president Donald Trump named Ajit Pai, who has said he wants to take a "weed whacker" to net neutrality rules, the new head of the Federal Communications Commission. Observers believe that gutting the rules will have global repercussions.
