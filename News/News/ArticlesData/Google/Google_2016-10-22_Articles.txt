Also, if you are not happy with Google’s speed of rolling out the Play Store updates in your country, you can also choose to manually update it. So, how do you install the Play Store? Is there a special method? Is it as simple as installing any other app? Fret not, installing the Play Store is as simple as installing any other app from outside the Play Store. Now, let us get going to know how to install the Play Store. Method #1: Update the Play Store Step #1: Open the Play Store app. Step #2: Head to the Play Store’s settings. Step #3: Scroll down and find the build version. Now, simply tap on it to start downloading the latest version of the Play Store.(if any) Method #2: Download the APK file from your Android device & Install the Play Store At first, you need to grab the APK file from the web to get started installing the Play Store. However, only a few of the sites on the web offer to download the legitimate / unmodified Play Store APK File. Moreover, APKMirror.Com seems to be the only one that you can trust right now. Note: APKMirror.com is the most trusted source for downloading original / unmodified APK files. The website is owned and managed by AndroidPolice.com. They verify the MD5 hash value (The cryptographic signature) which guarantees that the file is safe to install and was not tampered with in any way. Steps to download the APK File from APKMirror.com Note: The images used for this method shows the desktop version of the website. It would be the same when using your Android device. Step #1: Head on to APKMirror.com Step #2: Type in – “Play Store” in the search field of the site as shown in the image below. Step #3: Now, tap on the search icon to start searching for it. Finally, you will get to see multiple versions of the APK file for the Google Play Store as shown in the image below. So, now you will have to decide which one to choose for your device. If you are confused, do have a look at APKMirror’s FAQ page to know which variant should you download for your device. Note: There is nothing to worry about if you accidentally install an incompatible APK variant for your device. The installation would simply fail if you do so. Step #4: Click on the version you want to download and finally tap on the Download button to start downloading the APK file as shown in the image below. Now that you have successfully downloaded the APK file to your Android device. You will have have to first allow the installation from unknown sources in order to install an APK file on your device. Steps to Allow Installation from Unknown Sources Step #1: Open the settings app. Step #2: Scroll down and click on “Security” settings. Step #3: Scroll down to find “Unknown Sources” option and enable it. Ignore the warning message because you know what you are doing already (It is safe!). Note: Do not forget to disable the installation of Unknown sources after installing the Play Store. Steps to Install the Play Store Step #1: Open the downloads manager of your device. Step #2: Click on the Play Store’s APK file. Step #3: Tap on “Install” to start installing the APK File. Method #3: Transfer the APK File from the PC to your Android device & Install the Play Store On the off chance, if you do not have an active Internet connection on your device, you can utilize a desktop in order to get the APK file. Follow the same set of steps to download the APK file from APKMirror.com as mentioned above. After you are done downloading the APK file to your computer, simply transfer the file to your Android device connecting it via a USB cable (as a storage media). You may refer to the Google’s support page if you have any problems connecting your Android device to the computer. Simply, navigate your way to the location where the APK file resides and click on it to Install the Play Store. Of course, you will have to allow installation from unknown sources here as well before installing the Play Store. Wrapping Up So, as you are now aware of various methods to install the Play Store. Was that not very easy? Having trouble installing the Play Store with the methods mentioned above? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below. Filed in Cellphones.

Resend activation e-mail Risk Assessment / Security & Hacktivism Using Rowhammer bitflips to root Android phones is now a thing Permission-less apps take only seconds to root phones from LG, Samsung and Motorola. by Dan Goodin - Oct 23, 2016 11:03 pm UTC Login to bookmark 157 Enlarge / An LG Nexus 5 at the moment it is rooted using Rowhammer-induced bit flips. van der Veen et al. Researchers have devised an attack that gains unfettered "root" access to a large number of Android phones, exploiting a relatively new type of bug that allows adversaries to manipulate data stored in memory chips. The breakthrough has the potential to make millions of Android phones vulnerable, at least until a security fix is available, to a new form of attack that seizes control of core parts of the operating system and neuters key security defenses. Equally important, it demonstrates that the new class of exploit, dubbed Rowhammer, can have malicious and far-reaching effects on a much wider number of devices than was previously known, including those running ARM chips. Previously, some experts believed Rowhammer attacks that altered specific pieces of security-sensitive data weren't reliable enough to pose a viable threat because exploits depended on chance hardware faults or advanced memory-management features that could be easily adapted to repel the attacks. But the new proof-of-concept attack developed by an international team of academic researchers is challenging those assumptions. An app containing the researchers' rooting exploit requires no user permissions and doesn't rely on any vulnerability in Android to work. Instead, their attack exploits a hardware vulnerability, using a Rowhammer exploit that alters crucial bits of data in a way that completely roots name brand Android devices from LG, Motorola, Samsung, OnePlus, and possibly other manufacturers. No quick fix "Until recently, we never even thought about hardware bugs [and] software was never written to deal with them," one of the researchers, Victor van der Veen, wrote in an e-mail. "Now, we are using them to break your phone or tablet in a fully reliable way and without relying on any software vulnerability or esoteric feature. And there is no quick software update to patch the problem and go back to business as usual." So far, "Drammer," as the researchers have dubbed their exploit, has successfully rooted the following handsets: the Nexus 4, Nexus 5, and G4 from LG; Moto G models from 2013 and 2014 made by Motorola; the Galaxy S4 and Galaxy S5 from Samsung; and the One from OnePlus. In some cases, the results aren't always consistent. For example, only 12 of the 15 Nexus 5 models were successfully rooted, while only one of two Galaxy S5 were compromised. The researchers aren't certain why their results are inconsistent. They theorize that the age of a given device may play a role, since extended or intensive use may wear down cells inside the memory chips over time. Another possibility is that memory chips from some suppliers are more resilient to Rowhammer than others. (It's not uncommon for different generations of the same phone model to use different memory chips.) The researchers expect to soon publish an app that allows people to test their individual phone and anonymously include the results in a running tally that will help researchers better track the list of vulnerable devices. (Update 10/24/2016 6:10 California time: The app still hasn't gone live in Google Play. People who are willing to sideload the app can find it here.) The researchers privately reported their findings to Google engineers in July, and the company has designated the vulnerability as "critical," its highest severity rating. Google also awarded the researchers $4,000 under the company's bug bounty reward program. Google informed its manufacturing partners of the vulnerability earlier this month and plans to release an update in November, but the researchers warned it doesn't conclusively fix the underlying Rowhammer hardware bug. Instead, it only makes the vulnerability much harder to exploit by restricting an app's access to "physical contiguous kernel memory," as carried out by Drammer. "I will have to check once the patch is out, but I expect that we could still find bit flips," van der Veen told Ars. "Exploiting them would be harder, but probably not impossible." Google continues to work on a longer term solution. The researchers have published two videos that demonstrate Drammer in action against an unrooted LG Nexus 5. For test and research purposes, the phone is connected by USB to a computer, although such a pairing isn't necessary to make the attacks work. In the first video, the handset is running Android 6.0.1 with security patches Google released on October 5. Beginning around 0:15, Drammer begins hammering memory, and between 0:30 and 0:50, the exploit can be seen writing new entries to the memory's page table, 512 entries at a time. At the 0:50 mark, Drammer obtains root access and opens a shell window that gives complete control over the device. Drammer on Android 6.0.1 The second video shows how Drammer can be combined with code that exploits specific Android vulnerabilities, in this one known as Stagefright, which remains unfixed in many older handsets. By adding the Drammer privilege-escalation exploit, an existing code-execution attack can access core parts of the operating system, rather than being confined only to a small section of it, as envisioned under the Android security model. In the second video, the Stagefright exploit gives the researchers an advanced shell, but it still has only limited system privileges, as evidenced by the inability to access the phone's SD card. By running Drammer, however, the shell gains root access, starting about 3:30 into the video. Stagefright + Drammer Drammer represents a dramatic advance in what's known about Rowhammer. In 2014, researchers first demonstrated that repeatedly accessing data stored in memory chips could flip certain bits, causing certain zeros to become ones and vice versa. The bitflips were viewed by many as more of a data-corrupting threat than one with far-reaching consequences for security. In part, that was because the bit flips were possible only in limited regions of certain DDR memory chips, making it hard to surgically alter specific pieces of security-sensitive data. The road to exploitation Then in 2015, researchers for Google's Project Zero showed that in limited settings, Rowhammer could be exploited to elevate user privileges and break out of security sandboxes that protect operating systems from untrusted code. Many researchers continued to downplay the significance of the results, in part because Google responded by updating its Chrome browser to disable the CLFLUSH instruction that was required to make the sandbox escape work. Additionally, critics said error-correcting code and other protections could easily mitigate the threat. Since then, researchers have slowly advanced the capabilities of Rowhammer, showing, for instance, the bug can be exploited by the type of JavaScript code hosted on websites and can be fine-tuned to alter specific pieces of security-sensitive data using a technique known as flip feng shui. Flip feng shui, however, still relied on advanced memory-management features that aren't available in most mobile devices and other low-cost platforms. And like all the other Rowhammer exploits that preceded it, it worked only on devices that used chips with an x86 x64 architecture, which are mostly made by Intel and Advanced Micro Devices. Drammer was devised by many of the same researchers behind Flip Feng Shui, and it adopts many of the same approaches. Still, it represents a significant improvement over Flip Feng Shui because it's able to alter specific pieces of sensitive-security data using standard memory management interfaces built into the Android OS. Using crucial information about the layout of Android memory chips gleaned from a side channel the researchers discovered in ARM processors, Drammer is able to carry out what the researchers call a deterministic attack, meaning one that can reliably target security-sensitive data. The susceptibility of Android devices to Rowhammer exploits likely signals a similar vulnerability in memory chips used in iPhones and other mobile devices as well. "It is currently unclear to us if, and how this could be exploited," van der Veen told Ars. "I would not be surprised if it turns out that this is possible, though. Drammer shows that the requirements for reliable exploitation are provided by fundamental operating system functionality, and I expect that similar functionality is available on iOS (or even Windows Phone)." The findings are the product of a research team from VUSec at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, the University of California at Santa Barbara, and Graz University of Technology. They will be presenting their research later this week at the 23rd ACM Conference on Computer and Communications Security in Vienna, Austria. They have published this informational page with additional details of their work. In a paper published early Monday morning Amsterdam time titled Drammer: Deterministic Rowhammer Attacks on Mobile Platforms, the researchers wrote: Not only does our attack show that practical, deterministic Rowhammer attacks are a real threat for billions of mobile users, but it is also the first effort to show that Rowhammer is even possible at all (and reliably exploitable) on any platform other than x86 and with a much more limited software feature set than existing solutions. Moreover, we demonstrated that several devices from different vendors are vulnerable to Rowhammer. To conclude, our research shows that practical large-scale Rowhammer attacks are a serious threat and while the response to the Rowhammer bug has been relatively slow from vendors, we hope our work will accelerate mitigation efforts both in industry and academia. In a statement, Google officials wrote: "After researchers reported this issue to our Vulnerability Rewards Program, we worked closely with them to deeply understand it in order to better secure our users. We’ve developed a mitigation which we will include in our upcoming November security bulletin."

They can make it more difficult, as the article states software fixes would only be a bandaid. Well, it'll be a kinda-sorta software patch. Mainly to enable memory encryption. On an SoC I worked on, we had in the memory controller a Memory Encryption Unit that scrambled both address and data lines. If you enabled it, every boot you'd load on a random number into the key registers and then enable it. (You have to be running from SRAM at this point, because obviously once enabled, everything is encrypted). The purpose of this unit was to prevent plaintext data form hitting memory so if you spied on the memory bus, you got gibberish. This technique has been used many times efore (I believe the Xbox360 has encrypted main memory as well). Even better, it's wire speed zero overhead, transparent to the SoC (inside the SoC the MEU would've decrypted the data, so no special support is needed, and this includes the DMA controller). Because of the way it works and the key, you cannot guaranteed the data or the rows are even similar from boot to boot. I'm not sure if iOS or the Apple SoCs have a MEU - in general they should, and I think I've heard they do, but no real confirmation. 965 posts | registered 7/7/2001 KonoWatakushi Ars Scholae Palatinae jump to post Layer8Error wrote: The actual implementation of this exploit is way over my head, but could this be prevented using ECC? Theoretically, an attack is still possible with ECC. However, ECC helps considerably with this and other data corruption, and would likely land the attack on the other side of practical. ECC memory should have been made standard a decade ago. Now, as with many other things, the cost of our foolishness is coming due. Manufacturers saved a few pennies or dollars, and now we have millions if not billions of devices that can't be secured. 1226 posts | registered 9/14/2005 Reader comments 157 You must login or create an account to comment.

(For more resources related to this topic, see here.) Google App Engine gives developers a NoOps (short for No Operations, indicating that developers and engineers have no work to do in order to have their code running and available) way of deploying their applications, and Go has been officially supported as a language option for some years now. Google's architecture runs some of the biggest applications in the world, such as Google Search, Google Maps, Gmail, among others, so is a pretty safe bet when it comes to deploying our own code. Google App Engine allows you to write a Go application, add a few special configuration files, and deploy it to Google's servers, where it will be hosted and made available in a highly available, scalable, and elastic environment. Instances will automatically spin up to meet demand and tear down gracefully when they are no longer needed with a healthy free quota and preapproved budgets. Along with running application instances, Google App Engine makes available a myriad of useful services, such as fast and high-scale data stores, search, memcache, and task queues. Transparent load balancing means you don't need to build and maintain additional software or hardware to ensure servers don't get overloaded and that requests are fulfilled quickly. In this article, we will build the API backend for a question and answer service similar to Stack Overflow or Quora and deploy it to Google App Engine. In the process, we'll explore techniques, patterns, and practices that can be applied to all such applications as well as dive deep into some of the more useful services available to our application. Specifically, in this article, you will learn: How to use the Google App Engine SDK for Go to build and test applications locally before deploying to the cloud How to use app.yaml to configure your application How Modules in Google App Engine let you independently manage the different components that make up your application How the Google Cloud Datastore lets you persist and query data at scale A sensible pattern for the modeling of data and working with keys in Google Cloud Datastore How to use the Google App Engine Users API to authenticate people with Google accounts A pattern to embed denormalized data into entities The Google App Engine SDK for Go In order to run and deploy Google App Engine applications, we must download and configure the Go SDK. Head over to https://cloud.google.com/appengine/downloads and download the latest Google App Engine SDK for Go for your computer. The ZIP file contains a folder called go_appengine, which you should place in an appropriate folder outside of your GOPATH, for example, in /Users/yourname/work/go_appengine. It is possible that the names of these SDKs will change in the future—if that happens, ensure that you consult the project home page for notes pointing you in the right direction at https://github.com/matryer/goblueprints. Next, you will need to add the go_appengine folder to your $PATH environment variable, much like what you did with the go folder when you first configured Go. To test your installation, open a terminal and type this: goapp version You should see something like the following: go version go1.6.1 (appengine-1.9.37) darwin/amd64 The actual version of Go is likely to differ and is often a few months behind actual Go releases. This is because the Cloud Platform team at Google needs to do work on its end to support new releases of Go. The goapp command is a drop-in replacement for the go command with a few additional subcommands; so you can do things like goapp test and goapp vet, for example. Creating your application In order to deploy an application to Google's servers, we must use the Google Cloud Platform Console to set it up. In a browser, go to https://console.cloud.google.com and sign in with your Google account. Look for the Create Project menu item, which often gets moved around as the console changes from time to time. If you already have some projects, click on a project name to open a submenu, and you'll find it in there. If you can't find what you're looking for, just search Creating App Engine project and you'll find it. When the New Project dialog box opens, you will be asked for a name for your application. You are free to call it whatever you like (for example, Answers), but note the Project ID that is generated for you; you will need to refer to this when you configure your app later. You can also click on Edit and specify your own ID, but know that the value must be globally unique, so you'll have to get creative when thinking one up. Here we will use answersapp as the application ID, but you won't be able to use that one since it has already been taken. You may need to wait a minute or two for your project to get created; there's no need to watch the page—you can continue and check back later. App Engine applications are Go packages Now that the Google App Engine SDK for Go is configured and our application has been created, we can start building it. In Google App Engine, an application is just a normal Go package with an init function that registers handlers via the http.Handle or http.HandleFunc functions. It does not need to be the main package like normal tools. Create a new folder (somewhere inside your GOPATH folder) called answersapp/api and add the following main.go file: package api
import 
(
  "io"
  "net/http"
)
func init() 
{
  http.HandleFunc("/", handleHello)
}
func handleHello(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) 
{
  io.WriteString(w, "Hello from App Engine")
}
 You will be familiar with most of this by now, but note that there is no ListenAndServe call, and the handlers are set inside the init function rather than main. We are going to handle every request with our simple handleHello function, which will just write a welcoming string. The app.yaml file In order to turn our simple Go package into a Google App Engine application, we must add a special configuration file called app.yaml. The file will go at the root of the application or module, so create it inside the answersapp/api folder with the following contents: application: YOUR_APPLICATION_ID_HERE
version: 1
runtime: go
api_version: go1
handlers:
- url: /.*
  script: _go_app
 The file is a simple human–(and machine) readable configuration file in YAML (Yet Another Markup Language format—refer to yaml.org for more details). The following table describes each property: Property Description application The application ID (copied and pasted from when you created your project). version Your application version number—you can deploy multiple versions and even split traffic between them to test new features, among other things. We'll just stick with version 1 for now. runtime The name of the runtime that will execute your application. Since we're building a Go application, we'll use go. api_version The go1 api version is the runtime version supported by Google; you can imagine that this could be go2 in the future. handlers A selection of configured URL mappings. In our case, everything will be mapped to the special _go_app script, but you can also specify static files and folders here. Running simple applications locally Before we deploy our application, it makes sense to test it locally. We can do this using the App Engine SDK we downloaded earlier. Navigate to your answersapp/api folder and run the following command in a terminal: goapp serve You should see the following output: This indicates that an API server is running locally on port :56443, an admin server is running on :8000, and our application (the module default) is now serving at localhost:8080, so let's hit that one in a browser. As you can see by the Hello from App Engine response, our application is running locally. Navigate to the admin server by changing the port from :8080 to :8000. The preceding screenshot shows the web portal that we can use to interrogate the internals of our application, including viewing running instances, inspecting the data store, managing task queues, and more. Deploying simple applications to Google App Engine To truly understand the power of Google App Engine's NoOps promise, we are going to deploy this simple application to the cloud. Back in the terminal, stop the server by hitting Ctrl+C and run the following command: goapp deploy Your application will be packaged and uploaded to Google's servers. Once it's finished, you should see something like the following: Completed update of app: theanswersapp, version: 1 It really is as simple as that. You can prove this by navigating to the endpoint you get for free with every Google App Engine application, remembering to replace the application ID with your own: https://YOUR_APPLICATION_ID_HERE.appspot.com/. You will see the same output as earlier (the font may render differently since Google's servers will make assumptions about the content type that the local dev server doesn't). The application is being served over HTTP/2 and is already capable of pretty massive scale, and all we did was write a config file and a few lines of code. Modules in Google App Engine A module is a Go package that can be versioned, updated, and managed independently. An app might have a single module, or it can be made up of many modules: each distinct but part of the same application with access to the same data and services. An application must have a default module—even if it doesn't do much. Our application will be made up of the following modules: Description The module name The obligatory default module default An API package delivering RESTful JSON api A static website serving HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that makes AJAX calls to the API module web Each module will be a Go package and will, therefore, live inside its own folder. Let's reorganize our project into modules by creating a new folder alongside the api folder called default. We are not going to make our default module do anything other than use it for configuration, as we want our other modules to do all the meaningful work. But if we leave this folder empty, the Google App Engine SDK will complain that it has nothing to build. Inside the default folder, add the following placeholder main.go file: package defaultmodule
func init() {}
 This file does nothing except allowing our default module to exist. It would have been nice for our package names to match the folders, but default is a reserved keyword in Go, so we have a good reason to break that rule. The other module in our application will be called web, so create another folder alongside the api and default folders called web. Here we are only going to build the API for our application and cheat by downloading the web module. Head over to the project home page at https://github.com/matryer/goblueprints, access the content for Second Edition, and look for the download link for the web components for this article in the Downloads section of the README file. The ZIP file contains the source files for the web component, which should be unzipped and placed inside the web folder. Now, our application structure should look like this: /answersapp/api
/answersapp/default
/answersapp/web
 Specifying modules To specify which module our api package will become, we must add a property to the app.yaml inside our api folder. Update it to include the module property: application: YOUR_APPLICATION_ID_HERE
version: 1
runtime: go
module: api
api_version: go1
handlers:
- url: /.*
  script: _go_app
 Since our default module will need to be deployed as well, we also need to add an app.yaml configuration file to it. Duplicate the api/app.yaml file inside default/app.yaml, changing the module to default: application: YOUR_APPLICATION_ID_HERE
version: 1
runtime: go
module: default
api_version: go1
handlers:
- url: /.*
  script: _go_app
 Routing to modules with dispatch.yaml In order to route traffic appropriately to our modules, we will create another configuration file called dispatch.yaml, which will let us map URL patterns to the modules. We want all traffic beginning with the /api/ path to be routed to the api module and everything else to the web module. As mentioned earlier, we won't expect our default module to handle any traffic, but it will have more utility later. In the answersapp folder (alongside our module folders—not inside any of the module folders), create a new file called dispatch.yaml with the following contents: application: YOUR_APPLICATION_ID_HERE
dispatch:
  - url: "*/api/*"
    module: api
  - url: "*/*"
    module: web
 The same application property tells the Google App Engine SDK for Go which application we are referring to, and the dispatch section routes URLs to modules. Google Cloud Datastore One of the services available to App Engine developers is Google Cloud Datastore, a NoSQL document database built for automatic scaling and high performance. Its limited feature-set guarantees very high scale, but understanding the caveats and best practices is vital to a successful project. Denormalizing data Developers with experience of relational databases (RDBMS) will often aim to reduce data redundancy (trying to have each piece of data appear only once in their database) by normalizing data, spreading it across many tables, and adding references (foreign keys) before joining it back via a query to build a complete picture. In schemaless and NoSQL databases, we tend to do the opposite. We denormalize data so that each document contains the complete picture it needs, making read times extremely fast—since it only needs to go and get a single thing. For example, consider how we might model tweets in a relational database such as MySQL or Postgres: A tweet itself contains only its unique ID, a foreign key reference to the Users table representing the author of the tweet, and perhaps many URLs that were mentioned in TweetBody. One nice feature of this design is that a user can change their Name or AvatarURL and it will be reflected in all of their tweets, past and future: something you wouldn't get for free in a denormalized world. However, in order to present a tweet to the user, we must load the tweet itself, look up (via a join) the user to get their name and avatar URL, and then load the associated data from the URLs table in order to show a preview of any links. At scale, this becomes difficult because all three tables of data might well be physically separated from each other, which means lots of things need to happen in order to build up this complete picture. Consider what a denormalized design would look like instead: We still have the same three buckets of data, except that now our tweet contains everything it needs in order to render to the user without having to look up data from anywhere else. The hardcore relational database designers out there are realizing what this means by now, and it is no doubt making them feel uneasy. Following this approach means that: Data is repeated—AvatarURL in User is repeated as UserAvatarURL in the tweet (waste of space, right?) If the user changes their AvatarURL, UserAvatarURL in the tweet will be out of date Database design, at the end of the day, comes down to physics. We are deciding that our tweet is going to be read far more times than it is going to be written, so we'd rather take the pain up-front and take a hit in storage. There's nothing wrong with repeated data as long as there is an understanding about which set is the master set and which is duplicated for speed. Changing data is an interesting topic in itself, but let's think about a few reasons why we might be OK with the trade-offs. Firstly, the speed benefit to reading tweets is probably worth the unexpected behavior of changes to master data not being reflected in historical documents; it would be perfectly acceptable to decide to live with this emerged functionality for that reason. Secondly, we might decide that it makes sense to keep a snapshot of data at a specific moment in time. For example, imagine if someone tweets asking whether people like their profile picture. If the picture changed, the tweet context would be lost. For a more serious example, consider what might happen if you were pointing to a row in an Addresses table for an order delivery and the address later changed. Suddenly, the order might look like it was shipped to a different place. Finally, storage is becoming increasingly cheaper, so the need for normalizing data to save space is lessened. Twitter even goes as far as copying the entire tweet document for each of your followers. 100 followers on Twitter means that your tweet will be copied at least 100 times, maybe more for redundancy. This sounds like madness to relational database enthusiasts, but Twitter is making smart trade-offs based on its user experience; they'll happily spend a lot of time writing a tweet and storing it many times to ensure that when you refresh your feed, you don't have to wait very long to get updates. If you want to get a sense of the scale of this, check out the Twitter API and look at what a tweet document consists of. It's a lot of data. Then, go and look at how many followers Lady Gaga has. This has become known in some circles as "the Lady Gaga problem" and is addressed by a variety of different technologies and techniques that are out of the scope of this article. Now that we have an understanding of good NoSQL design practices, let's implement the types, functions, and methods required to drive the data part of our API. Entities and data access To persist data in Google Cloud Datastore, we need a struct to represent each entity. These entity structures will be serialized and deserialized when we save and load data through the datastore API. We can add helper methods to perform the interactions with the data store, which is a nice way to keep such functionality physically close to the entities themselves. For example, we will model an answer with a struct called Answer and add a Create method that in turn calls the appropriate function from the datastore package. This prevents us from bloating our HTTP handlers with lots of data access code and allows us to keep them clean and simple instead. One of the foundation blocks of our application is the concept of a question. A question can be asked by a user and answered by many. It will have a unique ID so that it is addressable (referable in a URL), and we'll store a timestamp of when it was created. type Question struct 
{
  Key          *datastore.Key `json:"id" datastore:"-"`
  CTime        time.Time      `json:"created"`
  Question     string         `json:"question"`
  User         UserCard       `json:"user"`
  AnswersCount int            `json:"answers_count"`
}
 The UserCard struct represents a denormalized User entity, both of which we'll add later. You can import the datastore package in your Go project using this: import "google.golang.org/appengine/datastore" It's worth spending a little time understanding the datastore.Key type. Keys in Google Cloud Datastore Every entity in Datastore has a key, which uniquely identifies it. They can be made up of either a string or an integer depending on what makes sense for your case. You are free to decide the keys for yourself or let Datastore automatically assign them for you; again, your use case will usually decide which is the best approach to take Keys are created using datastore.NewKey and datastore.NewIncompleteKey functions and are used to put and get data into and out of Datastore via the datastore.Get and datastore.Put functions. In Datastore, keys and entity bodies are distinct, unlike in MongoDB or SQL technologies, where it is just another field in the document or record. This is why we are excluding Key from our Question struct with the datastore:"-" field tag. Like the json tags, this indicates that we want Datastore to ignore the Key field altogether when it is getting and putting data. Keys may optionally have parents, which is a nice way of grouping associated data together and Datastore makes certain assurances about such groups of entities, which you can read more about in the Google Cloud Datastore documentation online. Putting data into Google Cloud Datastore Before we save data into Datastore, we want to ensure that our question is valid. Add the following method underneath the Question struct definition: func (q Question) OK() error 
{
  if len(q.Question) < 10 
  {
    return errors.New("question is too short")
  }
  return nil
}
 The OK function will return an error if something is wrong with the question, or else it will return nil. In this case, we just check to make sure the question has at least 10 characters. To persist this data in the data store, we are going to add a method to the Question struct itself. At the bottom of questions.go, add the following code: func (q *Question) Create(ctx context.Context) error {
  log.Debugf(ctx, "Saving question: %s", q.Question)
  if q.Key == nil {
    q.Key = datastore.NewIncompleteKey(ctx, "Question", nil)
  }
  user, err := UserFromAEUser(ctx)
  if err != nil {
    return err
  }
  q.User = user.Card()
  q.CTime = time.Now()
  q.Key, err = datastore.Put(ctx, q.Key, q)
  if err != nil {
    return err
  }
  return nil
}
 The Create method takes a pointer to Question as the receiver, which is important because we want to make changes to the fields. If the receiver was (q Question)—without *, we would get a copy of the question rather than a pointer to it, and any changes we made to it would only affect our local copy and not the original Question struct itself. The first thing we do is use log (from the google.golang.org/appengine/log package) to write a debug statement saying we are saving the question. When you run your code in a development environment, you will see this appear in the terminal; in production, it goes into a dedicated logging service provided by Google Cloud Platform. If the key is nil (that means this is a new question), we assign an incomplete key to the field, which informs Datastore that we want it to generate a key for us. The three arguments we pass are context.Context (which we must pass to all datastore functions and methods), a string describing the kind of entity, and the parent key; in our case, this is nil. Once we know there is a key in place, we call a method (which we will add later) to get or create User from an App Engine user and set it to the question and then set the CTime field (created time) to time.Now—timestamping the point at which the question was asked. One we have our Question function in good shape, we call datastore.Put to actually place it inside the data store. As usual, the first argument is context.Context, followed by the question key and the question entity itself. Since Google Cloud Datastore treats keys as separate and distinct from entities, we have to do a little extra work if we want to keep them together in our own code. The datastore.Put method returns two arguments: the complete key and error. The key argument is actually useful because we're sending in an incomplete key and asking the data store to create one for us, which it does during the put operation. If successful, it returns a new datastore.Key object to us, representing the completed key, which we then store in our Key field in the Question object. If all is well, we return nil. Add another helper to update an existing question: func (q *Question) Update(ctx context.Context) error 
{
  if q.Key == nil {
    q.Key = datastore.NewIncompleteKey(ctx, "Question", nil)
  }
  var err error
  q.Key, err = datastore.Put(ctx, q.Key, q)
  if err != nil {
    return err
  }
  return nil
}
 This method is very similar except that it doesn't set the CTime or User fields, as they will already have been set. Reading data from Google Cloud Datastore Reading data is as simple as putting it with the datastore.Get method, but since we want to maintain keys in our entities (and datastore methods don't work like that), it's common to add a helper function like the one we are going to add to questions.go: func GetQuestion(ctx context.Context, key *datastore.Key)
(*Question, error) 
{
  var q Question
  err := datastore.Get(ctx, key, &q)
  if err != nil {
    return nil, err
  }
  q.Key = key
  return &q, nil
}
 The GetQuestion function takes context.Context and the datastore.Key method of the question to get. It then does the simple task of calling datastore.Get and assigning the key to the entity before returning it. Of course, errors are handled in the usual way. This is a nice pattern to follow so that users of your code know that they never have to interact with datastore.Get and datastore.Put directly but rather use the helpers that can ensure the entities are properly populated with the keys (along with any other tweaks that they might want to do before saving or after loading).

CDT October 23, 2016 CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST Harry Potter, Anthony Bourdain, Superman, Bill Simmons and Charles Barkley are all going to work for a phone company. AT&T’s planned $85.4 billion acquisition of Time Warner, the New York-based company that owns HBO, CNN, TNT and Warner Bros. film studio, is a huge domino falling in the content business. The deal, which creates a media powerhouse and comes with promises of innovation and cost-savings, will make competitors in the wireless and Internet space like T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon uneasy. The move could also set off a new wave of telecommunications companies and Internet giants, such as Google and Apple, buying or making deals with popular content programmers, further blurring the boundaries among the industries. In fact, Apple has been rumored for months to be a potential acquirer of Time Warner. And Google's interest in buying more premium entertainment content, such as the right to stream NFL games, has been widely reported. Other cable network operators that also could be potential takeover targets, to name a few, include: AMC Networks, best-known for its top-rated TV show The Walking Dead but which also owns BBC America and SundanceTV; and Discovery Communications, which owns and operates Discovery Channel, The Learning Channel, Animal Planet and OWN, in a joint venture network with Oprah Winfrey. The merger, which marries partners in distribution and content, will surely trigger multiple layers of complexity for customers, industry regulators, investors and consumer watchdogs as they sort out revenue possibilities and conflicts of interest. But competitors of Time Warner or AT&T can no longer to afford to stand by idly. Time Warner’s Chairman and CEO Jeff Bewkes intimated as much, saying the deal was partly to get ahead of competitors. “You’re going to see all kinds of distributors following,” he said in a press conference call with reporters Saturday night. “And you’re going to see a kind of revolution in the TV world.” Telecom providers have been shopping for content companies to acquire as their wireless smartphone and broadband Internet service markets mature. "As upside from data usage seems to be increasingly capped, we would not be surprised if other distributors were to potentially embrace larger opportunities in the content arena over time," said Barclays Equity Research analysts Kannan Venkateshwar and Amir Rozwadowski in a recent note to investors. Ownership of Time Warner’s content – including Harry Potter movies, DC Entertainment films, whose franchises include Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman, CNN, NBA basketball on TNT, MLB baseball on TBS, and HBO’s critically acclaimed shows, like Game of Thrones -- guarantees that AT&T can make those programs available on its DirecTV satellite TV service. AT&T can also stream those shows to its Net-delivered and wireless DirecTV-branded streaming services in the works. AT&T bought DirecTV last year for $48.5 billion. With more consumers streaming on their mobile devices, Bewkes, whose company had been wooed by others, pulled the trigger on the deal largely because he was drawn to the idea of delivering his content to consumers on “a multiplatform basis,” he said. Beyond that, AT&T also gets revenue by licensing those movies and TV series to other pay-TV providers and subscription Net TV services such as Netflix.  "Video and entertainment will remain the key driver for the future of consumer-oriented services," said Brett Sappington, senior director of research at Parks Associates. "Video, virtual reality, and other entertainment experiences are data hungry. They will be the experiences that push consumers to higher tiers of broadband or mobile data." Owning content also helps pay-TV providers to avoid costly conflicts over the escalating prices they pay to carry programming, he said. "With content costs continuing to increase, operators are expecting more such conflicts in the future. So, ensuring access to popular content certainly helps AT&T," Sappington said. Moreover, Time Warner's networks, particularly HBO and TNT, fetch some of the highest fees for pay-TV providers. After closing the acquisition, AT&T-DirecTV will not have to pay for Time Warner's content and will be in position to dictate the financial and legal terms of Time Warner's negotiations with other cable competitors. Comcast's acquisition of NBC Universal in 2011 foreshadowed AT&T-Time Warner deal. And regulators’ approval of the deal and Comcast’s continued profitability from its business diversity have emboldened its pay-TV competitors. Since then, Comcast also acquired DreamWorks Animation in April for $3.8 billion. Verizon's announced July purchase of Yahoo for $4.83 billion -- and its May 2015 $4.4 billion deal for AOL -- involved content, as well as Internet advertising, making it "a case of buying what it needed to better monetize the data its network produces," said analyst Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research. "Any media company without a controlling shareholder and other than Disney (because of size) could be a target," Wieser said. CBS and Viacom, despite the recent turmoil surrounding management, could be targets. The controlling shareholders of both companies – principally, billionaire media mogul Sumner Redstone and his daughter, Shari Redstone – have called on the two companies to merge. With a combined market cap of more than $40 billion, a CBS-Viacom would hold not only CBS' various networks including Showtime, but also Viacom's assets such as Paramount, BET, Comedy Central, MTV and VH1. If the merger occurs, it would possess the No. 1 primetime broadcast network and collectively the most number of cable TV viewers. Other standalone media companies, such as AMC, Discovery and Scripps, which owns HGTV and Food Network, will be constant subjects of merger speculation. Meanwhile, Time Warner, until the acquisition is closed, could continue to be the subject of a possible bidding war. But only a few companies have the financial wherewithal to pull it off. "It seems unlikely at the price AT&T is offering,” Wieser said. As the telecom-media landscape turns, regulators will have their hands full. AT&T's Chairman and CEO Randall Stephenson told reporters that he doesn't see difficulty in passing regulatory muster since he's buying a "supplier," or in business parlance, a deal of "vertical integration." Anti-trust regulators have been typically more concerned with horizontal integration deals, in which a company buys a rival and gain greater market share. Still, given the size of the deal, regulators will hardly rubber-stamp their approval. They did put some conditions on Comcast's acquisition of NBC Universal -- a similar case of vertical integration -- and the same would likely happen here, Sappington says. "The fact that AT&T is not one of the two largest pay-TV providers in the U.S. market will help," he said. "It makes it more difficult for opponents to claim a monopolistic advantage for AT&T in this merger."

Google has rolled out yet another algorithm change that is having a major impact on local business search results and rankings. Google hasn’t officially named the update yet, so the search engine optimization community did the honors. In the alliterative tradition of previous updates such as Panda, Penguin and Pidgeon, SEO experts have dubbed this one Possum to reflect the many hidden listings that have resulted. In this update, the searcher’s location, as pinpointed by GPS on mobile devices, is a primary ranking signal to determine how high on the business listing will appear on the results page. Search results previously centered on the location of the business and how well the business listings optimized for that location. You’ve Been Filtered What will Possum mean for businesses? As always, there will be winners and losers. Google believes users want to see the search results closest to where they are at that moment. Businesses on the outskirts of a city or in the suburbs, previously slighted in the search results because of their out-of-the-way location, will benefit from Possum. The losers may be those multi-location businesses who invested time and energy in creating multiple Google My Business listings for each individual entity in the business — for example, a law firm with multiple lawyers. In an effort to merge local and organic ranking signals, Google now is filtering similar results for the same address to eliminate multiple citations. The listings didn’t just drop a few positions, either. They are simply nowhere to be found in the search results, although the listings remain active. In addition, businesses with a wider geographical target may see a drop in rankings because customers will see more results from businesses closer to their location. For example, if your business was located in Hiawatha but you wanted customers from Iowa City, previously you could rank for searches in those areas by including that location in your website content and metadata. Today, searchers in Iowa City are likely to see Iowa City businesses in the search results first, regardless of how well a website located in Cedar Rapids has optimized for Iowa City customers. Surviving Possum Each Google algorithm change usually takes a few months to play out. At this time, here are a few recommendations for businesses. For those multi-business locations, SEO experts recommend businesses retain only on the most relevant Google listings and removing the rest. Businesses can include information about individual contributors on their main Google My Business page description section. Businesses that need traffic from outside their immediate geographic area may need to beef up their marketing mix to include stronger directory listings, more targeted advertising, social media and pay-per-click campaigns. Possum is just one more critter to add to Google’s menagerie of algorithmic changes that businesses will need to tame. Location is more important now — but it is not the only signal. You still have to take care of the basics when creating your online presence. Strong content, sound website development and good on-page optimization as well as off-page citations such as reviews, directory listings and quality links all contribute to great online visibility.

Time Warner’s Chairman and CEO Jeff Bewkes intimated as much, saying the deal was partly to get ahead of competitors. “You’re going to see all kinds of distributors following,” he said in a press conference call with reporters Saturday night. “And you’re going to see a kind of revolution in the TV world.” In this June 18, 2014 file photo, Jeff Bewkes, Chairman and CEO of Time Warner, attends the Cannes Lions 2014, 61st International Advertising Festival in Cannes, France.

"As upside from data usage seems to be increasingly capped, we would not be surprised if other distributors were to potentially embrace larger opportunities in the content arena over time," said Barclays analysts Kannan Venkateshwar and Amir Rozwadowski in a recent note to investors. Ownership of Time Warner’s content – including Harry Potter movies, CNN, NBA basketball on TNT, MLB baseball on TBS, HBO’s critically acclaimed shows, and DC Entertainment films, whose franchises include Superman, Batman and Wonder Woman -- guarantees that AT&T can readily make those programs available on its DirecTV satellite TV service without cumbersome negotiations. AT&T can also stream those shows to its Net-delivered and wireless DirecTV-branded streaming services in the works -- and even waive monthly data limits for AT&T smartphone and Internet customers. AT&T bought DirecTV last year for $48.5 billion.

Beyond that, AT&T also gets revenue by licensing those movies and TV series to other pay-TV providers and subscription Net TV services such as Netflix.  "Video and entertainment will remain the key driver for the future of consumer-oriented services," said Brett Sappington, senior director of research at Parks Associates. "Video, virtual reality, and other entertainment experiences are data hungry. They will be the experiences that push consumers to higher tiers of broadband or mobile data." Owning content also helps pay-TV providers to avoid costly conflicts over the escalating prices they pay to carry programming, he said. And Time Warner's networks, particularly HBO and TNT, fetch some of the highest fees for pay-TV providers. After closing the acquisition, AT&T-DirecTV will dictate financial and legal terms of Time Warner's negotiations with other cable competitors. "With content costs continuing to increase, operators are expecting more such conflicts in the future. So, ensuring access to popular content certainly helps AT&T," Sappington said. Comcast's acquisition of NBC Universal in 2011 foreshadowed AT&T-Time Warner deal. And regulators’ approval of the deal and Comcast’s continued profitability from its business diversity have emboldened pay-TV competitors. Verizon's announced July purchase of Yahoo for $4.8 billion -- and its May 2015 $4.4 billion deal for AOL -- involved content, as well as Internet advertising, making it "a case of buying what it needed to better monetize the data its network produces," said analyst Brian Wieser of Pivotal Research. "Any media company without a controlling shareholder and other than Disney (because of size) could be a target," Wieser said. CBS Corp. and Viacom, despite the recent turmoil surrounding Viacom's management, could be targets. The controlling shareholders of both companies – principally, billionaire media mogul Sumner Redstone and his daughter, Shari Redstone – have called on the two companies to merge. With a combined market cap of more than $40 billion, a CBS-Viacom would hold not only CBS' various networks including Showtime, but also Viacom's assets such as Paramount, BET, Comedy Central, MTV and VH1. Other standalone media companies, such as AMC, Discovery and Scripps, which owns HGTV and Food Network, will be subjects of ongoing merger speculation. As the telecom-media world turns, regulators will have their hands full. AT&T's Chairman and CEO Randall Stephenson told reporters that he doesn't see difficulty in passing regulatory muster since he's buying a "supplier," or in business parlance, a deal of "vertical integration." Anti-trust regulators have been typically more concerned with horizontal integration deals, in which a company buys a rival and gain greater market share. Randall Stephenson, chief executive officer of AT&T Inc., gestures during a session on the opening day of the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, on Wednesday, Jan. 22, 2014. [Via MerlinFTP Drop]  (Photo: Chris Ratcliffe, Bloomberg) But given the size of the deal, regulators will hardly rubber-stamp their approval. They did put some conditions on Comcast's acquisition of NBC Universal -- a similar case of vertical integration -- and the same would likely happen here, Sappington says. "The fact that AT&T is not one of the two largest pay-TV providers in the U.S. market will help," he said. "It makes it more difficult for opponents to claim a monopolistic advantage for AT&T in this merger." The presidential election also could be a variable. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said he'd oppose the merger, if elected, saying "deals like this destroy democracy."

Who will win the AI wars? Rory Cellan-Jones, Oct 24, 2016, BBC We’re moving from a mobile first to an AI-first world.” That was how Google’s boss, Sundar Pichai, began a presentation recently, at which his company unveiled a range of new hardware products. He believes that the key attraction of both the new Pixel smartphones and the Google Home smart speaker is the company’s expertise in artificial intelligence as demonstrated by the Google Assistant. The search company believes that the vast amount of data it has collected over the years, coupled with its expertise in machine learning, will give it a head start in the coming AI battle. The company hopes that Google Assistant, a conversational chatbot or virtual PA, will soon be a key feature on all sorts of Android devices, not just those it makes itself. If Pichai has his way, we will soon be shouting: “OK Google,” to get all sorts of information and services. But recently came news that showed that the biggest player on Android may not be so keen on that idea. Samsung has announced that it is buying Viv, an artificial intelligence company started by the same people who created the virtual assistant Siri, and then sold it to Apple. Viv, according to Samsung, is “a unique, open artificial intelligence platform that gives third-party developers the power to use and build conversational assistants and integrate a natural language-based interface into renowned applications and services”. That appears to be a pretty good description of what Google is doing with its AI. And other technology giants are flexing their own AI muscles. Apple of course has Siri, Microsoft has Cortana, and IBM’s Watson has been around for a while and is beginning to make its presence felt in a number of commercial applications. Then there is Alexa, the AI at the heart of Amazon’s voice-controlled Echo speaker. Amazon has opened up the Alexa platform to outside developers, and there are already a few Alexa-powered devices out there in the market. Alexa is pretty good at understanding what you are saying, but not so smart at dealing with follow-up questions. And this is where Google believes its AI has an edge, saying its Assistant has contextual awareness that allows it to carry on a conversation beyond an initial question. The company gives as an example the query: “Who is the current British prime minister?” Try this out with Google, Alexa and Apple’s Siri, and all three will produce the answer: “Theresa May”. But follow up with: “How old is she?” and Siri says: “I’m afraid I couldn’t find anything on ‘How old is she?'” while Alexa tells you she does not understand the question. But the Google Assistant knows you are referring to Mrs May and comes back with: “Theresa May is 60 years old.” Of course, we are at the very early stages of this revolution, and much may change as each AI learns by doing. What is more, none of them has yet convinced a significant number of people that conversing with a smart device is really useful rather than a bit of fun. Both Amazon and Google are betting that this moment comes when we walk through the front door and say: “OK Google, turn on the lights,” or: “Alexa, turn up the heat in the hallway.” Now we know that Samsung and perhaps IBM’s Watson may also be competing to give us similarly compelling AI experiences.

Fear not: Lewis Hamilton pips Nico Rosberg for pole at US F1 Grand Prix Read more Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.09pm EDT 14:09 Preamble Lewis Hamilton continues to talk the talk when it comes to his championship hopes, but he must know that Nico Rosberg will have one glove on his first world title should the German win in Austin; his current 33-point lead with four races to go is recoverable but a 40+ lead with three left seems more than a stretch. It was vital then that Hamilton secured pole on Saturday at a circuit he so enjoys tearing around. Rosberg will start second with the Red Bull duo of Daniel Ricciardo and Max Verstappen on the second row. Then again, a quick look back through some of this season’s turning points is a reminder that pole position does not always translate to top of the podium, especially when Hamilton is on the front. The technical problems that have dogged his starts are always lurking in the background and should they surface at the Circuit of the Americas, his hopes of a fourth US Grand Prix win will be in serious peril. More importantly, the championship will be Rosberg’s to lose. Beyond the Mercedes drivers there is a whole field of action and plenty to look out for, most notably Red Bull’s timely late-season surge and Ferrari’s issues which leave Sebastian Vettel sounding a little more fed up with each passing session. Can Jolyon Palmer put on a show for Renault? Will Jenson Button be able to make an impact from the back? Will home-team Haas offer the crowd anything, at all, to cheer? We’ll soon find out.

And before you get any ideas, the answer is no, it doesn't double as a microSD expansion slot. Rather than a hidden feature, Google had numbers and letters engraved into the SIM tray. No, it doesn't lead to a stash of treasures. Where it leads to is Google's headquarters. That's right, Google engraved its own HQ's address at the back of the SIM tray. First reported by Android Police, the top of the tray has "1600 AMPHITHEATRE" inscribed while the bottom part has "MTN VIEW CA 94043." Venturebeat corroborates the report and revealed that aside from the Pixel, the Pixel XL also has a SIM tray with Google's engraved HQ address. When Apple released the Apple Macintosh/Macintosh 128k, which came after the Lisa and Lisa II, signatures from members of Cupertino's Macintosh Division were engraved on its case. Google could be pulling something of that nature with the Pixel and Pixel XL. Granted the handhelds' sizes, however, it would be hard to fit multiple signatures from people involved in their development and release. Hence, instead of the signatures, an address pointing to the HQ, which pretty much covers everyone that had something to do with the Pixel and Pixel XL, was listed. Google is yet to release a statement on why the address was etched at the back of the SIM tray. Phone By Google, Assembled By HTC Some believe that the engraved address is a way of reiterating that the Pixel and Pixel XL are indeed the signature "Phones by Google," which makes sense. But while Google tagged both handhelds with the said branding, it should also be noted that they both came off HTC's assembly line. The only HTC branding it has, however, appears on the batteries. Moreover, other major components such as the display, flash storage and mobile DRAM are from Samsung. The audio and NFC controllers are from NXP while the Wi-Fi controllers were sourced from another outfit. The Google Pixel with its 5-inch 1080p display is now out, off-contract, for $649. Its bigger brother, the Google Pixel XL that has a 5.5-inch 1440p display, retails for $769. Note that the prices listed above are for the Pixel and Pixel XL's most basic iteration: 32 GB. Getting the version with the 128 GB onboard storage means an additional $100. Both smartphones will be running on Android 7.0 out of the box but will have an Android 7.1 update.

Where text used to be bold and dark, which contrasted well with predominantly white backgrounds, now many websites are switching to light greys or blues for their type. Award winning blogger Kevin Marks, founder of Microformats and former vice president of web services at BT, decided to look into the trend after becoming concerned that his eyesight was failing because he was increasingly struggling to read on screen text. My plea to designers and software engineers: Ignore the fads and go back to the typographic principles of print.Kevin Marks He found a ‘widespread movement’ to reduce the contrast between the words and the background, with tech giants Apple, Google and Twitter all altering their typography. True black on white text has a contrast ratio of 21:1 - the maximum which can be achieved. Most technology companies agree that it is good practice for type to be a minimum of 7:1 so that the visually-impaired can still see text. But Mr Marks, found that even Apple’s own typography guidelines, which recommended 7:1 are written in a contrast ratio of 5.5:1. More elderly people are using the internet to stay in touch with relatives  Google’s guidelines also suggest a 7:1 contrast ratio, but 54 per cent opacity of display, which brings the ratio down to 4.6:1. Mr Marks, who has been named one of the Telegraph’s 50 must influential Britons in technology,  said the changes risk undermining the universal reach of the internet. “The typography choices of companies like Apple and Google set the default design of the web, and these two drivers of design are already dancing on the boundaries of legibility,” he warned on the technology site Backchannel. “If the web is relayed through text that’s difficult to read, it curtails the open access by excluding large swaths of people such as the elderly, the visually impaired, or those retrieving websites through low quality screens. “As we rely on computers not only to retrieve information but also to access and build services that are crucial to our lives, making sure that everyone can see what’s happening becomes increasingly important.” How easy-to-read is your font? The changes in typography have come about because, as web design evolved, the numbers of fonts, colours and background began to diverge from the original set of ‘web safe’ fonts which were deemed legible online. The rise in LCD technology and high definition screens has also allowed designers to use increasingly thinner fonts, which, while working on desktops, can be virtually impossible to read on smartphones or tablets. In recent years, reference guides such as the Typography Handbook have also steered designers away from too much contrast, claiming that traditional black on white typography strains the eyes, and made it difficult for people with dyslexia.   And many computers are now set to grow dimmer during the evening to avoid too much blue light after dark, which can keep people awake. But the US based Web Accessibility Initiative, which came up with the original ratio formula in 2008 to help web designers said too little contrast made web pages ‘confusing and frustrating’ Lighter fonts may work well on a high-definition desktop but not on smartphones or in brighter lighting conditions  “Choosing colours with poor contrast makes navigating, reading and interacting a real pain,” said a spokesman. “Good design means sufficient contrast between foreground and background colours. If it’s important enough to be clear. This is essential for people with low contrast sensitivity which becomes more common as we age.” But Mr Marks said that reducing the contrast risked alienating some users. “To arbitrarily throw away contrast based on a fashion that looks good on my perfect screen in my perfectly lit office is abdicating designer’s responsibilities to the very people for whom they are designing,” he said. “My plea to designers and software engineers: Ignore the fads and go back to the typographic principles of print. “You’ll be making things better for people who read on smaller, dimmer screens, even if their eyes aren’t aging like mine. It may not be trendy, but it’s time to consider who is being left out by the web’s aesthetic.” Dr Simon Harper, an experimental Computer Scientist in Human Computer Interaction and Information Systems at the University of Manchester, said: "Black text on a white background may convey a certain harshness, grey text, on the other hand, may convey a softer more friendly feeling.  "But for some, these design choices come at the cost of legibility, fatigue and comprehension. We call this a situational impairment, whereby the user is disabled by the device, design, environment, or context of use.  "Straining to see text will give many a disabling experience. In the new world of cutting edge digital design all of us will at some point become impaired.  "Making sure that controls are present to conform the design to the user, so that the user doesn't always have to conform themselves to the design - sometimes and impossible requirement, is the only viable option."

Photo / 123RF • Daniel Prince is Associate Director Security Lancaster, Lancaster University We often hear about the dark web being linked to terrorist plots, drug deals, knife sales and child pornography, but beyond this it can be hard to fully understand how the dark web works and what it looks like. So just for a minute imagine that the whole internet is a forest - a vast expanse of luscious green as far as the eye can see. And in the forest are well worn paths - to get from A to B. Think of these paths as popular search engines - like Google - allowing you as the user the option to essentially see the wood from the trees and be connected. But away from these paths - and away from Google - the trees of the forest mask your vision. Off the paths it is almost impossible to find anything - unless you know what you're looking for - so it feels a bit like a treasure hunt. Because really the only way to find anything in this vast forest is to be told where to look. This is how the dark web works - and it is essentially the name given to all the hidden places on the internet. Just like the forest, the dark web hides things well - it hides actions and it hides identities. The dark web also prevents people from knowing who you are, what you are doing and where you are doing it. It is not surprising, then, that the dark web is often used for illegal activity and that it is hard to police. Technical challenges Dark web technologies are robustly built without central points of weakness, making it hard for authorities to infiltrate. Another issue for law enforcement is that - like most things - the dark web and its technologies can also be used for both good and evil. Continued below.

So in the same way criminals use it to hide what they are up to, it can also help groups fight oppression or individuals to whistle blow and exchange information completely anonymously. In fact, Tor - "free software and an open network that helps you defend against traffic analysis" and a critical part of the so-called dark web - has been funded by a range of Western governments, including the US. A service like Tor, is global, in no one physical location, and is operated by no one commercial entity - which is typical of these technologies. Theoretically, the only way to intercept communications sent via something like Tor is to install a "backdoor" in the application everyone uses. A backdoor is meant to provide a secret way to bypass an application's protection systems - in a similar way to how people hide backdoor keys in flower pots in the garden in case they get locked out of their house. However, the use of a "backdoor" could also allow any governments - even oppressive ones - to intercept communications. Indeed, cyber breaches have shown us that any backdoor or weakness can be found and exploited by hackers in order to steel people's information, pictures and data. Exploiting the darkness Of course, none of this is new - criminals have always found ways to communicate with each other "under the radar". Mobile phones have been used by criminal gangs to organise themselves for a long time, and as a society we are comfortable with laws enabling police to tap telephones and catch criminals. Unfortunately, infiltrating the dark web is not quite as easy as tapping the local telephone exchange or phone network. Because the dark web is quite unlike the telephone system - which has fixed exchanges and is operated by a small set of companies, making interception easier. Even if tapping the dark web was a straightforward exercise, morally it is still fraught with questions. In the UK, the Draft Investigatory Powers Bill, dubbed the snoopers' charter, sets out the powers and governance for Law Enforcement over communications systems. However, the discussion of the bill has been impacted by the Snowden revelations which have demonstrated that society is not comfortable with mass, unwarranted surveillance. Surveillance society This public distrust has led to many technology companies pushing back when it comes to accessing users' devices. We have seen Microsoft take on the US government over access to email and Apple against the FBI when petitioned to unlock an iPhone of a known terrorist. And yet some of these same communications companies have been harvesting user data for their own internal processes. Famously, Facebook enabled encryption on WhatsApp, protecting the communications from prying eyes, but could still look at data in the app itself. For now, though, it is clear that we still have a long way to go until society, government, law enforcement and the courts settle on what is appropriate use of surveillance both on and offline. And until then we will have to live with the fact that the one person's freedom fighting dark web is another's criminal paradise. - The Conversation By Daniel Prince Email Print Get the news delivered straight to your inbox Receive the day’s news, sport and entertainment in our daily email newsletter SIGN UP NOW Loading Discover more Loading Loading Herald Services Book your ad Driven Photos for sale True Commercial Death Notices Public Notices Our Regional News Stories The Northern Advocate Northland news in briefs Toxic shellfish warning The Ministry for Primary Industries has advised the public not… Hawke's Bay Today Donald Trump sending people this way?

Technology Apple Science Cars Celebrity Movies Business Black Friday Holiday Gifts     Shortly After Wave Of Pixel Reviews Google Shares Have Soared To Highest Till Date Posted: Oct 23 2016, 10:53am CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, in News | Technology News     Google has not yet released its Pixel phone series but surprisingly the initial wave of reception given by blogs is very much optimistic. After the first wave of reviews released on the internet, today we observed Alphabet Inc’s stock opening to be $814.21. Throughout the day the stock continuously increased and reached such a level which the company has never before achieved. Don't Miss: Hatchimals Deals on Amazon.com Google’s stock reached $828.21 right at mid- day 02.20 PM. The value is the highest the stock has ever reached in its history. The stock closing value by the end of the day i.e.4pm was $821.49. Bloomberg believes the soaring stock price is because of the wave of positive Reviews for the Pixel devices. It seems like Google’s efforts in both software and hardware are actually paying off even though the phone hasn’t hit the market yet. Customers are most likely to get their hands on their devices around October 20.

With the arrival of Android L, the vast majority of the Google Applications are getting attacked by the Material Outline dialect. Material Plan Idea is about paper impact. The UIs and screens resemble sheets of paper stacked or lying one next to the other. This overhaul brings the really far reaching update inside the Android's most recent material outline rules. The upgrade begins with the new "compliment" play store symbol and proceeds all through the application with the unfaltering hues, some solid activitys, huge pictures and better uses of shadows and shading. The application is being taken off in stages, so you may not be the first to get the overhaul yet.

For the most part all the Google applications will be taken off for a couple of weeks in the wake of discharging. Give it a chance to come to you and you will soon get it and keep away from the issues in future by not having the weirdo rendition. What would you be able to expect later on? You can expect an immense deluge of Google applications being founded on this new type of innovation called Material Plan sooner rather than later.

Lasta Oct 23, 2016 | 10:56 AM Google Pixel XL is one of Google's two new flagship smartphones; the other one being Google Pixel. The search engine giant is trying to advertise these two new phones as "made by Google." The phones were launched and made available on October 20, 2016. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge was released earlier at February 2016. Specs In terms of size, Google Pixel XL is larger than Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge. Pixel XL is 155 mm in length, while Galaxy S7 is 151 mm. Pixel XL is 76 mm wide and has a thickness of 7.3 mm, while Galaxy S7 Edge has a width of 73 mm and is 7.7 mm thick. Google Pixel XL is also, expectedly, heavier than Galaxy S7 Edge (by 11 grams). Yes, I want Breaking Christian News Submit Google Pixel XL has an aluminum body and is glossy in some areas. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge has an ergonomic design with rounded edges and an aluminum frame that is streamlined. Both Galaxy S7 Edge and Pixel XL comes in three different colors; for the Samsung smartphone, the colors available are black, silver and gold, while the Google smartphone comes in black, silver or blue. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge has a waterproof design which makes it safe to use under 1.5 meters of water for at most 30 minutes. Google Pixel XL, unfortunately, is not waterproof. Google Pixel XL has a Snapdragon 821 quad core 2.15 GHz, while the Galaxy S7 Edge has a Snapdragon 820 quad core 2.15 GHz. Both devices have 4 GB RAM. Google Pixel XL also has two variants for internal storage, 32GB and 128GB, and Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge has three options: 32 6B, 64 GB and 128 GB. Display While Google Pixel XL is bigger than Samsung Galaxy S7, both smart phones have the same 5.5-inch screen size. Their resolutions are equal as well, at Quad HD resolution (2560 x 1440) and 534 ppi. Both phones also have AMOLED displays. Unlike Apple though, both phones don't have pressure-sensitive displays which help differentiate between a light press and a hard press. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge has a curved display which makes it look different from other top of the line smartphones. Camera Both Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge and Google Pixel XL has a 12 MP rear camera, but Pixel XL has a better front-facing camera at 8 MP. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge has a 5 MP front camera. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge has a larger camera aperture at f/1.7 while the Google Pixel XL has a f/2.0 aperture. Samsung has this feature to have better quality photos taken at low light. Unlike many high-end smart phones, though, both devices don't have dual lens cameras. Optical image stabilization is available in the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge but not in the Google Pixel XL. This feature helps make images less blurry and makes videos smoother. Battery Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge has a bigger battery at 3,600 mAh, while that for Google Pixel XL is 3,450 mAh. This means that Galaxy S7 Edge has a better battery life than the Pixel XL. Charging the Pixel XL is done through a USB-C port, while the Galaxy S7 Edge uses a microUSB charger. Both phones have fast charging capabilities. One feature that Galaxy S7 Edge has that Google Pixel XL doesn't is wireless charging.

The microphone is reportedly broken, but the company is quick to replace the faulty units.  ( Google ) Advertisement The Google Pixel is rolling out as we write, and reports are already piling up about microphone issues that are plaguing the smartphone. It looks like this is a year when manufacturers are inadvertently packing hardware mishaps into their devices. The main concern with the Pixel is that the microphone of the gadget stops working without notice. Tests are showing that the microphone is functional in most cases, but an unbeknownst reason causes it to fail, either right from the start or after some usage. A long Reddit thread is gathering users' experiences with the issue, and similar testimonials keep adding up. So far, it is unclear whether we are looking at a software or hardware problem. Techies are looking at hardware issues as the possible cause, since users have discovered that there are some tricks that can get the microphone to work in a predictable manner. One example would be turning the speakerphone on and off during voice calls which, some claim, makes the microphone consistently functional. Redditor CMDR_Crispies says that they had the same problem with the Nexus 6P, and speculates that the microphone issue could stem from noise cancellation going haywire. The Redditor also notes that his Google Pixel does not seem to pick up sound, except for the camera app, which works normally. It cannot be vouched that this trick will help every Google Pixel owner out there, but it is worth testing. Google says that it will offer replacement units to customers who are facing the microphone issue, so if your mic is failing more often than not, you might want to give customer support a call. Based on Redditors' experience, the company actually made good on the promise and was very prompt in sending exchange phones. "I ordered a replacement through them at 10:00 p.m. and had the phone in hand at 11:00 a.m. the next morning," Redditor wayfrae notes. Others were not so pleased to see how fast Google is providing replacement devices. "Your replacement is arriving before my day one preorder, " Redditor ujaku points out. Although this shows that Google is determined to offer quick support for some of its customers, it is understandable if others are feeling a bit left out. A Google community manager joined the Reddit discussion and is urging users to share their experiences in the thread. Did you face some microphone problems with your Google Pixel?

Home Partner Sites Contact Blog More October 23, 2016 by vishaldutia 5 Android apps you shouldn’t miss this week! – Android Apps Weekly Welcome to the 162nd edition of Android Apps Weekly! Here are the headlines from the last week: Google Play has updated their metadata rules to help apps be more user friendly. Some of the new rules include carpet bans on nudity, violence, vulgar language, and drug use. Along with the new rules, Google has released a new set of guidelines for apps to follow. Some of those includes a higher focus on what makes an app special, less keyword stuffing, and a focus on making the content suitable for a general audience. These rules have already gone live. The Elder Scrolls: Legends was briefly available in the Google Play Store this week. It’s upload was a mistake according to the developers. It’s actually a tablet test version of the game. For those who don’t know, Legends is a card dueling game similar to Hearthstone or Clash Royale. The difference being that this takes place in the Elder Scrolls universe. It’s still available on PC and has been for a while if you want to check it out. Google revealed the winners of their 2016 Material Design Awards this week. There were a few categories, including Charming Engagement, Focused Efficiency, Expressive Layouts, Creative Navigation, and Brand Infusion. The winners of those categories were Fabulous, Airbnb, Kitchen Stories, C Channel, and Asana, respectively. Everyone will officially receive their rewards at the SPAN LA conference later this month. Candy Crush is going to get a TV show. Reports say that the show will feature teams of two people who will be running around on a giant, interactive game board in order to play Candy Crush. It’ll be aired on CBS and the co-producing credit is going to Lionsgate. It’ll also appear during the daytime around the same time as The Price Is Right. There’s no word yet on when it’ll air, but it’s going to be interesting, that’s for sure. Google’s Pixel Launcher was launched on Google Play. The good news is that it’s there. The bad news is that you won’t be able to download it unless you have a Pixel device. This is very similar to how Google did it with Google Launcher. Thus, it’d be a surprise if this didn’t show up on more devices eventually. For now, it’s a good sign that it’s in the Play Store and Pixel owners will certainly get faster updates this way. For even more Android apps and games news, updates, deals, and releases, check out this week’s newsletter by clicking here. There you’ll find all kinds of interesting information that we didn’t have time for here. If you’d like, you can use the form below to sign up for the newsletter and we’ll send it to you every Sunday. Also don’t forget to check out the Android Authority app for even faster updates! Signup for our newsletter Email Address Android Weekly Apps Weekly Marsbot [Price: Free] Marsbot is the latest app out of the developers of Foursquare. This is a simple chat bot that keeps an eye on where you’re going and tries to recommend stuff you might like. Unlike Google Assistant which resides in Allo, Marsbot sends you actual text messages. That means you can communicate with it on whatever SMS app that you’re using. It uses quite a bit of battery if left to its own devices, but it otherwise appears to work pretty well. It’s worth a shot if you’re into that sort of thing. Download now on Google Play! The Bug Butcher [Price: $3.99] The Bug Butcher is the latest game out of Noodlecake Studios. This is an action shooter where your job is to kill bugs. The bugs also happen to be gigantic, deadly, and numerous. On top of that, the mechanics are an ode to the old arcade shooter “Super Pang” where you can you can only shoot upward. It’s an action packed experience with plenty of game play and no in-app purchases. It is experiencing some early bugs which should hopefully be ironed out over time. Download now on Google Play! Surfy Browser [Price: Free] Surfy Browser is a fun little browser with a solid set of features. Its biggest features include security and privacy. Thus, you’ll be able to lock your browser with a passcode to prevent people from getting into it and viewing your browsing history. You can also save sessions to lockable tiles so that you can pick up where you left off later. It works well enough when it comes to performance and it loaded every site we threw at it. It is an early release app which means there are likely bugs that you will find. It’s totally free to try if you want. Download now on Google Play! Plants vs Zombies: Heroes [Price: Free with in-app purchases] Plants vs Zombies: Heroes is the latest game in the world famous franchise. This one takes a more PvP perspective and you’ll be building teams of heroes that have various powers. You’ll then be dueling them against other players. There is a campaign that you can play through and there are tons of monsters to collect. It is a little bit of the same vein as other PvP titles like Hearthstone and Clash Royale, except without as heavy of a focus on card collecting. It’s not bad, though. Download now on Google Play! Wallpapers [Price: Free] Wallpapers is the other Google Pixel app that was released to the Play Store this week. Unlike Pixel Launcher, this one is available to pretty much everyone. Contained within are all of the Google Pixel wallpapers which you can set as your home screen wallpaper at will. It can also see the wallpapers downloaded to your device in case you want to switch back. It features a few extra functions for anyone who owns a Pixel, but otherwise it’s a fairly simple little wallpaper app. Download now on Google Play!

The Linux Rain Linux General/Gaming News, Reviews and Tutorials Toggle navigation Home About Contact Submit Tip/Article Categories Reviews News Tutorials Editorials Announcements Previews Upcoming Advocacy Overviews Netflix on Firefox for Linux By Andrew Powell, published 23/10/2016 If you're a Firefox user and you're a little fed up with going to Google Chrome every time in order to watch Netflix on your Linux machine, the good news is since Firefox 49 landed, HTML5 DRM (through the Google Widevine CDM (Content Decryption Manager) plugin) is now supported. Services that use DRM for HTML5 media should now just work, such as Amazon Prime Video. Unfortunately, the Netflix crew haven't 'flicked a switch' yet behind the scenes for Firefox on Linux, meaning if you run Netflix in the Mozilla browser at the moment, you'll likely just come across the old Silverlight error page. But there is a workaround. For some reason, Netflix still expects Silverlight when it detects the user is running Firefox, despite the fact that the latest Firefox builds for Linux now support the HTML5 DRM plugin. Sad face. However, there is a simple workaround for now by tricking Netflix into thinking you are actually running something like Google Chrome, by changing the browser user-agent. There's probably multiple plugins and methods for doing this, but I did it with a site-specific user-agent switcher called UAControl. If you install that add-on (or any user-agent switcher, but this one allows you to just target Netflix.com if you so wish), all you'll need to do is restart Firefox, head to Netflix.com and do the following: Click and hold the mouse button on the new UAControl button that should be in the top right of the browser (see image below) On the drop-down menu, click "UAControl Options for this Site..." You'll be brought up with a dialog window where you can choose three actions (again, see image below) Choose "Custom" and enter the following into the box: Linux / Chrome 53: Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Ubuntu; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/535.11 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/53.0.2785.34 Safari/537.36 Hit 'OK' a couple times until you're back on Netflix, refresh the page, and you should be good to go! You may have to let Firefox install the DRM plugin if it hasn't already, but it will prompt you automatically to do so. If it doesn't, check Preferences/Content and make sure "Play DRM Content" is checked. Enjoy! Current Caveats It seems to work as it should, but just occasionally I found Netflix video wouldn't play until I refreshed the page. Performance and CPU usage doesn't seem to be quite on par with Chrome for Linux when playing Netflix video either, but that may be due to optimizations that are yet to come for Firefox for Linux in regards to the HTML5 DRM plugin. Your mileage may vary of course, but importantly, it works generally. Who knows, by the time you read this article, the Netflix guys may even make the change and you won't need this workaround! But if you're currently encountering the annoying old Silverlight prompt on Firefox, this will work fine.

In fact, the Google Pixel only sports an IP53 rating which means that it technically isn’t designed to even withstand splashes of water. DON’T MISS: Everything we know about Apple’s exciting next-gen MacBook Pro Per the Ingress Protection (IP) chart, here’s how the Google Pixel stands up. It has a level 5 rating against solids which means: “Ingress of dust is not entirely prevented, but it must not enter in sufficient quantity to interfere with the satisfactory operation of the equipment; complete protection against contact.” With respect to liquids, it has a rating of 3 which means: Water falling as a spray at any angle up to 60° from the vertical shall have no harmful effect.” Put simply, you’ll definitely want to avoid taking your brand new Pixel into the shower or even bringing it anywhere near water without a protective case. All that said, some real world testing suggests that the Google Pixel may be more water resistant than its paltry IP rating would otherwise suggest. In a video posted to YouTube this week, we see a Google Pixel submerged under water for 30 minutes. Impressively — relative to its IP rating — the device survived the submersion and appeared to be functioning just fine. Now we still wouldn’t recommend anyone try this at home, but Pixel owners might take solace in the fact that a little bit of rain won’t wreak havoc on their device.

Daisy Ridley, Jennifer Lawrence and Shailene Woodley jumped, tumbled and fired off arrows as main characters in action franchises. In comedy, Amy Schumer, Melissa McCarthy, Tina Fey, Amy Poehler and Anna Kendrick headlined films. Yet, overall, men were still seen and heard about twice as much as women in the 200 highest-grossing films of 2015. The figures come from a new machine-learning technology developed by researchers at Google and the University of Southern California to analyze the role of women in film. The software, created with backing from the Geena Davis Institute on Gender in Media and Google’s philanthropic division, is the first to automatically measure how screen and speaking time in film and TV break down by gender. In the past, researchers fulfilled this task with time-intensive, manual hand-coding. The data show that, when the film had a male lead, male characters appeared on screen and spoke about three times more often than female characters in 2015. In films with both male and female co-leads, men still had far more speaking and screen time. And even in films with female leads — about 17 percent of the top-grossing films in 2015 — men had a roughly equal amount of screen and speaking time as women. Box office results That data is shown in graphs produced by the institute, in which each of the bars represents one of 2015’s top-grossing films. The amount of screen time and speaking time for women is shown on the left and for men on the right. The vertical line shows the average for all films in that year. The researchers also analyze the results by box office revenue. On average, films with female leads took in $89.9 million each at the box office, 15.8 percent more than the average take of films with male leads — a finding that the Geena Davis Institute says debunks “the idea female leads are not bankable.” Past studies have shown that women are vastly underrepresented in film and that this trend hasn’t changed much over the decades. But just adding more female characters isn’t enough, advocates say — female characters need to be given speaking parts and agency in film, not just appear as decoration. The Geena Davis Institute argues that film representations matter for what women accomplish in the real world. For example, the group notes that the participation of girls in national archery competitions doubled in 2012. It speculates that this was a direct result of media representations of female archers, including in “The Hunger Games” franchise and Disney’s animated movie “Brave.” There are more meaningful consequences outside of archery. Women in film and TV are less likely to be shown in certain careers, including as company executives, scientists, politicians or legal and financial professionals — and that lack of role models could affect girls’ career choices, the group says. The tool is likely to be used to look at other areas of unconscious bias and stereotypes in the media. Backers at Google have said they hope to use the new software to look at the diversity of media portrayals of scientists and engineers, with the hope of discovering how that might shape the career aspirations of young viewers.

The Rema Hort Mann Foundation announced today that eight artists will be awarded its 2016 Emerging Artist Grants. They will each receive $10,000 in recognition of their “critical and rigorous work in the field of contemporary art.” The grantees are Genesis Belanger, Teto Elsiddique, Anna Glantz, Joiri Minaya, Azikiwe Mohammed, Sara Murphy, Sondra Perry, and Adrianne Rubinstein. The winners were selected from a pool of one hundred artists by a jury consisting of Matthew Higgs, director and chief curator at White Columns; Susan Hort, cofounder of the Rema Hort Mann Foundation; David Humphrey, a professor at Columbia University; Carolyn Ramo, executive director of Artadia; and Elisabeth Sherman, assistant curator at the Whitney Museum of American Art. Founded in 1995, the foundation was established by friends and family of Rema Hort Mann, who died of stomach cancer at the age of thirty, to provide support to emerging artists as well as cancer patients. It has been providing New York City artists with grants since 1996 and also recognizes eight artists in Los Angeles annually. Past grantees include Mary Reid Kelley—who received a MacArthur ‘Genius’ Fellowship this year—Korakrit Arunanondchai, Keltie Ferris, Rashaad Newsome, Virginia Overton, Dana Schutz, Sarah Sze, Mickalene Thomas, and Kehinde Wiley.

She will take up the post on December 5. Robert Goudie, GRACE board chair, said that Siegel “brings outstanding academic achievement, a passion for contemporary art, a demonstrated ability to raise money for and manage significant projects, and a national perspective, relationships, and experiences.” He added, “She’s exactly the right person to lead us forward in our determination to become an even more impactful presence in the metropolitan area’s visual arts landscape.” Previously, Siegel has served as curatorial assistant at the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles, assistant curator of modern and contemporary art at the High Museum in Atlanta, and as the associate curator at the Contemporary Jewish Museum in San Francisco. In the spring of 2018, she will present an exhibition of works by the late artist Moira Dryer at the Phillips Collection in Washington, D.C. Siegel received her Bachelor’s degree from the University of California San Diego and her Master’s degree in modern art history, theory, and criticism from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. ► MORE “I am honored by this opportunity and look forward to getting to work. The chance to lead this dynamic period of growth and extend GRACE's already well-established reputation for quality is a compelling combination for me,” Siegel said. “GRACE has a rich history in the community. As the community grows—with the coming of Metrorail and extension of the D.C. metro area—so will GRACE.” The Silver Line project—a twenty-three-mile extension of D.C.’s Metrorail system—was initiated in July of 2014. Five new stations are being added to the rail service, four in Tysons and one in Reston. Phase two of the construction on the project is slated to be completed in the next five years, and the opening date of the Reston station will be determined by the Washington Metropolitan Area Transit Authority.

Brielmaier will be responsible for working with the museum’s curatorial team to organize exhibitions and artist projects, develop Saratoga and New York–based programming, contribute to research and scholarship, advise the institution on acquisitions, and to help fulfill the museum’s goal of strengthening the way in which it explores issues of identity and race as part of a $1.2 million Mellon Foundation initiative. Director Ian Berry said, “Isolde brings with her a deep knowledge of the art world, a global awareness, and strong scholarship that will be invaluable as we continue to grow our collection and expand our focus to include a broad range of artists and types of programming. We’re very excited to welcome Isolde to the Tang.” ► MORE Previously, Brielmaier taught at numerous institutions, including Vassar College and Columbia University, and has also worked for cultural organizations such as the Guggenheim Museum, the New Museum, the Bronx Museum of Art, and the Savannah College of Art and Design’s Museum of Art. Brielmaier has published the first monographs on photographers Zwelethu Mthethwa (2010) and Hector Acebes (2004), and is the recipient of fellowships from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, the Ford Foundation, and the Social Science Research Council. “The team at the Tang understands the role art can play in parsing out contemporary issues, and has a track record of opening conversations about these issues through a range of different programs,” Brielmaier said. “I am very much looking forward to building upon its great history of innovation and creativity.” LESS Permalink Comments November 14, 2016 Orlando Announces Plans to Turn Pulse Nightclub Into a Memorial Pulse nightclub in Orlando, Florida. Photo: Chris O’Meara The city of Orlando has announced plans to purchase Pulse, the nightclub where a gunman killed forty-nine people and injured dozens of others this summer in the deadliest mass shooting in US history, and turn it into a memorial, Marc Santora of the New York Times reports. In the early morning hours of June 12, Omar Mir Seddique Mateen entered the gay club during Latin night and terrorized people for more than three hours until he was fatally shot by police. Orlando mayor Buddy Dyer said the site “has great significance not just for the LGBTQ community and for the Hispanic community but for all of us that live and love Orlando.” He added, “I think it is very important that the city take control of the site.” The city has agreed to buy the building for $2.25 million, pending the city council’s approval. Dyer said that for the next twelve to eighteen months the club will be left the way it is “so that people from around the country and world that want to visit the site can do so.” Pulse has already been visited by scores of tourists as well as politicians, including Hilary Clinton, and the city said that it will work closely with the community to create the memorial.

Photo: Asor Cultural Heritage Initiatives Satellite images of heritage sites around the city of Mosul in Iraq show severe damage to ancient Mesopotamian cities, Kristen Romey of National Geographic reports. The ziggurat of Nimrud, a 140-feet high stepped tower made of mudbricks located in the former capital of Assryia, was leveled sometime between August and October. Built by king Ashurnasirpal II nearly 2,900 years ago, the large temple was a sacred site dedicated to the war god Ninurta, Nimrud’s patron deity. Ruins at the site of Dur-Sharrukin—a 740-acre city featuring a twenty-four-foot-wide wall and a royal palace containing monumental stone sculptures and reliefs—was damaged by Kurdish Peshmerga forces while digging defensive trenches between mid-October and early November. Experts suspect that ISIS looted the ancient city in 2015. The Islamic State has yet to publicly claim responsibility for the destruction. The terrorist group had previously destroyed the Northwest Palace of Ashurnasipal II and the Nabu Temple at Nimrud in early 2015. Experts are waiting for permission to inspect Nimrud, which was recently liberated from ISIS, but are concerned that the Islamic extremists may have left IEDs and other explosives at the site.

Winners of the prize will receive more than $30,000 for the creation of new works and more than $6,000 as an artist fee as well as the opportunity to exhibit their work in a thirteen-week group show. “Our ambition for this international Artists’ Award is to open up a significant new biennial platform for nurturing emerging global talent and to create discursive space for key issues for art, artists and audiences,” director Sarah Munro said. “At the core of this project is not an award ceremony but a commitment to talent development and dialogue with our audiences at a local, national, and international level.” The jury for the first prize will consist of artists Monica Bonvicini, Mike Nelson, Pedro Cabrita Reis, and Lorna Simpson. Permalink Comments November 14, 2016 Artist’s Heir Sues Prague to Stop Controversial Exhibition Tour Alphonse Mucha with the Slav Epic in the 1920s Photo: Mucha Trust 2016 John Mucha, grandson of Czech artist Alphonse Mucha, has filed a lawsuit against the city of Prague claiming ownership of the artist’s twenty monumental paintings after learning that they are due to tour Japan and China, Julia Michalska of the Art Newspaper reports. The large-scale canvases—some measuring over twenty-six feet tall—are part of a painting cycle that took the artist eighteen years to complete. Titled The Slav Epic, 1910–1928, the works, which depict the history of the Slavic people, were funded by US philanthropist Charles Crane and gifted to Prague in 1928 in celebration of the tenth anniversary of Czechoslovakia’s independence. Alphonse donated the works under the condition that the city would build a permanent exhibition space for the canvases. Mucha, who is president of the Mucha Foundation, said, “The canvases are huge and are very sensitive as they are oil and tempera on canvas. As such, any touring risks permanently damaging the art—particularly as some of the Chinese museums at which the Epic will be exhibited have never hosted exhibitions of Western paintings of such size and technical complexity before, and are unlikely to have the required conservation expertise to handle such works.” ► MORE Conservators are also alarmed by the decision to loan the works. Zuzana Poláková, a restorer of paintings at the Slovak Academy of Sciences, said, “The more Mucha is handled, the less Mucha there is. Works from Mucha’s epic have been exhibited abroad several times in the past and they have always needed restoration. Damage is caused by the repeated rolling and unrolling of the canvases and changes in climate.” The Association for the Conservation and Development of Cultural Heritage in the Czech Republic has also asked the country’s culture ministry to halt the tour citing the recommendation of a commission, which was appointed by Prague city council in 1936, that the works should not travel abroad again. In a complaint filed in April, Mucha claims that since the city failed to build a home for the works they should be returned to the artist’s descendants. Currently housed in the Veletrzní Palác, the works will have to be moved in December since the city’s lease on the building will end. Prague City Gallery, who is charged with the maintenance of the works, is spearheading the exhibition tour. The Slav Epic is scheduled to be exhibited at the National Art Center in Tokyo as well as Nanjing Museum, the Guangdong Museum, and the Hunan Provincial Museum in China. Gallery director Magdalena Juríková is also working on extending the two-year tour by negotiating contracts with the US and South Korea. Juríková, who says that World War I and World War II combined with a totalitarian regime have prevented the gallery from building a space for the works, is unconcerned about the risks of transporting and exhibiting the works in other institutions. “If these venues can display ancient art, Renaissance paintings, classic Modern art and other fragile works of art from several European destinations by artists such as Da Vinci, Raphael, Titian, Lorenzo Lotto, Rodin, Picasso, Léger and Dubuffet, they will apply the same care in showing works by Mucha—even if they are monumental.” The first court hearing is scheduled to take place on January 18.

Joel Kotkin and Marshall Toplansky This May 13, 2015 file photo shows Google's self-driving car during a demonstration at the Google campus in Mountain View, Calif. (AP Photo/Tony Avelar, File) By Joel Kotkin and Marshall Toplansky Posted: 10/23/16, 8:07 AM PDT | # Comments The consumer technology boom, largely responsible for a resurgence in California’s economy after the tech wreck of 2001, seems to be coming to an end. The signs are widespread: slowing employment, layoffs from bell-weather social media companies, the almost embarrassing difficulty of finding buyers for Twitter, the absorption of Yahoo by Verizon and the acquisition by Microsoft of LinkedIn. This is not to minimize the great things which have been accomplished over 15 years of massive investment in these technologies. Mark Zuckerberg founded Facebook in 2004, and is now worth some $55 billion, up $15 billion from last year. In 2015, more than 1 billion people globally used Facebook applications every single day. The “app economy” created by Steve Jobs and Apple is equally impressive. What would we have done with our free time if it were not for Farmville, Angry Birds and Pokemon Go? The tech boom has changed the face of wealth in America. Tech oligarchs, mostly clustered in the Bay Area, which dominates some 40 percent of employment in search and web publishing, now account for one quarter of the wealth of the Forbes 400 richest Americans. This tilting of wealth is not going away, and may shape the business world for a generation. Concentration and contraction Overall though, the economic impact of these technologies has been limited. Google’s Alphabet Inc. and Facebook Inc. together employ fewer than 75,000 people, one-third fewer than Microsoft, worth only a fraction its value. Snapchat, the star of Silicon Beach, employs several hundred people, hardly enough to reverse a long-term decline in Southern California tech employment. More troubling still are changes in the Bay Area tech culture. In its 1980s heyday, Silicon Valley was a Wild West of start-ups, new companies and ideas, and lots of jobs. Today, it resembles increasingly the cozy and fundamentally uncompetitive world of Detroit’s Big Three — Ford, Chrysler and General Motors. The Valley is increasingly dominated by a handful of companies — Google, Facebook and Apple — while conditions for startups, even well-funded ones, have deteriorated markedly. Despite the hype surrounding the possible IPO for Snapchat, new firms raised $15 billion in venture capital during the third quarter of 2016 — ending in September — down 28.6 percent from $21 billion for the same period one year ago. The third quarter of 2016 marked the fifth straight quarterly decline in completed financings and the lowest number recorded by PitchBook since the fourth quarter of 2010, signaling that investors are writing bigger checks for fewer deals. Rather than the Wild West, we are seeing consolidation in social media, which depends largely on advertising revenue. Google and Facebook claimed 64 percent of that revenue, according to Pivotal Research. Google scooped up $30 billion and Facebook gathered $8 billion, while other smaller companies have lost market share over the last five years. As promising start-ups are swallowed up at an alarming rate, the likely scenario, as we have seen in other industries, may be secular stagnation. With less competition and innovation, the track record of oligarchies, particularly regionally incestuous ones, is not a great one, as anyone who deals with new Microsoft or Apple operating systems, can attest. Even Sergei Brin, a co-founder of Google, recently suggested that start-ups would be better off launching somewhere else. Advertisement One door closes, another opens The preponderance of evidence is pointing to the end of the boom era in social media growth. Already, there are clear signs of slowing, with layoffs growing rapidly and more companies looking for space in less expensive, less highly regulated areas. Yet this shift from social media may prove a long-term benefit both to the national economy and California. The sad truth is that for all the billions earned in stock market value, social media, unlike past tech booms, has done precious little to boost economic productivity. According to the Pew Center for Internet, Science and Tech, 56 percent of workers who use social media platforms for work-related purposes agree that social media distracts from the work they need to do, with 30 percent agreeing strongly. Rather than thrilling tweens with their first Tweets, technology companies may be shifting to far more important callings. In the Bay Area and elsewhere, firms are delving into promising fields including autonomous vehicles, machine learning, artificial intelligence, financial technology, biomedical research and even space exploration. These endeavors do more than simply keep people entertained and informed about their friends. They may create the basis for longer-lasting growth in the productive economy, not only here in California, but around the nation. Will California be able to maintain its innovation dominance in this next tech cycle? The Golden State faces the twin headwinds of high housing prices and restrictive regulations. These growing technologies require interfacing with the analog (aka real) world, relying more on 30-something, experienced engineers and data scientists than the millennial hipsters and coders who have fueled social media and casual gaming. California needs to make housing affordable and lessen regulatory burden for business if it plans to lead the next wave. Joel Kotkin is the R.C.

Plenty of people have expressed their interest in both handhelds and most likely went on to grab their units when the devices got released a couple of days ago. However, a good chunk is still undecided. While early reviews for the Pixel and Pixel XL are now out, they only detail the software experience and the surface of the hardware that the handhelds have. A deeper look into the hardware would require the smartphone to be taken apart. iFixit did just that with its Google Pixel XL teardown. Going In From the Top Noting of the Google Pixel XL's design similarities to the iPhone, iFixit decided to open the device and expose its innards by first detaching the display. After a minute of heat, another minute for prying and a couple of screws, iFixit finally separated the screen from the rest of the phone. "The OLED panel separated from the digitizer glass a little too easily for our liking. Super-thin components and no frame or bezel behind the display make it extra sketchy to remove," writes iFixit. Further scrutiny reveals that the 5.5-inch AMOLED display is from Samsung, and the touch controller that comes attached to its back is a Synaptics ClearPad S3708. The Midframe With the display off, the midframe was exposed. iFixit comments that the slim magnesium frame is more bendy than expected and that it is clipped very firmly to the phone's body. iFixit's Google Pixel XL teardown reveals that the midframe houses an earpiece speaker and a ribbon connector. With the frame off, the rest of the components, including the matte-black motherboard, are exposed. Taking Out the Battery While Google tags the Pixel and Pixel XL with a "Phone by Google" branding, it's not a secret that both handhelds came off HTC's assembly line. However, HTC did not leave any of its own branding aside from the one found on the 13.28 Wh battery. The battery's cover has a perforated portion, which, when pulled, turns into convenient strip for taking out the battery. The Motherboard And Modular Parts After taking out the interconnect board, 3.5 mm headphone jack and 8-megapixel front-facing camera, iFixit got access to the motherboard but not before the fingerprint sensor cable was detached. At the front, the motherboard has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 SoC, along with a 4 GB LPDDR4 mobile DRAM from Samsung. Qualcomm's power manager IC, Quick Charge 3.0 IC and LTE RF transceiver as well as the NXP audio amplifier, NFC controller and Wi-Fi controllers also take up some of the motherboard's front-side space. At the mobo's back is a 32 GB UFS 2.0 chip from Samsung, the audio codec, antenna matching tuner, LTE RF transceiver and power amplifiers. Attached to the motherboard, just beside the 12.3-megapixel rear camera that is also attached to the mobo, is a mini board that houses the microphone. The miniboard is also home to the rangefinder that the XL needs for its laser autofocus. The Daughterboard And the Fingerprint Sensor The fingerprint sensor is housed by the rear case and, as mentioned, is attached to the motherboard via a cable. Also in the rear case is the daughterboard, which is home to a microphone and the USB Type-C port. "This is a pretty bare-bones part, which means cheap USB port replacements," iFixit writes in addition to its prior comment on how the daughterboard pops out with relative ease. Repairability Score The Google Pixel XL's repairability score is 6 out of 10. iFixit sees the modular components, the perforated cover that makes battery removal a breeze and the uniform T5 Torx screws of the handheld as its positive points. However, the sketchy removal of the display as well as the snug, fit notches that made the midframe removal laborious pulled the XL down in terms of repairability. Note that the iPhone 7 Plus was awarded a 7 out of 10. Below is iFixit's teardown video for the Google Pixel XL.

How Google's self-driving car project rose from a crazy idea to a top contender in the race toward a driverless future Avery Hartmans Oct. 23, 2016, 8:00 AM 56,751 facebook linkedin twitter email print A row of Google self-driving cars outside the Computer History Museum in Mountain View, Calif.AP Photo/Eric Risberg Google's self-driving car project was started in 2009 on one premise: build an autonomous vehicle by 2020.  Now, it's seven years later, and Google's test cars have driven two million miles in four cities around the nation and have learned everything from how to honk politely to how to sense cyclists and pedestrians.  But Google has also failed to commercialize its cars so far — falling behind competitors like Uber and Tesla, despite being the first company to put the cars on the road — and has lost some of its best talent to other companies in the industry. As Google prepares to spin out the project as its own company under the Alphabet umbrella, here's a look back at the company's progress in building the world's first fully autonomous vehicle. View As: One Page Slides Google launched its self-driving car project in 2009 under the leadership of Sebastian Thrun, a Stanford University professor who is lauded as the founder of the autonomous car. While at Google, Thrun led several projects at Google's X research lab, including Google Glass and Street View. Thrun has since left Google and is now the founder of education startup Udacity. Flickr / JD Lasica Source: Udacity Thrun first began his research on driverless vehicles at Stanford, leading a student and faculty team that designed the Stanley robot car. The car won a $2 million prize at the 2005 DARPA Grand Challenge for driving 132 miles in the desert on its own.

It hired a handful of people with perfect driving records to sit behind the wheel, a position it still hires for seven years later. Justin Sullivan/Getty Images Source: The New York Times, Business Insider Google's cars use GPS, sensors, cameras, radar, and lasers to "see" the world around them. The sensors on the car can detect objects up to two football fields away, including people, vehicles, construction zones, birds, cyclists, and more. YouTube/Ted Talk Source: Business Insider By 2010, Google's cars had logged more than 140,000 miles on the road. The company wrote in a blog post at the time that it believed it had the power to cut the number of traffic deaths each year by half.

Urmson later become CTO of the project. Reuters/Stephen Lam Source: Google As of 2011, Google had made the switch from Toyota to Lexus, installing its technology into a fleet of 23 RX450H SUVs. Mark Wilson/Getty Images Source: The Guardian Google announced it had turned the corner on its technology in April 2014, writing in a blog post that the test cars could handle thousands of urban situations that had stumped it in the prior few years. It was the company's first official update on the project since 2012. Google cofounder Sergey Brin.AP/Eric Risberg Source: Business Insider In May 2014, Google built its own car and showed off a prototype of it at the Code Conference. There were no brakes, no steering wheel, and no gas pedal — only a button to turn it on. The company capped the vehicles' speed at 25 mph and planned to make 100 to 200 versions of the car. Google Source: Google, Business Insider About a year later, Google started road-testing the prototypes in Mountain View. AP Photo/Tony Avelar Source: Business Insider In July 2015, Google began testing its self-driving cars in Austin, Texas, sending the Lexus RX450h vehicles equipped with autonomous technology to the city. Shutterstock Source: Business Insider In September 2015, Google hired former Hyundai and Ford executive John Krafcik as CEO of the project. AP Source: Business Insider Several reports surfaced in December 2015 that Google was partnering with Ford to work on self-driving cars. But the deal never materialized, and Ford went on to work on self-driving cars on its own. Ford currently tests fully autonomous vehicles in Michigan, Arizona and California, and will triple its autonomous vehicle test fleet this year to have the largest of any automaker.Ford Source: Business Insider In February 2016, a Google car got into its first accident: One of the cars hit a bus in Mountain View going two miles per hour. While the vehicles had gotten into various scrapes over the years, this was the first time one of the autonomous cars caused an accident. YouTube/Associated Press Source: Business Insider Google added Kirkland, Washington, as another test site in February 2016 due to the region's wet weather. Facebook/Visit Bellevue Washington Source: Business Insider In April 2016, Google began testing its cars in Arizona. Ahead of their arrival, Google sent four vehicles to Phoenix to map the area. Google said at the time that it chose Arizona because of the state's desert conditions, which would help Google understand "how our sensors and cars handle extreme temperatures and dust in the air." iStock / CraigStocks Source: Business Insider, Business Insider Google and Fiat Chrysler teamed up to work on self-driving cars together in May, with Fiat providing 100 Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans to Google for testing purposes. Chrysler Source: Business Insider The self-driving car project took a step closer to commercializing in August, when Google hired former Airbnb executive Shaun Stewart. Stewart specializes in building and scaling up businesses. AP Photo/Eric Risberg Source: Business Insider After more than seven years, Urmson left the self-driving car project in August, writing on Medium: "Now, 1.8 million miles of autonomous driving later, I've decided the time is right to step down and find my next adventure." Medium / Chris Urmson Urmson's departure was one of many for Google around the same period of time, including one of the project's other cofounders, Jiajun Zhu, who left for an unnamed startup. Another group that included cofounder Anthony Levandowski went to found a self-driving truck startup at the beginning of the year. In September, one of Google's cars was involved in a collision that sent the car's human driver to the hospital. Another vehicle came into an intersection in California at 30 miles per hour, running a red light and hitting the Google car's right side, effectively T-boning the car. The car sustained substantial damage. Twitter/grommet Source: Business Insider Google plans to make its self-driving car project — which is still housed under Google X — into a standalone company under the Alphabet umbrella by the end of the year. FlickrCC/OC Always Source: Business Insider At last count, Google's cars had driven more than two million miles in its four test cities. There are now 24 Lexus SUVs on the road and 34 prototype cars that drive up to 26,000 miles per week. But after seven years of work, there's still word on when the cars will become commercially available, while Google's competitors like Uber and Tesla have already debuted their cars to the public. One reason may be Alphabet CEO Larry Page's insistence on building a fully-autonomous vehicle rather than one that's partially autonomous.

But Elswood’s pupils were saved by alternative technology – free wireless connection via unused parts of the TV spectrum known as white space. It’s being provided by a consortium led by Google as part of a wider trial. Elsewhere in the country Microsoft is operating similar pilots. Both are racing to fine tune a technology that could ultimately bring cheap broadband to the entire continent. “Using white spaces will definitely be a more cost effective way to take Internet to the masses,” said Spiwe Chireka, an analyst at research firm IDC. Africa is the world’s last major untapped market for Internet access. Only 16 percent of its billion people use the Internet – half the penetration rate of Asia, according to the International Telecommunication Union. Most Africans who can access the Internet do so via mobile phones because few have the landlines that have been the means of connecting in Western countries. This has pushed broadband usage to 11 percent this year from just 2 percent in 2010. But mobile phone companies are reluctant to build costly masts and networks in remote rural areas – meaning hundreds of millions of Africans have little prospect of ever going online. Google and Microsoft are chasing this massive new market, aiming to provide white space Internet access to rural swathes with no coverage and in megacities where overcrowding and built up areas can mean frustratingly poor phone reception. Africa’s thinly populated airwaves – Zimbabwe, for instance, has only one TV station – make it ideal for this technology because of the abundance of available spectrum. Microsoft is running pilot schemes in Kenya, Tanzania and South Africa with the aim of launching commercial projects thereafter. Google is sponsoring trials in schools, including Elswood, across South Africa. While for both firms the logic of developing cheaper ways to access new customers is clear, the incentive for governments is also compelling. World Bank research shows that a 10 percent increase in broadband penetration can result in an extra 1.4 percentage points of annual economic growth. “This is really welcome,” said Patrick Muinda, a spokesman at Uganda’s education ministry. “We need as much bandwidth as we can get. More children are being taught computer studies as a subject and more computers are being purchased for use on e-learning platforms. This would just hasten that process.” HOW IT WORKS Television networks leave idle gaps between channels in order to protect themselves from interference from other networks. The technology uses these “white spaces” to transmit and receive wireless data signals. The adapted TV radio waves can travel up to a 10-kilometre radius, making them ideal for connecting off-grid villages. They penetrate walls better than mobile signals. And they’re cheap to provide: building a white spaces mast costs a tenth of the amount needed for a normal telecoms base station, said Arno Hart, project manager for the Cape Town white spaces trial being funded by Google. “It’s a great medium for … wifi hotspots anywhere, so that any population or demographic profile can have access to good affordable Internet,” Hart said. Local Internet service providers are helping: In Tanzania Microsoft has partnered with UhuruOne to provide connection to students at the University of Dar es Salaam. In January the project will be expanded to four universities, giving more than 72,000 students broadband access for $5 a month. In Kenya, Indigo Telecom and the United States Agency for International Development are working with Microsoft to provide wireless broadband to rural schools, a health clinic and government office in remote areas of the Rift Valley province. Indigo is currently providing free Internet to schools but plans to charge those living in the surrounding community $1.50 per month for connectivity in future. It has provided the infrastructure – fibre, masts and radios – while Microsoft supplies the software and applications. “We’ve started in areas that economically are not viable for mobile phone companies to start in,” said Indigo’s chairman Peter Henderson. “The strength of our operation is low cost of connectivity that lends itself to the areas that previously would digitally have been forgotten.” Vodacom, South Africa’s biggest mobile phone company, said it was following the technology closely. “It’s an interesting initiative. At this stage it’s not clear how it will be managed from a regulatory perspective, so it’s difficult to speculate on how it may impact the overall provision of connectivity,” spokesman Richard Boorman said. REGULATORS WATCH Governments have largely welcomed the technology though some officials have expressed reservations about whether it could affect or cross into bandwidth reserved for the military, emergency services and air traffic control. African regulators are also watching closely to allay concerns that broadcasters could be affected by interference, said Whitney Cubbison, communications director for Microsoft’s Africa initiatives. One country, which Microsoft declined to name, has warned that the process to change its regulations could take another couple of years. Google’s Cape Town trial is backed by the South African regulator, which is using the test case as the basis of future regulation, and has said Google can continue the project past its original September end-date. Regulators in Malawi and Senegal, countries with only a handful of broadcasters and plenty of available spectrum, have also expressed keen interest in the technology, Google said. Microsoft says it is in talks with 10 more African governments to start trials but will not say which ones or how much the tests will cost. “At this point, we feel there is ample proof that white space radios can coexist with incumbent licensees without any risk of interference,” Cubbison said. Back in Cape Town, schools participating in the trials hope everything works out. They are keen to hang on to their new, faster and more reliant Internet. “We don’t mind paying for it because it works for us,” said Paul Haupt, head of IT at The Settlers High School, a more affluent school in the Cape Town trial. “We’ve gotten used to a good service.” Tyler Jacobs, an Elswood 10th grader working on his homework during a break in a packed computer room, summed it up: “It makes life so much easier.” (Reuters) (Editing by Sophie Walker) By Helen Nyambura-Mwaura TAGS Africa SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleThailand braces for any backlash over world court’s temple ruling Next articleAfrican workers in Riyadh seek repatriation after two riot deaths The Zambezian. http://thezambezian.com thezambezian.com delivers latest Africa breaking news and information on the top stories, weather, business, entertainment, politics, and more.

President Elect Trump Addresses Nation; Secretary Clinton Calls Him to Concede Home » News » Google is the latest tech company to drop the longstanding wall between anonymous online ad tracking and user’s names Google is the latest tech company to drop the longstanding wall between anonymous online ad tracking and user’s names Sunday, October 23, 2016 - 04:08 Updated 3 weeks ago Special to HuntingtonNews.Net by Julia Angwin ProPublica, Oct. 21, 2016, 8 a.m. When Google bought the advertising network DoubleClick in 2007, Google founder Sergey Brin said that privacy would be the company’s “number one priority when we contemplate new kinds of advertising products.” And, for nearly a decade, Google did in fact keep DoubleClick’s massive database of web-browsing records separate by default from the names and other personally identifiable information Google has collected from Gmail and its other login accounts. But this summer, Google quietly erased that last privacy line in the sand – literally crossing out the lines in its privacy policy that promised to keep the two pots of data separate by default. In its place, Google substituted new language that says browsing habits “may be” combined with what the company learns from the use Gmail and other tools. The change is enabled by default for new Google accounts. Existing users were prompted to opt-in to the change this summer. The practical result of the change is that the DoubleClick ads that follow people around on the web may now be customized to them based on your name and other information Google knows about you. It also means that Google could now, if it wished to, build a complete portrait of a user by name, based on everything they write in email, every website they visit and the searches they conduct. The move is a sea change for Google and a further blow to the online ad industry’s longstanding contention that web tracking is mostly anonymous. In recent years, Facebook, offline data brokers and others have increasingly sought to combine their troves of web tracking data with people’s real names. But until this summer, Google held the line. “The fact that DoubleClick data wasn’t being regularly connected to personally identifiable information was a really significant last stand,” said Paul Ohm, faculty director of the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law. “It was a border wall between being watched everywhere and maintaining a tiny semblance of privacy,” he said. “That wall has just fallen.” Google spokeswoman Andrea Faville emailed a statement describing Google’s change in privacy policy as an update to adjust to the “smartphone revolution” “We updated our ads system, and the associated user controls, to match the way people use Google today: across many different devices,” Faville wrote. She added that the change “is 100% optional–if users do not opt-in to these changes, their Google experience will remain unchanged.” (Read Google’s entire statement.) Existing Google users were prompted to opt-into the new tracking this summer through a request with titles such as “Some new features for your Google account.” The “new features” received little scrutiny at the time. Wired wrote that it “gives you more granular control over how ads work across devices.” In a personal tech column, the New York Times also described the change as “new controls for the types of advertisements you see around the web.” Connecting web browsing habits to personally identifiable information has long been controversial. Privacy advocates raised a ruckus in 1999 when DoubleClick purchased a data broker that assembled people’s names, addresses and offline interests. The merger could have allowed DoubleClick to combine its web browsing information with people’s names. After an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, DoubleClick sold the broker at a loss. In response to the controversy, the nascent online advertising industry formed the Network Advertising Initiative in 2000 to establish ethical codes. The industry promised to provide consumers with notice when their data was being collected, and options to opt out. Most online ad tracking remained essentially anonymous for some time after that. When Google bought DoubleClick in 2007, for instance, the company’s privacy policy stated: “DoubleClick’s ad-serving technology will be targeted based only on the non-personally-identifiable information.” In 2012, Google changed its privacy policy to allow it to share data about users between different Google services - such as Gmail and search. But it kept data from DoubleClick – whose tracking technology is enabled on half of the top 1 million websites – separate. But the era of social networking has ushered in a new wave of identifiable tracking, in which services such as Facebook and Twitter have been able to track logged-in users when they shared an item from another website. Two years ago, Facebook announced that it would track its users by name across the Internet when they visit websites containing Facebook buttons such as “Share” and “Like” – even when users don’t click on the button. (Here’s how you can opt out of the targeted ads generated by that tracking). Offline data brokers also started to merge their mailing lists with online shoppers. “The marriage of online and offline is the ad targeting of the last 10 years on steroids,” said Scott Howe, chief executive of broker firm Acxiom. To opt-out of Google’s identified tracking, visit the Activity controls on Google’s My Account page, and uncheck the box next to “Include Chrome browsing history and activity from websites and apps that use Google services." You can also delete past activity from your account.   https://www.propublica.org/article/google-has-quietly-dropped-ban-on-per...   Tweet Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

Tuesday 15 Nov 2016 / Tehran - 03:28 / GMT - 23:58 Old FNA Old FNA                 Advanced Search Ar  | En  | Fa  | Tr Home Politico-Defense Politics  - Foreign Policy  - Defense  - Nuclear   Economy Society & Culture Society  - Sport  - Culture  - Art  - Life Style   Sci-Tech Space  - Nano  - Medicine  - Technology  - Earth   World Interviews & Commentaries Interviews  - Commentaries   Multimedia Photo  - Video   All Stories Technology Sun Oct 23, 2016 1:5 How to Install Android 7.1 Developer Preview on Your Device Tweet TEHRAN (FNA)- Google did something unusual with the announcement of the new Pixel phones. It also announced a new version of Android without even speaking about it directly. These phones run Android 7.1 Nougat, and now the first wave of Nexus owners are getting a look at the new software. Google has continued its Android beta program, so getting up and running on Android 7.1 is a snap, if you’ve got the right device. Android 7.1 marks the first time Nexus owners aren’t getting the full suite of upgrades from Google. The Pixel phones have some exclusive features, including built-in Google Assistant, the new Pixel Launcher, and fingerprint sensor gestures. However, not all of this is an arbitrary decision to add value to the Pixel. In the case of some features (e.g. fingerprint sensor gestures), there are hardware limitations in existing devices that prevent the feature from working. So, it’s not technically a Pixel-exclusive; there just aren’t any other phones that support it right now. As for what you can expect in the developer preview, there will be a handful of noticeable changes. For one, touch display responsiveness had been boosted. There’s also a new storage manager that helps you clear old files from your device to get more space for new stuff. Android’s launcher shortcuts, which were previously demoed in the 7.0 preview, are coming back. Although, now they are called “app shortcuts,” which might be the least descriptive name ever. They’re long-press shortcuts that app icons can produce to specific functionality in an app. For example, the camera icon includes links to take a video and take a selfie. To install the developer preview, you need to have a Nexus 6P, Nexus 5X, or Pixel C. Other Nexus devices like the Nexus 9 and (maybe) Nexus 6 will be added next month. The easiest way to to go to the beta site and sign in with your Google account. There, you’ll be shown eligible devices. Once you choose to enroll one, an OTA update to the developer preview will be pushed down in a few minutes. Doing this will not erase your data, but it’s a preview. Things could go wrong, so back everything up to be safe. If you want to handle the process manually, there are full system images available for download. This doesn’t require joining the beta, and you can install them even if you’re running a third-party ROM. You will need the Android SDK working on your computer, and your device’s bootloader needs to be unlocked. This will delete everything on your device, by the way. While this is technically for developers, plenty of enthusiasts are installing the beta too. It’s a pretty smooth process, and you can get a look at Android 7.1 before almost everyone else. Google is planning to have a final version of Android 7.1 available on Nexus devices by late this year or early next.         LATEST STORIES (4) Aerial Footage Shows Syrian Army Advances in Southwestern Damascus Syrian Army Missile Hits Militants' Gathering in Southern Aleppo Hashd Al-Shaabi Kicks Off 3rd Phase of Military Operations West of Mosul Anti-Trump Protests Continue across US Cities Spokesman: Iran's Missile Power Not Negotiable Tasting Justice: ISIL Being Driven Away in Iraq and Syria Iran, Russia Stress Boosting Mutual Cooperation Spokesman: AEOI Not Concerned About Trump Aides' Remarks Hashd Al-Shaabi Rescues 300 Sunni Families Battle for Mosul Day 28: Hashd Al-Sha'abi Kicks Off 3rd Phase of Mosul Operation Russia, Iran Plan $10bln Arms Deal Report: Russian Strategic Bombers Prepare to Strike Terrorists in Syria Samples Taken in Syria's Aleppo Prove Militants Used Chlorine Gas Syria: Jeish Al-Fatah Declares State of Emergency in Aleppo Iran Urges Unity Among Muslim Nations Aerial Footage Shows Syrian Army Advances in Southwestern Damascus TEHRAN (FNA)- The Syrian army troops continued to hit the terrorist groups' defense lines and gatherings and seized back new regions in Western Ghouta, tightening the siege of the militant-held town of Khan al-Sheih.

(Reuters) Bangkok, Oct. 22 (Reuters): Thailand's government met representatives from Internet giant Google, amid growing calls from Thai hardline royalists to bring those who insult the monarchy to justice, as many Thais look with uncertainty to a future without their revered king. King Bhumibol Adulyadej's death on October 13 has thrown the country of 67 million into mourning. It has also led to the rise of ultra-royalist vigilante groups who say they will punish anyone perceived to have insulted the monarchy during a highly sensitive time for Thailand. Deputy Prime Minister Prajin Juntong said he met Google representatives in Bangkok yesterday. Google affirmed in the meeting that it would continue to help the government remove content from YouTube, a Google subsidiary, that it deemed offensive, he said. "If any website is inappropriate they said to get in touch with them and inform them of the URL and the time the content was found," Prajin told reporters. That conforms with Google's practice around the world, Alphabet Inc's Google says. "We have always had clear and consistent policies for removal requests from governments around the world and we continue to operate in line with those policies," a Google spokesperson in California said yesterday. "When we are notified of content that is illegal through official processes, we will restrict it in the country where it's illegal after a thorough review." Thailand's military government said on Tuesday it was tracking people suspected of insulting the monarchy following the king's death and would ask other countries to extradite them. Some critics of the monarchy living abroad have been named and shamed in Thai language web forums. Outside the world of the Web, some Thais who have chosen not to wear black, the official colour of mourning, have been publicly jeered at.  More stories in International AT&T agrees to buy Time Warner for $85bn Dylan's Nobel snub 'impolite, arrogant' Court seals Mursi jail sentence Joking cops give breath test to toddler    Copyright © 2016 The Telegraph.

This can produce more interesting lessons than even digging into things like patents and whitepapers. For instance, I published a post last night, October 4th, 2016, on Context Vectors. On Twitter this morning, Dan Shure had a question about the snippet for my post, wondering why the snippet date was April 10, 2016. I knew the answer immediately. Dan’s Questioning Tweet: When I researched the post, and found the patent I wanted to write about, I used the WIPO Patentscope website to find the patent. I copied information from the WIPO pages, including the formatting of the Dates the patent was published and granted: I copied those dates into my post in exactly the same formatting found on the WIPO site DD/MM/YY instead of the way dates are formatted in the US MM/DD/YY: It appears that Google decided that it should take a lesson from the context of my blog post, and read the date of my post using DD/MM/YY instead of MM/DD/YY: Which answers the question that Dan asked about why Google decided that the date in the snippet should be April 10, 2016 instead of the date that it was actually published October 4, 2016. Google may have paid more attention to the context of date formatting than it possibly should have in that post. It does show that Google is paying attention to context, though. There were some others involved in a discussion of this anomaly this morning, and I wanted to give a shout-out to them for getting involved (thanks!): Aymen Loukil Steven Weldler Tylor Hermanson I’m not sure if it will help much, but I have changed the Formatting of the patent dates in the post about context vectors to the Americanized format of MM/DD/YY. Google is still showing a snippet date of April 10, 2016. Aymen Loukil suggested I try using DateTime Schema. It looks like that is aimed at providing information regarding sites that provide schedules, and Schema.org tells us that it is used on “Between 10 and 100 domains”. Nothing on that page seemed to explain how to explain the formatting used by Dates. Funny to learn about how Google might use context to format a snippet date based upon how the post the snippet is about may format dates within it. I decided to write about Dan’s question and its answer to keep it in mind and learn from it (I suspect we won’t see a patent just about how Google decides upon how to format dates in snippets. I’ve written some other posts about patents from the WIPO pages, and used the European formatting of dates from those. I should go back and look at the snippet dates Google may have given those… Facebook52 Twitter154 Google+15 LinkedIn105 Pinterest2 328shares Related Post navigation Previous PostGoogle Patents Context Vectors to Improve SearchNext PostKnowledge Panels in Site Audits 32 thoughts on “Learning SEO by Looking at Anomalies” Aaron Bradley says: 10/05/2016 at 11:39 am Hey Bill, FWIW I declare my blog posts to be of type schema.org/Article and then provide datePublished and dateModified in ISO 8601 date format (as per schema.org/Date). Google’s seems to understand this pretty well (though I’m not sure if it favors this structured data over in-post dates). Bill Slawski says: 10/05/2016 at 12:06 pm Hi Aaron, Thanks. I’m not sure I even thought about whether or not the formatting of the dates I included in my post from yesterday would influence the formatting of the snippet date that Google showed for my blog post. I have now learned that Google does pay attention to information like that, which is why I am sharing the information. We can see that Google may pay attention to the dates that are shown on a post, but might ignore the country of origin of the post when deciding upon the date format to use to interpret when those in-post dates actually refer to, if the post refers to dates that are formatted differently. I probably need to find other posts I’ve written that have included WIPO patent information, and see if the snippet dates showing for those also uses european formatting in snippets for those posts. If I had a site that published schedules for transit, I would probably want to find a way to format dates so that I was certain that Google understood the formatting I was using. Snippet dates, though? I wrote and published the post yesterday, which wasn’t April 10, 2016; I didn’t expect Google to change the date format that it had been using for most other posts on my site because I didn’t change the formatting of the dates I received from WIPO. Now I understand the risk of not doing so. 🙁 Maybe including the Structured Data information in addition to the in-post dates may be a good idea. Bill Slawski says: 10/05/2016 at 12:39 pm Hi Aaron, Thinking about this again, I wonder if I had the right structured data, and included European formatted dates from WIPO in my post if Google would choose the formatting it sees in the post over the information it sees in structured data. I don’t know which it would choose. California is a long way from Europe, so I don’t know why they decided to use european formatting. Cliff Sarcona says: 10/05/2016 at 3:40 pm Question: What exactly does this say about Google’s ability to track content within context? Would you say it proves that contextual backlinks are given more weight then say a random link posted without any content, or a link thrown in a side bar? Bill Slawski says: 10/05/2016 at 4:06 pm Hi Cliff, Thank you for sharing your questions. This patent describes a process by which a search engine can better index content found on the Web and assign contextual meanings to terms or phrases or words based upon finding those in a knowledge base such as an online encyclopedia, and assign a weight to the term(s) based upon how often it shows up in such sources. The combination of the contextual meanings (from different subject matter domains) and weights applied to those meanings is referred to as a “Context Vector.” The patent isn’t about links or backlinks, and doesn’t refer to contextual backlinks at all, so comparing it to a random link or a link in a sidebar isn’t a consideration here at all. The idea behind this patent is to better index content found on the web, and to apply contexts to queries when searches are performed to make it more likely that a searcher finds what they are looking for. Viva Traffic says: 10/05/2016 at 4:55 pm Out of curiosity, does a post with earlier dates typically rank higher? For example, 2012 vs a 2016 post, will the 2016 post rank higher being that its newer information, or is that not factored in with seo? Rasmita Sahoo says: 10/06/2016 at 2:17 pm Hi Bill, Thanks for this useful information, this will help a lot of beginners like me. Thanks Again. Bill Slawski says: 10/06/2016 at 4:13 pm Hi Rasmita, You’re welcome. If you do see something odd in Google’s search results. and you can capture a screen shot of it, do so. And then ask about it, in places like Twitter. It is a good way to learn. Sometimes you can catch Google experimenting on something, and it’s good to see that happening, too. Andrew says: 10/08/2016 at 11:27 am Interesting to see how Google really drills down to content/context and not just url/title/description/H1. Really need to be on your toes while writing anything these days! Bill Slawski says: 10/08/2016 at 6:07 pm Hi Andrew, It is interesting seeing how Google can get a sense of the meanings of words on pages, and the context of those words. If what you write is about something, in a particular context, it should be easier for Google to find it. I’m liking the idea of context vectors.

I have seen him on Twitter, and I am going to have to hunt down things he has written about Schema. Thanks! Alnoor Verjee says: 10/24/2016 at 3:51 pm Hi Bill, quick question – do you think implementing a date time schema would help in ranking newer content in any way or is it just for context purposes? Bill Slawski says: 10/26/2016 at 12:42 pm Hi Alnoor, I don’t think that a date/time schema would solve the problem I have with the format of the date the post was published being read wrong by Google. It probably doesn’t have any impact on the rankings of that page either. shamala says: 11/01/2016 at 10:42 pm Hello Bill, Thanks for this useful information, this will help me a lot. Thanks you.

Cristina Sliva says: 11/10/2016 at 1:47 am Thanks for sharing this blog, This blog is very useful for everyone. keep it on. Flypa says: 11/10/2016 at 2:00 am Does that mean if I publish a post in 2013 and update it in 2016, will that post show up higher in search results? Great post once again. Thanks Bill Bill Slawski says: 11/10/2016 at 8:00 am Hi Flypa, No, changing the dates on post that you made shouldn’t have any effect on the rankings of those posts. However, if Google notices that a post you wrote in the past starts getting a lot of new links pointed to it, it might take those new links as a sign that people are interested in the content of your post, and might consider it timely or evergreen. Bill Slawski says: 11/10/2016 at 8:02 am Hi Cristina, Thank you for your kind words – Good hearing that people are getting value from my posts.

Navigation gHacks Technology News The independent technology news blog Home Header Menu Home Windows Software Firefox Chrome Google Android Email Deals Best of Support Us Return to Content Google intensifies tracking: check your private settings By Martin Brinkmann on October 23, 2016 in Google - Last Update:October 23, 2016 46 Google made a significant change to the company's privacy policy recently which changes in a significant way how the company is tracking users on the Internet. Previously, the company kept its DoubleClick advertising engine apart from its core user services such as Gmail, Search or YouTube. While users could give Google consent to use the information for advertising, it required users to become active and opt-in for that. Those who did give Google consent, did not have their "personal" information and activity used for advertising purposes and tracking. The change that is reflected in the company's privacy policy changes that in a significant way, especially for new users. Google intensifies tracking The following sentence was removed from the privacy policy: We will not combine DoubleClick cookie information with personally identifiable information unless we have your opt-in consent. It was replaced with the following sentence: Depending on your account settings, your activity on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google. If you hover over the part of the sentence with a dotted line underneath it, you get an example that explains this in detail: This activity might come from your use of Google products like Chrome Sync or from your visits to sites and apps that partner with Google. Many websites and apps partner with Google to improve their content and services. For example, a website might use our advertising services (like AdSense) or analytics tools (like Google Analytics). These products share information about your activity with Google and, depending on your account settings and the products in use (for instance, when a partner uses Google Analytics in conjunction with our advertising services), this data may be associated with your personal information. Advertisement that you see on the web powered by DoubleClick, think Adsense for instance, may use personal information such as your name or your web activity to deliver personalized ads to you. While Google does not use all information yet for that, the content of Gmail emails for instance is not used to power DoubleClick advertisement on the Web, other activity is. The change is enabled by default for new Google users. Thimarts means that any new Google account is opted-in automatically so that personal information will be used for tracking and advertising purposes. Existing users on the other hand were prompted to opt-in to the change this Summer according to the Pro Republica article that broke the news. If you don't want that, you may want to check your Google Account Activity to make sure you are not opted-in. We talked about the My Activity dashboard that Google provides you with to manage and control activities before. You need to open the Activity Controls on the page to manage those. There you find listed at the top the Web & App Activity service. I recommend that you disable that, but you may find it useful. If that is the case, make sure you uncheck the "Include Chrome browsing history and activity from websites that use Google services". Now You: Was the setting enabled or disabled for your Google account?

Google wants to sell you stuff. More specifically, Google wants to sell you stuff that you want to buy. I mean, if you ever go into a store, and sales people actually pay attention to you and offer to help you find something you're looking for, do you always tell them to go away and leave you alone (because, you know, it's not like they really care about you and whether or not you find what you might be looking for--it's just a job to them, right)? Weird. Viewing "Google" like it's some serial stalker out to do you some harm. That's, like, paranoid.

Reply Parker Lewis October 23, 2016 at 12:39 pm # @Earl So, what do you think of what Microsoft is doing with Windows 10 ? This move kind of looks like the answer to Microsoft's data grab. Does AdBlock Plus blocks Google Analytics by default nowadays ? Last time I checked they whitelisted it on many sites I think, which should probably be seriously reconsidered now, and something similar to NoScript's surrogates be implemented if necessary. Reply Tim October 23, 2016 at 2:10 pm # You have it the wrong way round. Microsoft's move was because of what Google has been doing over the years, which is particularly worrisome now due to Google's monopoly with Android. Microsoft couldn't continue just making their money from the licence fee anymore, they were pushed into a corner. The money system by design is a race to the bottom and this is what we are witnessing. Google though have always been first and foremost an advertising company and their priority has always been with their customers (companies, not users). Advertising companies such as Google by their very nature collect as much information as they can. It's beneficial to them and the customers who are paying them, if for example they can identify when someone is pregnant, moving house, getting married, etc. so that they can break their habits. I have no idea why people have the impression that Google is a decent company just because their forte was giving away services for free. Monitor your web traffic just browsing the web over the course of a day and watch all the requests made to Google servers, it's staggering. Parker Lewis October 23, 2016 at 4:47 pm # It's not that Microsoft can or can't do anything else but what they are currently doing. Companies *want* data. Information is as valuable as goods and has always been. They will do anything possible to gather as much as they can, and what holds them back is not as much ethics or self-regulation as it is law, technology or public opinion and societal criteria. Google broke new technology ground back then, and successfully prevented law from meddling in. Public opinion is contextual with short memory, so over time the industry can sway it or make it resign itself by moving step by step. Other companies were not forced to follow, they did so happily because it was now possible, most of the effort in pushing back the three obstacles having been produced by Google. Later on Facebook had a similar role for social networks and Apple for smartphones. Windows 10 is IMO a new round of pushing things further (indeed enabled by previous rounds), and just like Google followed happily Facebook and Apple, I believe it has been eagerly looking for a way to rush into the bridgehead created by Microsoft. Perhaps this is it, at least for the web platform, and perhaps a future version of Android will receive all those neat "improvements" as well, now that obstacles have been pushed back. But that's just one side of the playfield since the more impatient and pushy this information grabbing movement gets, the further it fuels the opposing force in the public opinion. Which creates a number of opportunities, for example a market or a way to gain trust and brand recognition. Robert G.

Checking now Still disabled Reply Henk van Setten October 23, 2016 at 1:22 pm # Let my try to list a few things we can do if we cannot live without Google completely. This will not kill the Google privacy-eating monster, but at least help a little bit to keep it in its cage. BROWSING HABITS - In your browser settings, disable "third-party cookies". I also set it to discard all cookies every time I close the browser, but not everyone will like this, as of course this means you will see more login screens at the start of every new session. - If you want to keep other sites' cookies, you still can (every time you login to your Google account) make sure to uncheck the "keep me signed in" box on their password page. - Every time you're done with managing your Google account, Drive, Calendar etc. immediately take the extra little step to log OUT of Google again. Don't surf around the web while still keeping yourself logged in to Google, because Google will keep following and profiling you. Obviously, this will be a little harder for them to do when you're some not-logged-in-to-Google user with just an IP address. - Clarity note: to keep using general Google services such as Google Search, you really do NOT need to be logged in to your Google account at all. - Email: for some things, like installing apps on an Android phone, you cannot avoid using a Gmail address. But do not use just one single Google account (one Gmail address) for everything everywhere, as this allows Google to combine all your data (app prefs, email content, etc) in one single profile. - For your main email activity, use no Google account at all. Instead use at least two separate main email addresses: one for your private email (friends), and for other things (shops, newsletters). Both these main addresses should NOT be Gmail addresses. This minimizes Google's opportunity to use your emails for profiling. - Yet another thing you might do, obviously, is install an effective browser extension to filter ads and trackers, for example uBlock. If for some reason you still need to surf around while keeping yourself logged in to your identifiable Google account all day long, then at least do one or more of the following things: FAKE PROFILE DATA - My Google profile proudly states January 1, 1899 as my birth date. I set this not only because my actual age isn't Google's business, but also because this labels me as a Very Old Person, which drops me smack outside the preset age-group interest focus of most advertisers (believe me, the number of them that focus on seniors is relatively small). This can greatly reduce the number of Google-driven ads! "PAUSE" DATA COLLECTION - Most important of all is of course the thing highlighted by Martin in his post above: turn off "Web & App Activity" in the Google Privacy Settings. This helps to block Google from saving (and using) all your browsing history and all your search history. But you can do more: - Unless you use Google Maps for navigation, set "Location History" to Off, both in the Google Privacy Settings and every other random time when Google tries begging for your location again. They will call this Off setting "paused" (as if I would ever switch it on again). - In the same Google Privacy Settings page, also switch off "Voice and Audio Activity", "YouTube Search History" and "Youtube Watch History". - If you don't need things like automatic cross-device calendar syncing, you can even do the same with "Device information". But for many people this will be a bridge too far, I suppose. MANAGE ADS SETTINGS - Set "Ads based on your interests" to Off. But this is not enough, for in some situations Google still tries to serve you personalized ads even when you already set this to Off! So on this ads settings page in your profile, AFTER setting "Ads based on your interests" to Off, you still need to click the somewhat inconspicuous "Control Signed Out Ads" button. This will show you two more options: "Ads based on your interests on websites beyond google.com", and "Google Search Ads based on your interests". These two may still be active, so you need to set them Off as well. PROFILE-BASED SEARCH FILTERING - In order to always get unfiltered Google search results, in my profile I ticked "Do not use private results". OK, this was what I could think of right now. HTH. Reply kalmly October 23, 2016 at 3:36 pm # Thanks. That is very helpful. Reply Valrobex October 23, 2016 at 10:19 pm # Thank you, Henk, Your list was most informative. Glad to say I do all those things you recommend whenever I use Firefox & Pale Moon. It's a confidence builder for me to have someone with your credentials identify what to do and that I'm doing so. However, I usually use Epic Web Browser and follow the same protocol. An interesting side note: One of my regular client's husband works directly for Google. She informed me not too long ago, that most of the Google employees use Epic except when they must use Chrome for work. What does that tell you about the insidious nature of Google's tracking? Reply ann October 24, 2016 at 11:54 am # I would add, use 2 or more browsers. And I would suggest use chrome for all google related stuff, and eg opera or firefox for your normal surfing activities. on chrome , do make an account, and if you have an android use a different account for your android phone. and last but not least is indeed Lie to Google all the time. Well I say that for Google , but the same is true for facebook, Apple and Microsoft and many many others. Reply Yuliya October 23, 2016 at 1:29 pm # Disabled. "Include Chrome history.." allows Google to use your browser's local history fo online ads? That's terrible. The fact that Chrome has this kind of functionality implemented. Speachless. I find it amusing (not really) that the "Pause" button does only work the second time you press it on that popup. At least on Firefox. The first time I pressed it, it only showed an animation, the popup still being present in front. I also find amusing (really amusing) the phrase: "Remember, you can search or browse in incognito mode whenever you want to be more anonymous".

Reply jasray October 24, 2016 at 7:47 pm # "Saying you don't care about privacy because you have nothing to hide is like saying you don't care about freedom of speech because you have nothing to say." Perhaps . . . but the information being collected isn't for spying on a person or any other type of subversive activity. It's all about marketing. I read an article, sorry I don't have the link, but any type of tracking is attempting to determine "how" you "think" and "why" you make the choices you make when clicking on a site, link, etc. Cognitive science, thinking about thinking. One may go through several days and ask "Why did I choose this over this--in reality; have I been conditioned"? Tracking could care less about "who" you are or "what" you do in your spare time. Why did User A make this click and not one that is similar? How was the user's experience and perception different than User B who made the opposite choice? And this goes on to "site" choices, Amazon shopping, etc. Tracking is more of a behavioral science than a way to infiltrate one's life. Should we be concerned when we realize that companies are attempting to analyze cognitive choices, find patterns, and then manipulate and reprogram the mind to make different choices. https://uberspace.de/ For instance, why would I trust or click a link such as the above link posted by p3t3r? Don't know the guy, could care less who he/she is, his link is garbage to me because I don't click links in forums [those who did click on the link, why did you click on the link and how much information went with the click]. In all honesty, I don't have anything to say--but "privacy" and "freedom of speech" are myths. If one went to school or was fingerprinted for a license or filled out a form for employment, or filed taxes, those "golden years" of invisible and private are long ago fantasies.

Reply buck October 25, 2016 at 10:05 am # Yeah, I stopped using Google services many years ago, don't really understand why anyone even partially tech savvy with a passing interest in their privacy does TBH. This whole "you cannot avoid Google products" stuff is BS. I do. Completely. Tutanota and ProtonMail DuckDuckGo Firefox VPN DNS Tor Linux Don't store any data in the "cloud", don't understand why anyone would with the low cost of HDD these days. Only cloud based services I'd consider are those that are FOSS and encrypt all data stored. FOSS is the future. Google tracking and fingerprinting can be significantly hindered via add-ons such as: Better Privacy Canvas Blocker Cookie Monster HTTPS Everywhere No Resource URI Leak NoScript Privacy Badger Privacy Settings Random Agent Spoofer Self-Destructing Cookies UBlock Origin UMatrix Of course there is also the GHacks user.js gem. Any site that doesn't work at all without javascript or cookies enabled I tend to give a wide berth to also. They are basically saying if we can't track you we don't want you. Fine with me. I second the recommendation to give Ghostery a wide berth, they have sold their soul to the devil, or become the devil... one of the two :(. Reply AustTex guy October 27, 2016 at 8:14 pm # Hello All -- If I leave gmail, calendar, and voice open in a private Firefox window, google cannot track me online in another Firefox window, have I got that correct, isn't it sortof in a sandbox by itself if in private window?

Oct. 23, 2016 Updated 12:01 a.m. By JOEL KOTKIN and MARSHALL TOPLANSKY / Contributing Writers Facebook Twitter Email Comments PRINT SEND PDF The consumer technology boom, largely responsible for a resurgence in California’s economy after the tech wreck of 2001, seems to be coming to an end. The signs are widespread: slowing employment, layoffs from bell-weather social media companies, the almost embarrassing difficulty of finding buyers for Twitter, the absorption of Yahoo by Verizon and the acquisition by Microsoft of LinkedIn. This is not to minimize the great things which have been accomplished over 15 years of massive investment in these technologies. Mark Zuckerberg founded Facebook in 2004, and is now worth some $55 billion, up $15 billion from last year. In 2015, more than 1 billion people globally used Facebook applications every single day. The “app economy” created by Steve Jobs and Apple is equally impressive. What would we have done with our free time if it were not for Farmville, Angry Birds and Pokemon Go? The tech boom has changed the face of wealth in America. Tech oligarchs, mostly clustered in the Bay Area, which dominates some 40 percent of employment in search and web publishing, now account for one quarter of the wealth of the Forbes 400 richest Americans. This tilting of wealth is not going away, and may shape the business world for a generation. Concentration and contraction Overall though, the economic impact of these technologies has been limited. Google’s Alphabet Inc. and Facebook Inc. together employ fewer than 75,000 people, one-third fewer than Microsoft, worth only a fraction its value. Snapchat, the star of Silicon Beach, employs several hundred people, hardly enough to reverse a long-term decline in Southern California tech employment. More troubling still are changes in the Bay Area tech culture. In its 1980s heyday, Silicon Valley was a Wild West of start-ups, new companies and ideas, and lots of jobs. Today, it resembles increasingly the cozy and fundamentally uncompetitive world of Detroit’s Big Three — Ford, Chrysler and General Motors. The Valley is increasingly dominated by a handful of companies — Google, Facebook and Apple — while conditions for startups, even well-funded ones, have deteriorated markedly. Despite the hype surrounding the possible IPO for Snapchat, new firms raised $15 billion in venture capital during the third quarter of 2016 — ending in September — down 28.6 percent from $21 billion for the same period one year ago. The third quarter of 2016 marked the fifth straight quarterly decline in completed financings and the lowest number recorded by PitchBook since the fourth quarter of 2010, signaling that investors are writing bigger checks for fewer deals. Rather than the Wild West, we are seeing consolidation in social media, which depends largely on advertising revenue. Google and Facebook claimed 64 percent of that revenue, according to Pivotal Research. Google scooped up $30 billion and Facebook gathered $8 billion, while other smaller companies have lost market share over the last five years. As promising start-ups are swallowed up at an alarming rate, the likely scenario, as we have seen in other industries, may be secular stagnation. With less competition and innovation, the track record of oligarchies, particularly regionally incestuous ones, is not a great one, as anyone who deals with new Microsoft or Apple operating systems, can attest. Even Sergei Brin, a co-founder of Google, recently suggested that start-ups would be better off launching somewhere else. One door closes, another opens The preponderance of evidence is pointing to the end of the boom era in social media growth. Already, there are clear signs of slowing, with layoffs growing rapidly and more companies looking for space in less expensive, less highly regulated areas. Yet this shift from social media may prove a long-term benefit both to the national economy and California. The sad truth is that for all the billions earned in stock market value, social media, unlike past tech booms, has done precious little to boost economic productivity. According to the Pew Center for Internet, Science and Tech, 56 percent of workers who use social media platforms for work-related purposes agree that social media distracts from the work they need to do, with 30 percent agreeing strongly. Rather than thrilling tweens with their first Tweets, technology companies may be shifting to far more important callings. In the Bay Area and elsewhere, firms are delving into promising fields including autonomous vehicles, machine learning, artificial intelligence, financial technology, biomedical research and even space exploration. These endeavors do more than simply keep people entertained and informed about their friends. They may create the basis for longer-lasting growth in the productive economy, not only here in California, but around the nation. Will California be able to maintain its innovation dominance in this next tech cycle? The Golden State faces the twin headwinds of high housing prices and restrictive regulations. These growing technologies require interfacing with the analog (aka real) world, relying more on 30-something, experienced engineers and data scientists than the millennial hipsters and coders who have fueled social media and casual gaming. California needs to make housing affordable and lessen regulatory burden for business if it plans to lead the next wave. Joel Kotkin is the R.C.

Google achieves that by pulling together the best features from Apple, Samsung and other phones and offering them at prices comparable to iPhones. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg, File)   By Brian Chen The New York Times Oct. 23, 2016   Brian Chen, The New York Times technology columnist Today’s Business stories Festive farming: Harvest time comes for Willamette Valley Christmas tree growers For some, pets at work take edge off ‘ruff’ days Tiny-home market more bust than boom Business Datebook Business Beat More Business »   Google’s Pixel, the first smartphone to carry the search giant’s brand name, arrived in stores this week in a lucky stroke of timing. For Google, at least. This holiday season, all Google’s new phone has to do to compete with those from Samsung, the world’s largest handset maker, is not burst into flames. That’s what recently happened to a bunch of Samsung Galaxy Note 7s, the higher-end smartphones that use Google’s Android software. The Note 7s have since been recalled, and Samsung has shut down the product entirely. The absence of a major competing Android device works out especially well for Google because the Pixel is, relatively speaking, mediocre. It is slower than Apple’s iPhone 7 and the Galaxy S7, Samsung’s smaller flagship phone. Photos shot with Pixel’s camera don’t look as good as the iPhone’s. And Google’s built-in artificially intelligent virtual assistant, called Assistant, is still fairly dumb. But hey, the Pixel probably won’t burn down your garage or injure a child. So if you prefer Android and are already hooked on Google’s suite of Internet-powered software, including its maps, photos, email and document-editing apps, then you probably won’t regret buying the Pixel. Google said that it had optimized Pixel to be speedy, with real-world applications that consumers could perceive, like making the touch screen feel very responsive. It also said that it would improve its virtual assistant over time and that photos taken with the Pixel look more natural. In the United States, Google’s Pixel initially will be available for Verizon Wireless or Project Fi, Google’s cheaper phone service. Like other high-end phones, Pixel’s starting price is about $650. Pixel comes in two screen sizes: 5 diagonal inches and 5.5 diagonal inches. Google provided the 5.5-inch model, Pixel XL, for testing. After testing Pixel for five days, I concluded that although the device’s features are underwhelming, this is a good smartphone for Android fans. It does a great job doing what Google designed it to do: Running Android in its purest form, untainted by slipshod third-party apps. Better yet, this is an opportune time to consider breaking up with your carrier and switching to Project Fi, Google’s phone service that costs as little as $30 a month. Here’s what stood out in my tests of Pixel: Annoying assistant In a comparison of voice-controlled virtual assistants offered by Google, Apple, Amazon and Microsoft in January, I determined that none were great, though Google’s was slightly ahead of the pack. Nine months later, the situation remains largely the same: Artificially intelligent assistants still aren’t that smart. And so it was with Google’s supposedly new-and-improved virtual assistant, called Assistant, on the Pixel. The search giant says the difference with Assistant is that it is capable of “two-way conversations.” In plain English, you can make requests to Assistant and ask follow-up questions, and Assistant might understand the context to respond appropriately. Google offers this example: You can ask, “Where is the Taj Mahal?” and then ask, “How old is it?” While that sounds compelling in theory, Assistant failed at responding fully to many requests made with natural language. When I asked, “What time is ‘Westworld’ on TV?” Assistant displayed a Web search result containing the synopsis for the new sci-fi show. When I followed up with, “So what time is it on?” Assistant told me the current time, which was 9:35 p.m. From there on, Assistant continued to hit foul balls. When I said, “book me a table nearby,” Assistant would try to book a table only at a restaurant called Rich Table, and didn’t list other options. On the plus side, Assistant can handle a conversation about the weather. When I asked for the weather and it said it was raining, I asked whether it would stop raining this week. “Rain is not expected this week in San Francisco,” it said. Better. In its current state, attempting to accomplish complex tasks with Assistant on Pixel will waste more time than it saves. Mediocre camera Like pretty much every handset maker, Google proclaims Pixel’s camera to be the best on the market. Its rear camera has a 12.3-­megapixel sensor, similar to the iPhone 7’s 12-megapixel sensor. So I took photos with the Pixel and compared them with shots taken with the iPhone 7 and Samsung’s Galaxy S7. All the cameras took clear, visually appealing photographs with rich details, but there were major differences in color, even without any filters applied. The photos taken with the Pixel looked colder — they appeared to exaggerate cyans and magentas. The ones taken with the iPhone looked more vivid, though they appeared to slightly bump up yellows to make photos look warmer. The color in pictures taken with the Samsung phone looked oversaturated and unnatural. I decided to let a blind jury weigh in. My partner, a professional photographer, took photos with each camera of a plant in a colorful vase in natural lighting. She labeled each photograph A, B and C, and I sent the photos out to 30 people and, without revealing which phone each letter corresponded with, asked them to vote for their favorite. Out of 30 votes, 19 voted for the iPhone, eight voted for the Pixel, and three voted for the Samsung phone. People seemed to gravitate toward the warmer color profiles produced by the iPhone. The competition Based on features alone, the Pixel is decent compared with Apple’s iPhone 7 and Samsung’s Galaxy S7. Here are some highlights: What sets Pixel apart is its compatibility with Project Fi, Google’s experimental wireless service. You pay at least $30 a month for a package that includes unlimited minutes and messages and 1 gigabyte of cellular data. You can pay $10 more for each extra gigabyte of data or get reimbursed for the cellular data you don’t use. The best part: In the United States, Project Fi relies on cell networks from Sprint, T-Mobile and U.S. Cellular; Project Fi also works in more than 135 countries, and you pay the same rate no matter where you travel. In my review of Project Fi this year, I found the service to be reliable and the overall package to be a good, frugal option. The Pixel’s finger­print sensor, for unlocking the phone, is annoyingly on the back of the device rather than on the face. So when you’re on the go, you will probably be using two hands — one to hold the phone and the other to place your fingerprint on the back — to unlock the Pixel. In speed tests run with the mobile app Geekbench, the Pixel was about 80 percent as fast as both the iPhone 7 and the Galaxy S7. The Pixel wasn’t designed to be water-resistant, though Google says it is resistant to water sprays. The Galaxy S7 and the iPhone 7 survived a dive into a pitcher of water. It’s worth noting that the Pixel still has a headphone jack, which Apple eliminated from its iPhones this year (though it turns out the iPhone’s omission of the jack was not a big deal). The bottom line Largely because Samsung, the king of Android phones, is in the penalty box, now is a good time to consider trying something new, be it a different phone service or a different operating system altogether. Using Pixel with Project Fi may also end up saving you money: If you picked, for example, a plan with 2 gigabytes of data, you’d pay $40 a month for cellphone and data service that works all over the world. In contrast, Verizon charges $55 a month for a similar plan that doesn’t include free international roaming. If you are uninterested in Project Fi and not deeply invested in Google’s ecosystem, try an iPhone. Apple’s iPhone 7 and 7 Plus hardware features outperformed the Pixel in every way. And so far, to my knowledge, Apple phones haven’t blown up.

The specs, though just prototypes, are already stirring controversy. Jeanne Yurman reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript Google is getting into fashion with Project Glass. In a video released on Google+ the world's biggest search engine gave a sneak peek at wearable technology--glasses with a see-through computer screen. The specs would allow users to do things like take photos, get block-by-block directions, or receive a pop-up alert if a friend is nearby. CNET.com's Senior Editor, Bridget Carey explains how it works: SOUNDBITE: BRIDGET CAREY, SENIOR EDITOR, CNET.COM SAYING (ENGLISH): "Expect the computing muscle power to be connected to the phone you're carrying, the Google Android phone you're carrying through a Bluetooth connection. And the glasses would be talking to the phone in your pocket and therefore, relaying the info in your line of sight." The wraparound shades are merely a prototype but are already sparking controversy over privacy issues. Smartphones can already track a user's activity and whereabouts. But Google's glasses could provide something else...a visual record. SOUNDBITE: BRIDGET CAREY, SENIOR EDITOR, CNET.COM SAYING (ENGLISH): "We're kind of like in a Wild West right now when it comes to our privacy and what information we're sending out and what companies are doing with it. So these are all questions that Google would have to answer and be very specific about if they were going to launch something like this." Beyond privacy there are also questions about practicality. SOUNDBITE: BRIDGET CAREY, SENIOR EDITOR, CNET.COM SAYING (ENGLISH): "You look at all the things it could do to benefit your life, you know, getting an alert quick, change your route on your way to work so you're not late. That sounds kind of neat or perhaps, you know, getting information about something you're looking at. But then you think what are all the bad implications here? Here's another thing in our faces to distract us while were driving, while we're talking to our friends. Do we really need something like this?" These questions may or may not be answered. For now the sneak peak at these glasses is like one massive focus group for Google as it gauges responses amongst consumers and the media. The company is mum on when or whether Project Glass will produce an actual retail product. Jeanne Yurman, Reuters.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Pixel’s new promo videos tap three popular YouTube stars By Ida Torres - October 22, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Aside from being the first phone that Google can really call its own, one other thing that stands out about the newly-released Pixel smartphone is that the tech giant seems to be pouring so much effort into marketing it. From billboards to pop-up stores to large installations, they are really pulling out all the stops to let people know that the Pixel has arrived and that it is awesome (at least, a lot of reviews think so). Now for their latest promotional videos, they’ve asked 3 of the most popular YouTube stars to show off some of the selling points of the new smartphone. Todrick Hall is known for his unique fashion sense, and so on a search for the perfect suit to wear on a night out of town, he enlisted the help of the Google Assistant, which of course you can find built-in with Pixel. While of course you can find Google Assistant with other Android phones too, there might be a few easter eggs or special things you can only do with Google’s own phone. Fashion and beauty vlogger Alisha Marie takes her friends to a weekend of glamping, and of course, the main character in this video is the Google Pixel camera. She shows off such features like the 12MP camera, the double twist to take a selfie feature, the ability to record in 4K, video stabilization, panorama, anti blur, etc. For those who take a lot of photos and videos, the Pixel seems to cater to that crowd as well. Last but not the least, Connor Franta wants his loved ones to meet his new friends. And that’s a lot of new friends. Well, they’re actually really adorable puppies, so everyone seems happy about it. He’s showing off the video calling capabilities of the Pixel, specifically its video calling app Duo. One feature is called “Knock Knock” and it lets the receiver of the call get a preview of what’s going on before they actually pick up.

Thai junta says Google removing content with royal insults Reuters 23/10/2016 © Getty Images Thai mourners say prayers next to a portrait of the late King on October 22, 2016 in Bangkok, Thailand. Thailand's government met with representatives from Internet giant Google, amid growing calls from Thai hardline royalists to bring those who insult the monarchy to justice, as many Thais look with uncertainty to a future without their revered king. King Bhumibol Adulyadej's death on Oct. 13 has thrown the country of 67 million into mourning. It has also led to the rise of ultra-royalist vigilante groups who say they will punish anyone perceived to have insulted the monarchy during a highly sensitive time for Thailand. Deputy Prime Minister Prajin Juntong said he met with Google representatives in Bangkok on Friday. Google affirmed in the meeting that it would continue to help the government remove content from YouTube, a Google subsidiary, that it deemed offensive, he said. "If any website is inappropriate they said to get in touch with them and inform them of the URL and the time the content was found," Prajin told reporters. That conforms with Google's practice around the world, Alphabet Inc's Google says. "We have always had clear and consistent policies for removal requests from governments around the world and we continue to operate in line with those policies," a Google spokesperson in California told Reuters on Friday. "When we are notified of content that is illegal through official processes, we will restrict it in the country where it's illegal after a thorough review." NAMED AND SHAMED Thailand's military government said on Tuesday it was tracking people suspected of insulting the monarchy following the king's death and would ask other countries to extradite them. Some critics of the monarchy living abroad have been named and shamed in Thai language web forums. Outside the world of the web, some Thais who have chosen not to wear black, the official color of mourning, have been publicly jeered at. Thailand's military government has tried to seek tighter censorship of social media from Facebook, Google and Japan-based instant messenger service LINE since it came to power in 2014 following a coup it said was necessary to restore peace to the country following months of unrest. Thailand's royal insult law, known as Article 112 in the criminal code, makes it a crime to insult the king, queen, heir or regent. Those who are found guilty face up to 15 years in prison. The law has curtailed public discussion about the monarchy's role and its future following the death of King Bhumibol who ruled for seven decades and was seen as a unifying figure. Since taking power in 2014, the junta, known officially as the National Council for Peace and Order, has taken a tough stance on dissenters. It has come under strong criticism from the international community for lengthy and unprecedented prison sentences handed down by military courts against civilians for violating the lese-majeste law since the junta took power. The military government has repeatedly rejected accusations of rights violations. (Reporting by Pracha Hariraksapitak.

Klint Finley Business Date of Publication: 10.22.16. 10.22.16 Time of Publication: 9:50 pm. 9:50 pm AT&T Is Buying Time Warner Because the Future is Google AT&T Telecommunications companies are becoming media companies. That explains AT&T’s agreement to buy Time Warner for $85.4 billion. But something else explains it, too. Media companies are becoming telecoms. Internet firms like Google and Facebook and Amazon and Netflix are the new media companies. They deliver enormous amounts of video online, posing a direct threat to old-school television and movie companies. But they also are becoming telecoms, threatening the likes of AT&T and Verizon. They finance undersea cables that link their data centers. They buy fiber optic infrastructure. Facebook builds open source telco gear, Google offers high-speed Internet service, Amazon hopes to become an Internet service provider in Europe. As this happens, telecoms must fight back. And this means challenging tech giants on the media front. The proposed AT&T/Time Warner deal combines two powerhouses. AT&T is the nation’s largest pay TV provider, the second-largest wireless provider, and the third-largest home Internet provider. Time Warner owns a dizzying array of media properties, including HBO, CNN, Warner Brothers, DC Comics, TBS, TNT, the Cartoon Network and broadcast rights to many live sporting events. But it does not own Time Warner Cable, a separate entity that the cable company Charter Communications bought earlier this year. The deal confirmed today follow’s Comcast’s merger with NBC in 2011 and Verizon’s acquisition of AOL last year and planned acquisition of Yahoo this year. Pundits quickly noted that diving into the content industry could be AT&T’s attempt to fill the hole that is created as customers ditch cable TV in favor of streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and YouTube. That’s true, but another shift is happening, too. For years, the big telecom Internet providers essentially operated as dumb pipes. All they did was deliver content. That used to make a lot of sense. A decade ago, the dotcom crash was still a recent memory, and digital piracy threatened to undercut the entire entertainment industry. How things have changed. AT&T, Comcast and Verizon have watched Amazon, Facebook, and Google take their place among the world’s most valuable—and powerful—companies, using infrastructure owned by the telcos. The entertainment industry rebounded as well, with upstarts like Netflix having reinvented the very idea of television. What’s more, those same tech companies have increasingly encroached on the telco’s business. They threaten to upend telecommunications much like they’ve upended other industries, aided by the Federal Communications Commission making more of the wireless spectrum available to them. Google in particular is eager to access more of the spectrum. And it has a few other projects going that could further undermine traditional telcos. Although Google Fiber and the companies wild schemes to use balloons and drones to deliver Internet access to remote areas garner a lot of attention, two other projects promise to be more radical. The wireless Google Fi service essentially resells T-Mobile and Sprint’s service. Android phones can discern which carrier offers the strongest signal in any given location, allowing you to move seamlessly between Wi-Fi and the two carriers depending on signal strength. Apple is among the companies that may be developing similar technology. This could lead to a situation in which your carrier is essentially invisible, and you’re paying Google (or another broker) to connect you to the network with the strongest signal. That could be a national carrier, or a local Wi-Fi provider. Google Station, an effort to provide a unified system for logging into and paying for Wi-Fi around the world, fits neatly into the vision as well. Put the pieces together and you begin to see a future in which tech companies have commoditized telcos in much the same way they commoditized computer hardware. Telcos, using cheap, off-the-shelf hardware powered by open source designs, could compete to sell bandwidth to the Googles and Amazons of the world at razor thin margins. AT&T probably isn’t thinking about this right now. Like the pundits say, it probably cares more about short-term gains like papering over any potential losses from cord cutting. Nor is any of this to say that the merger will be good for AT&T, let alone the public. Robert McChesney, a communication professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, says these kinds of mega-mergers rarely benefit the public. “This is a merger that will make no sense,” he says. “There’s no reason this merger should be done for consumers or workers.” These sorts of deals rarely pan out for the companies involved. New York University economics professor Nicholas S. Economides notes that AT&T’s has a checkered history of acquisitions. For example, it bought business technology company NCR in 1991 for $7.4 billion, only to spin spin it off six years later for $3.4 billion. And who could forget Time Warner’s disastrous $165 billion1 acquisition of AOL in 2000, which it unloaded in 2009 for $2.5 billion. If regulators approve the AT&T and Time Warner merger, their blessing almost certainly will include stipulations barring it from, say, refusing to license its movies, television stations and other content to competitors like Comcast. That could make it hard to justify so expensive an acquisition. But in a world where Internet access is a commodity, not a government-supported monopoly, owning a giant media company begins to make sense. 1Correction 10/23/2016 at 11:30 AM ET: An earlier version of this story said that Time Warner acquired AOL for $165 million. It was $165 billion. Correction 10/23/2016 at 1:04 PM ET: An earlier version used an incorrect logo for Time Warner. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Content Marketing Social Media Paid Search Work Life Events Advertise What You Need to Know About Google’s #AMP [Updated 9/20/2016] News  SEO August 2, 2016 News SEO Danielle AntoszAugust 2, 2016 SEJ STAFF 493SHARES 2.3KREADS 493SHARES 2.3KREADS SEJ STAFFDanielle Antosz 493SHARES 2.3KREADS You have probably heard a lot about AMP lately. This article will give you an in-depth overview of what AMP is and what it means for you. I will update it regularly. According to Google, AMP (Accelerated Mobile Pages) “is an open source initiative that embodies the vision that publishers can create mobile optimized content once and have it load instantly everywhere.” What does that mean in plain speak?  AMP is an initiative by Google to improve the mobile experience. By stripping down webpages to just the important parts, it allows them to load much, much faster. Have you ever spent 30 seconds waiting for an article load, just to give up and head back to Facebook? AMP is designed to help you avoid that scenario. How Does AMP Work? AMP works in two ways. First, it narrows the technologies used by developers to create web pages. For example, it requires simplified coding and does not permit the use of JAVA. This helps streamline pages. Second, it serves up pages from its own servers, which means it doesn’t have to connect with each publisher’s server, which can take time. To do this, developers must create a stripped down version of their site specifically designed to meet AMP requirements. What are the Benefits of AMP? There are multiple benefits, to both the user and publishers. Users get a better, faster experience, which means they read more, search more, and possibly even buy more. For publishers, it results in higher SERP rankings, though Google has been quick to say it isn’t a ranking factor  – yet. But, AMP helps increase mobile friendliness and speed, which are ranking factors. AMP posts also appear in a carousel in the first organic result spot: But What About Our Ads? Many publishers have been concerned about what the stripped down versions of their site will mean for ad revenue. And AMP versions of web pages do tend to show fewer ads overall. This is what Google has to say about ads on AMP pages: “A goal of the Accelerated Mobile Pages Project is to ensure effective ad monetization on the mobile web while embracing a user-centric approach.” So, while fewer ads will be shown, it shouldn’t affect ad revenue because it will limit mobile bounce rates by helping deliver content faster. Only time will tell if this balances out financially for publishers, but offering a better user experience is always a good thing. News About Accelerated Mobile Pages AMP is constantly evolving, so we wanted to create an always up-to-date resource you could check back on to get more info. Here is the latest in AMP News, starting from the beginning. Google Announces AMP: October 7th 2015 In early October, Google announced the very beginning of AMP via their official blog. Poor mobile experiences were nearly ubiquitous, and the AMP project sought to change that. Google Pages Go Live: Late February 2016 In late February of 2016, we started seeing AMP pages show it in Google search results. AMP Pages Were Slow to Show Up: May 2016 Nearly three months after AMP went live, many publishers still weren’t seeing our newly-minted AMP pages on SERPs – including SEJ. Google Says AMP is NOT a Ranking Factor: June 24th At SEJ Summit in Chicago, Gary Illyes, Webmaster Trends Analyst for Google, states that AMP is not currently a ranking factor. He also states he could see it rolling out to product pages and other verticals in the future. Google Announces AMP for Ads and Landing Pages: July 19th At Google’s DoubleClick Leadership Summit, they announced AMP for ads and landing pages, filling a much-needed gap in the AMP offering. Ads were much slower to load than content, causing major issues, particularly for top banner ads that readers were scrolling past before they even loaded. Google Chrome for iOS Begins Supporting AMP: July 28th Apple users who search using Chrome begin seeing a lighting bolt and a label of ‘AMP’ next to these super fast loading articles. Google Announces AMPs to Show in Organic Search & New Demo Site: August 2nd, 2016 Previously, the only way to tell which articles were AMP was through the “Top Stories” carousel. On August 2nd, Google announced they would show in organic search results and be signaled by a blue link. Read more here, including Matt Southern’s interview with David “Bez” Besbris, VP of Search at Google, about the latest developments in AMP. They also announced a demo site where publishers can test and fine tune pages. Google Officially Rolls Out AMP in Organic Search In their quest to make the internet faster for all, Google is now displying AMP in their organic search results. What does this mean for publishers? This is one more nudge from Google about the importance of making the switch and will increase the reach of AMP for publishers who have already made the jump. From the user side, this change means a faster internet. Read Matt Southern’s news post for more information, including where AMP goes from here. Editor’s Note: This article will be updated regularly as Google releases new features.  AMP Resources: This regularly updated Roadmap shares what Google AMP is doing and where they are planning to take it. This page on ampproject.org can help you get started in AMP. Use this plugin to convert your site to AMP. It is a little more complicated than a regular plugin but doable for most tech-savvy folks or developers.   Image Credits:  Featured Image: Deposit Photos | alphaspirit In-post Image: Taken By Writer  Related Posts Google App for iOS Updated With Improved Voice Search, Forward Button, + More Google Trends Updated to Provide Minute-by-Minute Data on Trending Searches Updated: Google To Protect Paid Search Keyword Data, Making It ‘Not Provided’ [Corrected] Google Has Updated Its iOS Search App, Here’s What’s New Bio Twitter LinkedIn Latest Posts Danielle Antosz Features Editor at Search Engine Journal Danielle is the Features Editor for Search Engine Journal and the producer of SEJ Marketing Nerds podcast.

But, AMP helps increase mobile friendliness and speed, which are ranking factors.” I think you’ve misread into it, having AMP in itself doesn’t contribute but the effects of it do. So if your on a mobile it will help but if your on a desktop it won’t. Context is everything. Sachin Pratap Dev I think AMP or mobile page for a website is a best idea for increasing sales online. George Kamp AMP scrolling takes me back to the search page on Android. Can’t use it. Fast at providing nothing isnt fast.

As we have the last couple of months now, today we’ll be showing you another 5 Android apps that you should definitely give a shot… Allo The first big release of October was the long-awaited Google Allo. This latest messaging client brought a lot to the table compared to anything Google offered before, and it’s a very interesting app to use. Allo stands out from the crowd since it can allow you to better express yourself in the conversation with the ability to change the “volume” of your message, a tool for drawing on images, voice chat, and best of all, several packs of awesome stickers. The biggest standout feature, however, is Google Assistant. Google’s vision for the future of AI lies in Allo for all to try, even if it’s not as powerful as it is on the Pixel. If you can get your friends on Allo, it’ll be a fun time, but from speaking from personal experience, it might not replace any established client you’re currently using. Introducing Google Allo, a smart messaging app that helps you say more and do more. Express yourself better with stickers, doodles, and HUGE emojis & text. Allo brings you the Google Assistant, preview edition. – Download on Google Play Inkwire Another app that stands out this month is Inkwire. This app is perfect for anyone who ends up being the “tech support” of the family, yours truly included. Inkwire allows users to share access to their device with another person to get assistance. All you need to do to get this working is to open Inkwire, get an access code, share it with the other user, and they can input it into Inkwire. Once the devices are “paired,” the connected user can point out what to do on the “host” device to solve a problem or teach someone how to do something. Inkwire also features built-in voice chat for talking the person along with the problem. Best of all, Inkwire is completely free and works really well. Ever wanted to give another Android user a hand? Inkwire lets you easily share your screen to another Android user. With just a couple clicks, you can request to view another user’s Android. Once connected, you can optionally start a voice chat, and draw on their screen to guide them through their issue. – Download on Google Play Messenger You can never have enough messaging apps, right? Google certainly seems to think so… Anyway, another app we wanted to show off this month is an SMS client from Kinker Apps. The yet-to-be-named “Messenger” is a fully featured, customizable SMS client that works on any Android smartphone. It features a good-looking and fast UI, but the special features are what really set it apart. More notably than anything else, “Messenger” offers cross-platform/cross-device support for SMS. That means you can download the app on another phone, tablet, or computer and access all of your SMS messages. If you use a computer the majority of the day, Messenger is an app you’ll definitely want to check out! If not, it’s still worth a shot. Currently, Messenger is available on Google Play (and the Chrome Web Store) as an Early Access app. Things might be buggy until the final release although I haven’t had any notable issues to date. Fully featured text messaging with tons of customization! You get all of the messaging features that you’ve come to know and love such as cross platform messaging, group messaging, themes, etc. – Download on Google Play Swappa One of my favorite ways to buy and sell devices is with Swappa. The online service has been available for a few years and it’s great, but one flaw has always been the lack of a mobile app. Trying to respond to comments or snag deals is difficult on the mobile site. Luckily, Swappa is changing that with its own dedicated app. Swappa for Android brings a good-looking Material Design UI which is well laid out. As you’d expect you can use this app to easily browse listings, leave comments, buy products, and create your own listings. Right now the app is a bit slow, which is excusable considering it just released. If you’re trying to offload some old devices to save up for a new Pixel, V20, or another new release, this app may be what you’ve been looking for. It is, of course, free on Google Play. The ease of safely buying and selling gently used phones on Swappa just got even easier. The Swappa marketplace app makes it simple to shop for smartphones, tablets, Chromebooks, smartwatches and more on the go. – Download on Google Play Dactyl – Fingerprint Camera The last app we’ll feature this month is Dactyl. This app accomplishes a pretty simple task ─ it turns your fingerprint sensor into a shutter button. This free utility works well with most camera apps, including the Google Camera. To activate it, simply give the app accessibility access on your device and ensure you’re using a supported app. Unfortunately, this one seems to only work on Nexus devices as I haven’t had any success using it with the LG V20, Galaxy S6 Edge, or other devices I have in office. You can now use your fingerprint to take photos, selfies, and videos with almost any camera app! – Download on Google Play Guides Android Breaking news for Android.

Anna Scantlin Contributing Editor | October 22, 2016 106 shares 67 35 0 0 0 0 2 1 1               Competition has become pretty stiff over the past couple of months, largely in part due to Google’s rebranding to Pixel from Nexus. The biggest difference between Pixel and Nexus is that Pixel is Google’s first smartphone “designed and built by Google”, whereas Nexus was known for showcasing various Android manufacturers’ designs each year (for example, the Nexus 4 was created by LG and featured LG branding; the Galaxy Nexus was designed by Samsung and featured Samsung branding). And while it’s true that the Pixel was manufactured by HTC, the reason it doesn’t feature the HTC branding was because Google was the sole designer and overseer of the process; HTC simply manufactured it. With Nexus, the manufacturers were a part of the design process as well. So the main change is that Google basically took over everything regarding Pixel, therefore granting the company the ability to take sole ownership. Pixel is Google’s first Google-branded foray into the smartphone market, and with a name as big as Google and a price as premium as Pixel’s, Google is giving off the impression that they are ready to compete with Apple head-on. But how does the Pixel truly measure up to Apple’s titan, the iPhone? Is the premium price tag on the newcomer Pixel worth considering over the iPhone 7, a brand that has been the very definition of “premium” in the smartphone industry for nearly the past decade? In my subjective opinion, yes, the Pixel is worth the premium price, but if you’re trying to compare it directly with the iPhone 7 you’re going to see a lot of “give and take” between the two’s features and specs that ultimately put them on equal footing. Let’s take a quick look at some of the differences between the two: iPhone 7 and 7 Plus feature less RAM than the Pixel. However, iOS is more memory-efficient than Android, and doesn’t need as much RAM as Android would. Pixel kept the beloved 3.5mm headphone jack; the iPhone didn’t. iPhone 7 features OIS; Pixel does not. Apple’s 3.2GHz A10 Fusion processor appears to be faster and more powerful than the Pixel’s 2.15GHz Snapdragon 821, but both are blazing fast and most people wouldn’t notice the difference. Google Assistant allows for a more natural conversation, which utilizes context clues from your prior queries to come up with an answer. Siri also does this occasionally, but it isn’t as common for Siri as it is for Google Assistant currently. With that in mind, Siri has its own strengths against Google Assistant, and both are quite advanced. Neither phone have a microSD card slot, and both offer 32 and 128GB of internal storage, but the iPhone 7 offers an additional tier of 256GB of internal storage. Pixel is VR-ready, while the iPhone 7 is not. Both are universally carrier-friendly, but Verizon is Pixel’s only carrier partner. Pixel utilizes fast-charging, gaining 7 hours of usage after just 15 minutes of charging. The iPhone 7 does not charge as quickly. Pixel uses Android; iPhone uses iOS. Those are most of the major differences I found. Pixel may be a new brand, but Google is no stranger to the smartphone industry. I think it will take a couple of years for people to put Pixel at the same rank as the iPhone or Galaxy (well, Galaxy may be easier to tackle now), but overall I think the Google Pixel is a good, solid rival to Apple’s iPhone. Both are worth considering for those who are in the market for a flagship device and aren’t partial to one operating system. Readers, what are your thoughts on both devices? Do you think one is significantly better than the other? Let us know your thoughts in the comments below!

The target was Google and its massive server system, which apparently houses much more personal information than even most techies had imagined. The targeted servers housed information from every Google search ever conducted, even those using incognito windows, as well as all web activity involving Google Chrome, and all Google Drive activity. This information was then connected to the personal Google account or IP address of the user who conducted the search or web activity and thus traced with apparent precision to the individual responsible. The targeted servers also housed a new source of information gathered from users of Google cell phones, including the Nexus and Pixel models. This means that all cell phone activity of these phone owners -- i.e. texting, Google chrome web activity, app usage, Google Maps searches, etc. -- was recorded on google's servers and thus leaked this weekend. That makes this one of the largest and most egregious blows to personal privacy, not only in the history of the modern technological era, but in the history of mankind. While Google users have expressed outrage over both the amount of information it gathered as well as Google's lack of security, many politicians and celebrities have been on the defense after the material exposed from their Google usage proved scandalous. Dozens of the nation's top elected officials have held press conferences to deny incriminating or disturbingly hypocritical information made public by the hack. Former Republican US Senator Rick Santorum, known for his staunchly anti-gay marriage stance, lashed out against the publication of his Google inquiries that included repeated searches of the phrases "man on man," "young men sucking," and "gay orgy." Santorum told the media Saturday, "This purported 'hack' is nothing more than the fanciful fabrications of internet trolls with too much time on their hands. This is not truth. This leaked information is 100% fiction." Santorum was but one of a slew of politicians and political commentators to rebut the publication of their alleged online activity. Ann Coulter, a conservative commentator whose statements on immigration and the black community tend to garner cries of racism, defended herself yesterday after the Google leak reported that she often (as much as twice a day) frequented racially-based pornographic websites such as Big Black Dicks, Mandingo Media, and BrownDickWhitePussy. "I'll tell you right now," Coulter announced to the Fox and Friends cast Monday morning, "the very second they find out who released this slander, they'll be getting a call from my lawyer." And the leak wasn't any kinder to liberal politicians. Secretary of State John Kerry was quoted as saying in a personal email that he hates shaking hands with diplomats from Middle Eastern countries because "they just don't smell right." He also says he prefers meeting with Israeli officials because "at least the Jews know how to shower." Stars of the screen and stage have also been dragged through the mud by the hack. Sean Penn has come under fire after being quoted as saying in a personal email that he only gets involved in issues of social justice to "get some of that young hippie trim." Matt Damon became the butt of many Twitter jokes and memes after the hack reported that he spent hours searching for and then viewing pornographic films involving Sarah Palin lookalikes. Even Emma Watson, idolized both for her role as Hermione Granger in the Harry Potter films as well as her role as a Feminist spokesperson for the UN, has become an object of public scorn. The leak claims that Watson registered for and repeatedly used a "rape fantasy" service in which she paid strange men to come to her house unannounced; the men would then pretend to force themselves upon Watson for her own sexual enjoyment. Not all of the hack's revelations were as tame, however. A number of political and public figures have now come under investigation for crimes such as child pornography (actor/director Woody Allen, country music superstar Toby Keith), illegal business transactions including those involved with campaign fundraising (President Barrack Obama, Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg), and even murder (Barbara Walters). As news conferences and defensive tweets continue to flood the Internet, authorities continue to investigate both the source of the hack and the veracity of the claims it has made.

Speaking after meeting on Friday with Ann Lavin, Google's director of public policy and government affairs in Asia- Pacific, he said the representative of the tech giant has recognised the government's concern and agreed to take additional steps to address it. The government had invited a Google executive to meet ACM Prajin, also acting Information and Communication Technology Minister, to discuss how to handle sensitive posts which cause confusion and frustration among the public following the passing of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej. According to ACM Prajin, the special team, which includes Thai nationals, will be formed to work around the clock to review complaints about sensitive content and video clips. A Thai-language complaint form will also be provided to facilitate the process. ACM Prajin said the team was expected to start working yesterday. "If we have the URLs or clips and the times [the contents were posted] they can proceed right away, but we have to submit the court orders later," he said. However, ACM Prajin said if the government wants access to information about user accounts, which are deemed private, it needs to proceed via other channels due to privacy laws. He said the Foreign Ministry is expected to coordinate with the US government in that matter. He said about 120 lese majeste cases were found last Wednesday and Thursday and that most of the posts were apparently by Thais. He pledged that the government would do its best to handle the issue. ACM Prajin said he has assigned another working team comprising technicians and legal experts to consult with Line, a popular chat application, and Facebook on the matter. The government has called on people to behave respectfully and refrain from posting "inappropriate content" online while the country mourns the passing of His Majesty. The warning comes after several incidents in which crowds gathered in some provinces to accuse individuals of posting inappropriate content about the passing of the King. Five people have been arrested on lese majeste charges since his Majesty the King's passing, deputy national police chief Srivara Ransibrahmanakul said yesterday. Most concerned messages posted online which breach Section 112 of the Criminal Code, better known as the lese majeste law, he said. No further details of who had been arrested or where were available.

Google, on the other hand, is regularly praised for its powerful knowledge graph and accuracy. You probably know that the search company’s exciting new feature, Assistant, recently made its debut on the new Pixel smartphones. With that in mind, YouTuber Marques Brownlee took it upon himself to pit the Pixel’s Assistant against the iPhone’s Siri in a cool side-by-side video comparison. Let the battle of the smartphone voice assistants begin! In the video below, Brownlee activates Google Assistant and Siri at the same time, then asks them the same questions and follow-ups to see how each one responds. Some notable observations: Both assistants successfully accomplished simple tasks like opening apps, setting appointments and timers, checking the weather and more Siri couldn’t answer a follow-up question about Obama’s height Assistant didn’t know if the Los Angeles Clippers won the latest game Siri didn’t know who won the Super Bowl and the team’s current quarterback Google Assistant can’t recognize songs yet And here’s the video. Brownlee felt Assistant was more conversational, understood context better, sounded less robotic and had more personality to it that Siri. Siri could handle contextual questions in multiple queries, but she’s not quite up there on the level of Assistant. On the other hand, Brownleee said Siri’s responses complete with images, charts and other visuals were ultimately more useful to him than Assistant’s spoken information. Many Pixel reviewers lavished praise on Assistant, but not The New York Times’s Brian X. Chen who called the built-in artificially intelligent virtual assistant “still fairly dumb.” Of course, as Google’s artificial intelligence gets smarter, the Assistant will become more helpful—but you could say the same thing about Siri, too. Too bad the technology just isn’t there yet for digital personal assistants to become truly useful, fully conversational and proactive. From Michael Nunez’s Pixel review: In fairness nobody has it, and Google’s is better than what’s offered by competitors like Apple’s Siri and Microsoft’s Cortana. The point is that as a whole, smartphone assistants aren’t smart enough to be defining features. They’re gimmicks, and Google unwisely decided to build a phone around one. Or as The Verge’s Dieter Bohn put it,  “Google Assistant is absolutely the smartest of the assistant bunch, but it’s not yet in a class of its own.” Apple seems to have been ramping up hiring for its new machine learning division. Its stealth work on artificial intelligence and machine learning came to light in a recent interview which detailed how these techniques have improved not just Siri’s brain and natural language processing, but also features like the Apple Pencil’s palm rejection or iOS 10’s autocorrect suggestions and the Memories feature in Photos.

I liked how he commented that SIRI was less conversational because she didn’t know how to answer “How tall is he?”, but I don’t think that was the issue (especially since she later answered several contextual questions). The real issue was that she didn’t know who the president of the US was and had to look that up on wikipedia (which I though was hilarious and a definite point for Google). Second thing I noticed was his example at the end about looking up photos of cats taken at his house in the last week. That’s actually something SIRI does too (just tried in in fact). Apparently SIRI just assumes that if you’re asking her you probably want her to find something you don’t already have whereas google defaults to showing you your stuff first. All in all I was actually impressed. I don’t use SIRI a lot and kind of expected it to be a one sided fight for Google but it was far more even than I thought. I’m impressed. I think the point about Google’s reading of content to you was also a valid one in that hearing it is probably more useful as the point of hands free is to not have to interact with the screen. Rowan09 Great review indeed. I asked Siri who is the president of the United States and it told me. You have to be specific with Siri just like a woman. Lol. If I ask “tell me the weather” it tells me but if i just ask “what’s the weather today” it will display the results. When it comes to GUI Siri has it by far. I agree from the praise on the web over assistant I really wasn’t as impressed as they made it seem. It’s great but not as great as the web is making it out to be. Jayy It didn’t work for me. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/95bc66cf35de94fbbf19638eba6b0e59b11e91dad602dff096474dd449713068.png Rowan09 I know tried it once and it showed the card and told me then the second time it gave me what you posted. When I asked “what’s the name of the president of the United States” it gave the answer. Different questions give totally different answers, Apple need to fix this. Jayy Yeah, I tried it saying “What’s the name…” And it worked. I just personally feel that card should’ve appeared no matter how it was phrased. Edit: Apple should have purchased ViV Rowan09 I agree PhoneTechJay Why does it matter, didn’t it take the same amount of time to get the answer? Jayy Not necessarily. PhoneTechJay What are we talking, milliseconds or seconds.. seriously.. Agneev Mukherjee Yes. They should’ve bought ViV. Agneev Mukherjee I hate to break it, maybe because of your jailbreak!? Jayy Possibly. Agneev Mukherjee Still you’re lucky to be jailbroken, I get up every morning and the first thing I do is Google jailbreak for iOS 10… Jayy Ah man, I know it’s not what you want to hear but I’m not on iOS 10 because of you. When iOS 10 first released I was actually going to give up my jailbreak for it then saw your comments, and thought about all the stuff I’d miss! Agneev Mukherjee I’m glad you stayed jailbroken. leart it worked for me https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/863e7de00b6bdcf9ddae8448322794d963ceefbb971120cf54cab8a242fdfa2d.jpg Jayy It would seem that iOS 4,5,6 or whatever version you’re using is smarter than iOS 9 lol p.s I miss that old Siri mic leart ios 6, no siri before ios 5.. the graphic is just amazing… obsolete but beautiful.. lol https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/85d2325dea6917696ec3a02d7df32ecde6cfd8a33fa68ee09970ab3e2d780a05.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/85d2325dea6917696ec3a02d7df32ecde6cfd8a33fa68ee09970ab3e2d780a05.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/85d2325dea6917696ec3a02d7df32ecde6cfd8a33fa68ee09970ab3e2d780a05.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/85d2325dea6917696ec3a02d7df32ecde6cfd8a33fa68ee09970ab3e2d780a05.jpg Jayy Lol yeah you are absolutely correct, I couldn’t remember because I had to manually put Siri on my iPhone 4 through jailbreaking. And yes the UI was nice! Impreza Given Google trawls every inch of your web activity, Assistant is bound to always have an overall advantage to a degree. From memory Soundhound had the most impressive demo of an assistant I ever heard/saw. I think it was Soundhound here on iDB. Rowan09 Great review. People said Google was light years ago but I would disagree, it’s great in certain ways and vice versa. Andrieux Querido If you think siri is dumb, you didn’t see it in another languages yet. Siri in Portuguese Brazil. is really dumb. Plus old voice. Shame on you Apple. YaBoyLilMayo U sound hurt zebonaut Apple needs to get to work on Siri; make it smarter; more conversational; with a touch of personality. So when you ask; whats the weather ; it should add “its raining; you might want to take an umbrella;” or if its sunny; “you can leave your jacket behind today” because it knows yesterday was cold…. Bill Google talks way too much. Makes me wanna pull a Hillary on an Android phone. (destroy it with a hammer…) John The most frustrating thing for me though, is the fact there’s so much for America and very little for people outside (for example, I would love to see sports scores and other sport statistics hard baked in to Siri for our two biggest football codes–AFL and NRL) Xee Why is IDB not covering the slow memory (in 32Gb models) and slow modem chips in certain models (depends on region sold/model number of iPhone) of iPhone 7!? Dave Kurt I wish they had demonstrated actual useful real world implications; controlling smart appliances, third party integration and hands-free control.

X Close Regional Home > News > Regional < Back to SMG 45 Sunday, 23 October 2016 Google to remove content with royal insults BANGKOK: Thailand’s government met with representatives from Internet giant Google, amid growing calls from Thai hardline royalists to bring those who insult the monarchy to justice. King Bhumibol Adulyadej’s death on Oct 13 has thrown the country of 67 million into mourning. It has also led to the rise of ultra-royalist vigilante groups that say they will punish anyone perceived to have insulted the monarchy during a highly sensitive time for Thailand. Deputy Prime Minister Prajin Juntong said he met with Google representatives here on Friday. Google affirmed in the meeting that it would continue to help the government remove content from YouTube, a Google subsidiary, that it deemed offensive, he said. “If any website is inappropriate, they said to get in touch with them and inform them of the URL and the time the content was found,” Prajin told reporters. That conforms with Google’s practice around the world, Alphbet Inc’s Google said. “We have always had clear and consistent policies for removal requests and we continue to operate in line with those policies,” a Google spokesman in California said on Friday. — Reuters Tags / Keywords: thai insults You May Be Interested India announces new measures to increase supply of cash Farmers defend burning their fields Anticipation for supermoon dampened by rain, cloudy skies in Singapore Where are you on the journey to financial freedom?

Thailand has some of the strictest laws in the world on speech critical or insulting of its monarchy. All reported incidents of insulting comments must be investigated by police and violators are subject 15 years in prison if convicted. That sentiment has only increased since Thailand's long-serving and widely beloved King Bhumibol Adulyadej died on Oct. 13. Since then, government officials said they have located more than 100 items online they said are defamatory of Bhumibol and petitioned Google to remove the items from its search registry, effectively making them impossible to find online using the world's most popular Internet search engine. As it has in the past, Google told the Thai government it would review the material in question and see whether it meets the Thai legal standard for insulting the monarchy. Google has delisted some 1,300 items over the last several years at the request of the Thai government, though in some instances it has determined the content does not meet its internal standard for removing it from the search registry. "We have always had clear and consistent policies for removal requests from governments around the world and we continue to operate in line with those policies," a Google spokesperson told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. Google only delists the items from searches done within Thailand. The items remain accessible to Google users anywhere else in the world, the company said.

We’ve just learned, thanks to a report from the Pew Research Center, that more than 40 percent of Americans find news on Facebook. That’s probably not surprising given Facebook’s huge user base, but it draws attention to the “trending news” features the social media giant offers, and reminds us that these continue to be a cause of controversy. Glance at your Facebook page and you’ll see trending topics in the top right corner. Back in May we learned through a site called Gizmodo that Facebook was using so-called “news curators” – people contracted by Facebook who chose the topics that would appear on the page. Facebook clearly had plans to become, among other things, a digital newspaper, but charges of bias led the company to fire its curators and use computer algorithms to select trending topics. Unfortunately, that move hasn’t solved the problem. Facebook is getting a reputation for trending stories that, upon closer examination, turn out to be bogus, or in some cases link to “news” in the form of nothing more than press releases. The site personalizes trends for each user, but the appearance of phony stories on everything from the September 11 attacks to the employment status of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly has tarnished its image. The size of Facebook’s user base makes it a likely target for disinformation. The entire model of social media is to cluster people into categories, a fact made lamentably obvious when you see like-minded politicos swarming around a topic and echoing each other’s thoughts. These are personalized news feeds but they encourage an “us vs. them” mentality that discourages objectivity. All of this makes Facebook’s trending news stories an important thing to get right. News algorithms are going to get much better, but right now we’re still learning what they can do, and Facebook is hardly alone in its travails. I use Google Now a lot on my smartphone, letting it learn my interests and send me stories I can use in my writing. I’m continually startled when, having expressed my interest in astrophysics, I occasionally receive lurid tales of alien cities uncovered by our Mars rovers and hostile UFOs buzzing the International Space Station. Surely we can do better than this. Now I see that Google is going to add a fact-check feature to its Google News service (news.google.com), which pulls in stories from a wide variety of sources. The plan is to offer fact-based context with the help of a product called ClaimReview. Users will theoretically be able to check factual content in major stories as they break, drawing on labels that describe news content and allow Google to identify its sources. We’ll see how this works, but as I read it, content creators will be the ones to add fact-check tags to their posts, so we may wind up with a two-tier news presentation (at least on Google News) in which posts that have no fact-check capability become less trusted than those that do. This puts the onus on Google to keep an eye on content creators to make sure that tags are not being used inaccurately. We should start seeing the process in action on Google News soon. In my view, the best fix for bogus information isn’t new algorithms but a habit of critical thinking on the part of readers, who must make intelligent choices in what they read and trust. The Internet demands a digital literacy that compels users to weigh news sources and follow up controversial claims with supporting material. This new literacy includes honing our search skills to become fact-checkers rather than true believers whenever dubious claims are presented. But especially in election season, we live in an environment so fast-paced that bogus stories just disappear in the next onslaught of material before they are truly vetted. Yes, computer algorithms are going to get better. But the most important factor in getting accurate news is a skeptical reader who keeps asking questions, knowing how dangerous naive credulity can be. Paul A.

King Bhumibol Adulyadej's death earlier this month has thrown the country's 67 million people into mourning. It has also led to the rise of ultra-royalist vigilante groups who say they will punish anyone perceived to have insulted the monarchy during a highly sensitive time for Thailand. Deputy Prime Minister Prajin Juntong said he met Google representatives in Bangkok on Friday.  Thailand's government met representatives from Internet giant Google, amid growing calls from Thai hardline royalists to bring those who insult the monarchy to justice  Mourners gather outside of the Grand Palace to sing for a recording of the royal anthem in honour of Thailand's late King Bhumibol Adulyadej, in Bangkok A huge crowd of mourners gathered on Saturday outside Bangkok's Grand Palace to sing the royal anthem in honour of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died after seven decades on the throne 'If any website is inappropriate they said to get in touch with them and inform them of the URL and the time the content was found,' Prajin told reporters. That conforms with Google's practice around the world, Alphabet Inc's Google says. 'We have always had clear and consistent policies for removal requests from governments around the world and we continue to operate in line with those policies,' a Google spokesperson in California told Reuters on Friday. 'When we are notified of content that is illegal through official processes, we will restrict it in the country where it's illegal after a thorough review.'  Thailand's military government said on Tuesday it was tracking people suspected of insulting the monarchy following the king's death and would ask other countries to extradite them. Some critics of the monarchy living abroad have been named and shamed in Thai language web forums. Outside the world of the web, some Thais who have chosen not to wear black, the official colour of mourning, have been publicly jeered at. Among the mourners was the new King in waiting - Thailand's Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn People dressed in black travelled by bus, boat and on foot to Sanam Luang, a tree-lined open space that has been used for royal cremations outside the river-side Grand Palace, bringing the area to gridlock well before the singing Thailand's military government has tried to seek tighter censorship of social media from Facebook, Google and Japan-based instant messenger service LINE since it came to power in 2014 following a coup it said was necessary to restore peace to the country following months of unrest. Thailand's royal insult law, known as Article 112 in the criminal code, makes it a crime to insult the king, queen, heir or regent. Those who are found guilty face up to 15 years in prison. The law has curtailed public discussion about the monarchy's role and its future following the death of King Bhumibol who ruled for seven decades and was seen as a unifying figure. Since taking power in 2014, the junta, known officially as the National Council for Peace and Order, has taken a tough stance on dissenters. It has come under strong criticism from the international community for lengthy and unprecedented prison sentences handed down by military courts against civilians for violating the lese-majeste law since the junta took power. The military government has repeatedly rejected accusations of rights violations.  The announcement comes on the day that a huge crowd of mourners gathered on Saturday outside Bangkok's Grand Palace to sing the royal anthem in honour of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died after seven decades on the throne. The government has declared a year of mourning for the 88-year old king, who was seen as a father figure for generations of people, and, though a constitutional monarch, a calming influence over the country's often turbulent politics. People dressed in black travelled by bus, boat and on foot to Sanam Luang, a tree-lined open space that has been used for royal cremations outside the river-side Grand Palace, bringing the area to gridlock well before the singing. Police said more than 150,000 were in Sanam Luang and side streets with more people expected through the day.  The royal anthem, known as Sansoen Phra Barami, is played before the screening of every cinema show in Thailand, when the audience stands to honour the king as pictures of his life and work are shown on the screen RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next 'Do you want to die here?': Rise of vigilante mobs in...

Share this article Share The royal anthem, known as Sansoen Phra Barami, is played before the screening of every cinema show in Thailand, when the audience stands to honour the king as pictures of his life and work are shown on the screen. Saturday's singing was recorded for use in cinemas, organisers said. 'Since he went to heaven we want all Thais to demonstrate their love and sing this song to show before film screenings,' Prince Chatri Chalerm Yukol, a movie director in charge of the filming of the singing, told reporters. Since the king died, people from across Thailand have flocked to the gilded Grand Palace to pay homage to the only king most of them have ever known, who is lying in state there. Since the king died, people from across Thailand have flocked to the gilded Grand Palace to pay homage to the only king most of them have ever known, who is lying in state there Thai Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn (left) chatting with his older sister Princess Ubolratana Rajankaya (right) during a royal religious merit making ceremony as part of the royal funeral ceremony for late Thai King Bhumibol Adulyadej at Dusit Maha Prasart Throne Hall, Grand Palace, Bangkok Buddhist monks have been chanting prayers beside his coffin in an imposing throne hall, and they will chant for 100 days as part of the funeral rites. 'I wanted to be here to pay respects to His Majesty,' said Haysri Watanakulpipat, 47, who said she drove overnight from the eastern province of Prachinburi. The military government has not set a date for the royal cremation but it is expected in about a year. The government has said Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn will ascend the thrown soon but he had requested that his succession be delayed for an unspecified period, so he can grieve with the people. The government has moved to quash uncertainty surrounding the succession and to reassure the country that the king's death will not derail plans for a return to democratic rule, which include a general election in late 2017. It has stressed business and government should carry on as normal and tourism should not be affected. Buddhist monks have been chanting prayers beside his coffin in an imposing throne hall, and they will chant for 100 days as part of the funeral rites The royal anthem was the national anthem of what was then Siam until 1932, when young army officers and bureaucrats staged a coup to end absolute monarchy Police said they expected more people at Sanam Luang through the day. 'There are more than 150,000 people here already but it could easily rise to 250,000 by the evening,' Thai deputy police spokesman Major General Songpol Wattanachai said. The Grand Palace is a former royal residence that is used only on ceremonial occasions. The royal anthem was the national anthem of what was then Siam until 1932, when young army officers and bureaucrats staged a coup to end absolute monarchy.

After the device was discovered to be so dangerous many airlines have banned it, I’m faintly grateful that mine didn’t blow up during the week I kept it in my trouser pocket. Regardless, I’m still withdrawing my five-star rating. So what should the thinking man who doesn’t fancy becoming a human fireball buy instead?  Google’s Android ‘own brand’ Pixel phones are a new option in smartphones  Big, powerful and with a few extra techno-tricks, the Google Pixel is pitched as the latest object of desire for those of us who would rather have root-canal surgery than be seen with an Apple iPhone Google’s Android ‘own brand’ Pixel phones are a new option.

It’s so good it’s a chilling reminder of how predictable you really are. So is it a worthy Google phone? For want of a better word, Pixel certainly feels ‘Googly’, in that it bombards you with information all day long.

It’s so good it’s a chilling reminder of how predictable you really are It has a superb camera and a screen so sharp the type can go to tiny font sizes, where it’s more like browsing the internet on a PC. God only knows what this new phone is doing to my eyes. There are neat touches to the design, too. The fingerprint sensor to unlock it is on the back, so you can lift and unlock it seamlessly.  It doesn’t have the gleaming, spaceship-esque curves of Samsung’s Note, though – but then it doesn’t explode like it’s been hit by a photon torpedo, either.   Read more: ma de by go og le Share or comment on this article e-mail 25 shares Bing Site Web Enter search term: Search Like DailyMail Follow MailOnline Follow DailyMail +1 DailyMail     DON'T MISS It's getting hot in here!

By Rick Delgado Published 4 weeks ago 12 Comments Tweet Failure. Disaster. Flop. These are just a few of the words used to describe Google’s foray into wearable and augmented reality technology known as Google Glass. When the first videos of Google Glass were released to the public, they sparked the imaginations of millions. Many began to dream up fascinating new applications for this innovative technology. Just think of how it would impact businesses! How would our everyday lives change with this powerful device going with us wherever we went? The possibilities were staggering, and a revolutionary change in how the world works appeared to be right around the corner. As we now know, Google Glass is little more than a footnote. From the way most tech blogs describe it, Google’s amazing new device failed to live up to expectations. It never caught on with businesses or the public at large, and the result was a disaster the likes of which Google isn’t familiar with. In fact, many websites are urging companies pushing similar devices to do everything they can to avoid Google Glass’s mistakes. If there’s one thing to learn from the Google Glass phenomenon, it’s that Google struck out with this attempt. But could the popular perception of Google Glass be missing the point? It turns out that many people may have gotten the wrong idea of what Google was trying to do with its Glass product. A combination of mistaken media stories, common misperceptions, and poor communication have likely contributed to the idea that Google Glass was a failure of Betamax proportions. The tide may be turning on opinion regarding Google’s wearable attempt, and history may be a little kinder toward those strange looking glasses tech geeks were wearing for a time. This noticeable shift in opinion over the Google Glass has in part been driven by a push to understand what Google was trying to accomplish with it in the first place. Many of the shortcomings and criticisms people lobbed at Google Glass can actually be answered once you know that what we saw from the product was really only Google’s Explorer program. Yes, Google Glass was expensive, thus severely limiting the number of people who could buy it. Yes, its capabilities were not clearly defined and made using it pretty difficult at times. Again, that was all intentional on Google’s part. The tech company wanted the first adopters of Google Glass to be a sort of test audience. They wanted to see what people would do with the product and keep the feedback in mind for future projects. Based off of this research, Google would be able to develop other products. In other words, the Google Glass we saw was more of a trial run, a beta that was never going to be released to mass audiences at all. That’s why we never saw Google Glass released as a standalone product made available in stores. When Google revealed the Explorer project was coming to an end in early 2015, many people quickly proclaimed Google Glass a miserable failure. What they didn’t realize was that Google was transitioning into a new phase -- the enterprise version of the device. This new and improved Google Glass is being made for businesses and industries for them to use, and for now, it is seeing success. From its use in the airplane manufacturing process to helping people with autism, Google Glass has gotten a new lease on life thanks to improvements made through that initial experimental phase. The more it catches on among larger enterprises, the more likely it will eventually be made into a consumer version. Even if Google Glass itself were never to see the light of day again, that doesn’t mean it can be declared a failure. After all, innovation often requires failure along the way, leading to the very breakthroughs that can be deemed giant successes. The technology used in Google Glass is already being put to use in other devices, like smart contact lenses and new camera technologies. If anything, Google Glass can be considered a pioneer in the field of wearable smart devices, a needed trailblazer that paved the way for other gadgets and modular solutions that will play important roles in our lives in the future. While it may be popular to kick Google Glass around, Google may actually have the last laugh.

While Google Now was a clever search engine, Google Assistant is Googles first real shot at a virtual engine along the same lines as Siri and Cortana. The question is, how well does it fare against Siri. After all, Google is positioning the Pixel squarely against the Siri and while Apple doesnt quite market Siri as the main draw for the iPhone quite the same way as Google is with the Pixel, it would still make for an interesting comparison. And thats exactly what happened. In a video by Marques Brownlee, aka MKBHD, Siri and Google Assistant were put through the same set of questions. The end results were bit interesting. For what its worth, I personally didnt expect Siri to do as well as it did here, because it has historically not worked super well for me. Both assistants had their ups and downs. Siri voice replies were brief and the focus was on the info cards that it showed, which are super attractive compared to the barebones white cards that Google shows. Siri is also conversational to an extent but that is something that really is the strength of Google Assistant. Google also likes to read out the entire card, which makes it the better choice when you cant actually look at the screen, like while driving or if the phone is not directly in front of you. Google Assistant also, obviously, works a lot better if you use Google services a lot and it uses a lot of info from them to provide better personalized search results. Overall though, they came out super close in this particular comparison. Thats been it. Thanks for reading, and Ill see you in the next article. Peace.

Three takeaways: Google Assistant is more chatty than old Google Voice Search; Google still seems to have an edge over Siri when it comes to follow-up questions based on topic inference (which Siri also does, but not as well); and, Siri holds up well in most types of questions asked by Brownlee. In my daily experience, however, Siri still falls short of basic tasks too often (two examples) and deals with questions inconsistently. There is also, I believe, a perception problem with Siri in that Apple fixes obvious Siri shortcomings too slowly or simply isn't prepared for new types of questions – such as asking how the last presidential debate went. In addition, being able to text with Google Assistant in Allo for iOS has reinforced a longstanding wish of mine – the ability to converse silently with a digital assistant. I hope Siri gets some kind of textual mode or iMessage integration in iOS 11. One note on Brownlee's video: the reason Siri isn't as conversational as Google Assistant is due to the way Brownlee activates Siri. When invoked with the Home button (or by tapping the microphone icon), Siri assumes the user is looking at the screen and provides fewer audio cues, prioritizing visual feedback instead. If Brownlee had opened Siri using "Hey Siri" hands-free activation, Siri would have likely been just as conversational as Google. I prefer Apple's approach here – if I'm holding a phone, it means I can look at the UI, and there's no need to speak detailed results aloud.

You might be the designated ‘tech person’ for your family or friends, making sure granny doesn’t get malware on her dusty Windows XP desktop. Some people need an actual person to help them, and that’s completely okay – that’s where Google Support Services comes in. One of the Pixel’s exclusive features is 24/7 support straight from the Settings app, which even allows support agents to control your device (if you allow them) if needed. Now Google has published the Google Support Services application to the Play Store, to allow updates without new system updates.

Related ESOP dhamaka is for real but only for those who are prepared for the grind September 2013: Twitter acquired MoPub, an ad tech company, for $350 million. Perhaps as remarkable as the transaction itself was founder Jim Payne’s zeal in turning 36 of MoPub’s 100 employees into millionaires. Payne, a startup employee himself at one time, could do that by offering performance-based stock option grants regularly since founding the company in 2010. MoPub even offered employees loans to exercise their options long before the deal was cut. September 2016: Some 15 employees at Mumbai-based fintech startup Citrus Pay turned crorepatis when online payments service provider PayU bought out its smaller rival in an all-cash deal estimated at $130 million; an office boy, who was one of the first employees at Citrus Pay, took home Rs 50 lakh. Like MoPub’s millionaires, the Citrus Pay crorepatis had found an avenue to encash their employee stock options (ESOPs) to hit the jackpot. It’s a long shot, and observers concede as much. “ESOPs were a lottery, are a lottery and will always remain a lottery,” says Rishabh Lawania, founder of Xeler8, a market intelligence platform for venture capitalists and companies. "The only thing that’s gonna change in the nature of this lottery is the probability of one winning it.” As the startups ecosystem in India, points out Lawania, moves towards consolidation, marked by mergers and acquisitions and buyouts — the latest being MakeMyTrip buying out rival firm Ibibo earlier this week — the chances of winning this lottery will brighten massively. He backs his hypothesis with data: while in the first quarter of this year the number of mergers and acquisitions of startups stood at 40, it jumped to 65 in the July to September period (See Top acquisitions in 2016). In lieu of cash The trend, contends Lawania, will only gather momentum as funding becomes increasingly difficult to raise. This will increase the chances of winning the lottery, he says, adding that for a startup employee, there are only two ways to encash ESOPs: either when the company gets listed or when it’s bought. While listing is a bleak possibility for any Indian startup, a buyout is a more realistic option. In the past decades, the road to millions was mostly found by tech giants that made public offerings and got listed on the stock exchanges. Google, for instance, got listed just six years after it was founded, creating close to 1,000 millionaires virtually overnight; and back home Infosys took 12 years to get its shares listed, in 1993, spawning a rash of millionaires not just post-IPO but with a series of annual ESOP offerings in the years that followed. IPOs are rarer these days, and employees-turned-millionaires even rarer. But it’s a consolidation phase that’s tentatively begun in startups that may result in ESOPs regaining their lustre. Few saw that coming, as Jitendra Gupta who founded Citrus Pay in December 2010, will testify. “There were many who chose an all-cash package instead of ESOPs,” says Gupta. And recently when they asked if they could revert to ESOPs, Gupta had little choice but to reply in the negative: they had missed the bus! Gupta maintains that if one wants non-linear growth in life, then one has to take risks as there is nothing called guaranteed outcome with ESOPs. Employees who join startups won’t do justice to their risk ability if they don’t opt for ESOPs in lieu of a cash component, he says, adding that he was sad to see over 95% of hires not caring for ESOPs. “I had a tough time convincing potential hires, explaining the value-creation opportunity through ESOPs,” recalls Gupta. That mood may be changing as a steady stream of startup employees begin trading off a fat salary package for stock; some even taking a pay cut as high as 75% just to ensure that they maximise their chances of a windfall. Hopping on the rocket ride Raghu Mallena in Bengaluru is one startup guy who took the high-risk, high-reward gamble. The chief technology officer at Plackal, maker of a women’s health tracker called Maya, joined the firm in April this year from Juniper India where he was head of the security business unit for three years. Mallena, who set up NetApp’s first engineering team in India and also had a stint with Cisco, took a salary cut of 75 per cent but in return pocketed ESOPs. “There is no point playing conservatively if you have already taken the leap of faith to join a startup,” says Mallena. While one can make up for the lost salary by going to a big company in future, one can never make up for the lost ESOP opportunity. Raghu Mallena CTO, Plackal, maker of a woman’s health tracker, Bengaluru Joined Plackal in April this year from Juniper India where he was head of security business unit for three years Earlier set up NetApp’s first engineering team in India; also worked with Cisco SALARY CUT: 75% ESOP: Yes “Imagine how stupid you would feel if you joined Google pre-IPO and negotiated a 50 per cent higher salary in return for half the ESOPs,” grins Mallena who, after spending his career in corporate roles, took some time off to explore a few offbeat ideas: one of them was joining a startup. Would he advise employees to take a huge pay cut and opt for ESOPs? “The first thing to ensure,” he answers, “is that the salary meets one’s basic financial needs.” Beyond that, if it is a trade-off, one must go for ESOPs. He adds that the move to take a risk is quite similar to managing one’s financial portfolio, where only 20 per cent of investment would be in highrisk, high-reward instruments and the rest in safer options. So if one works for 25 years, then spending five years (20 per cent) in a high-risk, high-reward job is logical. “It makes sense not just financially but also for the five years of enriching experience.” For Ashwin Venkatraman, the trigger to join a startup by taking a 50 per cent salary cut was not only the financial rewards that ESOPs might bring in but a feeling of ownership that comes with them. “You feel deeply invested in the company’s success and growth,” says Venkatraman, who joined as chief operating officer at Furlenco, a furniture rental startup in Bengaluru in April last year. While he worked at InMobi as product head for four years before joining Furlenco, he has already had stints with Infosys and Google Jitendra Gupta MD, PayU India, an online payments startup Founder of Citrus Pay, which was bought by PayU in September this year Offered ESOPs to 51 employees at Citrus Pay; 15 turned crorepatis after the buyout “I wanted to have the opportunity to build Jitendra Gupta something from ground up,” he says. Though taking risks is in the DNA of Venkatraman — 10 years ago he quit a high-paying investment banking job to join a lesser known company at that time in India (Google), and six years ago he left Google to join InMobi — he had never taken such a big leap of faith. Also Read: ESOP millionaires among startups are an exception “It’s like leaving the cushy first-class cabin of a train and boarding a highly questionable rocket-ship,” he says. One never knows, he lets on, if it will explode or fly. While conceding that ESOPs are a lottery, Venkatraman believes that one can influence the outcome to a large extent. But what if the ESOPs don’t materialise? As long as one is not trading one’s basic necessities for ESOPs, it’s okay to take the risk, he reckons. He sounds a note of caution by rewinding to the first dotcom boom in the ’90s. A lot of paper millionaires were made in the US but, when their stock options turned out to be worthless, they were left with huge credit card bills and nothing in their wallet. Ashwin Venkatraman COO, Furlenco, a furniture rental startup in Bengaluru Joined in April 2015 from InMobi where he was product head for 4 years Earlier worked with Infosys and Google SALARY CUT: 50% ESOP: Yes “So startup employees do need to understand the risk,” he says. At the same time, he adds, one doesn’t want to become a Ron Wayne. The lesser known Apple founder sold his 10% holding shares for $800 in 1976; that stake would be worth roughly $63 billion at current prices. Also Read: ESOP dhamaka is for real but only for those who are prepared for the grind “You don’t worry about the comfort of your seat on a rocket. Just strap up and enjoy the ride,” adds Venkatraman. Another employee enjoying the rocket ride is Sreejita Deb. The chief business officer at Flyrobe, a fashion rental startup in Mumbai, joined the company in December last year from InMobi, where she was vertical head for a year. The MBA grad from Harvard Business School took a salary cut of 35% despite offers that were 60-75% higher, claims Deb, who had also worked at Twitter in Silicon Valley. The move, she asserts, has paid off. The biggest reward is to see something grow from 0 to 1 and realise that it happened because of you, she says Sreejita Deb Chief business officer, Flyrobe, a fashion rental startup in Mumbai Joined Flyrobe in December 2015 from InMobi, where she was vertical head for a year. Earlier worked at Amazon India and Twitter in Silicon Valley The MBA grad from Harvard Business School had offers that were 60-75% higher than Flyrobe’s SALARY CUT: 35% ESOP: Yes “There wasn’t a brand on whose back you were standing, no prior history on which you were building.” Deb believes that risk appetite of a person depends on his or her personal situation. If someone has an ageing parent to take care of or young children to think about or several liabilities, then it may not be realistic to take a massive paycut and opt for ESOPs. Another consideration is the stage of the company: if it’s an early-stage startup, and if one is convinced about the founding team, then one should opt for ESOPs Tanuj Choudhry Vice-president (growth), HomeLane, a home interiors startup in Bengaluru Joined in March 2015 from Amazon where he was senior product manager Earlier worked for six years at McKinsey SALARY CUT: 30% ESOP: Yes Like Deb, Shuchi Shukla too wanted to be part of a growth story. The chief of staff at Belong, a data-driven hiring startup in Bengaluru, Shukla joined in August last year from Bain & Company where she worked as consultant. “You don’t just want to do your job, take your salary and go home, but actually invest yourself in building the company that you own a part of,” says Shukla, who took a salary cut of up to 40% and had earlier worked with investment management teams at Accel Partners and Flipkart. When you put in so much, ESOPs become the way to aspire for a disproportionate share of returns of the company’s success as well, she says. That gamble doesn’t always pay off, and HR experts aver that the risks are loaded against the startup employees betting big on ESOPs. “For every Infosys, there would have been 100 or 1,000 tech startups that bit the dust — the same goes for their ESOPs,” says Padmaja Alaganandan, people & organisation head at PricewaterhouseCoopers India. ESOPs are a vehicle with inherent risk and uncertainty, she adds. If 99 of 100 startups fail, then it is logical that 99 out of 100 startup ESOPs will also fail to deliver value, adds Alaganandan. Shuchi Shukla Chief of staff, Belong, a data-driven hiring startup in Bengaluru Joined in August last year from Bain & Company where she worked as consultant Earlier worked with investment management teams at Accel Partners and Flipkart SALARY CUT: 30-40% ESOP: Yes High-risk gamble Manish Mehrotra is a startup employee who threw caution to the winds and opted for a higher chunk of stock options when he joined a grocery startup in Gurgaon in December 2014 at a very senior level. While the going was great initially and the startup was among the heavily funded ones, it hit choppy waters early this year and eventually shuttered. “I committed a blunder,” rues Mehrotra, adding that he didn’t understand the nature of the beast. Mehrotra thought that he would be able to encash his ESOPs after the vesting period of four years. But little did he know that the startup would fold within three. Like Mehrotra, Pooja Sahni too opted for a huge chunk of ESOPs when she joined an online payments company as product manager. Unlike Mehrotra, though, she chose to leave in a year. “I thought that I would get to encash the ESOPs after a few months,” she says. “I can’t stay at one place for four-five years.” Alaganandan of PwC India believes that it’s unfair to blame the vehicle without fully understanding the risks associated. Part of the problem, she contends, lies with unclear or misleading communication regarding ESOPs and their potential value by the prospective employer who may be keen to pitch them as a pot of gold or a guaranteed gain. Vinay Bagri CEO, NiYO, a fintech startup in Bengaluru Joined in March this year from ING where he was business head for three years Earlier had stints with Parle and ICICI SALARY CUT: 50% ESOP: Yes Another part of the problem lies with an inadequate understanding of the risks that prospective employees take while accepting these offers, as well as the expectation around an immediate payout. Another aspect that has given a bad name to ESOPs in startups is lack of clarity on issues such as the exercise price and the fair value. “It further leads to lack of transparency and confusion in the minds of employees,” she says. Unless an investor or the public actually pays for the valuation that a startup is commanding, all gains are notional. Citrus Pay founder Gupta, though, has proved that the gains can be real. Of late, he has got calls from a couple of founders who cursed him because suddenly their employees are now asking for formal ESOP letters. “Seems like change is in the air,” he grins.

By Julia Angwin, ProPublica When Google bought the advertising network DoubleClick in 2007, Google founder Sergey Brin said that privacy would be the company's "number one priority when we contemplate new kinds of advertising products." And, for nearly a decade, Google did in fact keep DoubleClick's massive database of web-browsing records separate by default from the names and other personally identifiable information Google has collected from Gmail and its other login accounts. But this summer, Google quietly erased that last privacy line in the sand – literally crossing out the lines in its privacy policy that promised to keep the two pots of data separate by default. In its place, Google substituted new language that says browsing habits "may be" combined with what the company learns from the use Gmail and other tools. The change is enabled by default for new Google accounts. Existing users were prompted to opt-in to the change this summer. click to enlarge The practical result of the change is that the DoubleClick ads that follow people around on the web may now be customized to them based on your name and other information Google knows about you. It also means that Google could now, if it wished to, build a complete portrait of a user by name, based on everything they write in email, every website they visit and the searches they conduct. The move is a sea change for Google and a further blow to the online ad industry's longstanding contention that web tracking is mostly anonymous. In recent years, Facebook, offline data brokers and others have increasingly sought to combine their troves of web tracking data with people's real names. But until this summer, Google held the line. "The fact that DoubleClick data wasn't being regularly connected to personally identifiable information was a really significant last stand," said Paul Ohm, faculty director of the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law. "It was a border wall between being watched everywhere and maintaining a tiny semblance of privacy," he said. "That wall has just fallen." Google spokeswoman Andrea Faville emailed a statement describing Google's change in privacy policy as an update to adjust to the "smartphone revolution" "We updated our ads system, and the associated user controls, to match the way people use Google today: across many different devices," Faville wrote. She added that the change "is 100% optional–if users do not opt-in to these changes, their Google experience will remain unchanged." (Read Google's entire statement.) Existing Google users were prompted to opt-into the new tracking this summer through a request with titles such as "Some new features for your Google account." The "new features" received little scrutiny at the time. Wired wrote that it "gives you more granular control over how ads work across devices." In a personal tech column, the New York Times also described the change as "new controls for the types of advertisements you see around the web." Connecting web browsing habits to personally identifiable information has long been controversial. Privacy advocates raised a ruckus in 1999 when DoubleClick purchased a data broker that assembled people's names, addresses and offline interests. The merger could have allowed DoubleClick to combine its web browsing information with people's names. After an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, DoubleClick sold the broker at a loss. In response to the controversy, the nascent online advertising industry formed the Network Advertising Initiative in 2000 to establish ethical codes. The industry promised to provide consumers with notice when their data was being collected, and options to opt out. Most online ad tracking remained essentially anonymous for some time after that. When Google bought DoubleClick in 2007, for instance, the company's privacy policy stated: "DoubleClick's ad-serving technology will be targeted based only on the non-personally-identifiable information." In 2012, Google changed its privacy policy to allow it to share data about users between different Google services - such as Gmail and search. But it kept data from DoubleClick – whose tracking technology is enabled on half of the top 1 million websites – separate. But the era of social networking has ushered in a new wave of identifiable tracking, in which services such as Facebook and Twitter have been able to track logged-in users when they shared an item from another website. Two years ago, Facebook announced that it would track its users by name across the Internet when they visit websites containing Facebook buttons such as "Share" and "Like" – even when users don't click on the button. (Here's how you can opt out of the targeted ads generated by that tracking). Offline data brokers also started to merge their mailing lists with online shoppers. "The marriage of online and offline is the ad targeting of the last 10 years on steroids," said Scott Howe, chief executive of broker firm Acxiom. To opt-out of Google's identified tracking, visit the Activity controls on Google's My Account page, and uncheck the box next to "Include Chrome browsing history and activity from websites and apps that use Google services."

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Why is the Google Pixel graded on a curve when the iPhone isn’t? Yoni Heisler BGR NewsOctober 22, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share During the original iPhone introduction, Steve Jobs referenced a favorite quote of his from legendary computer scientist Alan Kay: "People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware." This philosophy has formed the bedrock of Apple's business strategy for decades now, save for that brief dark period during the mid-90s when Apple sanctioned an ill-fated Mac clone initiative. Apple's devotion to both software and hardware is part of the reason why the iPhone often outclasses every other smartphones on the market. Undeniably, the ability to fine tune software and hardware to work together seamlessly and efficiently is a huge competitive advantage. That being the case, I've been especially intrigued with the Google Pixel as it marks Google's most serious effort to date to exert strict control over the entirety of the Android experience, from both a software and hardware perspective. We've seen Android flagships before, no doubt, but the Google Pixel was designed by Google from the ground up. DON'T MISS: iPhone 7 Plus vs Google Pixel speed tests: Closer, but Android was still crushed in the end As Google's Rick Osterloh explained to Bloomberg not too long ago, the Google Pixel has Google "managing inventory, building relationships with carriers, sourcing components, making supply chain deals and managing distribution." When reviews of the Google Pixel first started appearing online, I was excited to see if the hype behind the Pixel was real. Because competition is often a necessary component and driver of innovation, I was eager to see if the Google Pixel was a device that could potentially force Apple to step up its game. Most of the Google Pixel reviews I came across where overwhelmingly positive, but I couldn't help but notice that Google's smartphone, in many respects, was being afforded a pass that Apple's iPhone rarely, if ever, receives. Whereas the iPhone is seemingly criticized for minute and arguably petty reasons, some of the Google Pixel's shortcomings were curiously and conveniently glossed over with gusto. Touching on this very point, Rene Ritchie has a great piece up on iMore where he explains how the Pixel was graded by tech reviewers on curiously favorable curve. Remember: Google is a serious player in the smartphone business and the Pixel is priced as a premium handset. Consequently, one would imagine that the Pixel would be held up to the same level of scrutiny as the iPhone. Alas, this was hardly the case. The design of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s was lambasted mercilessly, and rightfully so given those unsightly antenna lines. In fact, many even brought up said design as evidence that Apple had lost its innovative edge along with its eye for industrial design. Meanwhile, the Google Pixel borrows many design elements from Apple's 2014 iPhone design and nobody bats an eye. It strikes me as odd that in 2016, an iPhone and an Android phone can look extremely similar and evoke completely opposite sentiments from reviewers. The Google Pixel by and large looks like an iPhone but some reviews viewed this as a positive because it was "familiar."  Meanwhile, if Apple doesn't introduce a groundbreaking new iPhone design every year, it's a sign that there's trouble in Cupertino. So, everyone who'd been criticizing Apple and iPhone design immediately called Google out for aping it? Not so much. Well, at least they called Google and Pixel out for the same things they called Apple and iPhone out for? Again, not so much. Bizarrely, some of the subtle improvements Apple incorporated into the iPhone 7 that were immediately categorized as minor or insignificant are completely missing from the Google Pixel. Ritchie writes: Surely they drew the line at Google's 2016 flagship missing optical image stabilization — not just in the regular-size, but in the Plus XL model as well — stereo speakers, and water resistance — things that were pointed to last year as indicators Apple was falling behind? I'm not saying that Apple should be immune from criticism, but it'd be nice if other companies, especially big players like Google, were held to the same set of expectations and standards that Apple has to live up to. Taking a look at any number of Pixel reviews, Google is given a pass for items that the press would absolutely obliterate Apple for. Read More Take Walt Mossberg's review, for example. Calling the Google Pixel "first rate" and the best Android phone he's ever tested, Mossberg quickly mentions that that the device's battery life was disappointing relative to Google's advertised specs. "It also isn’t water resistant, and is exclusive to only a single carrier, Verizon," Mossberg mentions before quickly moving on. And then there are the Google Pixel headphones. Oh wait, the Pixel doesn't come with any headphones. Speaking of earbuds, there’s good and bad news. The good: Google retained the industry-standard 3.5mm headphone jack. The bad: it doesn’t supply any earbuds for a $649 phone. The company says it assumes everyone has many pairs of buds lying around. I wound up using an old Samsung pair. Can you imagine the vitriolic outrage that would have resulted if Apple shipped an iPhone of any model with no headphones? It's also interesting that Google's new AI feature -- Google Assistant -- is being heaped with praise mostly because of its underlying potential. Google Assistant does seem to be a step up from Siri since it can handle contextual queries much more ably, but is it really that compelling of a feature in its current form? Mossberg writes: Here’s a series of questions I asked about the state where I live, without ever saying the state’s name except in the first question. The Assistant answered every question but one with a vocal reply, and answered all quickly and accurately: — What’s the population of Maryland? — Who’s the governor? — What’s the average household income? — What’s the land area? — Show me the state flag. — What’s the biggest county? I’m pretty sure I could have gone on. When I tried this with Siri, it handled the first one nicely, vocally and with a Wikipedia page. It answered the second by displaying an article defining the term governor. That's a nice perk for the Pixel, but is this really a huge selling point? As far as I can tell, the AI that Viv Software showed off is far more impressive. Besides, there are things that Siri can do that Google Assistant can't do quite yet, like reserving an Uber or Lyft. Still, not everyone was a fan of Google Assistant, as evidenced by this review from Michael Nunez of Gizmodo. I was particularly disappointed with Google Assistant because it’s such a promising concept. Google is moving attention away from the search bar more than ever. Instead, the company wants you to “Google” by using the messaging app Allo or voice search in Google Assistant. Ultimately, the Pixel and Pixel XL are gateways for feeding the Google brain more information about yourself. As Google’s AI gets smarter, the Assistant will become more helpful. While some people might find this creepy, I think the idea is exciting, and it’s a letdown that the tech isn’t there yet. In fairness nobody has it, and Google’s is better than what’s offered by competitors like Apple’s Siri and Microsoft’s Cortana. The point is that as a whole, smartphone assistants aren’t smart enough to be defining features. They’re gimmicks, and Google unwisely decided to build a phone around one. Meanwhile, another Pixel review on The Verge was quick to call Google's smartphone a "home run." Almost comically, one of the first few paragraphs reads: The Pixel is not waterproof, which is dumb and annoying. I should also note that a very short fall managed to crack the screen on the smaller Pixel during our review. A sample size of one is obviously too small to say that these devices are less durable than they ought to be, but it's not a great sign. All that said, I think it's great that Google released the Pixel. It's nice to see some solid competition in the premium smartphone space from a company not named Samsung. The Pixel seems like a compelling device, but let's be honest, the grading curve for Android is still a whole lot more lenient than it is for the iPhone.

NBC reported that a senior intelligence official has told the network that the hack “does not appear at this point to be any kind of state-sponsored or directed attack.” It may be that new evidence emerges that leads the U.S. intelligence community to change its opinion and identify a major state as a responsible party. The scarier possibility is that it wasn’t a state that did it. – – – The attack targeted the domain name system The Internet relies on a complicated mix of systems and protocols to work. Friday’s attack targeted one key aspect of the Internet — the domain name system. Every time that your desktop or phone browser asks to load the webpage for, say, http://www.washingtonpost.com, specialized servers need to turn the web address into a series of numbers — the so-called ‘IP address’ to figure out where the request ought to be sent to. The company that was hacked Friday runs part of the domain name system. The hackers sent so many requests to the domain name servers that they were completely overwhelmed. This kind of attack is called a ‘Distributed Denial of Service Attack’ or DDoS attack. It used to be thought of as a relatively unsophisticated instrument, and many forms of DDoS attack can be easily repelled, once the target of the attack realizes what is going on. Both activists (such as many members of the loose ‘Anonymous’ collective) and state actors (looking to silence inconvenient dissidents offshore) have used DDoS attacks in the past. Such attacks led Google to create Project Shield which was intended to deploy Google’s massive resources to protect actors who might otherwise be effectively silenced by nefarious actors. – – – These attacks have escalated Unfortunately, such attacks have escalated dramatically over time. The problem started with unsecured computers. Many people (almost certainly including readers of this article) are bad at keeping their computer operating systems updated, with the result that their computers have been quietly subverted and made part of ‘botnets’ made up of thousands of slaved machines. These computers can then be turned against a target system, repeatedly bombarding it with demands until it is effectively taken off the Internet. Criminals have herded botnets to blackmail the owners of e.g. gambling websites by threatening to keep them offline with DDoS attacks until a ransom is paid. Recently, however, the stakes have escalated yet again. The so-called ‘Internet of Things’ — the many consumer products which are somehow connected to the Internet — has created new opportunities for botnet herders, because these products tend to be badly secured and are usually never updated. Brian Krebs, a prominent writer and consultant on security, has often been targeted by various attacks by the criminals he writes about. Last month, he was hit by a truly massive attack mounted by a botnet of compromised devices. Friday’s attack uses the same ‘Mirai’ system, which was recently released into the wild so that anyone with moderate technical skills can use it to compromise and set up their own network of devices. – – – Anyone could be responsible As Krebs pointed out in a follow-up blogpost, the truly frightening thing is that anyone could be responsible. It used to be that only states had the firepower to mount really dramatic attacks like this. Now, as one of Krebs’s friends puts it, “When it comes to DDoS attacks, nation-states are just another player. so that . . .[t]oday’s reality is that DDoS attacks have become the Great Equalizer between private actors & nation-states.” One shouldn’t push this analogy too far. Other kinds of cyberattack — such as the attack that the United States and Israel reportedly mounted on the Iranian nuclear program — require bespoke skills and customization, and are out of the reach of all but sophisticated nation states. Even so, taking down a large chunk of the Internet, as Friday’s attack apparently did, is well within the grasp of small criminal groups and other ordinary actors. Equally, the fact that this is possible for ordinary actors may provide opportunities for states to undertake nefarious activities without getting the blame. Many of the techniques used to identify the perpetrators of cyberattacks rely on ‘fingerprints’ in the computer code underlying the attack. For example, if you are mounting one attack, it may be cheaper and easier for you to redeploy code that you have already used in others, than to write everything from scratch. This may, in turn, make it easier to identify you. Such identification techniques will be harder to use against DDoS attacks like this one, which deploy code that is widely available, and hence impossible to attribute to another actor. There may be other means of identification (for example, there might be bugs in the source code that could be exploited to pinpoint whoever is running it), but we don’t know for certain. This might tempt states as well as non-state actors to use this system to mount DDoS attacks in the belief that others will likely be blamed. – – – The underlying problem is tough to solve These attacks are likely to continue — and get worse — as long as more devices are released that can be subverted and slaved by botnets. Unfortunately, as another prominent security expert, Bruce Schneier, argues, that’s going to keep on happening. The producers of buggy and insecure cameras, baby monitors and so on have no incentive to improve them, since no one can sue them for the side effects of their carelessness. The users of the products don’t have any reason to care either. Schneier suggests that we might at least begin to address the problem by regulating manufacturers, or by making it possible for the victims of attacks, like Krebs, to sue them. This is, as Schneier certainly knows, unlikely under current political circumstances. The business community has resisted such mandates and rights for decades, and almost certainly still has enough political clout to continue to resist.

McIntyre October 22, 2016 9:25 am EST Print Email Tweet Search tops portal and social media, according to new data about visits to America’s largest websites in September. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google topped the list with 234 million unique visitors for the month, according to comScore. Second on the list is Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ: YHOO), which probably will be bought by Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ). It had 207 million unique visitors last month. Yahoo has the bad fortune that its bread and butter, online display ads, have dropped in price. While native and video ads have replaced this somewhat, Google and Facebook have as much as two-thirds of online ad revenue. According to Bloomberg: Google, the leading Internet search provider, and Facebook, the biggest social network operator, claimed 64 percent of that revenue, according to Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser. Google scooped up $30 billion and Facebook gathered $8 billion, while other smaller companies lost market share, the analyst noted. Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) had 205 million unique visitors. Following that is Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) with 192 million unique visitors. This includes MSN and visits to Microsoft company sites. Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), the online retail company, sits next at 184 million unique visitors. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) is well down the list in 22nd place, with 93 million unique visitors. It, and the revenue it gets online, show something of the wall that Wal-Mart has to climb. Two media properties are next: CBS Interactive from CBS Corp. (NYSE: CBS) at 168 million and Comcast Corp.’s (NASDAQ: CMCSA) NBCUniversal at 163 million. This includes all visitors to the cable, broadcast and studio sites, and gives some idea of why AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) would want Time Warner Inc. (NYSE: TWX), the sites of which are broken into pieces. Turner Digital, the largest of them, had unique visitors of 132 million. Behind CBS and Comcast, AOL, a division of Verizon, has 158 million. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) is next at 153 million. Among social media companies, LinkedIn Corp. (NYSE: LNKD) had 124 million, Twitter Inc. (NYSE: TWTR) 113 million and Pinterest 98 million. Mode Media, which closed in September, had 93 million unique visitors, which shows how little raw audience means. I'm interested in the Newsletter Get Newsletter terms and conditions   By Douglas A.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Siri and Google Assistant go head to head in new comparison video Yoni Heisler BGR NewsOctober 22, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share A lot has been made recently over Siri's shortcomings as an intelligent personal assistant, especially relative to the capabilities of Google Assistant on Google's new Pixel phones. Speaking to this point, Walt Mossberg not too long ago penned a widely circulated post lambasting Siri for its frustrating inability to answer layered questions. Siri has undoubtedly come a long ways since its introduction on the iPhone 4s back in 2011, but there's no getting around the fact that Apple's intelligent personal assistant faces increasingly stiff competition not only from Google, but also from Amazon and upstarts like Viv (now a Samsung property). DON'T MISS: Everything we know about Apple’s exciting next-gen MacBook Pro Making blanket comparisons between Siri and Google Assistant tends to be convenient, but it can also be misleading at times. While there are some things that Google Assistant excels at, there are also things that Siri can do that Google Assistant cannot. As a quick example, Google Assistant -- in its current form -- cannot order you an Uber while Siri can. All that said, Marques Brownlee recently posted an interesting video where he puts Apple's latest incarnation of Siri up against Google's vaunted new Google Assistant in a side-by-side competition. For as much praise as Google Assistant has received and for as much flack as Siri tends to receive, the results may surprise you. Google assistant is expectedly more nimble with context-based queries but Siri's answers, when it does have an answer, tend to be more informative. Starting out with some basic queries (i.e wake me up at 7:30 tomorrow morning, what's Tesla's stock price?) both Siri and Google Assistant are up to the task and perform dutifully. About 3 minutes in, Siri shows its first sign of failure. When asked who the president of the United States is, Google Assistant is quick to come up with the answer while Siri throws the query to Bing and lists out a few search results. When Brownlee next asks, "How tall is he?", Google Assistant recognizes that the context of the question is Barack Obama and returns the correct answer. Siri, meanwhile, remains clueless and once again returns Bing search results. However, when straight up asking, "How tall is Barack Obama?", Siri is able to answer quickly. The full video, which is well worth watching, can be viewed below. Siri certainly has tremendous room for improvement, but the gap between the two virtual assistants may not be as wide as you might assume. One interesting tidbit is that Brownlee found Google Assistant to be more personable than Siri, a feature which Siri used to excel at. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFiu5rfnhzo&feature=youtu.be Highlighting an instance where Siri outperforms Google Assistant, Brownlee at one point asks "Who won the Super Bowl?" While both return the correct answer, Siri's response contains more information as it displays a card with the final score along with a quarter-by-quarter scoring breakdown. siri-vs-google-assistantMore Trending right now: Everything we know about Apple’s exciting next-gen MacBook Pro Leaks show OnePlus is about to release an even faster smartphone Apple discovers that selling smartwatches for $15,000 doesn’t work See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next Donald Trump is already proving he has no idea what he is in for Quartz iOS 10 Hidden Feature: The Magnifier Yahoo Tech Online freedom hit by pressure on social media, apps AFP New hybrid console takes Nintendo on the go Yahoo Tech How Good Are the Walmart Black Friday TV Deals?

Thailand presses Google over online royal insults BBC News 22-10-2016 © Provided by BBC News Well-wishers hold a picture of Thailand"s King Bhumibol Adulyadej at the Siriraj hospital where he is residing, in Bangkok, Thailand, June 9, 2016. Reuters Thailand is mourning the death of King Bhumibol - who is protected from insult by law Google has agreed to co-operate with the removal of online content insulting Thailand's monarchy, the country's deputy prime minister says. Prajin Juntong said he had met Google representatives to complain about material found using the search engine and on YouTube, a Google subsidiary. Google said it was following its existing policies on content removal. Thais, which have the some of strictest lese majeste laws in the world, are mourning King Bhumibol Adulyadej. Mr Juntong said more than 100 pieces of content insulting to the monarchy have been found on Google services since he died on 13 October. Thailand's lese majeste laws explained Thailand's revered king dies at 88 Chanting banned at World Cup qualifier Thai mourning: What should tourists do? A spokesperson for Google told Reuters news agency that the company was following its guidelines for removal requests. "When we are notified of content that is illegal through official processes, we will restrict it in the country where it's illegal after a thorough review," they said. © Provided by BBC News Google Logo AFP Google receives thousands of takedown requests from law enforcement and governments every year Google periodically publishes data on such requests in what it calls "transparency reports" . In the six months between July and December 2015, it received 33 requests from the government of Thailand to remove content. Those requests covered 1,566 individual content items, 97% of which were cited as "government criticism". Google says it complied with 85% of the Thai government's requests - around 1,300 items - though it did not publish full details on how many items were restricted from viewing within Thailand or removed completely. 'Insult or threat' Article 112 of Thailand's criminal code says anyone who "defames, insults or threatens the king, the queen, the heir-apparent or the regent" will be punished with up to 15 years in prison. This has remained virtually unchanged since the creation of the country's first criminal code in 1908, although the penalty was toughened in 1976. However, there is no definition of what constitutes an insult to the monarchy. Complaints can be filed by anyone and they must always be formally investigated by the police. The details of the charges are rarely made public for fear of repeating the alleged offence.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple How to get Google's Pixel features on your Android phone Kyle Wiggers Digital TrendsOctober 22, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share You’ve undoubtedly seen the news about Google’s new smartphones, the Pixel and Pixel XL. Perhaps you’ve read a review or two. Maybe you’ve already double-checked your bank account and pre-ordered a unit. No matter which anticipatory stage you’ve reached, take comfort in knowing that some of the Pixel’s best features are based in software. Every Pixel admirer with an Android smartphone at his or her disposal can experience most of those features on the smartphone they already own, with a little patience, dedication, and electronic elbow grease. Related: Google’s Pixel is a new, exciting chapter for Android smartphones No unsanctioned procedure is without risk, of course, and that goes double for a device as indispensable as a smartphone. We can’t stress enough: if “APK” (Android’s app file format) and “sideloading” (shorthand for installing apps from unofficial sources) sound like foreign turns of phrase to you, and if you find the the idea of dealing with instability, missing features, and all-around bugginess the slightest bit unappealing, this guide isn’t for you. In the interest of covering our bases, there’s the elephant in the room: modified applications. Our guide links to apps that may or may not have been “messed with,” so to speak, at the code level. We’re taking care to source the files from a reputable website, but we can’t guarantee the apps in question don’t contain malicious or damaging code. Downloader be warned. If none of that’s deterred you and you’re confident in your ability to navigate the technical webs ahead, proceed with caution. Preparing your Android device First things first: you’ll need an Android device running Marshmallow 6.0 or newer. You’ll need to prepare it by (1) installing a freely available file explorer (e.g., ES File Explorer), and (2) permitting the installation of apps from third-party sources. Here’s how to allow the installation of apps from third-party sources: Open your device’s Settings menu. Scroll down and select the entry with the title Security or Lock screen and security. Tick or toggle the Unknown sources option. Press OK on the popup. Pixel Launcher extended-screenshot-2More One of the undisputed highlights of the Pixel’s new software is the Pixel Launcher, a home screen (technically) exclusive to the Pixel and Pixel XL. It’s cut from the same cloth as Google’s previous home screen app, the Google Now Launcher, in that it retains Android’s iconic app drawer, folders, and app shortcuts. But improvements and additions abound: There’s a new search icon and voice shortcut, plus a dynamic widget that reflects the current date and weather. There’s a new wallpaper picker, too, and a Google Calendar icon that matches the day’s date. If all that sounds appealing, good news: installing it is easy enough, but there’s a caveat. Thanks to myriad inter-dependencies, the Pixel Launcher won’t give you access to the Google Assistant, Google’s eponymous intelligent assistant. The Pixel Launcher’s “G” tab normally acts as a shortcut to the Assistant, but it’ll merely open the Google Search app on non-supported devices. Here’s how to install the Pixel Launcher: You’ll need two application files: the Pixel Launcher itself, and another that’ll pull a rotating collection of high-resolution wallpaper images from Google periodically, in the background. Download both using your device’s internet browser. Once both have finished downloading, use the file explorer you downloaded earlier to navigate to your device’s download folder and install the apps in question. After both finish installing, tap your device’s home screen. You’ll see an option to select the Pixel Launcher; tap it. That’s all there is to it! If you tire of the Pixel Launcher, switching back is easy enough. Here’s how: extended-screenshot-2More Read More Open your device’s Settings menu. Scroll down and select the entry with the title Apps. Tap the menu for the Pixel Launcher. Select the Clear defaults button. Tap your device’s home button and select the launcher of your choice. Camera app extended-screenshot-4More Google Camera may be available for compatible devices from the Play Store market, but the Pixel and Pixel XL pack a newer version of the app, v4.2, with features that haven’t quite made it to other phones just yet. There’s an overlay that adds shooting grids in 3×3, 4×4, and Golden Ratio configuration, plus a slider for manual exposure control. That’s not all: there’s also a lock focus option, new animations, and performance improvements across the board. The bleeding-edge Google Camera app doesn’t play as nicely with non-Pixel devices as the Pixel Launcher, unfortunately. Reddit and XDA users have reported success with the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P, but only models that have been updated to Android 7.0 Nougat; the app appears to crash on older Nexus devices, like the Nexus 6, and handsets from other manufacturers. There’s a sliver of a chance it might work on other phones, but for now, it’s likely a Nexus-only affair. If you’re willing to take the plunge, here’s how to install Google Camera v4.2: Download the Google Camera application using your device’s internet browser. After it finishes downloading, install it by navigating to your device’s download folder with your file manager of choice and tapping the Google Camera app. Tap Install. Once the installation finishes, you’ll see an icon for the Google Camera. That’s all there is to it. There’s another annoyance to note: if you’ve installed the Google Camera from the app store, it won’t replace it. Instead, you’ll have two Google Camera icons side-by-side in your app drawer. One workaround involves disabling or uninstalling the original Google Camera, but we recommend against it — put simply, it’s more trouble than it’s worth. Dialer extended-screenshot-3More There’s more to Google’s Pixels than a new home screen and camera app. Indeed, Google’s spruced up the Google Phone application — the dialer — with a cleaner, more intuitive UI. When you’re in a call, the background’s a translucent blue gradient atop your phone’s wallpaper. The in-call buttons have been enlarged, labeled a little more clearly, and moved below now-prominent Caller ID information. Incoming calls are now answered with an upward swipe (previously rightward) and declined with a downward swipe (previously leftward). On launchers that support it (including the Pixel Launcher and Action Launcher), the dialer’s icon lets you create a new contact from the home screen. The dialer, as with the camera, is a little capricious when it comes to compatibility. Users are reporting that it works on the Nexus 5X and 6P, but non-Nexus phones are a shot in the dark. Your mileage may very. Here’s how to install the Pixel dialer: Download the dialer application using your device’s internet browser. After the download completes, navigate to your phone’s download folder using a file browser, and select the Google Phone application. Tap Install. In order to use Google Phone, you’ll have to set it as your default dialer. Here’s how: Open Settings. Select the Apps menu. Tap the Gear icon in the top-right corner. Select Phone app from the list, and choose Phone. Rounded icons Fancy the Pixels’ spiffy rounded icons? You’re not the only one. Luckily, they’re easy to obtain: a crafty developer extracted them, packaged them in a compressed folder, and hosted the whole shebang online. Here’s how to nab ’em: extended-screenshotMore Download the icons using your device’s browser. Navigate to your device’s download folder using a file browser, and then extract the icons from the compressed folder. Install Awesome Icons, a free app from the Play Store. Now you’re ready to begin assigning new icons: Open Awesome Icons, and tap the image icon next to any compatible app. Select the entry under the Icons header, and then tap Picture. That’ll launch the Open from menu. From it, tap your file browser. Navigate to the folder containing the extracted icons, and select the icon that corresponds to the app you chose. At the cropping screen, ensure the selection area includes the entire icon. Hit Crop, then OK. Repeat the process for any remaining icons. The icons aren’t perfect, granted. They’ll only appear on your home screen, not your app drawer, and the list of supported apps is far from exhaustive, but for an unofficial fix, it ain’t bad. Google Assistant google-allo-hands-onMore There’s a way to get the Google Assistant on most modern Android devices, and it’s hardly a secret: Allo, Google’s new text messaging app. The Assistant’s accessible in a dedicated tab within the app, or by typing in “@google” before a query. We reviewed the Assistant thoroughly a few weeks back, but our consensus bears repeating: the Assistant’s really darn cool. It can look for restaurants nearby, pull up personal photos, run searches, look at flights, and find nearby events. It can provide quick access to a restaurant’s phone number and menu. It can play games like tic-tac-toe. And it can give you alerts at specific times of the day. Sadly, Google doesn’t intend to bring the Assistant to non-Pixel devices anytime soon. But take comfort in the fact that enterprising developers are actively attempting to shoehorn the Assistant into unsupported devices. Someday soon, you may not need a Pixel or Pixel XL to have Google’s conversational AI at your fingertips. Wallpapers google_wallpapers_phone-0More If you’re enamored by the incredible home screen wallpapers that ship with the Pixel and Pixel XL, good news: Google’s made it relatively easy to acquire something close to them. The firm’s Wallpaper app for Android provides a window into an extraordinary range of illustrations, photography, animations, and images optimized for your phone’s home screen, and they run the gamut in terms of content — you can expect subjects from solar phenomena to architectural hot spots. Perhaps best of all, the app packs an option to enable rotating Wallpapers: you can have the app select cycle through a gallery of pictures, if you so choose. Obtaining the Wallpapers app is easy enough. It’s available for download from the Google Play Store, and it’s compatible with Android devices running Android 4.1 and above.

 How Google embarrassed Apple Steve Kovach Oct. 22, 2016, 9:30 AM 189,277 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Reuters/Beck Diefenbach This week didn't look good for Apple. Google's new Pixel phone launched to positive reviews, largely because of the phone's new digital helper called Google Assistant. As I wrote in my review of the new Google Pixel, it’s relatively easy to make a high-end smartphone these days. The real challenge is lighting it up with unique software that helps you do more. And the new Google Assistant accomplishes just that. Right out of the gate, Assistant is noticeably smarter and more capable than Siri, a stark embarrassment for Apple, which had a five-year head start on Google. AI and voice control are considered to be the next big step in how we compute (just look at the early success of the Amazon Echo), and Google has already pulled ahead. Assistant is so good because it taps into Google’s vast network of products and culls them together into a single, all-knowing app. The more Google services like Calendar, Photos, and Gmail you use, the smarter Assistant gets. It’s also better at answering questions than the competition, thanks to its ability to tap into Google’s vast Knowledge Graph and deliver the single answer to the question you ask. Google Assistant has so many impressive skills that it’s impossible to list them all now. I’m still discovering new capabilities after almost two weeks with the Pixel. Here’s how I put it in my review: I haven't even come close to unlocking everything Assistant can do, but I was routinely surprised whenever I dreamed up something new to ask. Pull up the photos I took from my latest trip to San Francisco. Done. Give me the fastest route home. Done. Remind me to chat with my boss when I get to work tomorrow. Done. Play that Calvin Harris and Rihanna song. Done. Then there's the ability to tap into Google's vast knowledge of the web and deliver answers to the questions you ask. What time is the next presidential debate? Did the Jets win? Are there any good ramen restaurants near me, and can I get a reservation? I could go on and on, but you probably get the idea. Google has tens of billions of answers logged into its system, and it can pull even more from trusted sources like Wikipedia if it's stumped. It's almost always able to get you what you're looking for, though I did experience some rare cases in which it would pull up a standard list of Google search results. The shame here is that Siri had a five-year head start on Google Assistant, and Apple totally blew it. Siri struggles to answer even the simplest of queries. It wasn’t until two tech columnists recently pointed out those flaws that Siri quickly learned the answers to some of the questions they were griping about. Curious! The reality is Apple can’t be reactive and improve Siri every time someone blogs about its flaws.  Luckily, the pieces are in place, as Apple has acquired a series of AI and machine learning companies over the last year or so. Most notably, it bought the UK-based startup Vocal IQ, which as I reported earlier this year had technology that allowed users to control a phone or computer completely with voice. That also jibes with Apple’s near-term goal to make Siri fully capable of controlling the iPhone within the next few years, as Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported. But for now, Google Assistant is clearly in the lead, and that lead will only get wider as more people use it and increases its intelligence.

BANGKOK – Thailand’s Deputy Prime Minister Prajin Juntong met with representatives from Internet giant Google, amid growing calls from Thai hardline royalists to bring those who insult the monarchy to justice, as many Thais look with uncertainty to a future without their revered king. King Bhumibol Adulyadej’s passing on Oct. 13 has thrown the country of 67 million into mourning. It has also led to the rise of ultra-royalist vigilante groups who say they will punish anyone perceived to have insulted the monarchy during a highly sensitive time for Thailand. Deputy Prime Minister Prajin Juntong said he met with Google representatives in Bangkok on Friday . Google affirmed in the meeting with the Deputy PM that it would continue to help the government remove content from YouTube, a Google subsidiary, that it deemed offensive, he said. “If any website is inappropriate they said to get in touch with them and inform them of the URL and the time the content was found,” Prajin told reporters. That conforms with Google’s practice around the world, Alphabet Inc’s Google says. “We have always had clear and consistent policies for removal requests from governments around the world and we continue to operate in line with those policies,” a Google spokesperson in California told Reuters on Friday. “When we are notified of content that is illegal through official processes, we will restrict it in the country where it’s illegal after a thorough review.” NAMED AND SHAMED Thailand’s military government said on Tuesday it was tracking people suspected of insulting the monarchy following the king’s death and would ask other countries to extradite them. Some critics of the monarchy living abroad have been named and shamed in Thai language web forums. Outside the world of the web, some Thais who have chosen not to wear black, the official color of mourning, have been publicly jeered at. Thailand’s military government has tried to seek tighter censorship of social media from Facebook, Google and Japan-based instant messenger service LINE since it came to power in 2014 following a coup it said was necessary to restore peace to the country following months of unrest. Thailand’s royal insult law, known as Article 112 in the criminal code, makes it a crime to insult the king, queen, heir or regent. Those who are found guilty face up to 15 years in prison. The law has curtailed public discussion about the monarchy’s role and its future following the death of King Bhumibol who ruled for seven decades and was seen as a unifying figure. Since taking power in 2014, the junta, known officially as the National Council for Peace and Order, has taken a tough stance on dissenters. It has come under strong criticism from the international community for lengthy and unprecedented prison sentences handed down by military courts against civilians for violating the lese-majeste law since the junta took power. The military government has repeatedly rejected accusations of rights violations.

Answer: Because if feels weird to be on camera all day. Now, a new generation of video chat apps offers flexible new ways to maintain always-ready video chat sessions without making people feel like they're always on display. The secret is to be "always on" and available, but not "always live." Always-on video chat is perfect for digital nomads like me, as well as work-from-home telecommuters. It removes a sense of isolation, creates opportunity for break-room style serendipitous conversation and breaks down the formality of scheduling video chat sessions. Always-on video chat is also great for, well, everybody! We all have family and friends who live or work elsewhere. It's nice to just drop in on people and spend time with them. Theoretically, always-on group video chat should feel like hanging out with friends or co-workers in the same physical room. But it doesn't. Speaking of hanging out Five years ago, Google invented a new kind of group video chat called Hangouts and built it into its social network, Google+. I wrote in this space about a new concept for group video chat, which I called "ambient Hangouts." The column hit just before Christmas, and I suggested ambient Hangouts as a way to bring far-flung families together for the holidays. Even today, a few people still use Google Hangouts for always-live group video chat sessions. Trouble is, with always-live video, the camera is on you all day, and that can be uncomfortable. Also, when a single user is the only Hangouts participant for a while, Google terminates the session. The 'portal' idea Another approach to always-on video connections is the "portal." By setting up a videoconference session on a tablet, monitor or big-screen TV and leaving it running all day, always-live, remote offices can quickly communicate by walking up to the screen and instantly begin talking. Foursquare does this internally to connect its East- and West-Coast offices. Others have cobbled together their own solutions using Apple's Facetime or Microsoft's Skype. One company built an app in 2012 called Perch, which invited users to mount an iPad in two different locations. The app maintained an always-on video connection, which was activated using motion- and face-detection for always-on video, or it could be used optionally for always-on video connections. The split for Perch usage was 50% always-on, and 50% always-live. Unfortunately, Perch closed its doors last month. Perch CEO Danny Robinson told me that that the Perch "idea, market, customers, revenue were all moving up and to the right," but that friction between new, potential investors and the board led to the collapse of the startup. The good news is that Robinson also said he has 12 parties interested in a possible acquisition, so Perch might return to the market. When people can come and go as they please Remember Meerkat? The app last year popularized live-streaming video, a space now dominated by Facebook Live and Twitter's Periscope. This kind of live streaming involves one person streaming to an audience -- it's a one-way stream, although viewers can comment. Meerkat depended on Twitter for the sharing and discovery of live streams, and the use of Twitter enabled the app to go viral in its first month. But after Twitter bought Periscope, Meerkat's access to the Twitter "social graph" was cut off. Ultimately, Meerkat couldn't compete with Twitter's own alternative given Twitter's exclusivity on the network. The Meerkat app was removed last month and the service was shut down on Oct. 4. Meerkat was created by a startup called Life On Air. After the demise of Meerkat, the company got to work on a free iOS and Android app called Houseparty. Unlike Meerkat, Houseparty is for video chat -- few-to-few chat, rather than one-to-many streaming. In an unusual move, Life On Air published Houseparty under a fake name. Its developer was the non-existent "Alexander Herzick," and it operated under the radar for 10 months. The reason was to enable the company to "experiment and iterate without any hype," according to co-founder and COO Sima Sistani. Houseparty is aimed at everyone, but the user base skews young. Some 60% of Houseparty users are under the age of 24, according to Sistani. (The app's logo is one of those red plastic cups that frat houses use for playing beer pong, so it's not aimed at enterprises.) Houseparty is available via the company's iOS app. An Android version is in beta but available to the public on the Play Store. The idea behind Houseparty is that you can create a video space that's always "there," and family and friends can come and go as they please. This approach makes video conversations more casual and instant -- the same way co-workers would drop in on your cubicle for a quick chat, or friends might swing by to say hi. Instead of "arranging a call" or interrupting someone while they're in the middle of something, you simply create an open invitation for any number of people, then tell the app you're "Here." Set it and forget it. When other invited users are available, they can pop in for a group chat. As new users join, each window gets smaller to make room for the additional participants. With a few people on a single call, it creates a kind of Brady Bunch effect, with video windows tiled all over the screen. The effect works whether in landscape or portrait mode, even when some participants hold their phone one way and others hold it the other. It doesn't matter. Meerkat was declared a runaway success when it gained 300,000 users. Houseparty already has more than a million users, according to Sistani. Houseparty solves the need to either schedule a video chat, or interrupt people when they're busy. By setting up an open invitation to chat with all your family and friends, you can enjoy spontaneous, casual interaction whenever it's convenient. When the team is always 'there,' but with instant video chat on demand Another approach comes from a new application called Sneek. Think of Sneek as a kind of desktop Houseparty for professionals, an always-on video chat application for teams. A software company called Analog Republic launched the service three weeks ago. The company has 12 employees scattered all over the U.K. and U.S. and needed a solution for staying connected all day, according to co-founder Del Currie. So they built it for themselves and liked it so much they launched a public version. Here's how it works: Each team member is represented by a photo, which their webcam snaps at a user-determined interval -- either every minute or every five minutes. You can also pose for and snap a static picture manually. By choosing pixelated mode, your photo will be pixelated for a little more privacy. You can set a status message, which is displayed under your face. To chat with anyone or everyone, a simple click on a face or several faces instantly launches a video chat with whoever was clicked on. You can chat in Brady Bunch mode, or go fullscreen. The full-screen mode works just like Google Hangouts. Whoever's talking goes fullscreen, but you can override this by clicking on a person's face to see only that one person. Users set availability. So if you're away, the camera turns off. If you're at your desk but too busy to chat on video, team members can see your picture, but can't instantly start video chat. When talking is urgent but a team member is busy, you can click on their photo, which plays a knocking sound, and they can answer if they choose. You can also use a couple of Slack commands to launch or invite others to Sneek, and also share other users' profile snaps. Sneek provides a sense of presence for the team, and the kind of immediacy with communication that you'd have working together in the same office, but with multi-layered options for privacy and to eliminate the weirdness of being on live video all day. Sneek operates on a freemium model, but the free version doesn't offer video chat. You can use the "presence" features, including the photo snaps and status messages, but then you'd need to establish a video chat using Skype or some other software. The Pro version costs $10 per month, or $108 per year, and gives you the full, instant-video chat feature I mentioned. Sneek offers a free, 14-day trial, so you can try the Pro version for two weeks. Sneak works in a Chrome browser, or in a downloadable desktop application, available on OS X and Windows. A Linux version is promised "soon." The company is also planning an iOS version in early 2017 and an Android version after that, according to Currie. Video chat and videoconferencing is a great medium. Doing it the old way was stilted, awkward and formal, and always-live video chat felt intrusive. With Houseparty and Sneek, you can break down the walls of formality and create a sense of "presence," without feeling like you're in the spotlight all day.

Google has at last entered the race for home automation. In this way, the premium choices available for coordinating the diverse devices in your smart home were Amazon Echo and Apple Home. That implied picking between a defective monopoly and a smartphone application. Regardless of which one you possessed, you would dependably remain at the risk of being underwhelmed and constrained into narrowing by a single franchise. Be that as it may, with the presentation of Google Home, things have turned somewhat flexible in the domain of home automation, bringing forth a fairly solid competition. What is it? Google Home is a Wi-Fi speaker that additionally acts as a smarthome control centre and an assistant for the entire family. You can utilize it to playback entertainment all through your house, easily manage each day tasks, and ask Google what you need to know. What would it be able to do? In the event that you have a Chromecast, Google Home can control your TV. If you have Chromecast Audio, Google Home can control your speakers. If you have multiple Google Home devices, Google Home can play and sync music playback over every one of them. On the off chance that you have a perfect smart home setup, Google Home can control your house. To interact with the speaker, you basically say, "OK, Google" or tap on the capacitive top surface. You express your query and Google Assistant will respond. The component itself is exceptionally simple, however the associated AI makes it powerful. Google Home is available for pre-order at this moment in the US at a cost from $129 (around Rs 8,600).

As ever, many thanks for reading. Bye!

Nick Tompkins was excellent as a late replacement for Brad Barritt, Owen Farrell continues to impress on his comeback from injury and Richard Wigglesworth was typically classy. The big concern will be Maro Itoje, who went off with a hand injury. The Scarlets deserve credit for sticking to the task but they were eventually outgunned and now face a daunting double header against Toulon.

So if Itoje has an injury that means he can’t play against the Springboks, is that enough potential opensides out to constitute ‘exceptional circumstances?’ Does the new EPS agreement even contain the words ‘exceptional circumstances?

Eddie Jones will be worried about that. And after Alistair Hargreaves recent retirement, Kruis’ ankle surgery and a failure to agree a deal for Eben Etzebeth, Saracens are considerably short at lock if he’s out for any length of time.

Castres were impressive, far better than their defeat to Leinster last weekend, but Northampton were just awful. They’ve scored only 10 tries in the Premiership – the second least – and for a long time they looked like they may finish scoreless.

Twitter Always-on group video chat arrives Two innovative startups figured out all-day video chat sessions, without making it weird Mike Elgan (Computerworld (US)) 22 October, 2016 22:01 - - - - print email Comments Question: Why not launch video sessions with family, friends or co-workers and leave them running all the time? Answer: Because if feels weird to be on camera all day. Now, a new generation of video chat apps offers flexible new ways to maintain always-ready video chat sessions without making people feel like they're always on display. The secret is to be "always on" and available, but not "always live." Always-on video chat is perfect for digital nomads like me, as well as work-from-home telecommuters. It removes a sense of isolation, creates opportunity for break-room style serendipitous conversation and breaks down the formality of scheduling video chat sessions. Always-on video chat is also great for, well, everybody! We all have family and friends who live or work elsewhere. It's nice to just drop in on people and spend time with them. Theoretically, always-on group video chat should feel like hanging out with friends or co-workers in the same physical room. But it doesn't. Speaking of hanging out Five years ago, Google invented a new kind of group video chat called Hangouts and built it into its social network, Google+. I wrote in this space about a new concept for group video chat, which I called "ambient Hangouts." The column hit just before Christmas, and I suggested ambient Hangouts as a way to bring far-flung families together for the holidays. Even today, a few people still use Google Hangouts for always-live group video chat sessions. Trouble is, with always-live video, the camera is on you all day, and that can be uncomfortable. Also, when a single user is the only Hangouts participant for a while, Google terminates the session. The 'portal' idea Another approach to always-on video connections is the "portal." By setting up a videoconference session on a tablet, monitor or big-screen TV and leaving it running all day, always-live, remote offices can quickly communicate by walking up to the screen and instantly begin talking. Foursquare does this internally to connect its East- and West-Coast offices. Others have cobbled together their own solutions using Apple's Facetime or Microsoft's Skype. One company built an app in 2012 called Perch, which invited users to mount an iPad in two different locations. The app maintained an always-on video connection, which was activated using motion- and face-detection for always-on video, or it could be used optionally for always-on video connections. The split for Perch usage was 50% always-on, and 50% always-live. Unfortunately, Perch closed its doors last month. Perch CEO Danny Robinson told me that that the Perch "idea, market, customers, revenue were all moving up and to the right," but that friction between new, potential investors and the board led to the collapse of the startup. The good news is that Robinson also said he has 12 parties interested in a possible acquisition, so Perch might return to the market. When people can come and go as they please Remember Meerkat? The app last year popularized live-streaming video, a space now dominated by Facebook Live and Twitter's Periscope. This kind of live streaming involves one person streaming to an audience -- it's a one-way stream, although viewers can comment. Meerkat depended on Twitter for the sharing and discovery of live streams, and the use of Twitter enabled the app to go viral in its first month. But after Twitter bought Periscope, Meerkat's access to the Twitter "social graph" was cut off. Ultimately, Meerkat couldn't compete with Twitter's own alternative given Twitter's exclusivity on the network. The Meerkat app was removed last month and the service was shut down on Oct. 4. Meerkat was created by a startup called Life On Air. After the demise of Meerkat, the company got to work on a free iOS and Android app called Houseparty. Unlike Meerkat, Houseparty is for video chat -- few-to-few chat, rather than one-to-many streaming. In an unusual move, Life On Air published Houseparty under a fake name. Its developer was the non-existent "Alexander Herzick," and it operated under the radar for 10 months. The reason was to enable the company to "experiment and iterate without any hype," according to co-founder and COO Sima Sistani. Houseparty is aimed at everyone, but the user base skews young. Some 60% of Houseparty users are under the age of 24, according to Sistani. (The app's logo is one of those red plastic cups that frat houses use for playing beer pong, so it's not aimed at enterprises.) Houseparty is available via the company's iOS app. An Android version is in beta but available to the public on the Play Store. The idea behind Houseparty is that you can create a video space that's always "there," and family and friends can come and go as they please. This approach makes video conversations more casual and instant -- the same way co-workers would drop in on your cubicle for a quick chat, or friends might swing by to say hi. Instead of "arranging a call" or interrupting someone while they're in the middle of something, you simply create an open invitation for any number of people, then tell the app you're "Here." Set it and forget it. When other invited users are available, they can pop in for a group chat. As new users join, each window gets smaller to make room for the additional participants. With a few people on a single call, it creates a kind of Brady Bunch effect, with video windows tiled all over the screen. The effect works whether in landscape or portrait mode, even when some participants hold their phone one way and others hold it the other. It doesn't matter. Meerkat was declared a runaway success when it gained 300,000 users. Houseparty already has more than a million users, according to Sistani. Houseparty solves the need to either schedule a video chat, or interrupt people when they're busy. By setting up an open invitation to chat with all your family and friends, you can enjoy spontaneous, casual interaction whenever it's convenient. When the team is always 'there,' but with instant video chat on demand Another approach comes from a new application called Sneek. Think of Sneek as a kind of desktop Houseparty for professionals, an always-on video chat application for teams. A software company called Analog Republic launched the service three weeks ago. The company has 12 employees scattered all over the U.K. and U.S. and needed a solution for staying connected all day, according to co-founder Del Currie. So they built it for themselves and liked it so much they launched a public version. Here's how it works: Each team member is represented by a photo, which their webcam snaps at a user-determined interval -- either every minute or every five minutes. You can also pose for and snap a static picture manually. By choosing pixelated mode, your photo will be pixelated for a little more privacy. You can set a status message, which is displayed under your face. To chat with anyone or everyone, a simple click on a face or several faces instantly launches a video chat with whoever was clicked on. You can chat in Brady Bunch mode, or go fullscreen. The full-screen mode works just like Google Hangouts. Whoever's talking goes fullscreen, but you can override this by clicking on a person's face to see only that one person. Users set availability. So if you're away, the camera turns off. If you're at your desk but too busy to chat on video, team members can see your picture, but can't instantly start video chat. When talking is urgent but a team member is busy, you can click on their photo, which plays a knocking sound, and they can answer if they choose. You can also use a couple of Slack commands to launch or invite others to Sneek, and also share other users' profile snaps. Sneek provides a sense of presence for the team, and the kind of immediacy with communication that you'd have working together in the same office, but with multi-layered options for privacy and to eliminate the weirdness of being on live video all day. Sneek operates on a freemium model, but the free version doesn't offer video chat. You can use the "presence" features, including the photo snaps and status messages, but then you'd need to establish a video chat using Skype or some other software. The Pro version costs $10 per month, or $108 per year, and gives you the full, instant-video chat feature I mentioned. Sneek offers a free, 14-day trial, so you can try the Pro version for two weeks. Sneak works in a Chrome browser, or in a downloadable desktop application, available on OS X and Windows. A Linux version is promised "soon." The company is also planning an iOS version in early 2017 and an Android version after that, according to Currie. Video chat and videoconferencing is a great medium. Doing it the old way was stilted, awkward and formal, and always-live video chat felt intrusive. With Houseparty and Sneek, you can break down the walls of formality and create a sense of "presence," without feeling like you're in the spotlight all day.

(REUTERS/Dado Ruvic) These days, a new car is basically a computer with wheels. Trunks open automatically. The car parks itself. Rear cameras show you what you can’t see. If you lock your keys inside, you can open the doors by satellite. The flashiest new gadget: a touch screen in the middle of your dashboard. There’s a lot to love about these infotainment systems. Depending on the brand, you can organize your music, program the GPS and dictate text messages. Console screens are as wide as small tablets and they’re easy to read, even when you’re behind the wheel. But there’s a cost: Many of these services require subscriptions for services like in-vehicle Wi-Fi hotspots, Sirius XM satellite radio and live traffic data. You may start with a free trial, grow accustomed to the conveniences and then find yourself paying fees later on. These costs can add up over time, and the final tally might surprise you — especially when you set up automatic payment. You might not realize how much you’re shelling out for car-based infotainment until you look over your credit card statement. How do you avoid getting caught unaware? Here are some preventive measures. Grill the auto dealer Buying a car is an ordeal. Even when we’ve picked our dream car, we tend to drive away from the dealership exhausted. (Tip in a Tip: If you’re hunting for a new car, there’s an app that makes it easy. Click here to find your perfect car. ) The last thing you want to think about is whether the console uses Apple Maps or Google Maps. But this is a critical time, because the dealer may want you to subscribe to as many services as possible. Don’t let salespeople confuse you. There’s no reason to sign up for anything on the first day. All enrollments are voluntary, and these apps will be available whenever you want them. Infotainment systems are still new, and every car company has its own technology and services. Each system has distinct benefits and drawbacks: Volvo’s Sensus Connect has a touch screen you can use while wearing gloves. Ford’s Sync 3 uses a Blackberry-based system, and it’s a vast improvement on earlier versions. Android Auto will appeal to Google and Microsoft users, while Apple CarPlay is designed for Apple fans. Your preference for Apple or Android devices will likely influence your next car’s make and model. On my site, I have information about both systems. Most importantly, click here to see which system is preloaded into different car makes and models. A responsible auto rep will tell you all about these consoles and infotainment services. Ask how long the free trial lasts and how much the subscription will eventually cost. Grill them about cancellation policies, especially for features you’re not sold on. If any of these explanations sound fishy, just decline. Better to learn about your new car and drive it for a few hundred miles before adding features you may never even use. Remember your smartphone When it comes to vehicle infotainment, I don’t use any paid subscriptions. I use my phone instead. The truth is, most upmarket cars come with USB or audio ports that let you plug your smartphone directly into your vehicle’s system. For years, tech-savvy drivers have listened to music on their phones and held hands-free conversations through their car’s radio and speakers. An infotainment system is just a more sophisticated version of these radios and speakers. You can usually connect your phone directly to your infotainment console, which accesses all the music, podcasts, GPS, and streaming services you already have, and you don’t have to pay an extra penny. There is one downside: Using your phone for navigation and streaming services while driving may devour your data plan. The same goes for “tethering” a device to your phone, a technique some passengers use to access the internet during commutes. To avoid a data famine, you can download podcasts or audiobooks ahead of time, especially for long trips. It’s also a good idea to track your data use so you won’t go over the limit.

That’s right, no more clicking through to a lyrics site to get what you’re looking for, Google will return it immediately. This is made possible thanks to a multi-year deal between Toronto-based lyric licensing company LyricFind. The partnership between the two companies also creates a new revenue stream for artists. While the terms of the deal haven’t been disclosed, LyricFind CEO and co-founder Darryl Ballantyne has been quoted as saying it will be “a significant revenue stream” that could result in publishers and songwriters earning millions. The payout for artists is based on impressions. Royalties are earned whenever a set of lyrics is displayed in Google’s search results. So the more often a song gets searched for, the greater the payout for the artist. There’s no doubt that this addition to Google search will result in less traffic to lyrics sites — but is that necessarily a bad thing? Most lyrics sites earn money through advertising despite have no permission to reprint the lyrics contained on the site. In turn, that also means the artists receive no royalties when lyrics are viewed. This change is unfortunate for licensed lyrics sites who will almost certainly see their traffic decline going forward. The deal between Google and LyricFind creates a sense of legitimacy to lyrics search, as Google gets the rights to legally display song lyrics while artists receive the royalties they deserve. In addition, every lyrics snippet card will contain a link to purchase the song on Google Play, which could create even more revenue for Google and musicians. The new lyrics cards are live today in US English search results.

Google Has Quietly Dropped Ban on Personally Identifiable Web Tracking ProPublica 10/22/2016 Julia Angwin © Provided by ProPublica When Google bought the advertising network DoubleClick in 2007, Google founder Sergey Brin said that privacy would be the company’s “number one priority when we contemplate new kinds of advertising products.” And, for nearly a decade, Google did in fact keep DoubleClick’s massive database of web-browsing records separate by default from the names and other personally identifiable information Google has collected from Gmail and its other login accounts. But this summer, Google quietly erased that last privacy line in the sand – literally crossing out the lines in its privacy policy that promised to keep the two pots of data separate by default. In its place, Google substituted new language that says browsing habits “may be” combined with what the company learns from the use Gmail and other tools. Popular Searches Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 105.71 -2.72 -2.51% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▼ 58.12 -0.90 -1.52% Samsung Electronics Co Ltd SSNLF ▼ 1,250.00 -175.00 -12.28% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 719.07 -19.94 -2.70% The change is enabled by default for new Google accounts. Existing users were prompted to opt-in to the change this summer.   The practical result of the change is that the DoubleClick ads that follow people around on the web may now be customized to them based on your name and other information Google knows about you. It also means that Google could now, if it wished to, build a complete portrait of a user by name, based on everything they write in email, every website they visit and the searches they conduct. The move is a sea change for Google and a further blow to the online ad industry’s longstanding contention that web tracking is mostly anonymous. In recent years, Facebook, offline data brokers and others have increasingly sought to combine their troves of web tracking data with people’s real names. But until this summer, Google held the line. “The fact that DoubleClick data wasn’t being regularly connected to personally identifiable information was a really significant last stand,” said Paul Ohm, faculty director of the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law. “It was a border wall between being watched everywhere and maintaining a tiny semblance of privacy,” he said. “That wall has just fallen.” Google spokeswoman Andrea Faville emailed a statement describing Google’s change in privacy policy as an update to adjust to the “smartphone revolution” “We updated our ads system, and the associated user controls, to match the way people use Google today: across many different devices,” Faville wrote. She added that the change “is 100% optional–if users do not opt-in to these changes, their Google experience will remain unchanged.” (Read Google’s entire statement.) Existing Google users were prompted to opt-into the new tracking this summer through a request with titles such as “Some new features for your Google account.” The “new features” received little scrutiny at the time. Wired wrote that it “gives you more granular control over how ads work across devices.” In a personal tech column, the New York Times also described the change as “new controls for the types of advertisements you see around the web.” Connecting web browsing habits to personally identifiable information has long been controversial. Privacy advocates raised a ruckus in 1999 when DoubleClick purchased a data broker that assembled people’s names, addresses and offline interests. The merger could have allowed DoubleClick to combine its web browsing information with people’s names. Afteran investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, DoubleClick sold the broker at a loss. In response to the controversy, the nascent online advertising industry formed theNetwork Advertising Initiative in 2000 to establish ethical codes. The industry promisedto provide consumers with notice when their data was being collected, and options to opt out. Most online ad tracking remained essentially anonymous for some time after that. When Google bought DoubleClick in 2007, for instance, the company’s privacy policy stated: “DoubleClick’s ad-serving technology will be targeted based only on the non-personally-identifiable information.” In 2012, Google changed its privacy policy to allow it to share data about users between different Google services - such as Gmail and search. But it kept data from DoubleClick – whose tracking technology is enabled on half of the top 1 million websites – separate. But the era of social networking has ushered in a new wave of identifiable tracking, in which services such as Facebook and Twitter have been able to track logged-in users when they shared an item from another website. Two years ago, Facebook announced that it would track its users by name across the Internet when they visit websites containing Facebook buttons such as “Share” and “Like” – even when users don’t click on the button. (Here’s how you can opt out of the targeted ads generated by that tracking). Offline data brokers also started to merge their mailing lists with online shoppers. “The marriage of online and offline is the ad targeting of the last 10 years on steroids,” saidScott Howe, chief executive of broker firm Acxiom. To opt-out of Google’s identified tracking, visit the Activity controls on Google’s My Account page, and uncheck the box next to “Include Chrome browsing history and activity from websites and apps that use Google services." You can also delete past activity from your account.  Go to MSN Home More in Money Amazing Airstreams: The coolest tiny homes on wheels Lovemoney 8 ways President Trump will affect Wall Street U.S. News & World Report - Money 6 reasons to think twice before moving to Canada MarketWatch The 10 most expensive prescription drugs in America Fiscal Times How China's richest man is buying up the world Lovemoney 7 things you should never do online USA TODAY Up Next 20 tips for saving money at the grocery store U.S. News & World Report - Money AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More from ProPublica Revenge of the Forgotten Class ProPublica Facebook Says it Will Stop Allowing Some Advertisers to Exclude Users by Race ProPublica Thousands of Potentially Wrongful Convictions; Years of Delayed Action ProPublica 2016 Election Lawsuit Tracker: The New Election Laws and the Suits Challenging Them ProPublica ProPublica View the full site Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

Share Tweet Whatsapp Email Share Google removing Thai royal insults posts - Yahoo7 Pinterest Tumblr Thailand's government has met with representatives from Internet giant Google, amid growing calls from Thai hardline royalists to bring those who insult the monarchy to justice, as many Thais look with uncertainty to a future without their revered king. King Bhumibol Adulyadej's death on October 13 has thrown the country of 67 million into mourning. It has also led to the rise of ultra-royalist vigilante groups who say they will punish anyone perceived to have insulted the monarchy during a highly sensitive time for Thailand. Deputy Prime Minister Prajin Juntong said he met with Google representatives in Bangkok on Friday. Google affirmed in the meeting that it would continue to help the government remove content from YouTube, a Google subsidiary, that it deemed offensive, he said. "If any website is inappropriate they said to get in touch with them and inform them of the URL and the time the content was found," Prajin told reporters. That conforms with Google's practice around the world, Alphabet Inc's Google says. "We have always had clear and consistent policies for removal requests from governments around the world and we continue to operate in line with those policies," a Google spokesperson in California told Reuters on Friday. "When we are notified of content that is illegal through official processes, we will restrict it in the country where it's illegal after a thorough review." Thailand's military government said on Tuesday it was tracking people suspected of insulting the monarchy following the king's death and would ask other countries to extradite them. Some critics of the monarchy living abroad have been named and shamed in Thai language web forums. Outside the world of the web, some Thais who have chosen not to wear black, the official colour of mourning, have been publicly jeered at. Thailand's military government has tried to seek tighter censorship of social media from Facebook, Google and Japan-based instant messenger service LINE since it came to power in 2014 following a coup it said was necessary to restore peace to the country following months of unrest.

Nikita Richardson and Christina Farr 10.17.16 6:00 AM Roku As it introduces its next generation of TV sticks and players this fall, the country’s most popular enabler of cord cutting is already thinking beyond set-top boxes. Roku today commands 49% of the U.S. streaming-device market, ahead of Google and Amazon. But behind the scenes, the hardware maker is steadily becoming more of a streaming platform, an interesting move considering Roku’s origins as a Netflix spin-out in 2008. In the past two years, cable providers, including Time Warner, Charter, and, soon, Comcast, have added their own streaming services, and dozens of new TV shows, on Roku, making the platform even more of a one-stop shop for television. Meanwhile, smart-TV makers such as Sharp, Insignia, and Hisense have installed Roku’s in the back ends of their products, giving users access to Amazon Instant Video, Netflix, Hulu, and more. "We believe that the [operating system] phenomenon is now happening with TVs," says Roku CEO Anthony Wood. "Our business is to distribute our system to as many TV screens as we can and then monetize that base." The early results are promising: Just two years into its smart-TV efforts, Roku claims 15% of the market (behind Google’s 18%) and has seen its media and licensing sector grow from 20% to 44% of gross profit. And with 10.6 million subscribers across cable, TV, and devices, Roku can sell valuable demographic data to advertisers and marketers eager to reach cord cutters. "One aspect that’s an advantage for us is we’re a neutral party, we don’t make our own content," says Wood. "We’re a level playing field for content providers to compete on." —Nikita Richardson [Illustration: Kuocheng Liao] Milestones: In September, Roku landed in Asia, announcing a licensing deal with PLDT, the Philippines’ largest telecom company. Challenges: Google’s Chromecast device is growing more powerful, thanks to full integration with its Chrome web browser and the release earlier this fall of a new 4K-enabled version of the device. Buzz: Positive Digging deeper: 23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki wants scientists to use her genomic database to scale research. 23Andme This past August, with backing from Pfizer, researchers from 23andMe and Massachusetts General Hospital sent a ripple through the scientific community with the announcement that they had identified several genetic markers associated with depression, ending years of frustrated efforts to locate the genetic risks for the pervasive mental illness. Just as significant: The study was based on data from more than 120,000 people who had reported a diagnosis of depression to 23andMe, the genetics testing-kit company that has become a hit with people searching for their personal history in their DNA. A study of this size "wouldn’t have been possible before," says 23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki. "We’re hoping to enable a kind of research that has never been done." The Silicon Valley company has come a long way since 2013, when federal regulators ordered Wojcicki and her team to stop marketing its at-home genomics service. Today, it is working closely with the Food and Drug Administration to share select genetic-derived health reports directly with consumers—without a doctor’s note. The vast majority of 23andMe’s 1.2 million customers, who sign up for an at-home genetic test, agree to participate in research studies and surveys. So far, they’ve answered more than 350 million survey questions. The company says the scientific community is now waking up to the potential of this database, though 23andMe has been engaging in research projects for years. "Research studies don’t normally have hundreds of thousands of people," says Wojcicki. "We can help with that." —Christina Farr Milestones: 23andMe’s new Genotyping Services for Research program has made it possible for scientists to access customer data for their own studies. Challenges: Some customers are wondering whether they should receive compensation for making their DNA available to researchers. Buzz: Positive HTC Milestones: Consumer electronics maker HTC is capitalizing on the success of its Vive virtual-reality device; it recently turned the division into a wholly owned subsidiary and launched a new $100 million VR accelerator. Challenges: The company faces wider financial issues, and with revenue down 44% year over year, sales of its new HTC 10 phone continue to flag. In August, T-Mobile stopped selling the phone after just two months. Buzz: Neutral SalesForce Milestones: In Septem­ber, the sales software maker announced Einstein, a new suite of AI-enabled products designed to help clients by predicting the most promising sales leads and alerting them when a competitor hones in on their territory. Challenges: Salesforce hopes to fend off both Oracle and Microsoft, which recently beat out the company to purchase LinkedIn for $26.2 billion. Buzz: Positive WeWork Milestones: In an effort to build more long-term relationships with clients, coworking-space startup WeWork is experimenting with a yearlong lease option with a significant discount. Challenges: After cutting its profit forecast by 78%, an internal memo from CEO Adam Neumann recently urged employees to save energy, reduce the number of expensed meals, and take other cost-cutting measures. Buzz: Neutral Sony Milestones: This month, Sony will release a new 4K- and high-dynamic range-enabled Pro version of its popular PS4 console in a bid to attract players looking for higher-quality gaming experiences. Challenges: Sony follows in the footsteps of rival Microsoft and its Xbox One S console (released earlier this year) and, with future iterations, promises to feature more powerful graphic-rendering software than the PS4 Pro. Buzz: Positive Kind Bars' new fruit bars Kind Snacks Milestones: In August, Kind became the first snack manufacturer to break out its added sugar numbers, two years ahead of the FDA’s deadline to publish such information. Meanwhile, the company is rolling out new fruit bars that contain between 14% and 56% less added sugar than prior recipes. Challenges: With U.S. sales of energy and nutrition bars hitting $2.5 billion in 2015, big players Pepsi­Co and Hershey are joining the fray with their own healthy snack brands. Buzz: Neutral Coursera Milestones: Looking to diversify its user base and find new revenue streams, online education site Coursera recently launched Coursera for Business, which companies such as L’Oréal, Axis Bank, and BCG will use to train their employees and enroll new talent. Challenges: Coursera is still struggling to become profitable, as many people use its online courses for free, and is running up against competitors such as Harvard Business School and Udacity for the same customers. Buzz: Negative Tala (Inventure) Milestones: Originally focused on offering short-term, credit-building loans to people in Africa and India, InVenture has taken a new name, Tala, and shifted to mobile banking services, allowing users to make and send payments and track their credit score in real time. Challenges: Tala is still relatively small and has yet to reach the size or potential of African mobile payments juggernauts like Safaricom’s M-Pesa, which currently has more than 20 million users in Kenya. Buzz: Positive Equinox Milestones: Equinox has hired Four Seasons exec Chris Norton as the first CEO of its forthcoming luxury hotel brand, due in 2019. Earlier this summer, Equinox also tapped Generator Hostels founder Josh Wyatt as the hotel’s president. Challenges: With the first hotel’s grand opening still nearly three years away, the gym brand must maintain its momentum to avoid playing catch-up with other wellness-themed brands, including Barry Sternlicht’s growing 1 Hotels, which feature SoulCycle studios.

And, for nearly a decade, Google did in fact keep DoubleClick's massive database of web-browsing records separate by default from the names and other personally identifiable information Google has collected from Gmail and its other login accounts. But this summer, Google quietly erased that last privacy line in the sand - literally crossing out the lines in its privacy policy that promised to keep the two pots of data separate by default. In its place, Google substituted new language that says browsing habits "may be" combined with what the company learns from the use Gmail and other tools. The web, by definition, isn't private. The web is like a busy shopping street; you wouldn't shout your secrets for everyone to hear there either. The sooner people accept this fact, the better they'll be for it. Note that I'm not saying I'm happy about this fact - I'm just saying it is what it is. There's nothing any of us can do about it, until authorities or regulators start stepping in. That being said, Google published a statement about this, stating this change is opt-in. Our advertising system was designed before the smartphone revolution. It offered user controls and determined ads' relevance, but only on a per-device basis. This past June we updated our ads system, and the associated user controls, to match the way people use Google today: across many different devices. Before we launched this update, we tested it around the world with the goal of understanding how to provide users with clear choice and transparency. As a result, it is 100% optional - if users do not opt-in to these changes, their Google experience will remain unchanged. Equally important: we provided prominent user notifications about this change in easy-to-understand language as well as simple tools that let users control or delete their data. Users can access all of their account controls by visiting My Account and we're pleased that more than a billion have done so in its first year alone. You can opt-out in the Activity Controls section of your Google account settings.

Thailand’s royal insult law, known as Article 112 in the criminal code, makes it a crime to insult the king, queen, heir or regent. Those who are found guilty face up to 15 years in prison. The law has curtailed public discussion about the monarchy’s role and its future following the death of King Bhumibol who ruled for seven decades and was seen as a unifying figure. Since taking power in 2014, the junta, known officially as the National Council for Peace and Order, has taken a tough stance on dissenters. It has come under strong criticism from the international community for lengthy and unprecedented prison sentences handed down by military courts against civilians for violating the lese-majeste law since the junta took power. The military government has repeatedly rejected accusations of rights violations. Comments Readers are required to have a valid Facebook account to comment on this story.

King Bhumibol Adulyadej's death on Oct. 13 has thrown the country of 67 million into mourning. It has also led to the rise of ultra-royalist vigilante groups who say they will punish anyone perceived to have insulted the monarchy during a highly sensitive time for Thailand. Deputy Prime Minister Prajin Juntong said he met with Google representatives in Bangkok on Friday. Google affirmed in the meeting that it would continue to help the government remove content from YouTube, a Google subsidiary, that it deemed offensive, he said. "If any website is inappropriate they said to get in touch with them and inform them of the URL and the time the content was found," Prajin told reporters. That conforms with Google's practice around the world, Alphbet Inc's Google says. "We have always had clear and consistent policies for removal requests from governments around the world and we continue to operate in line with those policies," a Google spokesperson in California told Reuters on Friday. "When we are notified of content that is illegal through official processes, we will restrict it in the country where it's illegal after a thorough review."

Eurogamer.net Follow @eurogamer Home Reviews iPhone 7/ iPhone 7 Plus review Back in black. By Damien McFerran Published 22/10/2016 It apparently took "courage" to remove the 3.5mm audio jack from the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, according to Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller. The company's less kind critics have voiced the opinion that it has more to do with bolstering sales of the new £160 AirPods and the wireless headphones produced by Apple subsidiary Beats Electronics, but whatever side of the fence you happen to sit on, this is a decision that has dominated the headlines and has been in very real danger of completely overshadowing this year's iPhone refresh. Apple's reasoning for ditching a socket which has been commonplace on practically every smartphone for the past decade may be flimsy at best, but where the Cupertino company leads, rivals invariably follow and we could well see an industry-wide shift towards wireless audio in the next year or so. It's almost a shame that this decision has generated such a sizeable reaction online as the products it impacts have a lot going for them. For the first time in iPhone history we finally have a device that can cope with getting wet, while the improved camera on both models and unique "taptic" home button are welcome improvements. However, Apple has chosen to cram all of these elements into a chassis which looks disarmingly similar to the design of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S - the first time in the history of the line that the same aesthetic look has been retained for a third consecutive year (the iPhone SE doesn't count as that came over a year after the iPhone 5S ceased being Apple's flagship). iPhone 7/7 Plus specs Akin to 2014 and 2015, Apple has two flagship options this year. Both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus benefit from the increased power afforded by Apple's A10 Fusion chipset, but the latter has 3GB of RAM compared to the standard model's 2GB. This year the 16GB storage option has been retired, with 32GB being the entry level point. The other big difference between the two phones is the addition of a second telephoto lens on the 7 Plus, which gives x2 optical zoom. First up, the iPhone 7 specs: Dimensions: 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1mm Weight: 138g Chipset: Apple A10 Fusion Processor: Quad-core 2.23 GHz Graphics Core: Six-core graphics RAM: 2GB Screen: 4.7-inch LED-backlit IPS LCD, 750 x 1334 pixels (326 ppi) Storage: 32GB / 64GB / 128GB Camera: 12 MP, f/1.8, phase detection autofocus, OIS, quad-LED flash Connectivity: Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth v4.2, NFC (Apple Pay only) Other Features: IP67 certified, 1960 mAh battery And here's how the iPhone 7 Plus compares: Dimensions: 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3mm Weight: 188g Chipset: Apple A10 Fusion Processor: Quad-core 2.23 GHz Graphics Core: Six-core graphics RAM: 3GB Screen: 5.5-inch LED-backlit IPS LCD, 1080 x 1920 pixels (401 ppi) Storage: 32GB / 64GB / 128GB Camera: Dual 12 MP (28mm, f/1.8, OIS & 56mm, f/2.8), phase detection autofocus, OIS (4-axis), dual-LED flash Connectivity: Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth v4.2, NFC Other Features: IP67 certified, 2900 mAh battery Black is the new "hero" colour of the range this year, with matte and glossy finishes available. This new colour scheme hides one of the big changes to the design, which is the repositioning of the plastic antenna bands to the top and bottom edges of the rear of the device. These bands are now practically invisible, with Apple's design guru Jony Ive claiming that this has resulted in the most "refined" take on this particular design. It's hard to disagree; while it may not be revolutionary when set alongside its 2014 and 2015 predecessors, the iPhone 7 is certainly an appealing slab of technology. There are many aspects to the phone's design that are instantly familiar to iPhone owners. The power button resides on the right-hand side, with the volume controls and silent switch found on the opposite edge. On the bottom there's the lightning port, but the 3.5mm headphone jack you'd expect to see to the left is gone, with the resultant void being filled by a speaker (the phone has two) and the phone's larger "Taptic Engine" force feedback unit. Around the back, the camera bump has become bigger compared to last year's model, but it looks a lot nicer - the metallic lens housing has been replaced by a more gradual raised section that appears to be more like part of the design than something that was hastily tacked on at the last moment. Gallery: Available in matte and glossy black, this year's iPhones will make many nostalgic for the iPhone 3G. The removal of the 3.5mm headphone socket has allowed Apple to fit two powerful stereo speakers, while inside the phone the expanded Taptic Engine allows for system-wide force feedback. Apart from size, the big difference between the two models is the dual camera setup on the 7 Plus. Flipping the phone over reveals the final big change - there's no physical home button this time around. The circular pad remains, but a push with your thumb yields no movement; instead, the iPhone 7's Taptic Engine delivers a pulse that gives the impression of pushing a button. Apple has used the same tech on the Force Touch screen, and it's a pretty convincing system - even if it does take some getting used to initially. By eliminating this moving part, Apple will hopefully have solved one of the biggest problems the iPhone line has faced along the years - a broken home button. While the 3.5mm headphone socket is, in Apple's eyes at least, now a relic of the past, there's thankfully still a way of using your old wired cans. Included in the box is a small connection cable that plugs into the lightning port and features - you've guessed it - a 3.5mm port on the other end. It's hardly an elegant solution and means you can't charge the phone while listening to music, but it should help you endure the transition to wireless audio - just make sure you don't misplace the adapter. The other big news this year is that Apple has finally made its flagship phones water and dust proof. Both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus boast IP67 certification, meaning they're able to withstand a 30 minute dip in the wet stuff to a depth of one meter. Again, there's a game of catch-up being played here - we've had waterproof Android phones for years - but it's a welcome upgrade over last year's offering and should ensure that an unscheduled fall in the sink or (even worse) the toilet no longer means a tragic end for your £600 smartphone. Both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus benefit from backlit LED screens which are brighter and more colourful than before, but they retain the resolution we've seen in the previous two years. The iPhone 7 has a 4.7-inch 1334x750 screen while its larger sibling has a 5.5-inch 1920x1080 offering. Compared to what companies like Sony, Samsung and LG are shipping with their flagship devices it's clear that Apple is losing the pixels-per-inch war, but while it's annoying that iPhone fans have not had a resolution bump in the past three years, it matters little in day-to-day use. GFXBench's Manhattan test is a hard workout for the GPU, but the reality is that few games actually test cutting-edge graphics power these days. iPhone 7 iPhone 7 Plus iPhone SE iPhone 6S iPhone 6 iPhone 5S iPhone 5/5C Galaxy S7 Galaxy S6 Geekbench Single-Core 3000 3306 2496 2552 1605 1294 701 2171 1233 Geekbench Multi-Core 5330 5345 4343 4464 2901 2463 1267 6465 3964 3DMark Graphics 63668 62595 44059 41968 22824 19488 5232 32404 22954 3DMark Physics 15267 15231 12871 12998 9385 8042 8099 17730 17795 3DMark IceStorm Unlimited 37352 37015 28638 28067 17304 14797 5669 27370 21565 GFXBench T-Rex 120.1 122.4 79.9 79.7 42.8 28.9 6.9 87.0 58.0 GFXBench Manhattan 62.3 63.2 39.3 40.3 18.1 13.5 - 29.0 25.9 It's already almost impossible to discern individual pixels on this screen and we've long argued that 1080p is the absolute maximum you really need on a smartphone. Anything above that is simply adding strain on the processor (not to mention impacting battery life) for little visible reward - the only genuine use we can foresee for a resolution increase is for phones which are used to power virtual reality headsets, such as the Galaxy S7 and the newly-launched Google Pixel, where the user's eyes are close-up to the display. As the iPhone 7 has no VR application at present, it can't really be included in that argument. While the iPhone is eclipsed by its Android rivals when it comes to screen size, it continues to lead the pack in terms of raw processing power. The fact that the A10 Fusion chip is the first quad-core proposition from Apple might lead you to assume it is comfortably outclassed by competing handsets, but the benchmark results suggest otherwise. As ever, the merits of creating your own chipset speak for themselves; this is an industry-leading handset in terms of grunt. Another remarkable aspect worth noting is that the iPhone 7 has only 2GB of RAM (the 7 Plus has 3GB) yet it is capable of delivering performance levels which shame some of its RAM-obsessed Android challengers. It almost goes without saying that with such formidable specs the iPhone 7 is a solid platform for gaming. There are few titles which really exploit the additional power found within the handset at present but existing releases - such as the lush Zelda Wind Waker homage Oceanhorn and the ever-enjoyable Real Racing 3 - run as smooth as silk with none of the judders and frame-rate headaches seen in their Android equivalents. Mobile gaming doesn't really get any more polished than it does on an iPhone, and the iOS App Store continues to be the go-to platform for developers thanks to the relative lack of piracy when compared to Google's own digital store. Perhaps this is why Nintendo has chosen to bring Super Mario Run to iOS first, a move which will surely make Apple's devices even more attractive to dedicated gamers. Gallery: Incremental hardware upgrades means there's few games which fully exploit the power of the A10 Fusion chipset, but rest assured everything runs like clockwork on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, with not stutter or frame rate hiccups. 3D Touch is supported by some games too, but not as many as we'd like. In terms of software, Apple has launched iOS 10 alongside its 2016 flagship phones. This update brings with it some visual changes - such as bubble-like notifications and the Google Now-style "Today" screen, which sits on the left-hand side of your main Home screen and gives you calendar updates and news stories - but perhaps the most significant difference is how 3D Touch has been embraced more enthusiastically this time around. Introduced in the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, 3D Touch is based around pressure, allowing you to press down on the screen to "peek" at images and access more commands. In iOS 10 it's also used in a new "rich notifications" system, where pressing down an alert bubble allows you to expand it and - in some cases - respond without having to actually open the app in question. As was the case last year, you could argue that a simple long-press would work just as well but 3D Touch appears to be here to stay, at least as far as the iPhone is concerned. Another welcome introduction for iOS 10 is the ability to wake the phone's screen as soon as you pick it up, and lock screen widgets - recently expunged from Android - have been added so you can check vital information without unlocking your device. However, there are times when it feels like Apple's attempts to enrich iOS have been fumbled. The notification system is the main culprit, and remains unwieldy for those who have a lot of apps firing off messages at once. In Android, notifications from the same app are often grouped together so you can see at a glance which one you need to open first, but in iOS each message has its own entry and you often have to swipe through an entire stream of alerts before finding one of any real interest. Worse still, important alerts get buried amid eBay messages, emails and other less urgent notifications, which means they often get overlooked altogether. Granular access is given to this system so you can disable audio alerts for a particular app or prevent it from firing off a message on your lock screen, but it's still a poor second to the way notifications work in Android - an OS which has led the way in this area almost since day one. Another advantage Google has is better overall customisation and flexibility - bonuses which come hand-in-hand with weaker security and an app store which struggles to attract talent due to the fact that any Android user can side-load pirated apps and games without having to pay a penny. Swift to focus and capable of capturing life-like shots, the iPhone 7's camera is perhaps the best on any smartphone right now. Low-light photography is much improved thanks to the inclusion of OIS and a f/1.8 aperture. One area where Apple's phones have enjoyed a particular notable advantage over pretty much every other manufacturer on the market is photography. While the megapixel count of 12 remains unchanged when compared to the iPhone 6S, both of this year's phones has a six-optical lens, optical image stabilisation (reserved for the "Plus" models previously) and a wider f/1.8 aperture. This means shots are less prone to camera shake and low-light shooting is much improved. Apple claims that the camera on the iPhone 7 is 60 per cent faster than its direct predecessor, which is an impressive claim as the iPhone 6S could capture an image in double-quick time. Suffice to say, the camera is insanely swift to focus and snap, and produces images which have excellent contrast and colour replication. Some of the shots look somewhat dull when compared to the vibrant images obtained on Samsung's latest handsets, but they're notably free from oversaturation and unrealistic colours. In terms of video, you can expect 4K capture at 30fps, or if you prefer a smoother frame-rate you can drop down to 1080p60. Slow-motion and time-lapse modes are also included, and the 7-megapixel selfie-camera on the front is now aided by a flash - in reality, the screen simply fires up to illuminate your face. On the 7 Plus, Apple has opted for the dual camera approach seen on Android phones like the LG G5, Huawei P9 and HTC One M8. The phone comes with a 12-megapixel telephoto lens in addition to the standard 12-megapixel snapper seen on the standard iPhone 7 model. This telephoto lens effectively grants the end user x2 optical zoom, allowing you to zoom in on your subject without experiencing the image quality degradation that normally comes with digital zoom. It doesn't end there, though - the iPhone 7 Plus uses its dual-camera setup to create a "depth map", picking out close-up and distant objects. This information is then used to add an artificial bokeh effect to create the kind of depth-of-field you'd normally only get from a DSLR with wide aperture. It's an interesting use of the two cameras and allows for some really effective shots - expect to witness bokeh-overload on your Instagram feed as more people pick up the phone. The 7 Plus has the same 12 megapixel, f/1.8 aperture lens as the standard iPhone 7 but includes a second telephoto lens which allows for x2 optical zoom and realistic depth-of-field shots. The iPhone 7 has a larger battery than the iPhone 6S, and when teamed with the A10 Fusion's two "low power" cores, this should mean improved stamina. However, that isn't the case; the iPhone 7 doesn't seem to offer much of an advantage when compared to last year's model. The iPhone 7 Plus is a different story as the larger frame allows for a bigger capacity battery, but on the whole this feels like another area where Apple has lost ground to competitors. Phones like the Galaxy S7 and Xiaomi Mi5 are similar in size to the standard iPhone 7, yet they have larger power cells and consequently last much longer when away from a power socket. While we rarely got to the end of the day with a dead phone, there were a few times when overzealous usage caused the juice to drop to alarming low levels before bedtime - Pokémon Go usually being the main culprit. The iPhone 7's middling stamina is exacerbated by the fact that it lacks quick-charging and takes around 90 minutes to reach 100 per cent. Again, this is another area where Google has the upper hand; most leading Android handsets have some kind of fast charging capability which can fully boost the battery in less than an hour, while others also offer convenient wireless charging. Expect to see these features come to Apple's devices soon, when they will no doubt be acclaimed as totally ground-breaking. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus: the Digital Foundry verdict While the design might not have altered a great deal, it's clear that some big strides are made with this year's iPhones. Waterproofing is a huge plus point, and the traditional increase in processing power once again puts Apple at the front of the pack. Improvements with the camera and screen give further incentive for existing iPhone users to upgrade, and while the removal of the 3.5mm headphone socket is a pain, the expanded taptic engine does much to make up for it, allowing system-wide vibration feedback which can be felt in everything from scrolling menus to games. Digital Foundry: the best PC gaming controllers From Xbox Elite to Amazon bargain. Ditching the socket has also allowed Apple to include two powerful stereos speakers that sound leagues ahead of any other device on the market. The dual-camera setup on the 7 Plus is also worthy of note, with the secondary telephoto lens allowing for some neat tricks when it comes to composing the perfect image. It's also worth noting that this is the first year that Apple has made 32GB the base storage option - something that has been a long time coming. In terms of the basics, call audio quality is excellent, as is network and wireless connectivity. However, there's no denying that in some key areas, Apple's phones continue to lag behind the competition. Battery life is only a slight improvement over last year's offerings but remains disappointing when compared to rival handsets, and the lack of any kind of fast charging capability is almost unforgivable in 2016, especially on a phone which costs this much. While Samsung and Sony's flagships are in a similar price bracket, the Android sector is awash with much cheaper devices from companies like Xiaomi, Lenovo and Ulefone, many of which offer mod cons that are frustratingly absent on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. The trade-off is getting one of the most powerful phones on the market with a well-stocked app store, tightly integrated software features and impeccable build quality.

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Content Marketing Social Media Paid Search Work Life Events Advertise 4 Myths About Google Panda That Are Still Doing the Rounds SEO October 17, 2016 SEO Pratik DholakiyaOctober 17, 2016 558SHARES 1.5KREADS 558SHARES 1.5KREADS Pratik Dholakiya 558SHARES 1.5KREADS Google Panda was an update introduced in 2011, aimed at preventing low-quality content from gaming its way into the top ranking slots on SERPs. How Google feels about SEO is open to question, but we can say for sure that when you could just pump out reams of garbage content stuffed with keywords and get your site above the fold on the first page, they hated it. Panda’s whole purpose was to make search rank correlate with quality. Which is a good thing. Trouble is, Panda blew a lot of folks out of the water. Not just spammy listicles, keyword stuffers, and link buyers, but a whole slew of people who followed the best available advice in January 2011. Come February; Panda rolled out and their rankings were badly reduced. The workings of Google’s algorithms is always proprietary. We keep trying to guess; they keep changing the rules. As a result, there are beliefs about the way Panda actually works and even what it’s for that have clung on for years. Some of them aren’t true anymore; some of them were never true; all of them are myths that could lead you to waste your time and even potentially damage your search rank. #1 – There Will be a Panda Update Soon There sure will. Tomorrow, in fact – and the day after. In March of 2013, Google announced that Panda would become Panda “Everflux”, integrated with the basic search algorithm and updated constantly. This myth comes from the impact of the initial Panda rollout, when the desired effect of Panda – spammy sites tumbled down the rankings – were accompanied by numerous undesired outcomes including many scraped sites actually rising up the rankings. In short, the result of the initial Panda rollout was chaos. People look to the likelihood of a “new” Panda update in deep concern in case all that happens again. The worst downside of this myth is that we’re all like sportspeople taking our eyes off the ball to look at the (non-existent) UFO. There are important Google updates that are changing the way online business is conducted, and because they’re not labeled “Panda” we’re all looking the other way. Last April’s mobile-friendly update hit more sites than Panda (or Penguin, come to that) but it caused less of a stir. We’ve learned to live with Panda, and it’s helped a lot of us by making content marketing and search optimization a lot easier to align. #2 – The Duplicate Content Filter is Part of Panda This one is just totally untrue. It’s common, though, because they aim at similar results – rewarding quality – and they came in at the same time. In a Twitter discussion with Marie Haynes, Google’s John Mueller said categorically that “Those are 2 separate & independent things.” That seems pretty final. But it doesn’t mean that you’re not going to get slapped for having a bunch of duplicate content. Google has gotten a little more sophisticated at dealing with duplicate content over the years – after all, nearly every site has some. But large amounts will open you up to loss of traffic. It’s not technically a penalty. It sure feels like one when your traffic nosedives, but when you fix it and your site gets recrawled, the traffic should recover. That doesn’t happen with Panda penalties. There’s also a big difference between the effects of duplicate content within your site and duplicated content from elsewhere on the web: one dilutes traffic and the other sets red flags flying at Google HQ. E-commerce sites are particularly at risk here because they have thousands of product pages that might be using the manufacturer’s product descriptions or generic placeholders. Canonical tags for duplicate pages and your own copy are the cure. #3 – Too Much UGC Will Attract Panda User-generated content used to be the Holy Grail. It’s social proof, it’s content for free, and it’s proof of deep engagement. People don’t contribute content to websites they don’t care about. Post Panda, that began to change. And now SEOs are recommending that clients remove all the user-generated content from their websites. Once again, this is an overreaction based on misunderstanding what Panda’s all about. It’s not about user-generated, old, thin, whatever. It’s about quality. Some UGC is very high quality, while some is people telling you how you won’t believe how they made money online with this simple trick. Too much of that second kind can actually go against you, as Google’s John Mueller explains: “Another thing… which is common with forums is low-quality user-generated content. If you have ways of recognizing this kind of content, and blocking it from indexing, it can make it much easier for algorithms to review the overall quality of your website.” The alleged UGC price is even worse if your site is a forum or acts like one. In cases like Stack Overflow and Quora where almost all the content is user-generated, what is the risk that Google will hunt down spammy UGC? This very thing happened to Mozilla back in 2013. Mueller recommends cleaning house before you get hit with a penalty: “The same methods can be used to block forum spam from being indexed for your forum. Depending on the forum, there might be different ways of recognizing that automatically, but it’s generally worth finding automated ways to help you keep things clean & high-quality, especially when a site consists of mostly user-generated content.” It’s worth revisiting Mueller’s point about high-quality UGC: when you collate it right UGC campaigns can be among the best forms of content in Google’s eyes, as well as being inspiring and effective for users. Many forum sites run on a question-and-answer basis. One effective way of keeping poor content out of the bots’ claws without messing up your site’s running is to no-index pages that have questions but no answers or that have only posts from the OP of the thread. When useful content builds, those pages can be indexed. #4 – All Pages Need to be High Quality This is probably the biggest myth about Panda. That every single page needs to be perfect for the site to rank at all, and if there’s anything on there that Panda doesn’t like, the whole site will suffer. In fact, Panda is sometimes applied in quite a granular fashion and generally poor-quality penalties will hit individual pages, not the whole site. The site’s main pages can still rank well even if some of that site’s content doesn’t. What you’re looking for is the overall picture Google gets of your site. If you have an awesome site with a few bad pages, Panda might hit those pages but your site will rank well just the same. The other way around won’t work out so well. Yoast’s Joost de Valk explains: “Panda usually affects your site because you have too many low quality pages as a proportion of your overall number of pages.” Identifying pages that need to be fixed is a matter of checking in your analytics tool to find pages with low traffic and high bounce. Apply common sense: some pages might be really useful for the few visitors they get. Some might have what looks like a high bounce rate because visitors get what they need fast and leave. Conclusion Panda is a different beast when you look at it close up. Far from being capricious, Panda’s demands seem fairly reasonable when you know what they actually are and how to work with them. Don’t let myths about certain types of content, content length, or some impending Pandageddon update stop you from making your site Panda-friendly!

Restaurants Home Nation / World Attack on internet: who did it? print Share | e-mail Facebook Tweet StumbleUpon Google Analysis Attack on internet: who did it? By Henry Farrell / Special to The Washington Post Published Oct 22, 2016 at 12:02AM As users of Twitter and many other services probably know, large parts of the internet weren’t working Friday, thanks to a hacking attack on the internet’s infrastructure. NBC reported that a senior intelligence official has told the network that the hack “does not appear at this point to be any kind of state-sponsored or directed attack.” It may be that new evidence emerges that leads the U.S. intelligence community to change its opinion and identify a major state as a responsible party. The scarier possibility is that it wasn’t a state that did it. The attack targeted the domain name system The internet relies on a complicated mix of systems and protocols to work. Friday’s attack targeted one key aspect of the internet — the domain name system. Every time that your desktop or phone browser asks to load the webpage for, say, http://www.washingtonpost.com, specialized servers need to turn the web address into a series of numbers — the so-called ‘IP address’ to figure out where the request ought to be sent to. The company that was hacked Friday runs part of the domain name system. The hackers sent so many requests to the domain name servers that they were completely overwhelmed. This kind of attack is called a ‘Distributed Denial of Service Attack’ or DDoS attack. It used to be thought of as a relatively unsophisticated instrument, and many forms of DDoS attack can be easily repelled, once the target of the attack realizes what is going on. Both activists (such as many members of the loose ‘Anonymous’ collective) and state actors (looking to silence inconvenient dissidents offshore) have used DDoS attacks in the past. Such attacks led Google to create Project Shield which was intended to deploy Google’s massive resources to protect those who might otherwise be effectively silenced by nefarious actors. These attacks have escalated Unfortunately, such attacks have escalated dramatically over time. The problem started with unsecured computers. Many people (almost certainly including readers of this article) are bad at keeping their computer operating systems updated, with the result that their computers have been quietly subverted and made part of ‘botnets’ made up of thousands of slaved machines. These computers can then be turned against a target system, repeatedly bombarding it with demands until it is effectively taken off the internet. Criminals have herded botnets to blackmail the owners of gambling websites by threatening to keep them offline with DDoS attacks until a ransom is paid. Recently, however, the stakes have escalated yet again. The so-called ‘Internet of Things’ — the many consumer products which are somehow connected to the internet — has created new opportunities for botnet herders, because these products tend to be badly secured and are usually never updated. Brian Krebs, a prominent writer and consultant on security, has often been targeted by various attacks by the criminals he writes about. Last month, he was hit by a truly massive attack mounted by a botnet of compromised devices. Friday’s attack uses the same ‘Mirai’ system, which was recently released into the wild so that anyone with moderate technical skills can use it to compromise and set up their own network of devices. Anyone could be responsible As Krebs pointed out in a follow-up blog post, the truly frightening thing is that anyone could be responsible. It used to be that only states had the firepower to mount really dramatic attacks like this. Now, as one of Krebs’ friends puts it, “When it comes to DDoS attacks, nation-states are just another player … so that today’s reality is that DDoS attacks have become the Great Equalizer between private actors & nation-states.” One shouldn’t push this analogy too far. Other kinds of cyberattack — such as the attack that the United States and Israel reportedly mounted on the Iranian nuclear program — require bespoke skills and customization, and are out of the reach of all but sophisticated nation states. Even so, taking down a large chunk of the internet, as Friday’s attack apparently did, is well within the grasp of small criminal groups and other ordinary actors. Equally, the fact that this is possible for ordinary actors may provide opportunities for states to undertake nefarious activities without getting the blame. Many of the techniques used to identify the perpetrators of cyberattacks rely on ‘fingerprints’ in the computer code underlying the attack. For example, if you are mounting one attack, it may be cheaper and easier for you to redeploy code that you have already used in others, than to write everything from scratch. This may, in turn, make it easier to identify you. Such identification techniques will be harder to use against DDoS attacks like this one, which deploy code that is widely available, and hence impossible to attribute to another actor. There may be other means of identification (for example, there might be bugs in the source code that could be exploited to pinpoint whoever is running it), but we don’t know for certain. This might tempt states as well as non-state actors to use this system to mount DDoS attacks in the belief that others will likely be blamed. The underlying problem is tough to solve These attacks are likely to continue — and get worse — as long as more devices are released that can be subverted and slaved by botnets. Unfortunately, as another prominent security expert, Bruce Schneier, argues, that’s going to keep on happening. The producers of buggy and insecure cameras, baby monitors and so on have no incentive to improve them, since no one can sue them for the side effects of their carelessness. The users of the products don’t have any reason to care either. Schneier suggests that we might at least begin to address the problem by regulating manufacturers, or by making it possible for the victims of attacks, like Krebs, to sue them. This is, as Schneier certainly knows, unlikely under current political circumstances. The business community has resisted such mandates and rights for decades, and almost certainly still has enough political clout to continue to resist. 15398049 View next article in Nation & World     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

Using Ugly Email Extension To Identify Tracked Emails All that the user needs to do is just Open their Google Chrome browser on the PC, search for Ugly Email in the Webstore and click on "Add to Chrome" to save yourself from tracked emails. After adding it to Chrome, whenever the user login into their Gmail account or open emails, there will appear an evil eye sign, which means the email has been tracked by a hacker. #2 Google 2 Step Verification is the Best Way to Keep Hackers Away Google Verification process is extremely secure and safe and keeps Gmail accounts safe from various disasters and hackers. To make it work properly, the Gmail user has to provide with a one-time login code to a secondary device either via text or Google authentication app. Hence, in case someone is trying to hack your account, the hacker has to identify the security code for the secondary devices also, which is extremely difficult, and in turn protects your account. #3 Avoid Any Such Spam or Phishing Messages A Gmail user should avoid any malicious emails, and especially the ones starting with a subline like "Your money is waiting" "Claim your reward" and so on. It is recommended to not open such emails that you receive from unknown recipients. #4 Always Try to Keep Your Contact Number Up-to-Date It often happens that you change your mobile number, and your Gmail account, or other social media accounts are registered under your previous number. It is recommended to up to date your account with the number you are using, to keep an eye on any malicious activities happening with your account. SEE ALSO: 5 Easy Steps to Capture A Screenshot in Google Chrome Without Installing An Extension   #5 Using a Recovery Email Address is a Must Other than updating the mobile number to get updates on malicious activities, every Gmail user is required to update an alternative email address as well. This is because email address is the other option that Google uses for sending security codes and in case you forget your password, the security code to login to login to your Gmail account will be sent to the secondary email id.

Australia had 817 run metres to 583, and laid 86 tackles while forcing New Zealand into 183, plus also dominated possession for large periods of the game, but they lacked the finesse and finishing touch to get the job done. The disallowed try that would have made it 15-15 set them back, but they weren’t beaten by the ref. Their formidable opponent simply crushed them in the final 20 minutes. With this win, New Zealand have 18 straight Test wins, a new world record, and the Wallabies are still to break through for an Eden Park Test win since their last in 1986. That’s some hoodoo, but this is a helluva rugby team. There’s daylight between them and the Wallabies right now. Thanks for joining us, and stay tuned for Paul Rees’ report of all the action from tonight’s game. Adios!

New Zealand win 37-10 as Australia run out of legs And with that, the All Blacks take their world record 18th straight win in what ended up a six tries to one drubbing, a scoreline that doesn’t reflect Australia’s guts and tenacity for a large part of that encounter. But...the Wallabies just weren’t good enough. No excuses. They lacked that little bit of polish and class, and fumbled around when chances presented themselves. Gallant, just not quite good enough. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.27am EDT 04:27 79 min: This game is just meandering to its conclusion now but in the interests of Trans-Tasman bitterness, the local fans are still doing a great job of booing Cooper and Israel Dagg soon scoots through for his second try after a pass from Cruden. But...it’s a forward pass. Dagg wastes an enthusiastic celebration of the feat, too. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.25am EDT 04:25 78 min: Oh dear, it’s getting worse for the Wallabies now as Reece Hodge is flattened in a big tackle. That might just about finish him off for the night, you’d think. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.24am EDT 04:24 76 min: It hasn’t been Australia’s night, it’s safe to say. They go forward again and create a big opening but Reece Hodge fumbles from a leg tackle when he’s eight metres out and another promising move peters out with a frustrating error. Updated at 4.24am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.21am EDT 04:21 74 min: After 15 points in 14 minutes, Aaron Cruden proves that the All Blacks are indeed human when he misses the conversion. Quade Cooper then appears for his heel turn and he’s welcomed onto the field with a quite predictable round of boos. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.20am EDT 04:20 New Zealand try! New Zealand 37-10 Australia (Coles 72) 72 min: This game is getting a little ragged now as the Aussies flag in their spirits and the All Blacks throw the ball around with no small amount of flair. They’ve got their foot to the floor and the Wallabies are a little helpless to stop it. Savea goes within half a metre of a hat-trick but turns in the tackle to put Dane Coles through instead! Coles deserved that as it was his big tackle on Dean Mumm that caused the turnover in the first place.

New Zealand 30-10 Australia (Savea 68) 67 min: Foley is still trying to find gaps but he’s monstered in a few big tackles. But...they Aussies produce an overlap and swiftly move to 22m before things break down and the All Blacks force a turnover, working it wide to Savea, who just pulverises a couple of would-be tacklers on his way to a second try. That was brutal. It’s all falling apart for Australia. That’s Savea’s 45th All Blacks try and his ninth double.

New Zealand 25-10 Australia (Cruden 64) 64 min: This game was alive 10 minutes back but an Aaron Cruden penalty goal here makes things difficult for the Wallabies. They’ve been gallant, but lacked polish. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.09am EDT 04:09 62 min: Reader Ken McMahon writes in from Switzerland and agrees that some of the All Blacks could slap a smile on their dials. “No doubt I am not the only one to think it: you’d think slick ball movement would make him smile more...or is that the preserve of Aaron Smith” he asks. Both sides are ringing the changes now (Perenara off, Kerr-Barlow on for the ABs) but this All Blacks buffer suddenly looks a healthy one. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.05am EDT 04:05 60 min: Australia are even winning lineouts tonight, as per one here 22m out. Foley gets it out to Folau and the Wallabies look like they’re on but the giant Aussie couldn’t quite release the pass when a host of options presented themselves. Australia have another one-man overlap on phase five but Reece Hodge has the same problem as Folau. A little slicker with their passing and Australia could be leading right now. So often they’ve released pressure right when they looked to have some ascendancy.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.52am EDT 03:52 50 min: just another incident out of that near-try: the big tackle on Rory Arnold has crocked the towering Australian and he limps off, grimacing noticeably. Israel Folau takes the Wallabies to 15m out and they’re on the charge again, as Simmons slips through to take them inside 10, where the All Blacks are offside. Matt Burke reckons the home side is “rattled”, but I might reserve judgement for another 20 minutes or so. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.49am EDT 03:49 47 min: Well, how will that call change the complexion of the game? The Wallabies need to get on with the job but that decision will have irked them. Replays indicated the try would be allowed but New Zealand got the rub of the green. And now...has Dane Coles scored a loose ball try after he kicked it clear for New Zealand from a Rory Arnold turnover? We see it from more angles than the Kennedy assassination but no try is the ruling! That seems almost karmic. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.46am EDT 03:46 Try reversed! New Zealand 15-10 Australia 45 min: There’s a review of the try now. Was Ardie Savea blocked from getting near Speight in his pursuit of the try-scorer? Yes in the eyes of the refs! Oh dear. The Australians are fuming. Would he have laid a finger on Speight either way? He wasn’t within a bull’s roar of the Aussie! Michael Cheika has steam coming out his ears up in the box.

New Zealand 15-15 Australia (Speight 45) 45 min: Whisper it, but the Wallabies are a serious chance here and with a few neat passes and a couple of enticing gaps opening up, Henry Speight sprints down the wing with the wind in his sails and streaks clear for a try!

Updated at 4.00am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.38am EDT 03:38 42 min: We’re off and away in the second half with a very short Beauden Barrett kick, which is followed by a mad scramble but the Wallabies retain possession eventually. Reece Hodge has another nice moment when he steals possession and offloads to Kepu, who charges to 10 metres out and the Wallabies soon win a shot at goal. It’s a very bright start for Australia.

Not only that, but they have a half chance for another try as the hooter approaches. They go forward, there’s a string of passes....and then a turnover. And that’s it. An absorbing first half comes to its conclusion and New Zealand take the honours, but only just. “We’re playing in the right areas of the field,” says Wallaby Bernard Foley. “We’ve just gotta be resilient and stick at it... If we stay at it we’ll get the reward. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.21am EDT 03:21 38 min: New Zealand handle a five-man lineout with ease and then spread it wide but there’s a big tackle from Reece Hodge on Ryan Crotty.

But for a knock-on, the All Blacks were on for a third try soon after. There was a finger-tip in it. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.12am EDT 03:12 30 min: Reece Hodge has a 50m kick now, and with that stiff breeze in the back of his mind, pulls it right. Still, the Wallabies are in this game after 30 minutes, which you would not have tipped during their shambolid first 10. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.10am EDT 03:10 Australian conversion! New Zealand 10-7 Australia (Foley) 28 min: Foley makes no mistake with the conversion and there’s a penalty to boot, against Kieran Read, opening up the chance of a 10-point try.

New Zealand 10-5 Australia (Arnold 28) 28 min: Some action! Bernard Foley slips a tackle and gains a few metres and Phipps also has a bright moment, but it’s pretty sloppy work by the Wallabies as they meander their way forward but out of nowhere ‘Three storey’ Rory Arnold slips free with an ungainly try, which has come completely against the run of play! Put that one down to Bernard Foley, folks. Rory Arnold scores. Photograph: Fiona Goodall/Getty Images Updated at 4.05am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.07am EDT 03:07 26 min: As Matt Burke tries to think up new and ever more polite ways of describing Australia’s woeful scrum, and eventually settles on a theory that it “sucks the oxygen out of your legs” when you’re down there. I’m heading for an anatomy and physiology text book to verify that claim. I’ll let you know what I find. The crowd is so bored right now they’ve registered their disgust with a Mexican wave. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.03am EDT 03:03 23 min: Michael Collins arrives with our first email of the night: “I’m no expert in gate technology but isn’t a rusty gate actually going to swing open with some difficulty? (It’s early; I’m tired; and the cricket’s going badly. So I’m grumpy).” Hmm, you could be right there, Michael. Does Australia doing very badly in rugby balance out England doing very badly in cricket? That seems about right to me. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.01am EDT 03:01 22 min: This has been a half-decent five minutes for the Wallabies, but they’ve got nothing to show for it yet, and they’re penalised for not releasing when they spread it wide. Tackles? 43-13 in favour of New Zealand. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.59am EDT 02:59 21 min: Kepu has his first decent run of the night for the Aussies and Foley creates a nice opening. Sio charges forward towards the try line but a lack of composure costs the Wallabies as Kerevi eftly avoids three tacklers but then fires off a slightly shambolic pass, which goes forward into the hands of the All Blacks. One step forward, two steps back. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.56am EDT 02:56 19 min: Dean Mumm does a power of work to force a turnover and a scrum for his side out of an All Blacks lineout, bear-hugging a New Zealand opponent and the ball at the base of the pack. New Zealand waste their dominance of the scrum and Foley goes for touch in the aftermath. I think you know what happens next: the ABs pick the lineout like a dirty nose. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.54am EDT 02:54 17 min: Michael Hooper’s almost through for the Wallabies but his torso gets a little too far out in front of his legs as he streams forward and his face receives some panel-beating at the hands of the oncoming turf. There’s only brief moments of ascendancy for Australia. “It’s almost a hatred between the players at the moment,” says Gordon Bray, and the ref calls both teams in for a bollocking. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.52am EDT 02:52 16 min: Chaos! The Aussies make a hash of the possession but then so do the All Blacks as well in a helter skelter minute of rugby, when Australia twice look like scoring but eventually squander it. There’s a lot of niggle out there, as you’d expect. It’s lippy, chippy, and the Aussies are under the kosh. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.50am EDT 02:50 14 min: New Zealand have had 67% of the possession so far, if that wasn’t obvious from the scoreline. Israel Folau continues to charge in and try to make things happen for the Wallabies but they’re up against it as they fumble their way to the 22m line and earn a penalty. Foley uses it to go for touch – about eight metres out. I like it. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.48am EDT 02:48 12 min: Beauden Barrett has been sublime this season but he’s just missed his second conversion of the night as the swirling breeze continues to wreak havoc on both sides’ kicking game. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.47am EDT 02:47 New Zealand try! New Zealand 10-0 Australia (Brown 10) 10 min: Australia have already missed seven tackles, compared with New Zealand’s one, as the packs line up for a scrum and Aussie Scott Sio is punished by the ref for not binding. The All Blacks do far better with their second lineup of the night and Lienert-Brown scoots clear for another try in what’s been a shocking start for Australia. Henry Speight almost reeled in an interception there but in missing it he opened the path for an easy try. Anton Lienert-Brown touches down with ease. Photograph: Hannah Peters/Getty Images Updated at 4.05am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.44am EDT 02:44 8 min: The All Blacks miss the conversion, so it stays at 5-0 for now, but there’s some early alarm bells here for Michael Cheika. The All Blacks were throwing it around the joint almost arrogantly in the lead-up to the opening try. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.43am EDT 02:43 New Zealand try! New Zealand 5-0 Australia (Dagg 6) 6 min: Oof, don’t speak too soon. Now the All Blacks are on the charge and if not for a near-intercept from Folau, they were positively marauding. There’s gaps everywhere and Dagg crosses for the first try! Dear oh dear, that was far too easy for the home side. The Aussies swung open like a rusty gate. Israel Dagg scores the opening try.

We’ll start with the obvious. Australia haven’t beaten the All Blacks in New Zealand since 2001, when the Baha Men’s “Who Let the Dogs Out?” was enjoying its three-month run at the top of the charts and each member of The Strokes still had hair. What hope do the Wallabies have tonight at Eden Park? Well, none. They haven’t won at this venue in three full decades and face a side looking for its 18th win on the bounce. The ABs haven’t lost on home soil since 2009, nor at Eden Park since 1994. It’s been 18 matches since the Wallabies last won at any New Zealand venue. I’d call that a tall task of Robert Wadlow dimensions, wouldn’t you? The Aussies are sitting on three wins from nine starts this year – hardly imposing – but they’ve at least changed things up for tonight’s game; Quade Cooper heads to the bench, Bernard Foley returns to hatural habitat of flyhalf, while Reece Hodge pairs with Samu Kerevi in the centres. The net result is that Henry Speight gets to return on the wing. David Pocock is also back earlier than expected from a wrist injury (OK, quieten down there at the back of the room) and takes his place on the bench. New Zealand head into this one with a 57-15 thrashing of the Springboks as preparation. Julian Savea gets the nod in front of Waisake Naholo for the starting side, while Matt Todd is favoured ahead of Ardie Savea for the starting seven spot. Can the Wallabies cause the upset of the year and party like it’s 1986? With a lineout like theirs, probably not, but that shouldn’t stop the rest of us.

By Owen Hughes October 22, 2016 07:00 BST Unified Android toolkit for Pixel and Pixel XL devicesIBTimes UK The Pixel and Pixel XL have been built to showcase the power of Android and Google's vision of the operating system at its purest, most intuitive form. Google Assistant undoubtedly steals the spotlight, yet there are a number of features tucked beneath the surface that will let you get the most out of Alphabet's new flagships. We've dug out the best hidden features, tips and tricks to help get you up and running with your new smartphone, and be sure to check out our Google Pixel XL review when you're done. 1) Use a Night Light Studies have shown that the blue light omitted from smartphone displays and other gadgets can interfere with our sleep. Google has now built a Night Light feature straight into Android 7 that filters out blue light and help you get a better night's rest. You can toggle this manually from the notifications panel or set it to come on automatically by going to Settings>Display>Night Light>Turn on Automatically. You can set it to come on from sunset to sunrise, or use custom times. Moves add useful gesture inputs to the PixelIBTimes UK 2) Bust out the Moves The Pixel comes with a handful of gesture shortcuts that are disabled by default but are actually quite useful. This includes a feature that will let you quickly switch between the front and back camera by quickly double-twisting the phone, another for letting you boot up the camera from any screen by double-pressing the power button, and a gesture that will let you check your notifications by swiping down on the fingerprint sensor. All of these are easy to switch on by going to Settings>Moves, and from there you can toggle each Move as you wish. 3) Be a battery saver There's something reassuring about being able to see exactly how much battery you have remaining. You can modify the battery icon on the Google Pixel to show the percentage you have remaining by pulling down on the notifications bar and then holding the Setting cogwheel for a few seconds. A system message will pop up on-screen once you've done this successfully. Once unlocked, go to Settings and scroll all the way down to System UI Tuner at the bottom. Open it and go to Status bar>Battery>Always show percentage. Also worth setting up is battery saver mode, which will automatically kick your phone into a low-power mode when your battery dips below a certain threshold. You'll find this within Settings>Battery>Battery saver. 4K video capture isn't enabled by default, so you'll have to dip into your camera settingsIBTimes UK 4) Enable 4K video The Google Pixel is capable of shooting video in glorious 4K, and with Google offering free and unlimited cloud photo storage with its new flagship, there's no reason not to. The camera's video setting is set to 1080p by default though, so to crack up the resolution open the camera app, swipe right and hit Settings. Scroll down to Video>Back camera video resolution and hit UHD 4K. 5) Make Assistant work for you Google Assistant is Google's answer to Siri and one of the first things you should test out after purchasing your Pixel. You can make it even more useful by tailoring the info it serves you based on your location and interests. Sadly, this feature is only available in the US for now. To do so, launch Google Assistant by long-pressing the home button, tap on the menu icon in the top left corner and hit Settings. From there you can customise the websites it pulls your news from and what info to include in your daily agenda. 6) Liven up your wallpapers The Google Pixel's Live Data wallpaper shows a colour gradient that changes according to time and weather conditions where you are. This is all well and good for more exotic parts of the world, but in the UK this means you're likely to be staring at a grey background six days out of seven. Fortunately the Pixel also comes with a range of Google Earth and satellite pictures you can chose from. To keep things looking fresh, you can set this to change every 24 hours. You can do this by long-pressing the home screen, hitting Wallpapers, scrolling to the category of your choice and pressing Daily wallpaper. Head into your Wi-Fi settings to enable Wi-Fi AssistantIBTimes UK 7) Boost your browsing experience with Wi-Fi Assistant You can set your Pixel phone to automatically switch between Wi-Fi and 4G/3G networks while browsing the web depending on which has the strongest signal at a given time. This is useful because it helps you preserve mobile data, meaning worry-free browsing and content streaming. To activate Wi-Fi Assistant, go to Settings>Wi-Fi and press the cog wheel in the top right corner, then hit Use open Wi-Fi automatically. To keep you safe on public Wi-Fi networks, Wi-Fi Assistant automatically passes your data through a VPN to keep your personal information hidden and secure. 8) Dip into Developer settings The Pixel and Pixel XL are already pretty nippy devices, but you can make things even faster under your finger by tweaking animation settings. You first have to unlock the Developer options, which are hidden by default. To do this, go to Settings and scroll all the way down to About phone. Then scroll down to Build number and tap it repeatedly. This will unlock the hidden Develop options menu, which will now appear near the bottom of the main Settings menu. Once in Developer options, scroll down to Drawing. Beneath this are options for Window animation scale, Transition animation scale and Animator durations scale. These options let you tweak how long the respective animations last for. The lower the number, the quicker windows, transitions and animations will respond to touch input. There are a lot of other Developer options you can tweak from this menu, although it's been purposely hidden, intended only for power users. We'd recommend against fiddling around with them unless you know what you're doing. It won't damage the phone but could affect the way it works. Launcher shortcuts takes a leaf out of iOS's bookIBTimes UK 9) Use Launcher shortcuts Long-pressing app icons on the Pixel will bring up shortcuts similar to the iPhone 7's 3D Touch feature, which will let you dive into specific app functions. For example, holding the Gmail app icon will give you the option of jumping straight into composing an email. Similarly, long-pressing the phone icon will bring up your favourite contacts and let you dial them without having to leave the home screen. This feature appears to be limited to a selection of Google's own apps for the time being, although much like 3D Touch we expect it will be expanded to third-party developers in the near future. 10) Be security smart With fingerprint, face and retina scanning, smartphones are better than ever when it comes to keeping our content secure. That said, you can never be too careful and Google lets you add an extra layer of security to your phone with Smart Lock, which automatically keeps your phone tablet locked when it's not with you, and unlocked when your device is safe. For example, you can choose to have your device unlock when it detects another connected nearby device, such as a smartwatch, or when it's located in a 'trusted place' – at home or in the office, for example. To set up Smart Lock, head to Settings>Security>Smart Lock and chose when you want you Pixel to automatically lock. A word of caution: on-body detection will keep your phone unlocked while you're carrying it, but won't necessarily be able to tell the difference between you and someone else.

The Indian Express Nation World Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Home Compare News Mobile & Tabs Gadgets Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Mobile & Tabs Google Pixel positive reviews pushes Alphabet shares to record high Google Pixel positive reviews pushes Alphabet shares to record high With Pixel, Google is getting into Apple's territory displacing Samsung as Apple's major hardware competitor By: Tech Desk | Published:October 22, 2016 11:17 am With Pixel, Google is becoming Apple’s new competitor with some serious ambition (Source: AP) Alphabet Inc. shares hit a record high on Tuesday after mostly positive reviews for its new Pixel phones, the first line of phones designed in-house by its Google unit. The Mountain View, California-based company’s stock gained 2.5 percent to $826.85 at 2.43PM in New York, after earlier reaching $828, the highest price since August 19, 2004, when Google’s shares were first traded in the public markets. The mostly positive reviews are a change for Google, a company that has occasionally pushed out glitch-ridden devices before they were ready for mainstream consumption. Google executive Rick Osterloh told Bloomberg News earlier this month that the company would continue to produce new hardware annually. The Verge’s Walt Mossberg called the new phone “easily the best” Android phone he had ever tested, praising the device’s automated Assistant voice feature and camera system, but panning its battery life. TechCrunch’s Darrell Etherington said the Pixel’s camera is a “terrific photo and video experience,” but said Apple Inc.’s iPhone 7 still produces more accurate colors. Youssef Squali, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, attributed Alphabet’s share gain to the support for the Pixel and confidence after Netflix Inc.’s positive quarterly results on Monday. “Part of it is the Pixel reviews, which have been more positive than I expected,” Squali said. “Partly it’s the Netflix effect. Great earnings. Google is reporting next week. There’s hope for a strong quarter from all internet companies.” J&K Schools: Amid Shutdown, Restrictions, Board Examinations Begin Ghazipur: PM Modi Flags Off Shabd Bhedi Express Ghazipur: PM Modi Promises To Open Files Of Patel Committee This Is How People Celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti Nation Celebrates Guru Nanak Jayanti Demonetisation: Brinda Karat Calls PM Modi’s Speech ‘Drama’ Vizag Police Nabs Prisoners Escaped From Warangal Central Jail Demonetisation Will Affect Fashion Industry Only In Short Run, Feels Designer Sabyasachi New Zealand: Two Killed In 7.8 Magnitude Earthquake Demonetisation: Banking Correspondents Can Withdraw Cash Multiple Times, Says Shaktikanta Das PM Modi Claims Demonetisation Has Left Corrupts With ‘No Option’ Golfer Aditi Ashok becomes first Indian Woman to lift European Tour Event PM Modi at KLE: Win gold medals for India in 2020 Olympics Idea Exchange With Ujjal Dosanjh India Manage A Draw After Anxious Day 5 Google Pixel is a big deviation from Google’s older Nexus program.

It's not exactly a store, but the Google "showroom" that opened Thursday in New York is the internet giant's first real-world shop and a step onto terrain where rival Apple has excelled. The success of the temporary storefront Google opened in the trendy Soho neighborhood could help the California-based company decide whether to follow Apple's lead and operate its own brick-and-mortar retail operation. The New York pop-up shop will be open through the end of this year, and let people get their hands on new Google devices such as Pixel smartphones which began shipping Thursday in a direct challenge to Apple's latest iPhones. "This is not even a testing ground, just an extension of the launch," Google spokeswoman Chrissy Persico said at the showroom opening event. "We want people to come in and experience the products." Google early this month took on rivals Apple, Samsung and Amazon in a new push into hardware, launching the in-house designed Pixel smartphone and a slew of other devices showcasing artificial intelligence prowess. By producing both the phone hardware and its Android software, Google is making a more direct assault on Apple and its tightly controlled ecosystem. The pop-up shop also displayed Google's freshly unveiled Daydream View virtual reality headset, a modular wi-fi system, and a Home virtual assistant that will challenge the Amazon Echo device. Nothing is sold at the Google shop, but the staff directs potential customers to the company's online store or telephone operators who can take orders for products. - 'Big battle' - A wall in the shop is decorated with an artful arrangement of blue, red, yellow and green blocks, arranged to display the internet company's trademark colors. Only 30 or so visitors ventured into the pop-up store for its opening morning, a lean showing in comparison to mobs typically drawn to new Apple stores. Apple has a shop in Soho, too, and many more across the country and around the world. As differences on the hardware side of premium smartphones have faded, competitors have increasingly stressed "experiences" such as smoothly accessing content or services. "I am interested in technology, so I just hang out in stores," Columbia University student Ravi Lakshmanan told AFP in the Google shop. "There is going to be a big battle of platforms and it's going to be interesting to watch." Another visitor, Ike McLaughlin, said he has flip-flopped between the rivals but is on Google's side for now because he felt Apple was "playing it safe, when Google is taking risks and making a push in artificial intelligence." McLaughlin's verdict echoes the concerns of analysts that Apple has not delivered a market-shaking new product since the death of visionary co-founder Steve Jobs in 2011. But even if its market capitalization has fallen below peaks hit in 2015, Apple remains the world's most valuable company based on its share price. For the financial year ending September 2015, Apple posted a net profit of $53 billion, double the figure posted in the last year of the reign of Steve Jobs.

These files could provide insights regarding these devices difference with models of the Nexus line.  ( Google ) Advertisement Google has already published the latest over-the-air (OTA) update images and Pixel factory images at the tech company's developers' page last Oct. 20. This news should be welcome for the tech-savvy crowd out there who likes to tinker with their Android devices. To those wondering what these "images" are all about, these are the files necessary to manually restore or update Google phones beginning with the Nexus line. The factory images can restore the phone's original factory setting. This is particularly handy for users who encountered errors when rooting or customizing their devices. Unlike the OTA images, however, the installation of the factory images will wipe out all data from the device. The OTA images, on the other hand, merely update the device. "This has the same effect of flashing the corresponding factory images, but without the need of wiping the device," Google explained how the OTA images works. Google has provided all the details and instructions such as the six-step OTA update application as well as key security warnings when proceeding with the update. But Nexus and Pixel phone owners are advised to proceed with caution especially if they do not have experience rooting their handsets. The posting of the Pixel and Nexus factory and OTA files also provides an opportunity for the public to compare the differences between the Nexus phones and the latest Google Pixel phones. However, since the files have been recently posted, there is still scant information in this respect. This is bound to change as developers start to evaluate all the information. So far, we only know that Google has provided the Google Pixel and Pixel XL three builds each. The former, which was also identified in the post as Sailfish, has the 7.1.0 (NDE63H), 7.1.0 (NDE63L) and 7.1.0 (NDE63P). The three downloadable builds for Pixel XL, also referred to as Marlin include 7.1.0 (NDE63H), 7.1.0 (NDE63L) and 7.1.0 (NDE63P). The three build versions are reportedly identical. The distinction is said to be based on the three regions where both phones are being sold. If you are ready to flash or update your Pixel device, do not forget to check if it is bootloader unlockable. As Tech Times previously reported, Pixel phones bought from Verizon are unlocked. You should also be mindful that unlocking the bootloader, which is necessary to flash your device, will void its support for Android Pay. Using the factory image will wipe all your phone's data.

Log in Sign up Login with Facebook Login with Google Go Advanced News Reviews Phones Home News Blog Reviews Comments (29) Post your comment Watch the Google Pixel and LG V20 go through scratch and burn tests 21 October 2016 YouTuber JerryRigEverything is back with a couple of new scratch and burn durability tests. He performs endurance tests on smartphones by testing how easily every component on the outside of the phone can be damaged with either razors, Mohs hardness picks, or a lighter to test the 'degradability' of pixels over time. Starting off with the scratch test, the Google Pixel features Gorilla Glass 4 and begins scratching above a Mohs hardness scale level of 6. Nothing out of the ordinary there. The earpiece is a concern at it is not a metal mesh, but made of some kind of tough fabric. The YouTuber reminds owners to be careful not to puncture the earpiece when cleaning. As for the razor test, the front glass resisted well against the blade while the rear glass showed light scratches. With the same razor, he scratched the aluminum unibody, but its worth noting that his key and coin scratches rubbed right off. As for the fingerprint scanner on the Really Blue model, the razor made deep scratches into the scanners coating, but the fingerprint scanner worked perfectly fine afterwards, nonetheless. The bend test of the Google Pixel really shows HTCs exceptional design. Unlike the case with the Nexus 6P, which failed the bend test on the YouTubers channel, twice, the Google Pixel is built very sturdy and the area near the volume key didnt dent like the 6Ps did. The LG V20 went off to a rocky start as both the top and bottom bezels of the phone are made of just plastic. But, thankfully, the earpiece is made of metal, just like all the buttons found on the device. Much like the Google Pixels fingerprint scanner, however, the LG V20s fingerprint sensor is also able to read a print 100% of the time, despite its surface being mercilessly scratched. While keys and coins mark the Pixel, they didnt cause any permanent damage, as the Pixels key and coin marks rubbed right off. It appears the iPhone 7 did better in the key test, and the Pixel did even better with the same test. The camera comes with a small protector which should be left on. As the YouTuber scratched the bare glass surface, a few seconds passed before the entire rear camera glass shattered as it became weak. Bringing it to the bend test, the removable battery of the LG V20 doesnt grant it the same amount of structural integrity found in other smartphones with internal batteries. So while the LG V10 handled the bend test a little better, the V20 still passes this guys durability test.

You’ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You’re all set! Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Henry Farrell October 21 Follow @henryfarrell Twitter was unavailable for much of Friday after a massive attack on the underpinnings of the Internet. (Leon Neal/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images) As users of Twitter and many other services probably know, large parts of the Internet weren’t working Friday, thanks to a hacking attack on the Internet’s infrastructure. NBC reported that a senior intelligence official told the network that the hack “does not appear at this point to be any kind of state-sponsored or directed attack.” It may be that new evidence emerges that leads the U.S. intelligence community to change its opinion and identify a major state as a responsible party. The scarier possibility is that it wasn’t a state that did it. The attack targeted the domain name system. The Internet relies on a complicated mix of systems and protocols to work. Friday’s attack targeted a key aspect of the Internet — the domain name system. Every time your desktop or phone browser asks to load the Web page for, say, http://www.washingtonpost.com, specialized servers need to turn the Web address into a series of numbers — the IP address — to figure out where the request ought to be sent. The company that was hacked Friday runs part of the domain name system. The hackers sent so many requests to the domain name servers that they were overwhelmed. This kind of attack is called a distributed denial of service attack, or DDoS attack. It used to be thought of as a relatively unsophisticated instrument, and many forms of DDoS can be easily repelled, once the target of the attack realizes what is going on. Both activists (such as members of the loose Anonymous collective) and state actors (looking to silence inconvenient dissidents offshore) have used DDoS attacks in the past. Such attacks led Google to create Project Shield, which was intended to deploy Google’s massive resources to protect actors who might otherwise be effectively silenced by nefarious actors. These attacks have escalated. Unfortunately, such attacks have escalated dramatically over time. The problem started with unsecured computers. Many people (almost certainly including readers of this article) are bad at keeping their computer operating systems updated, with the result that their computers have been quietly subverted and made part of ‘botnets’ made up of thousands of enslaved machines. These computers can then be turned against a target system, repeatedly bombarding it with demands until it is effectively taken off the Internet. Criminals have herded botnets to blackmail the owners of gambling websites by threatening to keep them offline with DDoS attacks until a ransom is paid. Recently, however, the stakes have escalated. What’s called the “Internet of Things” — the many consumer products connected to the Internet — has created opportunities for botnet herders because these products tend to be badly secured and are usually never updated. Brian Krebs, a prominent writer and consultant on security, has often been targeted by the criminals he writes about. Last month, he was hit by a massive attack mounted by a botnet of compromised devices. Friday’s attack used the same ‘Mirai’ system, which was recently released into the wild so that anyone with moderate technical skills could use it to compromise and set up their own network of devices. Anyone could be responsible. As Krebs pointed out in a follow-up blog post, the truly frightening thing is that anyone could be responsible. It used to be that only states had the firepower to mount really dramatic attacks like this. Now, as one of Krebs’s friends puts it, “When it comes to DDoS attacks, nation-states are just another player. Today’s reality is that DDoS attacks have become the Great Equalizer between private actors & nation-states.” One shouldn’t push this analogy too far. Other kinds of cyberattacks — such as the attack that the United States and Israel reportedly mounted on the Iranian nuclear program — require bespoke skills and customization and are out of the reach of all but sophisticated nation-states. Even so, taking down a large chunk of the Internet, as Friday’s attack apparently did, is well within the grasp of small criminal groups and other ordinary actors. Equally, the fact that this is possible for ordinary actors may provide opportunities for states to undertake nefarious activities without getting the blame. Many of the techniques used to identify the perpetrators of cyberattacks rely on “fingerprints” in the computer code underlying the attack. For example, if you are mounting an attack, it may be cheaper and easier for you to redeploy code that you have already used in others than to write everything from scratch. This may, in turn, make it easier to identify you. Such identification techniques will be harder to use against DDoS attacks like this one, which deploy code that is widely available and hence impossible to attribute to another actor. There may be other means of identification (for example, there might be bugs in the source code that could be exploited to pinpoint whoever is running it), but we don’t know for certain. This might tempt states as well as nonstate actors to use this system to mount DDoS attacks in the belief that others will likely be blamed. The underlying problem is tough to solve. These attacks are likely to continue — and get worse — as long as more devices are released that can be subverted and slaved by botnets. Unfortunately, as another prominent security expert, Bruce Schneier, argues, that’s going to keep on happening. The producers of buggy and insecure cameras, baby monitors and so on have no incentive to improve them, since no one can sue them for the side effects of their carelessness. The users of the products don’t have any reason to care, either. Schneier suggests that we might at least begin to address the problem by regulating manufacturers, or by making it possible for the victims of attacks, like Krebs, to sue them. This is, as Schneier certainly knows, unlikely under current political circumstances. The business community has resisted such mandates and rights for decades and almost certainly still has enough political clout to continue to resist. 1 of 15 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × See where the Internet lives: Inside Google’s data centers View Photos Take a look inside the company’s data centers around the world.

IVANCA About me Google will be your enemy, and one who knows you a little too well Do you think Google would sell all your personal information to ISIS for $200? I think they would, as long as nobody notices it, meaning if it doesn’t get bad PR or any sort of repercussion; plausible deniability could be enough: “We sold your information to someone! Oops we didn’t know it was ISIS! Sorry!” How did it come to this? Well, there wasn’t a clear point where you decided to give up your information in exchange for good search engines and a good mail system; it just was 1998 and you were in front of a computer looking to navigate this new thing called the Internet, and someone told you that there is this thing called Google where you can search anything at all; how convenient! The thing is, that first time they forgot to put in big red letters a message saying “Welcome to Google. We will track the searches -and every activity- you do today and every search you do from now on until the day you die, they all will be logged on our archive about you, we can and will do anything we please with such data, specially advertisement, but more importantly, we have no restrictions, even if there are any restriction written in our current terms-of-services it doesn’t matter, because our terms-of-service can by changed by us at any given time in the future without prior notice.” Until recently Google had a little rule about not tracking you on third-party sites, but no more, and the thing is, it doesn’t even matter if the sites you visited have Google plus or not, because tracking you was done (and is being done) with the help of Google Analytics, Google Maps, Gmail, Google JavaScript CDN, Google Play apps, Google Android (all of it), Google Images, Google APIs, Google Blogger Widgets, Google YouTube videos. Basically, they probably know more about you than yourself, you don’t remember what pages were you visiting this day one year ago? Well, Google does. Do you think removing this rule is where Google stops? Do you think tomorrow they will not try to push a little further what they allow themselves to do with your data? They will, even worst if Google stock starts falling when they will try to monetize your data with more ethically dubious tactics, and if the stock falls even further they will try something a little more unethical, and so forth. This is actually the only aspect where I believe Apple has an edge over the competition, is not the pretty smartphones or the cute user interfaces; its that their incentives are actually aligned with their clients interests’, because they don’t make money selling your info, they make money by selling you the next inane iPhone/iPad upgrade, and as long as you keep buying their incentives will match. I know, this all sounds too fear-mongering and I’m sure you are (and will be) more useful for Google if you continue breathing and out of jail, but the room for damage is big enough to be worrisome. Oh yeah, and then there is Facebook, but I will leave that one for your imagination, or perhaps your nightmares. 3 weeks ago 1 note devilduck liked this ivanca posted this

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Fabriq is the first Alexa-powered portable speaker By Ida Torres - October 21, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Alexa, the intelligent personal assistant that is part of Amazon Echo’s portable smart speaker, has been a pretty good competitor to the likes of Apple’s Siri, Window’s Cortana, and Google’s…well, Ok Google. But previously, you could only experience it on the aforementioned Echo. Until now, that is. Fabriq is the first Alexa-powered portable, all-in-one speaker. And the best part is that it actually looks pretty and can even be part of your house or office decorations. Fabriq looks like a decorative item that will go well with your other accessories at home or at your workplace but it of course serves not just as a speaker but your connection to your Alexa service as well. It has dual WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity and high quality sound so you can use it as stand-alone speaker or paired with other speakers for multi-room purposes. You will also be able to control the speaker or speakers through the Fabriq app on your smartphone. But of course the highlight of the Fabriq is that you can have it do “neat tricks” courtesy of Alexa. Aside from checking the weather and asking it to recite your schedule, you can also use it to control your supported music apps, control smart devices within and from outside your house, and even call an Uber for yourself. It has a rechargeable battery that can last up to five hours and comes with a 2” precision active driver, a 2” passive radiator, and 5W of power. Fabriq comes in three styles: Jack Plaid, Earl Grey, and Splat. The design has different colors, prints, and fabrics, wrapping up a 3.15” x 3.15” x 3.15” speaker. It is now available through Amazon.com for only $49.99.

LG’s G series of smartphones has been gaining traction over the past couple of years, and the G5 certainly turned heads when LG announced its partially modular design, which allows users to add modules to improve certain aspects of the phone. It sounded good in theory, but realistically hasn’t garnered much attention after the fact. Only two modules, the CAM Plus and the Hi-Fi DAC modules, have been released, despite the implication that more modules would become available over the course of the year. There’s also the fact that modules are expensive, and require a reboot of the device every time you switch modules out. The G5’s less-than-desirable fate was a mixture of two things: the modular capabilities weren’t modular enough, and modularity in general just doesn't seem like something that most smartphone consumers are interested in, or even ready for. Even Google’s Project Ara, which was based almost entirely on modularity, was canceled earlier this year, so perhaps it’s good news to read that LG is allegedly giving up on the modular dream when it comes to the G6. In some ways it’s a shame, because it felt like smartphones were heading in a more modular direction. Not only was the G5 unveiled this year, but the Lenovo Moto Z was also unveiled with a “modular type” design of its own. Before Project Ara was canceled, I had high hopes for the future of modular smartphones. Lately, though, my enthusiasm for the concept has waned. I still think that the modular concept is interesting and could help with certain pitfalls of the industry such as contributing to e-Waste, but I’m no longer convinced that modularity is a concept that the industry, or its consumers, are ready for right now. In regards to LG, I do wonder if the G6 will end up being more popular than the G5. It’s hard to imagine that something designed retroactively could be more popular than something so innovative (even if unpopular, I do consider the G5 to be innovative), but not impossible, especially when you take into consideration how well Apple’s “retro” iPhone SE was received earlier this year. Plus, when you think about it, as long as LG keeps a micoSD card, removable battery, and 3.5mm headphone jack, they’re pretty much set. Even in the unlikely case that their batteries caused explosions, a removable battery would make the situation a hundred times easier to deal with than inconveniencing people with multiple returns or exchanges. But I’m sure that LG would still need to come up with something to attract attention to the brand. Although I believe LG’s popularity has improved over the past few years, it still wanes in comparison to Apple, Samsung, and most recently Google. My first thought was for LG to add in the same secondary display that it has in the V10 and V20, but then that takes away from the uniqueness of the V series. On the other hand, perhaps LG’s best move is just to keep it simple, as we can see with the G5 that it is possible to be innovative and unsuccessful at the same time. With the Note 7 officially off the table and the iPhone 7 causing controversy with the missing 3.5mm headphone jack, now also appears to be the most opportune moment to be perfectly adequate when it comes to smartphones; if only HTC had waited until now to release the HTC 10. Readers, what are your thoughts on these rumors? Do you think LG should keep pushing on with a modular design in the G6, or is the industry simply not ready for this type of design yet?

What began with fitness trackers, smartwatches and other tech-driven accessories, has since blossomed into wearable technology that can measure, monitor and report on our health, now, from the very fabric of our clothing. Wearable tech has been the hot topic of the year with brands like Fitbit. The fitness tracking brand pulled ahead of Apple and Samsung as the top purveyor of leading wearable devices.  Fitbit recently reported first-quarter net income of $11 million on $505.4 million in revenue. As consumers’ response to tech has varied, from the unfavorable (Google Glass) to the hopeful (VR Goggles), the question remains: How will the consumer respond to the meteoric developments in the world of wearables? “It’s this convergence of really figuring out how you integrate technology in an invisible way, yet it’s meaningful to the consumer. Every brand has a unique consumer,” Sandra Lopez, vice president of strategic relationships/business development for Intel’s New Devices Group, told The International Business Times at the 2016 Fashion Tech Forum, which was held in Brooklyn Oct. 13. Founded by CEO and consultant Karen Harvey, this was the conference’s third year and played host to innovators in the wearables space, from Sandra Lopez, Intel's vice president of wearables, to Paul Dillinger, Levi’s vice president of global product innovation.  Lopez has championed Intel’s bite-size module device, Intel’s Curie Module, and formed partnerships with fashion brands like Fila for Baja East and Hussein Chalayan to integrate the device, a mix of software and hardware, into their accessories, making virtually any piece a wearable. Lopez said the success of wearable pieces lies in how each brand harnesses the technology to make it work for consumers. And “one size” does not fit all.  “It’s personal. I firmly believe that the people who are not using their Fitbits and put it in their drawer three months later, it probably wasn’t for them to begin with. “As a technology company, there is not one solution for everybody,” Lopez added. “We’re all different. Bringing relevant experiences and multiple experiences is going to be the key to success.” In 2016, there is no shortage of brands and companies that have delivered to bring consumers those “relevant” and continued experiences. From wearable, tech-driven fabrics to mood, health and wellness trackers, here are 10 brands and products that are redefining “wearable tech” to bring consumers smart, intuitive experiences through technology.  Tech Fabrics: Garments that feature “smart” fabric will be the washable, everyday answer to the wearable tech accessory. Google and Levi’s teamed up on Project Jacquard, which was first announced in May and champions garments made from yarns that can interact directly with digital devices and smartphones.  Using integrated GPS and electronics that are washable, Wearable Experiments also debuted a line of pieces that connect wearers to experience, or “human/computer” interaction. The company released a sports jersey, aptly named the Fan Jersey, prior to the Super Bowl that transmits haptic vibrations, allowing fans to feel vibrations based on real-time plays during the game. The company also released leggings called the Nadi X. The tights are made with the same technology as the jersey, but assist the wearer in correcting form during a workout.  Module-Based Wearables: Intel’s Curie Module is an example of a device that could be incorporated into a variety of products to make them wearable. In the past year, Intel has partnered with fashion brands to integrate the module into a variety of pieces.  A collaboration with designer Hussein Chalayan during Fashion Week in September saw the debut of Curie Module-powered glasses that gather biometric data to monitor breathing, heart rate and brainwave activity. Baja East and Fila partnered for Fashion Week to debut a footwear line that also used Intel's Curie technology. The connected shoes can "track and interpret fitness data" for the wearer.  Fitness and Wellbeing Trackers: Fitness trackers have had some of the highest success rates in the wearable tech space, and when it comes to fitness, Fitbit products have consistently hit the mark. Its new Charge 2 wristband uses a PurePulse Heart Rate feature that tracks heart rate and can better track caloric burn. Stress and overall wellbeing are kept in check with Vinaya’s Zenta wearable, a pioneering piece in “emotion technology.” Zenta builds a profile of the wearer by tracking sleep, stress, emotional states and overall mood. The Zenta wristbands can be pre-ordered on the brand’s Indiegogo page and are expected to ship beginning in March.  VR Goggles And Glasses: With the advent of mainstream VR technology, consumers can expect to see many iterations of VR goggles debut soon. One of the most buzzed-about products is the Oculus Rift, which is expected to debut later this year. The goggles can plug in through USB or DVI ports and the consumer model is said to use 2160-by-1200 resolution, Warable reported. The Samsung Gear VR goggles are available now and connect to Samsung’s smartphones, making them compatible and user-friendly.  Related Stories Wearable Tech Takes On Air Pollution The Quirkiest New Wearables Pet Tech: Pets are in on the wearable action, too. Wearable devices that track and monitor pet health have claimed a space in the wearables category. Brands include Whistle, which tracks a pet’s location and daily activity, and PetPace, a “smart collar” that monitors a pet’s vital signs, activity and behavioral patterns.  “Enviro-trackers”: Devices that not only measure personal health and well-being, but monitor surroundings and the environment will be another coming wearable trend. Tzoa revealed its “enviro-tracker,” which hooks directly to garments and uses internal sensors to measure and report temperature, air quality, atmospheric pressure and UV exposure. Using the data, the device can help the wearer determine where there’s fresh air and indicate locations on a real-time environmental data map that shows where there is air pollution. Tzoa’s enviro-tracker currently is available for pre-order.    Join the Discussion Most Read Stay connected to the biggest stories unfolding in technology.

SOCIAL MEDIA TOOLKIT 5 Insights on Branding in the Digital Age Everything about your online presence from your social media profiles to your opinions is a small reflection of who you are as a person. Here's how to make sure it represents your brand. By Bill Carmody Bill Carmody is the founder and CEO of Trepoint and a 22-year digital marketing veteran. His purpose in life is to be an inspirational leader who enjoys solving problems and creating breakthroughs for those brave enough to build a better future. @BillCarmody Founder and CEO, Trepoint@BillCarmody WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement "You never get a second chance to make a first impression." Remember that old saying? That came from a time when most people met face to face. Now, in the digital age, your first impression precedes you. In a previous article, I wrote about the fact that "You Are Who Google Says You Are." Everything about your online presence from your social media profiles to your status messages, your opinions to your articles and tweets, everything you publish online is a small reflection of who you are as a person. Today, before anyone meets you in person, they spend a few minutes on Google to determine who you are, what you stand for and just about anything they want to know about you. It's an understatement to say that, "Your reputation precedes you." This week, we have a digital identity expert and founder of Binary Tattoo, Cat Coode who spent some time speaking with Devishobha, founder of Kidskintha- a platform for millennial parenting and its unique challenges. Devishobha met Cat Coode as a guest for her interview series called Momspirations and they spoke about 5 ways brands manage their digital identity. Your Brand Begins With Your Profiles. The first story about your brand comes from the company's online profile. And, once they are online, they are permanent. There are three ways in which brands are boosted by their social media profiles: The company's profile: A good profile is one that is direct, simple and tells the brand's story at first shot. Both the profile photo and the cover image together create a great imagery and impression in the eyes of the viewers and it's important for them to complement each other. The best ones are those that are kept very simple and stick to the message. The 'About' space should be as clear as possible, and the rest of the page would do well to complement each other. The profiles of your employees & brand ambassadors: In the age of social media, people representing the brand carry the extra burden of representing the brand's identity more than they would like. Nothing is more reminiscent of this fact that this recent incident in India, where an upcoming brand was forced to give up a very popular actor as its brand ambassador purely out of pressure from social media, because his public image at the time was harmful to the brand's image. When companies have people within the organization representing them in certain specific roles, their profiles have a large impact on the company's brand image too, though it may not be in the scale of a celebrity endorsement. The profile of the anyone associated with the brand: People like employees and clients who are associated with a brand could give out an impression about the company, even though personal profiles cannot be tied too tightly with the company's. However, in professional networks like LinkedIn, a brand is seen in a very positive light when its employees share the company's updates and events regularly on their timelines, even if it is in a personal capacity. Build policies around the use of third-party applications: Most companies would require the use of third-party apps. Most apps request access to some of your data to run the application. In some cases, unseen metadata may be sent to the app makers. To protect sensitive and private information, it is always it is advisable to put out a clear set of rules for use of app requested data especially while working with a team. Some useful rules: Always download only from the App Store of a device. Turn off data that might not be required by the apps Do a rain-check on what kind of data is being requested, and if the application needs that kind of data. Be wary of free apps. Most are 'free' in exchange for information. Apart from this, employees should also be made aware of other organizations that might be interested in getting the company's data(and their own). 3. Educate your teams on how to deal with Cyberbullies. The thing with internet trolling is that you never know who the troller is nor will you likely meet them face-to-face. One wrong tweet and the trolling may explode and there's no knowing to what level it can cascade. In some cases, many are also left wondering what was so offensive about a post or tweet that exploded the bullying. In such cases, it's always a good thing to have a consistent plan of action and policy to deal with cyberbullying. Some recommendations: Have information handy on the cyber bullying reporting procedures for various platforms. Always take a screenshot before deleting the post to be able to provide evidence. 4. Create a Social Media Policy for your teams. Social media acts like the proverbial wildfire. The instant the publish button is hit, we lost sight of where our written word is spreading next and what pathways it will trigger for further dissemination. In the light of such a scenario, it is extremely important to have consistent controls on the source. Having clear guidelines for your team(s) or even club(s) that you might run can save us a lot of heartbreak down the line. Some recommendations: Have consistent guidelines about photo posts. Set clear expectations on the language and tone to be used in the messages. Brush up the policies at regular intervals and have it reach the teams regularly. 5. Keep branding consistent. Earlier, the only messages that we got about brands was billboards and television ads. Today, we see brand messages splashed out on several platforms- Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn company pages, Youtube, Blogs, Interviews of prominent leaders- everything spells out something. It becomes important to keep social profiles up-to-date and in-sync with each other. The profile and cover pictures should communicate the same sentiment across platforms. They should also be kept up-to-date with information on upcoming products and services, to keep it fresh for the viewers. Different networks cater to different demographics. Hence, convey the brand's core personality on different platforms in a manner that connects with the demographics on the network assumes utmost significance. A LinkedIn campaign definitely cannot be as flashy and free-style as a Facebook or Pinterest campaign, but both have to connect to the brand's personality and convey the core message to the audience. Similarly, promotional offers on different networks also need to be altered to suit the network. Like this article? Get breakthrough marketing tips in your inbox every week!

Debunking urban legends How To Debunk Online Rumors & Urban Myths How To Debunk Online Rumors & Urban Myths Have you ever seen a post on the Internet and your only reaction was "what? That can’t possibly be true". It’s happened to me lots of times and I’m always sent on a wild goose... Read More , like the infamous Iraq camel spider, thankfully isn’t actually too difficult due to the wealth of information online. Yet for some reason, people are still regularly fooled by these hoaxes. Perhaps it’s due to the human desire to find and believe in wild things, or maybe people are just lazy and believe everything they read online Do You Believe Everything You Read on the Web? [You Told Us] Do You Believe Everything You Read on the Web? [You Told Us] Having established a long time ago how great the Web is as a learning tool - packed full of information that is now all available right at your fingertips - it's time to remind ourselves... Read More . Either way, one popular hoaxing topic that has fooled people for years is Apple’s iPhone. Let’s take a look back at some of the dumbest iPhone hoaxes that have spread over the years. Most of these surfaced as “tips” or “hacks” that would in reality destroy your phone or render it unusable. 1. iOS 7’s Fake Waterproofing One of the headline features of the new iPhone 7 (and 7 Plus) Everything You Need to Know About the iPhone 7 & iPhone 7 Plus Everything You Need to Know About the iPhone 7 & iPhone 7 Plus No headphone port, water and dust resistance, and Apple's best camera yet -- this is the iPhone 7.

What Makes a Device Waterproof or Water-Resistant? A lot of devices are marketed as waterproof, but that can be severely misleading. Most are actually water-resistant. What's the difference? Here's everything you need to know about it. Read More , which is obviously something built into the physical device. That didn’t stop people from believing that updating to iOS 7 would magically make their phones waterproof, though. When a fake advertisement made to look like official Apple information created by 4chan users advised folks that the latest OS update would make their phones waterproof, many believed it. Why is everyone making a big deal about the water-proof iPhone 7? iOS 7 already made my iPhone 6 water-proof!! pic.twitter.com/eLKh4IEnqP — Mark Cerqueira (@markmcerqueira) September 28, 2016 Ads by Google The victims never stopped to think about how a software update could have an effect on the ability of the phone to resist being thrown into water How To Save A Wet Cell Phone Or Tablet How To Save A Wet Cell Phone Or Tablet I’ve got bad news for you. Dropping your phone in a puddle of water, bath, sink, toilet – even getting caught in a heavy shower – will leave it irreparably damaged. The same goes for... Read More , and ended up with a destroyed unit instead. Even with a waterproof phone, you shouldn’t push your luck. Treat the waterproofing of your $700+ phone as accident protection, not a feature to be pushed to the max with potentially disastrous results! 2. The iPhone 7’s Secret Headphone Jack Certainly the most controversial feature of the new iPhone 7/7+ has been the removal of the headphone jack. A good pair of Bluetooth headphones Best Bluetooth Headphones in 2016 Best Bluetooth Headphones in 2016 Android and Apple phones may dispense with their audio jacks. Bluetooth, on the other hand, may replace wires entirely. So you may want to invest in Bluetooth headphones. But which one? Read More  or use of the included lightning-to-stereo adapter solves this problem, and the new iPhone still sounds great. No Stereo Jack, No Problem: Why the iPhone 7 Sounds Great No Stereo Jack, No Problem: Why the iPhone 7 Sounds Great It's official -- Apple has removed the standard 3.5mm headphone jack on the iPhone 7. But don't worry, this is a good thing. Read More  But many still aren’t pleased. Of course, nothing is stopping people from refusing to buy a phone that doesn’t have the features they want. Some iPhone 7 users have instead decided to take matter into their own hands and drill a hole into their devices to find the “secret” 3.5mm jack. Of course, this results only in a destroyed iPhone. Having a look at the comments of the YouTube video above (that started this trend) reveals hundreds of people that tried this and wonder why it doesn’t work. We’re not sure how people could be this foolish, especially since this isn’t the first iPhone hoax. It turns out taking a drill to your device isn’t a good idea. Check out a few other reasons for skipping the iPhone 7 Why You Might Want to Skip the iPhone 7 & Wait for the iPhone 8 Why You Might Want to Skip the iPhone 7 & Wait for the iPhone 8 2017 marks ten years of iPhones, and rumor has it that Apple has something very special planned. Read More if the lack of a headphone jack is a sticking point for you. 3. iOS 8’s Microwave Charging Microwaves are great for cooking food, but have you ever seen an electronic device put into a microwave? It doesn’t end well. That didn’t stop the iOS 8 “microwave charging” iPhone hoax, however. Coming once again from the depths of 4chan, another real-looking Apple advertisement surfaced touting iOS 8’s ability to recharge your phone with just a few moments in the microwave. #iOS8 #WaveCharge pic.twitter.com/XLeqvSByM2 — Derek Rodriguez (@drod2169) September 19, 2014 While the waterproof myth at least has some basis in reality How Star Trek Predicted the Future We Now Live In How Star Trek Predicted the Future We Now Live In Faster-than-light travel may be a long way off, but Star Trek still successfully predicted the future we now live in. Read More , you would hope that the majority of people know that microwaves don’t mesh well with phones. Unfortunately that didn’t stop people from trying this out for themselves. A quick glance over the comments on the video “proving” that this works shows several commenters lamenting their newly ruined phones.

[Tech News Digest] Google retires Picasa after 14 years, your iPhone has bad memories of the 1970s, Netflix goes all in on Amazon Web Services. the Nigerian scam no one will fall for, and jamming with Google Translate. Read More that was exploited by those who wanted to have some fun with it. Any newer 64-bit iDevice (equal to or above the iPhone 5S, iPad Air, iPad Mini 2) that had its date changed to January 1, 1970 would not be able to start back up if it was shut off. This was caused by the way that Unix (which iOS is based on) keeps time. It uses a 32-bit number to record the number of seconds that have passed since 00:00 UTC on January 1, 1970. Apparently, Apple (understandably) never planned for a phone to be set to this paradoxical date. iOS 9.3 arrived soon iOS 9.3 Has Arrived, Here's Why You Should Upgrade iOS 9.3 Has Arrived, Here's Why You Should Upgrade While mainly focusing on bug fixes and increased performance, iOS 9.3 introduces few new features which make updating all the more worthwhile. Read More after this bug was found, and patched it up. While most people would never have a reason to change their phone’s time like this, it didn’t stop some pranksters from having some fun. An “Easter Egg” was circulated that claimed changing the date would unlock a retro Macintosh theme. This, of course, was not true, and resulted in a lot of iPhones being turned into doorstops. iphone users – blast from the past easter egg! Set date to January 1, 1970 and reboot! Have fun! pic.twitter.com/SnsJPIcDV5 — Pat ? Wallace (@PatWallace) February 15, 2016 For another interesting implication of Unix time, check out the Year 2038 Problem. 5. Bending Is a Feature An unfortunate design flaw, the tendency of the iPhone 6 to bend in tight pockets or under stress was well-known during its time. This garnered plenty of humorous reactions on Twitter Trolling Apple: The 18 Best Reactions To The iPhone 6 Bending [Weird & Wonderful Web] Trolling Apple: The 18 Best Reactions To The iPhone 6 Bending [Weird & Wonderful Web] Apple was trolled hard over the iPhone 6 Plus bending, and we have compiled the best reactions to BendGate just for you. Read More , and most people knew to avoid placing their phones in tight positions. If you’ve been following along, you already know the story here. People capitalized on the bending “feature” of the iPhone 6 and created videos letting people know of the new “functionality.” This YouTube video that mocks Apple’s style is pretty obviously fake, but scour the comments and you’ll see people asking if their warranty covers a bent phone. You’d think people would at least run a quick Google search before doing something that could ruin their expensive phones. Apparently, you’d be wrong! Don’t Believe the Lies It’s fun to look back and see all the silly pranks that have been pulled Charge Your iPhone With an Onion, And Other Elaborate YouTube Hoaxes Charge Your iPhone With an Onion, And Other Elaborate YouTube Hoaxes Remember that eHarmony cat lady? Or the pig who rescued a goat? They were both hoaxes; here's a few more. Read More in years past. Of course, it wasn’t funny for the people who fell for this stuff and broke their phones, but that’s on them. By observing what has happened before, we can be better prepared for the future and the hoaxes that may arise in years to come. If you don’t take anything else away from this article, know that the depths of the internet have no problems trying to fool you into destroying your equipment.

One of the big takeaways is the repair score: a six out of 10. That’s not quite as good as the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus (which score a seven), but it’s far better than the Samsung Galaxy S7 (which scored a three), and the Nexus 6P (two out of 10). iFixit One of the highlights that the team points to is the modular nature of the phone: many of the components can be easily replaced, which makes the phone easier to repair. They also highlighted the HTC battery with a pull tab, which makes it easy to remove and replace, as well as the phone’s front 8-megapixel and back 12.3-megapixel cameras. The phone isn't flawless when it comes to fixability: they pointed out that the display comes in a thin frame, which is easy to bend or damage. You can check out the entire teardown on iFixit.

It can, for instance, navigate its way through a map of the London underground without being explicitly instructed how to do so. For the moment, this approach is less efficient than the old-fashioned, more specialised forms of artificial intelligence, but it holds out promise for the future and, like all such conceptual advances in computer programming, it raises more urgently the question of how society should harness these powers. Algorithms in themselves long predate computers. An algorithm is simply a sequence of instructions. Law codes can be seen as algorithms. The rules of games can be understood as algorithms, and nothing could be more human than making up games. Armies are perhaps the most completely algorithmic forms of social organisation. Yet too much contemporary discussion is framed as if the algorithmic workings of computer networks are something entirely new. It’s true that they can follow instructions at superhuman speed, with superhuman fidelity and over unimaginable quantities of data. But these instructions don’t come from nowhere. Although neural networks might be said to write their own programs, they do so towards goals set by humans, using data collected for human purposes. If the data is skewed, even by accident, the computers will amplify injustice. If the measures of success that the networks are trained against are themselves foolish or worse, the results will appear accordingly. Recent, horrifying examples include the use of algorithms to grade teachers in the US and to decide whether prisoners should be granted parole or not. In both these cases, the effect has been to punish the poor just for being poor. This kind of programming is, in the programmer Maciej Cegłowski’s phrase, like money-laundering for bias. But because the obnoxious determinations are made by computer programs, they seem to have an unassailable authority. We should not grant them this. Self-interest, as well as justice, is on the side of caution here. Algorithmic trading between giant banks is certainly to blame for such phenomena as “flash crashes” and is very plausibly responsible for the great financial disaster of 2008. But there is nothing inevitable about the decision to hand over to a computer the capacity to make decisions for us. There is always a human responsibility and this belongs with the companies or organisations that make use of – or at least unleash – the powers of the computer networks. To pretend otherwise is like blaming the outbreak of the first world war on railway timetables and their effect on the mobilisation of armies. The cure for the excesses of computerised algorithms is not in principle different from the remedies we have already discovered for algorithms that are embedded in purely human institutions. Expert claims must be scrutinised by outsiders and justified to sceptical, if intelligent and fair minded, observers. There needs to be a social mechanism for appealing against these judgments, and means to identify their mistakes and prevent them happening in future. The interests of the powerful must not be allowed to take precedence over the interests of justice and of society as a whole.
