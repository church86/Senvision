Digital Trends Home > Business > That animated GIF you’re sharing could be an… That animated GIF you’re sharing could be an ad in disguise By Julian Chokkattu — Updated May 26, 2017 2:44 pm Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Animated GIFs (Graphics Interface Format) are now 30 years old, and they are everywhere — we constantly use them to express feelings or joke around with friends, family, or even coworkers. They’re so ubiquitous on the internet that you can now easily find and share GIFs in all the popular messaging apps, like WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, iMessage, keyboards like Google’s Gboard, and even on social networks like Facebook and Twitter. They’re so popular, in fact, that a new trend is brewing. More and more of the GIFs you see are actually ads in disguise. Before you get your pitchfork out in protest that advertising is invading your blessed animated memes, you should know this: you’ve probably already sent a GIF ad. We’re not talking about a banner ad-like GIFs of a flashing Starbucks logo, but something a little more subtle, fun, and relatable. Like the GIF below: See the faded Domino’s logo at the bottom? It’s not going to stop most pizza-lovers from sharing the GIF in a conversation, and GIF search engines are getting paid by companies like Domino’s for pushing their brands. It’s a revenue model the makers behind GIF Keyboard are pursuing. The secret search engine where GIFs are born Have you ever wondered where GIFs come from? Most of us access them by way of GIF search engines — one of which is a company called Tenor (formerly Riffsy). You may have heard of Tenor’s first app, GIF Keyboard, and you have more than likely used its search engine, which powers GIF searches in apps like Google’s Gboard, Duck Duck Go, Kika, and TouchPal. They’re also a main contributor to GIF searches in services like iMessage, Slack, Twitter, Facebook Messenger, and Facebook (soon). “Tenor … has become a search engine for people’s thoughts, feelings, and emotions.” People use Tenor’s GIF search engine about 200 million times per day, and Tenor is looking to monetize its business by tapping into search terms, which perhaps unsurprisingly, are completely different from the types of terms you would throw into a search engine like Google. “Ninety percent of our volume is people typing in emotions — things like “happy,” “sad,” “smile,” “smirk,” — versus Google, where it’s very intent driven; where I want to understand ‘how tall is this glass,’ or ‘how big is this iPad,'” David McIntosh, Tenor’s founder and CEO, told Digital Trends. “People are typing in things like “ugh,” or “smiling” — people don’t go to Google and type in “smiling.” Tenor, more than 200 million times per day, has become a search engine for people’s thoughts, feelings, and emotions.” The fact that Google, the world’s biggest search company, decided to use Tenor’s API (Application Program Interface) over Google’s own Image Search to power GIFs in its keyboard app Gboard makes it clear there’s value in looking at these search terms. About 60 percent of Tenor’s volume is raw emotion, McIntosh said. Another 30 percent are emotions plus a term, like Minions (from Despicable Me). The final 10 percent comes from people searching for a specific GIF. The goal is to map these terms — these emotions — with advertisers. For example, if you type in “good morning” into a Tenor-supported GIF search, you may or may not see Starbucks-branded content. Starbucks-related GIFs can come from terms such as happy holidays, coffee, good morning, cheers, and more. But if the coffee company wants to make sure Starbucks-branded GIFs are your first results, it can pay Tenor to map its content to “good morning,” putting those results at the beginning. The model is cost per share, so advertisers like Starbucks will only have to pay Tenor when someone shares one of these branded GIFs. Will this ruin GIFs? Will people get skittish about sharing ads? Probably not, Gfycat CEO Richard Rabbat told Digital Trends, because we’ve been doing it for quite some time. “Advertisers are putting budgets behind [GIFs] now, because they see not only the fact that people are excited they can share it on messaging or social, but they’re using it to be a part of the conversation,” Rabbat said. Tenor has been mapping branded content with GIFs since it launched GIF Keyboard. Last year, for example, the company worked with Domino’s to map branded pizza GIFs to terms like “party,” “celebrate,” and “love,” and it ended up driving more than 40 million views in less than six weeks. The same applies for new movies and TV series, as Tenor has partnerships with a variety of studios. The GIF company is starting to officially monetize the feature with select advertisers in its own app first, and it will then later expand it to wherever its API is used. “People love showing this content as long as it maps to a particular emotion,” McIntosh said. But for this model to work, the branded GIFs have to be high quality. Rabbat, who spent some time at Google long before launching GIF search engine Gfycat, said employees at Google never thought people would click on ads ahead of search results. “When we looked at Search, for example, people were like, ‘how are you going to put an ad ahead of what people are really looking for?’ But then over time, the ad relevance became so good that people actually found a lot of value out of the ad itself,” he said. “I think that’s the bar we have to cross so we don’t deliver random advertised content. It has to be relevant, it has to be engaging.” The folks at Giphy, Tenor’s main competitor, think people will share these types of GIFs no matter what because it’s usually representative of what they do in real life. “GIFs are cultural soundbites,” Jason Stein, director of Business Development at Giphy, told Digital Trends. “All the GIFs on Giphy make up an entire language of culture that we use to express ourselves digitally in the same way that the places we frequent and the brands we wear help express ourselves in real life. Sharing a Starbucks GIF is the same choice as when someone walks into a [Starbucks] to grab a coffee on their way to work.” Stein hit home the importance of creating high quality GIFs. Giphy, for example, launched Giphy Studios — a production studio made up of people who know how to “make GIFs look great.” “It’s all great content, and that’s all anyone wants,” he said. “So if a partner is creative, understands the space, and makes GIFs that users want, there’s no “weirdness” at all.”

Generate Enquiries for your Business by Listing on Economictimes.com List Your Business Find Service Near You By Mishi Choudhary and Eben Moglen The world's major societies are now wrestling with the enormous social power wielded by the internet's “platform companies“.In Europe they speak of “GAFA“: Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon.Twitter, Uber and other aspirant companies hover just out of the main ring. Billions of people provide data about their personal lives and business activities to these companies, which are using that data as leverage to change human behaviour to their economic advantage.Governments everywhere see them as rivals to their power and also invaluable allies. India and its government too face immense challenges, but also an extraordinary opportunity , if GoI can lead India in the right direction. Essentially , three basic approaches to deal with the power of these American data miners have emerged. First, the US government sees them as pillars of post-industrial American power, and as an immense national security intelligence resource. It is therefore their strategic ally. Second, proponents of “digital sovereignty“, mostly autocracies, have chosen to build national search engines and social media structures, favouring domestic private market entrants (as has happened in Russia and China), and by exercising control over national telecommunications networks to block the US companies. Third, the European Union has attempted to control the companies' behaviour by regulation and litigation. Europe's open and democratic societies have been as fully colonised by the platforms as the US: the plurality of their citizens' email is read by Google, most of their citizens' social and family lives are surveilled by Facebook, and so on. The European Commission and national governments mostly attempt to regulate the companies through competition and “data protection“ law, both of which assume that profiting by collecting information about customers and their behaviour is essentially legitimate, and that the states' functions should be to require a “level playing field“ for local companies, and the acquisition of uninformed “opt-in“ clocks from the citizens whose intimate lives are being commoditised. Even the pursuit of these very narrow neo-liberal goals, however, means undertaking vastly expensive and complex litigation against the platform companies, expending time and taxpayers' money on the largest scale, with uncertain results at best. India has a golden opportunity to find a fourth way . The market in internet services ­ that is, information technology for use by people in their daily lives ­ is now dominated by companies that provide “free“ services in return for massive privacy invasion. This model, in which the consumer is the product, is doing enormous harm to the human race and destroying our privacy environment completely , in order to provide people supposedly “free“ email and other forms of social communication, calendaring and similar services “in the cloud“. Autocratic “digital sovereignty“ like China or Russia cannot be India's way: more than any other society , India stands to benefit economically from the open worldwide Net. No Indian government can afford to use its law officers, its Competition Commission and its taxpayers' money to spend years litigating with Google, Microsoft, or Facebook over individual business practices, in the European style. But to take an American free-market position with respect to the US platform companies is to endorse an immense act of digital colonialism, in which the private lives of more than a billion Indian citizens are delivered “free“ to the data miners. India's greatest advantages in 21st century global economic competition are the intelligence and education of its people. Software and network-based service industries are core components of any Digital India economic strategy .European countries intuit that spending hundreds of millions of euros and years in litigation with Google over whether search results prioritise Google services contributes less to European welfare than building a European business that would compete with Google globally . But this isn't aerospace and they don't know how. India can. India can invent competition that challenges not just the platform companies but their basic, anti-environmental business model. Indian internet companies can provide global digital service platforms that protect, rather than destroy, privacy . Indian internet industries can provide reasonably priced, universally available, privacy respecting services that compete directly with services provided by the US data miners, priced reasonably in local terms in all the developed and developing societies. Indian industries, providing state-of the-art cloud services ­ social networking, email, travel, calendaring, on-line retailing everywhere, etc ­ could very profitably , given Indian cost structures, compete to provide those services to everyone in the world who has seen the error of “free“ services based on privacy invasion, and wants an alternative she can pay for, with confidence in the privacy technology that is all open source, and works in their interest rather than someone else's. This is “for-profit, pro-privacy IT for humanity .“ And because of the economies of scale in this business, industry will be able to provide Indians with deeply subsidised or no-cost services, based not on invading or selling their privacy to multinationals, but as a consequence of the redistributive effect of selling first world consumers their data privacy as an export industry . As a method of restoring competitive health to an industry , nothing succeeds like competition. India can not only secure its strategic economic role in the 21st century global order, not only provide its own people with a chance to raise themselves by serving their own needs and the world's, but also help restore the privacy environment for all humanity by controlling the platform companies directly , positively, profitably, by making a better mousetrap. The world will beat a path to India's door. (Mishi Choudhary is a technology lawyer.

For one, you only get one rental at this price, and two, the deal might not appear for everyone. Your deal might also be be different, some are seeing $1.50.

Not sure what they're welcoming me back from. It wasn't all that long ago I rented Arrival from them. Ryne Hager I was curious what the differences by account might be. I'll update the post to include that. Hurricane Andrew Same here, I got the $1.49 deal yesterday. nagi Does not seem to be active in Hungary. Probably US-only. Arnaldo Rodriguez For me its $0.99 but when I get to the checkout, its $4.99 again s_bomb Same for me, no discount being applied Mathew Michel I'm guessing we aren't eligible since we use the discounts regularly: "This offer is open to specific Google Play users based on purchase history." s_bomb I had to click the banner advertising the deal and "accept" the deal, after that it is being applied. Gilberto Just as @s_bomb:disqus said, I had to click the banner first, and the price is $1.49 -_- me me I see the $0.99, I pick a film, I see rent/buy SD/HD, click on SD rent and it shows $4.99, right upto the point of debitting my credit card. That appears to me to be actually $4.99, not $0.99 ? Ryne Hager Yup, you have to actually redeem their coupon code via an advertisement you'll see on the main page for Google Play Movies, as noted in the article. me me Well that appears not true / applicable. I see $0.99, and then I click on it and it gets right up to the point of about to debit card and its $4.99. So its clickbait to fool me into paying $4.99. Nope. Ryne Hager Unfortunately, if you don't redeem the code via the advertisement on the Play landing page, you won't get the discount. me me Ahh. So YOUR LINK is bad. What i did: Ignore your link. Go to play.google.com Movies then the $0.99 is shown, click on that, then the film, then at checkout its $0.99 shown. Thanks for bringing to our attention, figured out valid method eventually. iboalali It's a shame that I will never rent or buy any movie or TV show from the play store, because I can't get anything in English (I live in Germany). Except if I want to watch something in German. I rather buy/rent from the Microsoft store, they offer everything in German and English for me.

Keith Taylor Since I have 5 different accounts I just used on of my secondary ones. blazingwolf I'm getting an offer for 2 episodes of a TV show for $.99.

ROB Same here... can't imagine a show I would want to pay to see lomsha Shows on 1 account but not the other lol. dullknives same. primary accnt - nothing. secondary accnt - offer is there. pfmiller It says an offer to welcome you back, so it's probably for accounts that haven't used Google Movies recently. roebling "La La Land", the big winner of the last Academy Awards, is on the $0.99 list OtisFeelgood Offer showed up as $1.49 for me. Marty Damn! I was really hyped about this. Sadly the only movies I would have been interested in suck. Logan, The Great Wall and Split all suck. 30014 Logan and Split were awesome, not interested in The Great Wall. Justin Osborne Ah, I reported this about a month ago, it's been going on for some time now. 😛 Marty Tried to rent Passengers and was charged $5.99. Got a refund. iKon Guys, just download Shoebox. Any movie for free. Y'all don't need these offers AC I don't really care about not being eligible for the discount, but it's REALLY tacky of Google to splash the offer screen up for everyone and then sweep the rug under unsuspecting users that didn't receive the promo.

PhoneDog Android And Me TodaysiPhone NEW Call T-Mobile at (855) 668-8976 TmoNews Unofficial T-Mobile Blog, News, Videos, Articles and more Navigation Home Submit News 700MHz LTE map Upcoming Phones HOT TOPICS: Samsung Galaxy Note 7 LG V20 Google Pixel Extended Range LTE Android 7.0 Nougat You are here: Home > T-Mobile offers to pay for Verizon switchers’ phones, two-lines-for-one deal also coming T-Mobile offers to pay for Verizon switchers’ phones, two-lines-for-one deal also coming May 24, 2017 Alex Wagner 103 Comments Yesterday T-Mobile CEO John Legere teased that T-Mo had multiple announcements coming up, and today a couple of them have been made. Starting May 31st, T-Mobile will kick off its #GetOutoftheRed promotion to help Verizon customers switch to T-Mo. Verizon customers in good standing with their carrier can get their iPhone or Google Pixel paid off by T-Mobile when they switch to T-Mobile and sign up for T-Mobile One, and they can keep their existing device. The phones that qualify for this promotion include the iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, Google Pixel, and Google Pixel XL. T-Mobile says that these devices were selected because “phones need certain software to be globally compatible, and some phones don’t yet have that software.” Magenta does say that it’s working with unspecified device makers to make more phones compatible with this promotion. Additionally, Verizon customers switching to T-Mobile must add T-Mo’s Premium Device Protection Plus insurance plan to their device to qualify. This insurance plan costs $15 per month and includes protection against loss, theft, and accidental damage, McAfee ID Protection, McAfee Content Protection, and other features. T-Mobile says that it’ll pay Verizon customers that take advantage of this promotion with a digital prepaid MasterCard card that typically arrives within 15 days. While this #GetOutoftheRed promotion is focused on Verizon customers (because VZW phones are unlocked), T-Mobile is doing something for AT&T and Sprint subscribers, too. Starting on May 31st, AT&T and Sprint customers can switch to T-Mobile and get their existing device paid off when they buy a new phone from T-Mobile on EIP. And unlike Carrier Freedom, those customers won’t be forced to trade in their existing device. Finally, T-Mobile says that starting tomorrow, May 25th, T-Mobile One customers with at least two voice lines can get two additional lines of service for the price of one. The cost of the second line will be offset by a bill credit.

(J²) Right… I’d found that the system doesn’t consistently apply these. TylerCameron Yeah their billng process it’s horrible Steve_NYC So true. I actually considered moving to the T-Mobile One Plan even though it would have cost me more money, just to get away from the insanity of their bill credit process. I finally got things straightened out, but I am sure it will be a problem in the future. It’s gotten to the point that I think it’s deliberate. Mike I had a free line from November that I had to call in every month. to get credit. They finally fixed it to be automatic this month. best part I got extra bill credits for months since last November and my bill is now negative so I didn’t have to make a payment this month. Al William So in order to get the free line, you need to have at least a total of 4 voice lines? Corey Jalette You need to have 2 voice lines to get this promo, which you get 2 lines for the price of 1. So in total you end up woth 4 lines, 1st 2 have to be voice, the 2 you’re adding could be whatever you want. So if you’re on the 2/100 plan right now if you add 2 tablets it would be 120 a month (20 per tablet but 1 is free) or if you add 2 voice lines it would be 140 (40 for adding a 3rd line then 4th is free) Al William Thanks for the clarification! So minimum 2 voice lines and the other 2 could be voice or data. I just wish they get rid of these bill credits. Sometimes it’s such a nightmare. Corey Jalette It can be yes but that’s how pretty much everything is done. Just like they had a free line deal in march it’s listed on my account as a free line on us but I still get the charge on my bill, but it’s auto credited. The only time it wasn’t was the first month because I added it before the end of the billing cycle. Cost $49 but they also credited my account manually that one time. Haven’t had an issue since. AWasserberg7 This article mentions Magenta. What *is* Magenta? Is that some cute term of affection for T-Mobile? kev2684 Are you serious? It’s their brand color. VZW = Red AT&T = Blue T-Mobile = Magenta Sprint = Yellow Nobody Special Cricket (umm, green) lol Genecio MetroPCS= Purple Black&Orange= Boost The Waz Just confirmed by T-Force that if you have a 2 for 100 plus a “this ones on us promo” giving you total 3 lines, you will lose your free line if you take advantage of the promotion of 2 for 1 tomorrow. They stated that they have to move you to a different Tmobile One plan….makes no sense since there is only 1 plan…… Corey Jalette This is ONLY if you’re adding a voice line people. If you’re adding tablet/smartwatch/mobile Internet plans that doesn’t affect your phone plan promo of 2/100. Corey Jalette Add 2 tablets with unlimited data on your plan for $20/month. They frequently have a free tablet promo with qualifying data plan. Snatch those up and you’re golden. The Waz Yes this will affect both. IF you have the 2 for 100 and the “this one is on us” free line….you will lose both promotions…confirmed with t force and John directly. Ben Also why can’t the t force reps do this. Seems very simple. chnage to the 4 plan rate, open the C-2 documentation, search this one on us, ask supervisor to open the page, enter the code on my account to reflect the 4th line as being free. And then add the 1 for 2 lines, or 50 percent off a one more line. This way I keep hookup and this one on us promo. and also eligible for future lines down the road. Yea this is very strange Ben Also why can’t the t force reps do this. Seems very simple. chnage to the 4 plan rate, open the C-2 documentation, search this one on us, ask supervisor to open the page, enter the code on my account to reflect the 4th line as being free. And then add the 1 for 2 lines, or 50 percent off a one more line. This way I keep hookup and this one on us promo. and also eligible for future lines down the road. So yea im wondering is anyone can find a loophole or something Andrew Singleton the reason is that you’re on a 2-line promotional plan paying $20 less than everyone else, and you’ve added a line. since you’re unable to add another line on that plan, you are forced to switch to a 3+ line plan, and that will cause activation-related discounts to drop. Corey below is correct, because internet lines (tablet, watch, syncup drive) are their own rate plan and don’t affect your voice configuration. Ben Also why can’t the t force reps do this. Seems very simple. chnage to the 4 plan rate, open the C-2 documentation, search this one on us, ask supervisor to open the page, enter the code on my account to reflect the 4th line as being free. And then add the 1 for 2 lines, or 50 percent off a one more line. This way I keep hookup and this one on us promo. and also eligible for future lines down the road. J Gerard Yeah! Let’s switch to T-MOBILE because we want to not be able to make phone calls half the time, and not have a signal to look something up when we actually need it. Oh yeah, and to not be able to upload pictures of something fun that we’re doing until we’re at home connected to WiFi later that night or the next day. Before any of you “magenta” fans TRIES to defend them… I’ve been a Verizon customer for about 12 years except for 6 months last year, when I switched because of crappy TMobile’s cheap prices and convincing (misleading) advertising. It was HORRIBLE. I used to get pissed and call them to ask why I could never get a signal. After 6 months, I finally admitted to myself that it was a ridiculous mistake and switched back to The Red! NEVER any issues with Verizon’s service. Never. “Magenta” is only good at talking a big game. If anyone’s thinking about switching to T-Mobile, DON’T DO IT. They are the worst. Go to any other carrier. Doesn’t have to be Verizon. kev2684 It’s all about location, location, location. Just because your area is bad, doesn’t mean everybody will have the same problem as you. J Gerard … EXCEPT that I live in a city. Oh, and Verizon’s coverage is flawless here. I happen to also know (through friends) that AT&T and Sprint are good here, too. Oh, but it’s all about location, location, location. Weak argument. T-Mobile just sucks! There’s a reason it’s so CHEAP! Austin8480 … OK JGerard. Next time, PLEASE use all capital letters to truly get YOUR point across. What I find PATHETIC is that you are a die hard Verizon turd in a TMobile blog. Oh wait, I meant Verizon TURD. Forgot to emphasize that. NOBODY in this room gives a flying —- about your opinion because you slummed it for 6 months and went to Magenta and it was as big of a mistake as…well, I will let you figure it out. J Gerard You were so busy typing a 3rd grade level post that you forgot to make a point. Here’s one for you: T-Mobile is inferior to almost all other carriers. Austin8480 If T-Mobile is so inferior, why are you even giving this blog the time of day. Are you upset that no kids want to hop in your van and eat your chocolate, so you are going to take out your frustrations on the inferior wireless network? thepanttherlady *Tip* Starbursts don’t melt :D theseanteam The hate is strong in this one. Those six months must have really scarred you or something. When you say almost all other carriers, which ones are you referring to? There are only four major carriers after all. And actually, that argument about location is a pretty strong one. T-Mobile’s network is the fastest in many locations, but can be really poor (or even non-existent) in others. The same can be said about everyone–including Verizon. Every carrier has their strong and weak areas. For someone to deny such would have to either be 1) ignorant 2) biased beyond belief or 3) troll. yankeesusa Yea, it still amazes me that people complain about coverage and then lump everyone else in america as having the same coverage, like we all live in the same area. Oh well. People never learn. I’m just happy tmobile works for me and that my data speeds are the highest iv’e ever had. At my house i’m getting close to 100megs almost every time. But hey i guess that’s not good enough for some. thepanttherlady I moved to Crestline a couple of weeks ago. No service. :'( kev2684 I had to google where that is lol :D Yeah it’s rural Ohio but I suppose Band 12 is coming? I’ve seen sightings on Band 12 in Jacksonville, FL lately as well as other parts of the country it’s currently not available. They’re probably working on it at the moment. thepanttherlady Sorry, I should have been more specific. It’s Crestline, CA. I made the same mistake when I called a county office but only Googled Crestline. Guy was really confused as they don’t have my address there. Took me a minute to figure out he was in Ohio. LOL kev2684 You’re literally live in a mountain! Views must be spectacular! thepanttherlady Some of them really are. :) Zacamandapio Verizon here we gooooooo. By the way, we went to Lake Gregory. :) thepanttherlady I’m literally 7 minutes from there. Went there 2 weekends ago to check it out. Water level is a little on the low side. Met a couple that same night that said they’d drained it for some reason and cited “water politics” because I guess the locals aren’t happy about it. Drove up from the Hesperia side this past Saturday and got to see Lake Silverwood. Will have to check it out this summer. Nice drive but hated seeing so many dead trees. :( ETA: I had to get Frontier (Verizon) internet so I could actually use my cell phone. What really sucks is: 1. I literally just got a hotspot through T-Mobile a month ago when they were offering another free line. It’s unusable. 2. I now HAVE to buy phones that have WiFi calling. Blah! thepanttherlady From the day we moved in 5/7: http://imgur.com/UQHsBZF http://imgur.com/t9Z64Q3 http://imgur.com/tm7ReiU And the lake :) http://imgur.com/1YUxwV9 http://imgur.com/tnGMcoq http://imgur.com/zhY16YK http://imgur.com/eaXr58H http://imgur.com/JO9BHJW Sharti24 Who will you be switching to? thepanttherlady I’m not switching. Yet anyway. I lose service 1/2 way up (or down) the mountain so I’ll probably have to get a very cheap pre-paid service/phone for emergencies in case I break down. Not all turnouts have a call box. I still work in Orange County and T-Mobile works fine most places I go. If it starts to be a problem then I’ll have to consider my options. Sharti24 Have tmobile send you a range extender. Not the one you plug into the internet but the one that has two boxes that boosts signal Berzerker Yeah, if you live in Bumblefuck, Montana, don’t switch. Greg Piller Shoot, I just signed up in Montana for TMO. Guess I’m “bumblefucked” lol. I have traveled to every state and been in EVERY U.S. major city multiple times living in every timezone and 11 states. My goodness you have a warped idea of “crap state”. Montana is paradise partner. You have to be from either NYC or California with that f’ed up mentality. He is right & not just in “crap” places but a lot of places like Chicago, IL where I was born and raised. Verizon & AT&T ARE better, Considerably better now in most places but TMO is gaining on them quickly & may reach parity in a few years. When THAT happens if TMO is still competitive, one would have to be a lunatic to stay with AT&T or Verizon. Berzerker …lol. I never said Montana was a “crap state.” It’s the easiest thing to think of when you think of wilderness where you won’t have service for miles. I could have picked a bunch of states, but Montana has, IIRC, the smallest habitation of humans to state ratio, behind Alaska of course. Easy target. Greg Piller To me 4 lines for $120 with TMO is enough of a savings to ditch AT&T. Verizon & AT&T and some of their customers can be arrogant & I think John Legere is one helluva CEO. I can pick up a burner sim with AT&T’s Cricket when I travel a bit and use it until TMO improves in Montana & then it’s sianara to ATT. Happy to be back with TMO. I was formerly a customer since the Voicestream days but when I moved west couldn’t keep them. Their coverage improvement in Montana & the nation as a whole with him at the helm has been nothing short of INCREDIBLE. I hope if the Sprint deal happens Legere is retained as CEO. mreveryphone Hummm… I travel the country for my job and I rarely have issues with T-Mobile… Is it perfect?? No… But no carrier is.. Verizon worked out for you, that’s great. T-Mobile works for millions, that’s also great. But this butt hurt rant is ridiculous and pure comedy! J Gerard “butt hurt rant” is kind of a dumb way to describe what I’m saying. But, I’ll consider the source, eh? Do you know ANYONE who thinks that T is better than V? Nope. So, the difference between us is that I choose to have a better service and I’m willing to pay a little more for it. You are cheap, and you’re willing to have an inferior service because it’s cheaper. That’s it. You know Verizon is better than T-Mobile Francisco Peña Anyone switching carriers should NEVER just switch without taking advantage of the initial return period. I was with VZW for yrs myself. Loved it, with my UDP that was grandfathered. Even went through one wave of price hikes to stay. Then the wife wanted a non-feature phone, and the price hike for her would have boosted out then $108 monthly payment, to $160 once we got a basic data plan, her line access fee (joke) and a new phone. So I looked into TMo. I purposely bought a phone the yr before that worked with Tmo and VZW (moto X DE) and signed up for one line of TMo, switched my Moto to Tmo and reactivated an older LTE phone I had back on VZW. Then I went around for a week doing speed tests everywhere I went. Stuck in traffic? speed test. Both side by side on the seat. Mall? yup, side by side in my hands. Work? yup. Home? yup. I hated VZW at work because my Moto could never get a signal inside the building, which caused my battery to die quickly each day. TMo? got a strong signal. Home, both were weak, but about the same. Driveway? same. So after 10 days, I went in to TMo and switched. Got 2 new phones (had a deal on G4s then) and was spending $140 for 2 lines/10GB each (was the $100/2L/10GB deal) with those phones. Has it been perfect? no. Has it been enough to switch back? no. After some finagling, got a $70 plan with 6GB each for 2 lines. Then have gotten a free line on top of that.. so now I pay $130 for 3 lines, with 6GB each (two don’t come close, mine has Stash so I’m good) and 2 new G6 phones. So for the price, its awesome. Can I deal with some poor service on the outskirts of town? sure. Oh, that Moto X? got it on the 3rd line… theseanteam I don’t think anyone has ever claimed that T-Mobile has better coverage than Verizon, but the point is it has the same quality of coverage in many places. Where I live, T-Mobile has equal coverage and faster speeds. It might not be like that for you, as everyone’s experience will vary. I’m sure if others suffered with bad service, they would switch carriers as well. But your superiority complex is just silly. mreveryphone I know plenty of people that think T-Mobile is better than VW… And I know people that think the opposite, it depends where you live. The service was inferior for you but not for me by any means… I appreciate the cheap name calling, I’ll be cheap all day if it means saving money but getting better service FOR ME… I’ve had service in buildings where others on VW had 0, I’ve smoked people on VW in data speeds tests so I’ll be cheap all day long!! Lol Vazaha There’s an unwritten agreement when you join T-Mobile that you will refrain from living in or going to crappy places. If you live in a decent place T-Mobile is fine. If T-Mobile sucks in your area, you know why :). Vazaha But seriously, I’m always envious of ATT and V when I go to crap places. tranceformer978 Why are you going to crap places? Melissa Cardenas Well what the hell are you doing on this website then? This is a T-Mobile forum obviously most people on here have T-Mobile and they Happy with it so they ain’t gonna listen to you . T-Mobile did not work in my old house so i had Verizon. Now in my new house Verizon don’t work at all and i had to get T-Mobile again because T-Mobile works here fine , So no carrier is perfect. It all depends on location!! J Gerard I get tech news alerts on my phone and things like this come up sometimes and I click on them. I believe that’s allowed! Apparently, what’s not allowed here is proper grammar and punctuation. I almost had to have your post translated in order to read it, but I figured it out eventually. Where did you go to school? Melissa Cardenas What ever im in a hurry and didn’t have time to spell check .But seriously don’t change the subject i don’t get why people like you come talk trash on a T-Mobile forum. ?? Makes no sense haha . And what ever im PRETTY sure you understood fine what i wrote in my first comment. Bull that you almost had to get it translated. Omar Boyer Melisa hes just being an idiot haha i understood perfectly well your first post. And i see they gave u some thumbs up on that first post so others also understood you no need to translate it . Ignore this lowlife with nothing to do. If he wants to stop making an Azz out of himself he should just block the notifications he gets from here. Melissa Cardenas i have better things to worry about ;) omar. And like you said he should just turn off notifications from here then. Eric Harlow Don’t give J Gerard the satisfaction in getting a reaction out of you and allow him to control the situation don’t dumb down to his level Eric Harlow Get off Melissa Cardenas butt about grammar here. This is a forum! Not a college message board or an college English Composition course. T-mobile has improved drastically within the last 3 years. T-mobile works for me out here in San Diego and in my future home in Missoula, Montana. I have mental disabilities that I got serving in The US Navy for twenty years and I dislike your comments towards Melissa Cardenas. This is a T-mobile fan website to discuss peacefully about T-mobile, so get your BIG RED DUMB AND DUMBER ASS OUT OF HERE. Andrew Addison You just made my night with that bomb diggity comment towards that boozo the snow clown filled with stuffy nose, trying to come off as English weirdo professor correcting people on their grammar fool there Bro. Is this guy here serious right now? He had no reason to talk down to someone like that and also talk down on the finest company/carrier, advising everyone to stay away from the best carrier/company which that one being T-Mobile-MetroPCS. We will forever be way Better in USA than any other carrier would have been. Eric Harlow OOH REALLY!!! HOW AWESOME!! Glad I made your night! RLB63 I actually feel sorry for you. How miserable your life must be for you to spend so much time on a site of a company you seem to hate so much. Cellphone companies aren’t making political statements. Seem way to smart for that. Don’t attack social issues. Attacking T-Mobile worth while to you and to spend so much time. You must not have anything better to do with your life. Eric Harlow I think you were supposed to reply back to J Gerard not me. I have been a T-mobile customer for over ten years and I am happy to be a T-mobile customer. Haze1nut English is a 3rd language for me, behind French and Portuguese. Correct my grammar for me, will you. It obviously makes you feel superior. Ascertion You think everyone that switches to T-Mobile can’t “Make calls half of the time”? You’re out of your mind! Tony Chen agreed, t mobile has gained millions of customers each quarter. if the drop calls were so bad why would t mobile gain 100% of new customers agaIN? another blockbuster quarter by t mobile. moonoverparma Funny, I’ve never had a problem. Nobody Special Several years ago i had a verizon phone (when the iphone’s came out they were the only one that were selling them with unlimited data at that time) and i had T-Mobile flip phone that i was using to make international calls. I have to admit, Verizon was more reliable than T-Mobile during my cell phone usage. I chose T-mobile over Verizon because of many reasons…. but it was never due to their coverage, because their coverage was horrible… but since then their coverage has improved. But i switched primarily due to the inexpensive international calls. That was a deal breaker for me, i was content with the terrible coverage with anticipation that they would improve their service. and with Verizon i was paying around $89 dollars for unlimited data and text and 450 minutes of voice calls. my tmobile line (from what i can remember) was around $78 dollars for unlimited talk and text and data. But fastforward to today, I have 5 Unlimited Everything (data/text/voice) lines with unlimited international calling (mobile+landlines) and international text for a low cost of $110 plus taxes and fees. Believe me i checked, Verizon or AT&T have nothing in comparison to what i have with T-Mobile. And i am not bashing you or Verizon at all, Verizon does have a more reliable coverage area but in the end i sided with T-Mobile over Verizon. If Verizon ever came up with incredible deals like T-Mobile has been doing almost every month i wouldnt turn down a great opportunity. RECAP: Verizon “Better Coverage” T-Mobile “Better Prices” It all boils down to what are you comfortable with. Im comfortable with crappy coverage. And My T-Mobile calls do drop often, but what i do is (i press redial) GOTCHA :) Gust OK so here’s the deal. In the morning when you wake up if you have T-Mobile you have to get up take a shower have breakfast shave go outside of your house in other to make a phone call. If you have AT&T or Verizon in the morning when you wake up you can reach for your cell phone and make a phone call. It is that simple. But you know what I have T-Mobile because over one year it saves me about $200 as compared to AT&T or Verizon. So I put up with the crap! Timothy Poplaski T-Mobile supports WiFi calling. You don’t have home WiFi? DM725 How do you not have wifi calling enabled? Maybe you need to buy a phone from the last 2 years… (My Motorola Nexus 6 Supported Wifi Calling….) RLB63 They have equipment they they will ship out for free with a deposit that will boost their signal on your house if you don’t have Wi-Fi calling. My phone automatically switches on Wi-Fi when I get home. Not for signal or to save data. It’s because with all the talk that cell signals MIGHT cause cancer why risk it? It is able to enable Wi-Fi, and it disables it when I leave the house. So that might be an option if you have Wi-Fi…. Phone Guy All lies. So funny, yet sad. yankeesusa LOL, not everyone lives where you live and have bad coverage with tmobile. 4 years ago i would have never used tmobile, now i no longer have sprint and got rid of my verizon line because tmobile is great for me where i live and work. I just recently drove across florida,georgia,nc and tennesse and had no issues. I was able to test it side by side with an att phone and the whole time both phones had coverage except up in the smokies near newfound gap where no one has signal. Don’t lump everyone in the same pile just because it doesn’t work for you. DM725 LoL, where the hell do you live? eanfoso The only one after verizon is at&t because we know that sprint and us cellular sucks more than t mobile Andrew Singleton T-Mobile has the lowest churn rate (people trying it and leaving) of all carriers. Could you please explain why? J Gerard Ha! Oh, I promise you I don’t feel like an idiot surrounded by people who work themselves up into a breathless rant trying to defend a crappy service. gmo8492 Crappy for who exactly, churn has gone down to record lows and T-Mobile has over 73 million subs, so if it doesn’t work out you can switch. Brad C It’s not for everyone, but has worked damn well for me for 12yrs.. I *actually* tried Verizon a few months ago, and came back after two weeks after awful LTE performance JG You’re cracking me up reading your comments! I have TMo and put up with their spotty coverage because I’m paying less per month staying with them. I can admit that. There is alot I enjoy about TMo, but dropped calls and dead zones IS a reality. I have a band 12 phone in metro PHX. Not sure why others feel the need to berail someone who doesn’t agree with them just for argument’s sake. Timothy Poplaski Because you aren’t saying, “Bad coverage in PHX”, you’re saying “Bad coverage”. I can drive for at least an hour in any direction and have solid coverage. It all depends on where you live, and you’re phone. Even phones with band 12 won’t all have the same results because some phones get better reception than others. So, I won’t even argue about coverage in PHX. Never been there, likely never will, so it just doesn’t matter to me. My excellent coverage probably doesn’t matter to you. It’s all about where you use your phone. navi harriram Dude you could of tested the network out on a $10 weekly plan or $3 daily. You don’t buy cell phone service every day so do the work. The sales rep just wants a commission check so they’ll say anything to get you to switch. That’s why I don’t work for wireless companies anymore. Too much bull to deal with yankeesusa Not everyone is defending a company that may or may not work depending on where you live. But many people actually do research and pick a company that specifically works for your needs depending on your area. I had verizon and sprint before tmobile and i have never ever gotten the speeds i get now not to mention i have great coverage ‘WHERE I LIVE”, YOU SEE, that’s the important thing, i researched and made sure it worked for me. I don’t just blindly select a company just because their commercial says so. Screamin That’s strange because T-Mobile has been #1 in customer service AND satisfaction for well over 2 years now… and yes, that includes coverage. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) I am thinking about switching to Verizon due to poor coverage. In San Diego area I get one to bars. I moved from Minnesota and T-mobile coverage in MN is excellent there with all bars. In San Diego it’s very poor in some areas. When iPhone 8 is release I am switching to Verizon. I love T-mobile plans but coverage in my area is poor. Sharti24 Agreed. On base (32nd street) forget about tmobile coverage. sprint excels on 32nd. go over to corando island its even worse! just throw your phone over board. no tmobile coverage on the air base at all. im using an iphone 6s Band 12 which is deployed in SD yankeesusa I agree, if in your area tmobile is not good and is affecting productivity or just not letting you use your phone to its fullest your’e better off changing. I have great coverage where I live and work and when i travel over 99% of the time i have no issues. But i got my wife on cricket which is att so for the times where tmobile may not get signal i have the att towers just in case. I’m on an old grandfathered single line plan that allows work discount so i’m keeping as long as i can. Screamin Sometimes it’s not always the cell coverage causing the issue, but the phone itself, especially if it’s an older device that supports fewer cell bands. With T-Mobile’s latest acquirement of spectrum you can expect a huge improvement in cell signal, both in range and structure penetration, within the year. Of course you can switch if you want, but they’re only going to get better. They’ve more than doubled the coverage in the past 2 years and have just as much coverage as Verizon with a network that’s actually futureproof unlike the other guys. DM725 Agreed, I know people that don’t realize they are using a phone without band 12, that doesn’t have wifi calling or Volte support, and has an extremely weak antenna. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) My phone is iPhone 7 and not an old device: Andrew Singleton if you hold an iphone 7 next to a galaxy s8, the s8 will have more bars every time. that’s due to a more powerful signal on galaxies and the fact that bars don’t mean anything with low-frequency spectrum. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) My roommate is on T-mobile and his current phone is galaxy s8. We experience the same issue. RLB63 Have you talked to T-Mobile C.S.? If they get people complaining about certain areas they tend to look into those areas. Is it outside or inside or both where you have problems? Inside out could be the building. They can seems you a device to boost the signal for your phone. Patel Nisha You couldn’t pay me to use a iPhone . And why would I switch Verizon to T-unmobile. So I can have a sub par data connection with hardly any coverage…. Andrew Why are you on TmoNews, then? Andrew Addison Lol I was just thinking the exact same thing. Lol DM725 I’m sorry you live in a place that T-Mobile doesn’t prioritize. Here in NY, we have no such issues. Andrew Singleton the offer is also good for pixels, and you don’t know anything about the network. in 1 year, verizon will wish it had t-mobile’s network. browne81 I cavy take this anymore. There is always someone in these forums going miss information. I have to speak up. As awhole some networks are better than others. I’m not going to get into my opinion on which is better nation wide. What I will say is this. The best carrier is the one that works where you frequent the most. No matter what carrier a person loves there is another person out there that thinks it terrible. So all these people saying bad things about T-Mobile should get the facts straight. Lastly I due example I don’t like sprint but I know there are people that have a great time with them. You don’t see me on a sprint site saying how bad they are. Is my spelling perfect no. Is my grammar perfect no. It’s this a college paper? No. So I really don’t care. AJ2 still waiting for them to do a $50 deal for single customers. browne81 They have a prepaid plan for 45 Select a phone: (optional) + - Any - 3G|4G U301 USB Modem Acer Aspire One Netbook Acer Liquid

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones 'Judy' malware infects several Google Play store apps; over 36.5 million Android phones affected Taking cognizance of the threat, Google has removed all the 'Judy' malware-infested apps from Play store. Rohit KVN   May 29, 2017 09:58 IST [Representational Image] ‘Judy’ malware found in 41 apps on Google Play store. In Picture: Android One phones put on displayReutes / Elijah Nouvelage Despite the several measures taken by Google to combat malicious apps on its Play store, a new malware dubbed as 'Judy' has been detected in over 40 applications, leaving close to 36.5 million Android devices vulnerable to illegal access. Internet security company Check Point Technology, which detected the malware first, has already informed Google and the search engine wasted no time and pulled off all the 41 malevolent apps from the store. Also read: WannaCry kill switch under nonstop botnet attack by hackers attempting to reignite ransomware "The malware uses infected devices to generate large amounts of fraudulent clicks on advertisements, generating revenues for the perpetrators behind it," Check Point Mobile research team said in a statement. Who is behind 'Judy' malware and what does it do? The 'Judy' malware was reportedly created by Korean company Kiniwini, which is officially registered as the ENISTUDIO corp on Google Play store. It makes apps for Android and Apple's iOS platforms. On the Play store, ENISTUDIO corp sells several types of games and value-added apps, and is found to have been installed in around 37 million devices. The company, in a bid to generate revenue, has incorporated the bug 'Judy', which works at the backend of the app, without any permission from the users. "The malware opens the URLs using the user agent that imitates a PC browser in a hidden webpage and receives a redirection to another website. Once the targeted website is launched, the malware uses the JavaScript code to locate and click on banners from the Google ads infrastructure," Check Point Technologies said. "Upon clicking the ads, the malware author receives payment from the website developer, which pays for the illegitimate clicks and traffic," it added. 'Judy' also displays big banner advertisements on the smart device's screen and forces the user to click on the ad. Most of the infected apps have received positive reviews on Google Play store, but some tech savvy users did find the constant ads popping up on the screen to be suspiciously odd and complained about the issue on the review comment section. Google has now removed the bug-infested apps from the Play store. It has also started an internal investigation to bring more stringent measures to control malwares and check if there are apps with similar malwares on Play store.

Google for Jobs going live for some people Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/27 4:31pm PDTMay 27, 2017 17 Plus 1 on G+ 67 Share on Facebook 72 Share on Twitter Total Shares156 Google News Back at Google I/O, a new initiative was announced called 'Google for Jobs.' As you might be able to guess from the name, it is designed to make finding job openings easier and more effective - for both applicants and employers. The feature appears to be going live on Google Search, at least for some users. Currently, searching something like "barista jobs" just returns a list of results from job listing sites. With Google for Jobs, you get a much cleaner interface with more details, plus modifiers like 'Full-time' and 'Starbucks.'    Left: Current layout; Center, Right: New layout This doesn't seem to be live yet for everyone, including myself, but let us know in the comments if you see it.

Mattwmaster58 I guess they are rolling this out :P Vratislav Jindra How about doing something about that ugly grey status bar, Google? I get it at the search results page which is also grey (a bit lighter), but not when there is a blue action bar right underneath it. Also the shadow under the status bar from KitKat era in the main screen of Google App seems weird. Sometimes I wonder what they pay their designers for, when they can't get this basic sh*t straight.

However, every once in awhile, Google will throw new subscribers a bone and will offer some free content for signing up. The latest offer being thrown in is 4 months of GPM for free, when signing up for a brand-new subscription. This means that if you’ve already activated the premium subscription on your current GPM account, then you won’t be eligible. After your four month trial period has expired, you’ll be charged $9.99 per month until you decide to cancel. You can, however, cancel the subscription beforehand and you won’t be charged once the free trial has been completed. As a reminder, with your subscription to Google Play Music, you’ll also receive YouTube Red which offers ad-free videos, the ability to watch videos offline, as well as access to YouTube’s original shows lineup. For $10 per month, it’s a pretty great deal, and it’s made even better considering the fact that you can try it out for four months.

One key battlefield: The online encyclopedia By Simona Weinglass May 29, 2017, 6:20 am Tweet Email Print Share Writers Simona Weinglass Simona Weinglass is an investigative reporter at The Times of Israel. Follow or contact: RSS Newsroom Email the Newsroom Facebook Twitter Related Topics binary options binary options fraud Banc de Binary If you’re the strategist behind a multibillion dollar scam that rips off hundreds of thousands of people worldwide, one of the key challenges you face is managing your online reputation. How do you prevent defrauded clients from warning others about their appalling experiences? This is the quandary faced by fraudsters in the binary options industry, which operates on the assumption that at some point potential clients will do a search for “Is binary options a good investment?” or “Is XYZ Binary Options Brand a reputable company?” To prevent the truth from getting out, the fraudulent firms need to comprehensively control what potential investor-victims see online. The Times of Israel, in a series of articles, has exposed the largely fraudulent Israel-based industry that has been stealing billions of dollars from hundreds of thousands of victims worldwide for the past decade. Duplicitous binary options companies ostensibly offer customers a potentially profitable short-term investment, but in reality — through rigged trading platforms, refusal to pay out and other ruses — these companies fleece the vast majority of customers of most or all of their money. (The industry has been denounced by Israel’s securities regulator and by the Prime Minister’s Office, and a government-drafted, opposition-backed bill to ban it was sent in February to the Knesset, where it currently languishes.) A screenshot of the February 2017 Signpost article detailing Wikipedia editors’ battle with Banc de Binary. For a normal business or industry it would be difficult to keep secret a track record of vast global theft. But the binary options industry is unrelenting in its ambition to control the flow of information about itself. Several months ago, an article appeared on Signpost, the internal publication of Wikipedia editors, showing the extreme lengths the boosters of just one binary options firm went to in order to bury information about the company’s troubles with regulators. Entitled “Wolves nip at Wikipedia’s heels: A perspective on the cost of paid editing,” the article describes the exhausting battle waged by volunteer Wikipedia editors against apparent flacks for Banc De Binary, an Israeli binary options firm which, until it closed its doors several months ago, was considered a flagship of this industry. An encyclopedia that assumes goodwill In its aims and founding philosophy, Wikipedia is the antithesis of the fraudulent binary options industry mindset. Founded in 2001 by Jimmy Wales, the online encyclopedia grew out of the American open-source software movement, which rests on the assumption that people will collaborate on a project without being paid to do so, out of an altruistic desire to produce something of value that benefits all. Anyone can edit Wikipedia, and much of its success relies on strangers around the world upholding the community’s trust. Due in large part to this optimistic view of human nature holding true, Wikipedia has been a success to the point where it is now the fifth-most visited website in the world. But this success has attracted many actors who seek not to enhance human understanding but to promote themselves, sometimes for illegitimate ends. Wikipedia logo For instance, in a much-publicized 2013 incident, accounts allegedly belonging to employees of a company called Wiki-PR, which wrote Wikipedia articles and edited pages on behalf of large corporate clients, were blocked and removed from the site. “It looks like a number of user accounts — perhaps as many as several hundred — may have been paid to write articles on Wikipedia promoting organizations or products, and have been violating numerous site policies and guidelines, including prohibitions against sockpuppetry and undisclosed conflicts of interest,” Wikimedia Foundation director Sue Gardner said in a statement on October 21, 2013. But as the recent Signpost article makes clear, the problem of paid editing has not gone away. And some of the worst violators are retail forex and binary options companies, Smallbones, the author of the Signpost article and an editor at Wikipedia for the past 11 years, told The Times of Israel in a telephone interview. (The Times of Israel knows the identity of Smallbones, a retired professor of finance living in the United States, but he requested that his real name not be used here in an effort to minimize the harassment, both online and off, that he has experienced as a result of writing about the issue of paid editing.) “We very commonly get people trying to insert advertisements into articles,” the Wikipedia editor said. “But this Banc De Binary article is by far the worst case I have ever seen.” A screenshot from a 2013 promotional video for Banc de Binary, since removed from the internet (Youtube) Banc de Binary’s website first appeared online in about 2010. In the same year, a man by the name of Oren Shabat registered the Israeli firm E.T. Binary Options Ltd., an Israeli company that operated a call center and managed Banc de Binary. The company, which later changed its name to E.T.B.O. Services, is owned by Oren, his father Hezi and his brother Lior Shabat, according to Israel’s corporate registry. A smaller portion of the company’s shares are held in trust for Yossi Almaliach, Ronen Tubul, Ohad Tzori and Yoram Menachem. Banc De Binary’s Wikipedia article was posted in 2012. At the time, the company billed itself as a group of “private options bankers” and claimed to be located at 40 Wall Street in New York City. (The company reportedly had a “virtual office” there. This address, known as the Trump Building, has been used by other binary options-associated firms like the SEC-sanctioned EZTrader and the e-wallet service Neteller). By 2013, the article had been deleted twice by Wikipedia administrators “for being purely promotional and thus violating Wikipedia’s policy against advertisements,” Smallbones said, but the article kept reappearing and would become a focus of frenzied editing. Wikipedia editors also conducted an investigation that led to the banning of the article’s original creators as “sockpuppets,” an internet term for users who assume multiple identities for purposes of deception. Initially, Banc De Binary claimed to have an office at 40 Wall Street (Youtube screenshot) In addition, a biography of Banc de Binary’s founder Oren Shabat (who has adopted the name of Oren Laurent) was deleted by other editors three times in 2013 due to perceived promotional content or because the article’s subject was considered “not notable.” Smallbones explained that it is common practice for editors to propose deleting Wikipedia articles that seem to have been created for purposes of self-promotion or advertising and that lack objective information from a reliable news source. “The terms of use for Wikipedia and for almost all the websites run by Wikipedia’s parent, the nonprofit Wikimedia Foundation, contain a simple provision regarding paid editing,” he said. “All paid editors must declare that they are paid and who is paying them, thus allowing volunteers to monitor and change any paid edits. Undeclared paid editors are not allowed to contribute to any of these sites. Advertising, marketing, and public relations text is prohibited by Wikipedia policy.” In addition, editors with a conflict of interest (for instance, individuals editing their own Wikipedia pages) are strongly discouraged from working on those articles where they cannot be objective. However, they are permitted to make suggestions on the talk page. The Banc de Binary Tower in Ramat Gan in 2014 (CC BY-SA BDBJack, Wikipedia) According to Smallbones, the flurry of activity surrounding the Banc De Binary article began when the US government filed civil charges against the company in June 2013, accusing it of illegally offering US investors binary options without being registered. John Berry, a senior lawyer for the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, said in a May 2016 interview with BBC radio that not only had Banc De Binary sold ostensible financial products to investors without being licensed to do so, but it had deceived those investors as well: “We presented evidence to the court that Banc De Binary was telling US-based investors that Banc De Binary was actually based on Wall Street, and we had evidence of online chat discussions where a Banc De Binary broker would tell a US investor, ‘Hey, I live, you know, right down the street from Wall Street, I’ve got a Wall Street address, I work there,’ and so they had repeatedly lied to US-based customers about being in the United States and being based in the United States with a US address on Wall Street and a New York-based phone number.” In March 2016, the company was ordered by a US court to pay over $11 million in restitution and penalties for illegally soliciting US customers. Regulators in Australia, New Zealand and Canada have issued warnings against Banc De Binary for illegal activity. Another brand that appears to be associated with Banc De Binary, Option.fm, has been blacklisted by financial regulators in Ontario, Hong Kong, Australia and New Zealand. Banc De Binary was also fined €350,000 ($370,500) by CySEC (the Cyprus Securities and Exchange Commission) in January 2016. Two days after the US claim against Banc De Binary in 2013, the information about it went up on Banc De Binary’s Wikipedia page. Over the next 11 months, over 500 edits would be made to the article, an unusually high number. According to the Signpost article, over 20 separate sockpuppets were banned from Wikipedia after editing this article. Smallbones said that the “edit wars” surrounding the Banc De Binary article mainly involved certain editors removing information about the CFTC claim or moving it to the bottom of the article, while other editors would move the information back to the top. The first two sentences of any Wikipedia article are of paramount importance because they appear prominently in what is known as a “knowledge box” on the right-hand side of a Google search results page. A screenshot of the Banc De Binary Wikipedia page as it appeared on May 23, 2017 As of this writing, the box reads “Banc De Binary was an Israeli financial firm with a history of regulatory issues on three continents. On January 9, 2017, the company announced that it would be closing because of negative press coverage and its tarnished reputation.” But Smallbones says a long and exhausting battle was waged over several years to get the page to its present state. “If you’re getting sued by the SEC and CFTC you can’t leave that out, and that’s the only thing the suspected sockpuppets wanted to do once those lawsuits came in. The main thing they were trying to do was take the information out or put it down at the bottom of the article where no one would read it. Our editors on Wikipedia said ‘no, this is very important.’ Smallbones recalled an argument with a suspected sockpuppet who made the claim that the information should be removed because the CFTC is not a reliable source whereas Finance Magnates — a trade publication for the binary options and forex industries — is. “An IP editor (traceable to Israel), claiming to be BDB CEO Oren Shabat Laurent, made five identical edits in the same day, all of which were reverted, to include highlights of Laurent’s biography, and lists of products and countries served. He also reduced the coverage of the regulators’ lawsuits and buried it at the bottom of the article,” Smallbones detailed in the Signpost article. Oren Shabat Laurent (center) and his wife Sivan Laurent sponsor Israel’s 2020 Olympic hopefuls (Courtesy Olympic Committee of Israel) Smallbones recalled that the back-and-forth disputes around the article were exhausting. “There were discussions on the Wikipedia discussion pages with 30 different people writing all at once, all on the same topic. It was totally impossible to figure out what everybody wanted. There were some people who would identify themselves as Banc De Binary and others who didn’t identify themselves but were obviously very biased in favor of Banc De Binary.” Smallbones said it is hard for volunteer editors to compete with paid promoters. “It’s extremely frustrating when people who are obviously paid are trying to distort information and we’re almost all volunteers. When someone can put five people on an article it’s very difficult for us to stop them — at least in the short term.” A five-figure fee for Wikipedia ‘crisis management’ In June 2014, a Wikipedia editor mentioned on a talk page that he had witnessed a new record in how much money someone had been offered to do “crisis management” for a Wikipedia page. The editor described “a recent contract to edit a single Wikipedia article, where the winning editor won the contract after charging something in the five digit range.” The Wikipedia page in question was the Banc De Binary page and the five-figure sum was offered on a freelancer site to anyone who could rewrite the article in a way that removed the negative coverage, Smallbones told The Times of Israel. “Banc De Binary is hilarious,” another editor wrote in response to the first editor’s revelation. The Banc De Binary Wikipedia page “was written by a paid editor (since banned) as a whitewash, and then Wikipedia editors got hold of it and converted it to a truthful article about what is clearly a very dodgy company. At that point, socks en masse descended to try to ‘fix’ it for the company, and when that didn’t work, more adverts to delete or revert the content appeared.” Banc De Binary logo But Smallbones said the reality wasn’t funny at all. First of all, he estimated that about 300 people visited the article’s different language versions per day, and he wonders how many of those, seeing positive statements, went on to trade with the company and lost money. Second, he wonders how many hours of unpaid labor Wikipedia editors spent on “cleaning up” the article. “Their paid editors probably put in well over 100 hours on the article. And we had to put in as much time as they did, even more, because if we want to correct something, often we correct it two or three different times because there are a few editors with different points of view.” “I’ll see something I don’t like and I will correct it and someone will correct me and someone will say that’s not quite right and correct them and then Banc De Binary will come along and put in something else. It’s very labor intensive.” On May 17, The Times of Israel reached out to Banc De Binary’s founder Oren Shabat Laurent for a response to the allegations in this article but did not hear back from him. Binary options, forex and paid editing Banc De Binary is not alone. Smallbones said that paid editing on Wikipedia is rampant in the binary options and retail forex industries. Many Wikipedia articles for such websites get deleted soon after they are put up, he said, because Wikipedia administrators strongly suspect they are created by paid editors for advertising purposes. In a post from September 2016, a Wikipedia editor recommended several binary options and forex company pages for deletion (only an administrator, a Wikipedia editor with special privileges, can perform the actual deletion), because the editor believed the entries had been created by sockpuppets or suspected paid editors. These included entries for binary and forex firms Spotware Systems Ltd., XM.com, AnyOption, IQ Option, and JustForex. “All the articles named above have been badly polluted by promotional editors and need a checkup,” the editor wrote. “One thing I noticed across the multiple articles is a heavy tendency to cite how well regulated the various companies and exchanges are.” All the entries mentioned above were subsequently deleted. Polluted content that can hurt your pocketbook Wikipedia is just one of many forums where some binary options and forex companies go to great lengths to create “fake news.” Fraudulent binary options firms also employ an army of SEO (search engine optimization) specialists, who ensure that the warnings of government regulators or negative press are buried far down in Google search results. (Last year, after The Times of Israel published several articles describing the widespread fraudulent in the binary options industry, one employee wrote to us complaining that “you are ruining the keyword ‘binary options.’”) But beyond that, some in the industry create fake news sites with an ostensibly large readership, featuring ostensible news reports that appear in Google News about the purported advantages of binary options trading. Slide from a lecture by Google to the binary options and forex industry at the IFX Expo, May 2016 (Hunter Stuart/Times of Israel) The industry also spends a fortune advertising on Google, Twitter and Facebook. Some firms pay for sponsored content on mainstream news sites, hire expensive lobbyists and PR firms, cozy up to politicians and donate money to charities. Some companies have managed to get their own executives to appear as talking heads on mainstream television financial programs. Some binary options companies have been known to make threats combined with offers (known as throffers) to individuals who post negative information about them, offering to refund part of their investment money if they take down their negative review, or if not, suggesting menacingly that “we know where you live.” Still other companies simply disappear from the internet as soon as the number of complaints mounts, only to pop up again under a different name and website. A Russian connection? If some of these efforts sound reminiscent of the recent outbreak of fraudulent and polluted content stemming from Russia, among other actors, this may be because the binary options industry has a significant Russian component. Beyond the Israeli call centers and marketers who commit binary options fraud, many of the investors or ultimate beneficiary owners of binary options companies are Russian. Several of the banks where investors’ money goes after their credit cards are processed are Russian-owned, including but not limited to the Russian Commercial Bank in Cyprus, Sberbank, and VTB Bank in Georgia. Several Russian-owned forex companies, like Forex Club and Master Forex, have partnered with the Israeli platform provider SpotOption to create their own binary options brands, such as option4trade and mfxoptions. We are kicking off the @iFXEXPO now. We have plenty of cool stuff on our stand. Come by pic.twitter.com/vN8hwur3h1 — Webzilla (@webzilla_com) May 27, 2015 A number of Russian-linked binary options firms, like option4trade and IQ Option, are hosted by the Russian-owned web hosting company Webzilla. Webzilla, whose owner Alexey Gubarev recently sued Buzzfeed for publishing his name in the unverified Trump dossier, has made no secret that forex companies are among its major clients. A number of these clients have been placed on government regulator warning lists. IQ Option has been placed on an investor warning blacklist by the Monetary Authority of Singapore. Forex Club was the subject of a regulator warning from Belgium’s Financial Services and Markets Authority (FSMA) in 2015. ‘In the end, we will prevail’ As for Smallbones himself, he is a retired professor of finance and a former foreign currencies trader on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange who lived and taught in Russia and Hungary during the 1990s and 2000s.The retail forex industry, as well as its many fraudulent players, first came to his attention then. ““I remember being in a little town in the Urals where all the factories had been closed. Posters were advertising forex trading with a $5 minimum deposit. The poor people who answered those ads had no chance of making any money,” Smallbones said, “but were likely going to be suckered into losing hundreds that they couldn’t afford. “There were similar scams in Moscow in the 1990s, only with more money involved.” As for how the binary options scam started, Smallbones waxed philosophical. “Securities scams go back forever. The original Ponzi scheme was in the 1920s and it involved international postal coupons. Then in the 1960s people were scamming with warehouse receipts for salad oil. Anything that can be changed into money, there is a scam associated with it. People just look at forex and see all the tools needed are there to create a scam.” Smallbones is drawn to edit Wikipedia articles about financial fraud because the topic interests him. But he regrets that it took at least three years to get the Banc De Binary article to a place where he feels it is accurate and fair. If that’s how much work was required to correct one small instance of fake news, Smallbones was asked, how can companies like Google or Facebook, which rely heavily on algorithms as opposed to humans, keep the fraudsters at bay? Smallbones replied, “Yes, well, most Wikipedia editors would probably agree that they can’t.” He was more optimistic about the ability of Wikipedia to root out lies and paid spin. The scammers “can make trouble and make us work a long time,” he said, “but in the long run, and this was a very long run, we’re going to prevail.” Like us on Facebook Get our newsletter Follow us on Twitter Banc De Binary CEO Oren Laurent in an interview posted on YouTube in August 2016 (YouTube screenshot) The Times of Israel Current top stories Wikipedia vs. Banc De Binary: A 3-year battle against binary options ‘fake news’   Hours before Deri interrogation, cops detain 14 in probe   ‘Jared doing a great job,’ says Trump amid reports of Kushner-Russia ties   Police detain 14th Manchester bomb suspect   Trump yelled at Abbas: ‘You tricked me in DC,’ Israeli TV reports   Tweet Read more on:  binary options,  binary options fraud,  Banc de Binary,  Wikipedia,  fake news,  binary options victims,  forex fraud,  Russia,  Search Engine Optimization,  paid editing,  Oren Laurent More in Israel Inside Supreme Court rules Haifa ammonia tank must close Comments on this article Report inappropriate comments Back to Top The Times of Israel Home Israel & the Region Jewish Times Israel Inside The Blogs The Jewish Planet Start-Up Israel Daily Edition Spotlight Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy About Us Advertise with Us Contact Us Newsletter Facebook Twitter RSS © 2017 The Times of Israel, All rights reserved.

Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 29 May 2017 | MYT 10:00 AM Google not giving up on virtual reality, despite disappointing sales Google has announced it is investing even more in VR, despite disappointing sales for a technology that was tipped to be as revolutionary as the smartphone. — dpa There's been a lot of hype about virtual reality (VR) headsets for years, but now that they’ve actually hit the shops, it's become apparent that besides hardcore gamers, most people aren’t interested in investing upwards of a thousand dollars on these new virtual worlds.  The Facebook-owned Oculus Rift, the HTC Vive, the Sony Playstation VR, the Samsung Gear VR and the Google Daydream have hit the market – but sales have been disappointing for a technology that was tipped to be as revolutionary as the smartphone.  An Oculus Rift bundle costs close to US$600 (RM2,560) and a HTC Vive with controllers around €900 (RM4,290), while for top-end systems there's the prerequisite of a powerful PC, which is likely to cost significantly more than €1,000 (RM4,767).  Some VR headsets can do without a high-end PC and just need a smartphone to be connected to the device, for example the Samsung Gear VR or Google's Daydream.  While these are cheaper and more mobile, they lack the image quality and precision of the more expensive VR systems with room sensors.  But Google has announced it is investing even more in VR. At its latest developers conference, the tech giant revealed a standalone VR device that doesn't require a computer or a smartphone to function and that will cost around the same as an Oculus Rift or HTC Vive.  In terms of resolution and tracking accuracy the Google device, which will be manufactured by HTC and Lenovo, won’t reach the level of the larger VR headsets but it’ll be quicker to set up as the movement sensors that track the user will be built into the device.  Clay Bavor, vice president of VR at Google, conceded that VR has so far failed to meet sales expectations. "This is the case with many new technologies. But it's going up again," he says.  Meanwhile Google is also focussing augmented reality, in which visuals from the real world is combined with virtual content.  Google demonstrated is plans with an application allowing users to look inside an ancient Egyptian sarcophagus from the Detroit Museum of Arts. Visitors can not only see the coffin's mummy on their tablet but also that the pharaoh is missing a toe.  Google hopes that in future all schools will have access to such technology. "It will take some time for this concept to become a reality, but it's no longer science fiction," Bavor said. — dpa Related Stories You May Be Interested BA cancels flights from London as global IT outage causes chaos Vietnam says Google will cooperate in removal of ‘toxic’ content Poor showing at Sudirman Cup costs Vivian-Khe Wei place in world meet Get smart about the idiot box The man who rebuilt this city Racing for a better tomorrow Others Also Read Miranda Kerr marries Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel More US tourists coming to our shores soon Investing in social impact advertisement Latest News Acquisitions accelerate as tech giants seek to build AI smarts Samsung Elec considers adding capacity at China chip plant Google Search introduces Personal tab to show users’ online content Lenovo’s struggling mobile business sets sight on high-end market More Heathrow chaos as BA scrambles to recover from IT crash Most Viewed in Tech More Heathrow chaos as BA scrambles to recover from IT crash Get smart about the idiot box Malaysians love to Netflix, with or without the chill, at night Lenovo’s struggling mobile business sets sight on high-end market US might ban laptops on all flights into and out of the country Google Search introduces Personal tab to show users’ online content Chipotle says hackers hit most restaurants in data breach BA cancels flights from London as global IT outage causes chaos Maintaining IPv4 is going to get expensive: expert Why you can’t buy a car online – for now Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Click “Start Scan” to find Windows issues that could be causing PC problems. Click “Repair All” to fix all issues. Google has announced the compatible devices available for the new Android 7.1.2 Nougat update and it seems like the Motorola’s Nexus 6 and HTC’s Nexus 9 tablet are not on the list. Android 7.1.4 Android Update is soon to be released in the upcoming months. The eligible devices which rolled in the Android Beta Program are : Pixel and Pixel XL, Nexus 5X, Nexus Player and Pixel C. Google stated that they are also preparing an upgrade for Nexus 6P and is expected to be launched soon enough. For all of you Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 fans out there, the news of Android 7.1.2 Nougat upgrade being unavailable for your devices, will come as an unexpected surprise. We just hope that Google reconsiders its decision. Well, Google has not specifically stated that Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 won’t be updated, we simply come to a conclusion based on the list of the devices eligible for the Android 7.1.2 Nougat, where these two have not been mentioned. Unfortunately, a Google employee has confirmed our conclusion. The only good thing is that Google might continue to bring in essential security patches for Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 for one single year. This will come as a consolation for most users who use one of this products. Available Devices For Android 7.1.2 Nougat Update If you device does find itself among the ones eligible for this update, you should be patient because it will be delivered in a couple of days. Google has recently announced that the Beta program will also include the Nexus 6P model. This program is supposed to be released soon. If you are not enrolled in the Beta program you need to register as soon as possible before it is too late, because only then you will receive the beta update over-the-air.

By Tas Bindi | May 29, 2017 -- 01:06 GMT (18:06 PDT) | Topic: Innovation After winning a three-game match against Chinese grandmaster Ke Jie in what is revered as the world's most demanding strategy game, Google's gaming AI AlphaGo is retiring. With nothing left to prove, AlphaGo's developers from Google-owned artificial intelligence lab DeepMind will now focus on creating advanced general algorithms that could help scientists uncover cures for diseases, reduce energy consumption, and invent new materials. Latest news on Asia Google's AlphaGo retires after beating Chinese Go champion What Indian IT needs to do urgently to survive the digital future Apple opens first Southeast Asia store in Singapore Chromebooks, detachables, and gaming PCs boost Lenovo results DJI Spark is a palm-sized drone available for $499 "We plan to bring that same excitement and insight to a range of new fields, and try to address some of the most important and urgent scientific challenges of our time. We hope that the story of AlphaGo is just the beginning," wrote Demis Hassabis, co-founder and CEO of DeepMind, and David Silver, research scientist at DeepMind, in a blog post. The developers behind AlphaGo still plan on publishing an academic paper later this year detailing what building the AI has taught them, and is also working on tool to teach humans to become better Go players. Last March in Seoul, AlphaGo became the first machine to beat a top player at the 3,000-year-old game of Go when it defeated Korean grandmaster Lee Sedol. AlphaGo has since learned to master the game by being "its own teacher", playing millions of high level training games against itself to continually improve, according to DeepMind. The progression of AlphaGo has shown how AI can not only replace human skills, but also advance them, according to DeepMind. Professional Go players including Shi Yue and Zhou Ruiyang admitted they changed the way they play after watching AlphaGo. Jie, who lost to the AI, opened the first game last week in China with an unusual strategy called the "3-3 point invasion" that AlphaGo used multiple times during the 60 matches it won in January under the moniker Magister. "Thanks to AlphaGo's creative and intriguing revelations, players of all levels have been inspired to test out new moves and strategies of their own, often re-evaluating centuries of inherited knowledge in the process," DeepMind software engineer Lucas Baker, and professional Go player Fan Hui wrote in a blog post. DeepMind has made 10 games that AlphaGo played against itself while it was training available to watch online, with a further 40 to be uploaded soon.

If you haven't seen Logan, Arrival, or Get Out, now you can give it a watch on the cheap.

The offer ends on July 7th, and you may have to follow specific steps to redeem it. There are a few caveats. For one, you only get one rental at this price, and two, the deal might not appear for everyone. Your deal might also be be different, some are seeing $1.50. Redeeming the offer might also be a bit awkward, as it seems to be tied to a user-specific coupon code. To use it you need to go to the Google Play Movies page and see if you have the ad visible below. Clicking the ad opens a prompt to redeem the offer. Google says that this offer is only open to specific users based on their purchase history, so YMMV. If everything goes smoothly, you'll have your $1 rental in no time. The full terms and conditions for the deal are available below. $0.99 for any movie rental Get any one movie rental of your choice for $0.99.

Not sure what they're welcoming me back from. It wasn't all that long ago I rented Arrival from them. Ryne Hager I was curious what the differences by account might be. I'll update the post to include that. Hurricane Andrew Same here, I got the $1.49 deal yesterday. nagi Does not seem to be active in Hungary. Probably US-only. Arnaldo Rodriguez For me its $0.99 but when I get to the checkout, its $4.99 again s_bomb Same for me, no discount being applied Mathew Michel I'm guessing we aren't eligible since we use the discounts regularly: "This offer is open to specific Google Play users based on purchase history." s_bomb I had to click the banner advertising the deal and "accept" the deal, after that it is being applied. Gilberto Just as @s_bomb:disqus said, I had to click the banner first, and the price is $1.49 -_- me me I see the $0.99, I pick a film, I see rent/buy SD/HD, click on SD rent and it shows $4.99, right upto the point of debitting my credit card. That appears to me to be actually $4.99, not $0.99 ? Ryne Hager Yup, you have to actually redeem their coupon code via an advertisement you'll see on the main page for Google Play Movies, as noted in the article. me me Well that appears not true / applicable. I see $0.99, and then I click on it and it gets right up to the point of about to debit card and its $4.99. So its clickbait to fool me into paying $4.99. Nope. Ryne Hager Unfortunately, if you don't redeem the code via the advertisement on the Play landing page, you won't get the discount. me me Ahh. So YOUR LINK is bad. What i did: Ignore your link. Go to play.google.com Movies then the $0.99 is shown, click on that, then the film, then at checkout its $0.99 shown. Thanks for bringing to our attention, figured out valid method eventually. iboalali It's a shame that I will never rent or buy any movie or TV show from the play store, because I can't get anything in English (I live in Germany). Except if I want to watch something in German. I rather buy/rent from the Microsoft store, they offer everything in German and English for me. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Wait, where is me me so they can complain that it's still too expensive? Keith Taylor Since I have 5 different accounts I just used on of my secondary ones. blazingwolf I'm getting an offer for 2 episodes of a TV show for $.99. I would rather have the movie but I guess this is better than nothing. ROB Same here... can't imagine a show I would want to pay to see lomsha Shows on 1 account but not the other lol. dullknives same. primary accnt - nothing. secondary accnt - offer is there. pfmiller It says an offer to welcome you back, so it's probably for accounts that haven't used Google Movies recently. roebling "La La Land", the big winner of the last Academy Awards, is on the $0.99 list OtisFeelgood Offer showed up as $1.49 for me. Marty Damn! I was really hyped about this. Sadly the only movies I would have been interested in suck. Logan, The Great Wall and Split all suck. 30014 Logan and Split were awesome, not interested in The Great Wall. Justin Osborne Ah, I reported this about a month ago, it's been going on for some time now. 😛 Marty Tried to rent Passengers and was charged $5.99. Got a refund. iKon Guys, just download Shoebox. Any movie for free. Y'all don't need these offers AC I don't really care about not being eligible for the discount, but it's REALLY tacky of Google to splash the offer screen up for everyone and then sweep the rug under unsuspecting users that didn't receive the promo.

Netflix confirms it is blocking rooted/unlocked devices, app itself is still working (for now) Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/13 3:08pm PDTMay 13, 2017 239 Plus 1 on G+ 1179 Share on Facebook 437 Share on Twitter Total Shares1418 Applications News Earlier today, Netflix started showing up as 'incompatible' on the Play Store for rooted and unlocked Android devices. However, the app itself continued to work fine, leading some (including myself) to think it could have been an accident. However, Netflix has now confirmed to us that blocking modified devices from downloading the app was intentional. This is the full statement: With our latest 5.0 release, we now fully rely on the Widevine DRM provided by Google; therefore, many devices that are not Google-certified or have been altered will no longer work with our latest app and those users will no longer see the Netflix app in the Play Store. If you're not familiar with it, Widevine is a Google-made DRM technology that works across various desktop and mobile platforms. Widevine categorizes devices into three security levels, ranging from all processes running in the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE) to not running anything in TEE at all. However, the Play Store listing seems tied to a device's SafetyNet status (which is used by Android Pay), rather than the Widevine TEE. For example, Artem's bootloader-unlocked stock Pixel is still on Widevine Level 1, the most secure level, but fails SafetyNet because it is unlocked. The update's changelog also confirms that: "Version 5.0 only works with devices that are certified by Google and meet all Android requirements." What isn't exactly clear is why only the Play Store listing is blocked, but the app itself continued to function normally. I tried both Netflix 4.16 and 5.0.4 (the latest version, from today), and both worked without problems on my unlocked and rooted Galaxy Tab S (which is labeled as Widevine Security Level 3). Maybe at some point the app will stop working, but that does not appear to be the case right now. If you have a blocked device, I recommend following the Pushbullet channel for Netflix on APKMirror (click the Pushbullet button on that page) so you can continue to receive updates outside the Play Store.

First the vpn's now this... why oh why??? Jimk4003 Surely because licensing is regionally specific, and because rooting has the potential to defeat DRM. I get that it might be annoying for some people, but aren't the reasons obvious? David Juarez But root?? Lol Semianonymous Probably an effort to reduce Region spoofing? Idk how easy that is to do on a stock device. Jimk4003 Because rooting has the potential to defeat DRM. mjh49783ab DRM doesn't work. All DRM does is inconvenience the end user. Jimk4003 Possibly. But Netflix have to negotiate licencing deals with the movie studios, and having DRM helps reassure the studios that the movies they have spent millions of dollars making aren't going to get stolen off Netflix without any attempt to stop it. mjh49783ab One could make the argument that rooting the phone may compromise the DRM. But blocking users from unlocking their phones to switch carriers? That is total bullshit, and is just the sort of thing that encourages users to pirate the content. Jimk4003 Netflix are blocking you from switching carriers? lomsha Sim unlocked phones are fine, unlocked bootloaders are blocked. mjh49783ab They didn't exactly make that clear in the article when I last read it. h4rr4r The studios need to reconsider blu rays then. Way easier to rip. Nothing they do will stop piracy. This kind of thing actually encourages it. Jimk4003 Maybe studios do need to consider Blu-ray's. That isn't Netflix's problem though. h4rr4r No Netflix problem is making sure they don't let the studios reduce the value of their product. If Amazon video works on my devices and Netflix does not that is a big deal to me. In that case I might as well sign up for more addon channels on Amazon with the mkney that currently goes to Netflix. Jimk4003 Agreed. But the studios are responsible for making the product they redistribute. It's certainly a balancing act, and I can see both sides of the argument, but Netflix isn't an inalienable right, and those who don't meet the T&C's are going to miss out. h4rr4r Sure, but the studios and Netflix are going to create pirates with these kind of actions. People aren't going to miss out. They will just pirate what they can't get legally. Jimk4003 Sure, but again, it's a tiny fraction of users. If Netflix can negotiate better terms with studios by blocking rooted devices, and thus improve their business overall at the expense of a few fringe users, it stands to reason that is what Netflix will do. Doby Gillis whaa fucking whaa. Sergio Carmona The only obvious thing here is your sarcasm detector not working properly. Go have it fixed please. Jimk4003 Nah, I'm good. h4rr4r So the reason are to make the product worse for the consumer. Great idea, now piracy looks better and better. Jimk4003 What percentage of phones are rooted though? Most people won't care, or even notice the change. h4rr4r It does not matter, if it drives even one person to piracy that is a loss. Jimk4003 But if they can ensure better licensing deals via these new terms, which will attract more customers at the expense of a few rooted users who make up a tiny fraction of overall users; will Netflix care about that loss? h4rr4r But if it encourages piracy the other side of the contract should want to avoid it. Gaining customers in the short term like this hurts the whole market in the long term. Cyber_Akuma Because yeah, people are going to rip movies from Netflix and not off a Blu-Ray.... and even IF they were to attempt to rip them off Netflix, they would use a PHONE and not a PC.... Jimk4003 Ripping Blu-rays isn't Netflix's problem, and Netflix don't need to try and guess what device someone would try and commit piracy with, when the technology exists to restrict them all. Cyber_Akuma You are missing the point, people aren't going to be ripping from Netflix over ripping from a Blu-Ray, and on top of that, they sure as hell aren't going to be ripping off a phone. And actually, you are wrong, the technology to "resist them all" does NOT actually exist. There is no one technology that "restricts them all" but several different technologies for different platforms with various levels of viability and success. Jimk4003 I said 'the technology exists'. When did I say it was a single piece of technology? Let's not be those guys who get in a pedantic argument about semantics on the internet. Regarding the issue under discussion; Netflix's job is to make their platform as robust as possible against piracy, using whatever technology is available to them. Blu-Ray simply isn't their problem. Cyber_Akuma Because just arguing "technology exists" is worthless, plenty of technology exists, and plenty of it is misused. Technically the technology to remotely brick your phone exists too, doesn't mean it's fine to use just because it "exists". And no, their platform already is robust, you are trying to ignore the fact that people ripping movies off a phone is a complete and total non-issue just to try to argue for Netflix's sake, this is ESPECIALLY considering the fact that it harms far more legitimate people than it helps. Sorry, but no, just a plain and completely undesputable NO. You can't argue that it's ok to use something that will hurt a large majority of people just to potentially possibly stop an extreme minority of people who would not even use this method anyway. That's like arguing it's ok to burn down a house to kill a spider. Jimk4003 "You can't argue that it's ok to use something that will hurt a large majority of people". We're talking about Netflix blocking rooted users; in what reality do they constitute the 'large majority' of Android users? Cyber_Akuma I meant the majority of the rooted users. Last time I checked, over 25% of people with an Android device had root access, which is several million users. And OF those several million rooted users, how many do you think actually use their rooted phone and Netflix app to pirate content? Less than 1% Hell, less than 0.1%? They are hurting over 99% of rooted Android users, which while not the majority of Android users is still a lot, to attempt to stop (and not even that effectively as there have been work-around for SafetyNet checks for nearly a year now) an extreme minority OF a minority from doing something they are unlikely to do due to other methods anyway. Richard Markert >I meant the majority of the rooted users. Even the majority of rooted users is a drop in the ocean when it comes to Android users worldwide. Cyber_Akuma Again, over 25%. You also completely missed the point of the argument in that this hurts nearly all rooted users that would not use this maliciously. Lord Argyris Looks like I'll have to start updating manually then. Or just not bother with the app at all since I rarely use Netflix on my phone as it is. SpasilliumNexus Thank goodness the 3T's Open Beta of OxygenOS is good enough for me to not unlock my device and stick with complete stock. Now I wonder why I haven't received any Netflix app updates beyond 4.16.1 build 15145 on the Play Store, when APKMirror has 4 newer versions. ast00 They asked for it. Now pirate their content knowing that you tried doing it the legal way, but THEY declined. Φώτης Because unlocking your Android powered device is such a "bad" thing to do. Whatever Netflix. Ailín Ó’S Ναι, ακριβώς... 😑 C64 How about some English Rob Google translate says that "Ναι, ακριβώς" translates to "Yes, exactly". pcriz How about some Google translate :-/ C64 This is an English website, so you have to talk English. I'm Dutch, so i talk (or try to talk) English too. It hasn't to be perfect, but it would be bs if I talked Dutch over here. 'Want 90 procent van de mensen hier spreken geen Nederlands' Or do you like to use translate with everything freaking post Φώτης Chill. It was literally just two words. Not that big of a deal, don't you think? AnubArack Is it that hard to write 2 words in another language then? Kevin Strident Yo no se. You try it. Φώτης Of course not. Actually this is exactly what happened :p AnubArack You and @kevinstrident:disqus are sooooo funny.

Otherwise have as much right to ignore him as he does to speak whatever language he wants. Geezz what a buncha cry babies xyz He is breaking the most important rule of the internet which is faasusu polo asini. pcriz I could try and translate that and feed a troll. Or I can go on living my life. I may choose the latter. C'est la vie, damn how easy (adult) was that ? d0x360 You can talk in whatever language you want. You won't get many people paying any attention to anything you say but who cares? Also...use Google to translate it. It's that button at the very bottom. Yes, exactly xyz Du-te dracului Rebel without a Clue Want 90 procent van de mensen hier spreekt ;) C64 Sorry i was stoned 🤣 Rebel without a Clue Hahaha ok dan mag het Keletor Thank you much! You are awesome, and I totally respect you for that statement and the use of the Commodore insignia. AntiCoyote Not really fair, every single Dutch person I know speaks English as well as an American :o) C64 I'm sorry that we Dutch learn English at school :p davidus The real reason behind this is that there arent many ppl to talk to in first place, if u only speak dutch. Trust me, i m from a neighbour country ;) Me Or some Bixby xyz I don't think Google can translate dipshit. Seems to be a rarely spoken language. pcriz Um okay, whatever that means. DavidEssex How about not being ignorant. xyz Ignorant? No one speaks every language in the world, dipshit. Өөрийгөө Зөндөө Go ArclightX flüggåәnkб€čhiœßølįên There! Now put that in your pipe and smoke it! C64 Don't quit your day job Narg While I prefer English, I have to say that web browsers today make it dirt simple to translate anything, why get all worked up about this? Not using the tools at hand just show ignorance and lethargy. nasznjoka umetisha mzazi asianrage Is it being Unlocked that is not allowed, or Unlocked and Rooted as well? Corbin Davenport Both.

EowynCarter Yeah me too. And unless they change this, bye netflix account. No point in something I can't use anymore. Demoncat The funny part about video DRM is it's easily defeated. It's more convenient to steal the videos than to deal with the DRM restrictions. Fedup Exactly. Between VPN'ed torrents and nzbs, my Sonarr downloads all TV shows (netflix, HBO, ABC/CBS/NBC/FOX) automatically within minutes of them being ripped and posted by others. It is 100% automated, and with my Plex server running, I can watch shows anywhere - cost = $0.00. I don't do this to save money. I do it for the convenience, lack of ads, and freedom of time/place shifting. Heck, some shows actually download BEFORE they air on network TV (i.e. Designated Survivor). Yan Minari You better tell us more about how you set up this. stan dex 97 new dark web premium links . also included are netfix lifetime membership links as well as graphic Live chat links (use anonymously) https://satoshibox.com/axbr7vnm6ifzk8hwtcreoe28/buy d0x360 I cancelled​ my account, sent them feedback and then just asked a friend who I let use HBO go and a Chromecast ultra if I could use their Netflix. David Gabel That seems rather dumb. Why cancel your service to them yet still use it via someone else? You're not teaching them anything. For an example, let's say you have a MacBook, and Apple does something to piss you off. You sell your MacBook, but then borrow a friend's MacBook. Nothing was actually accomplished. d0x360 Nothing was accomplished? I cancelled my account and let them know why. Now they aren't making money off me but I still to use their service. Your analogy is deeply flawed...deeply. So deeply I don't think you understand exactly what an analogy is. David Gabel So, you're "not giving them money" yet you still support them by using their product. It still seems like your logic is flawed. If you're really that pissed at Netflix, don't use it. Period. Use a different service instead of supporting them by borrowing it off a friend, as they are also giving them money (and support) , too via their subscription. revbones How is using their service for free "supporting" them? They aren't getting any revenue off you if you're not paying them. Saying you're supporting them by not paying them is a little stupid don't you think? xyz lol. So by your "logic" a person who pirates House of Cards is also supporting Netflix ? BobButtons You're doing the opposite of supporting. You're getting the benefits of their service while stopping payment and adding to server load which they pay for. David Gabel So far, your stance is the only one that makes sense. The rest so far are noise Sir Doogie Houser M.D.Esq. 200 You seen like an incredulous douch who I'd suplex onto a park bench for being a lap dog bitch.How is canceling or stealing not doing something.Also,its not a fucking macbook jerkoff its a paid service for TV on a phone they expect to be paid for.BTFO David Gabel And you are a loud mouth keyboard warrior that loves to talk a big game, but in reality have little to no control over anything and use web forums to spout obscenities and violent threats to make yourself feel better. nagi Just another step that makes pirating the same content more convenient... we should really be going the other way if they ever want piracy to be reduced. lomsha Funny thing is their content is available to stream all over the internet. Don't see how this move fights piracy as long as computers have access. This just alienates legit users who are doing nothing nefarious on unlocked/rooted devices. Richard Branches By one everybody pays... Pathum Addarapathirana Dude I root my phone to just get iPhone emojis and to tether without my carrier knowing. Like I'm not stealing anything this will just make me stop paying for Netflix. Latheryin Just a heads up. Those treating hiding mods are fake. There is no way to hide if from the carrier. Heck if they wanted to they could see every web page you load from a ton of different places and ways. Yan Minari That’s why god invented VPN Latheryin Yes but even then it doesn't block everything. qqqqqq My provider absolutely blocks tethering - I've been using various methods, including VPNs, to block it for literally YEARS... Hasn't been difficult. Dylan Harris That's not true. All you have to due to bypass tethering limits on t-mobile is to change the TTL on the tethered device. Latheryin That just gets by the automated checks. Get a live person to randomly pick your account (not really likely but happens) and it is not had to tell if someone is tethering. Dmitri Smirnov All that person will be able to tell is whether customer is using a lot of data or not. And this is the root of the problem: be honest that you are limited traffic, instead of trying to play this game of "we'll pretent we are giving you unlimited data and in return you'll only use small-format mobile device, so that we'll hope that you won't be able to use as much of it". Kind of "all you can eat, but you have to only use a tea cup and one chopstick". Latheryin No the issue is people being entitled and taking advantage of things. You have people running their gaming systems and using hundreds of gb a month. Not only is that kinda dumb but it violate the fair use act in most cell TOS. If people didn't abuse the system then it wouldn't be an issue. Also just some food for thought. If they can't tell anything more then a lot of data just how do they route the traffic properly? Make no mistake. If the carrier wanted to they could tell. I know for a fact that there is a team for both att and Verizon that is tasked with just that. Dmitri Smirnov >No the issue is people being entitled and taking advantage of things. You have people running their gaming systems and using hundreds of gb a month. "taking advantage" I thought that people were in their right by using what they paid for. Allright, tell me this - is it allright for me to watch 4K video on my phone (since the screens allow it now)? What's the difference between this and me watching the same stream on my laptop over my phone's connection? What if I just redirect the video stream to my TV using WiDi or any other technology? How is browsing a site from a laptop different from browsing it from a phone network-congestion-wise? And then it boils down to the same argument - carriers are just hoping you'll use the network less from you phone device, as it's less convenient. The more convenient smartphones become for consuming large volumes of traffic, the sooner carriers will have to more away from this scan and expose the actual numbers. > If people didn't abuse the system then it wouldn't be an issue. If carriers would be honest and upfront about "hidden" caps, then people would not be able to game the system. > Also just some food for thought. If they can't tell anything more then a lot of data just how do they route the traffic properly? Make no mistake. If the carrier wanted to they could tell. Latheryin Tethering was never even an extra charge until people started taking advantage of the mobile networks. Watching 4k videos is not a big deal, using 200gb of mobile data in a cycle is flat out stupid. Mobile networks were not designed for that type of traffic from a single device. Nor was it made to handle running your ps4 while you are gaming. Why do you think that pages are made to be mobile friendly? Not only is it a usability issue but a data usage issue as well. It's not hidden. All people have to do is read the TOS. It's all right there. Yet most people just don't want to take the time to do it and then get made about it. Can't blame the carriers for that. Dmitri Smirnov > Watching 4k videos is not a big deal, using 200gb of mobile data in a cycle is flat out stupid. a) I'm glad we're finally on the same page that the real problem for networks is data usage and not tethering or no tethering. b) You are aware that you're contradicting yourself in the same sensense? 4K 60Fps video bitrate is ~20-40 MiB/s which gives an average movie the size of about 72GiB. so by your definition watching a movie in good quality is OK as long as you don't watch more than 3 of them in a month. c) how is using mobile data that you paid for - stupid? If there are caps - announce them and make it impossible to go over them instead of shaming people who actually decide to take you up on your offer. d) tethering has not been an extra charge until telcos understood that they could charge extra for it (just like them toying with idea of charging extra for Instant Messenger traffic, because it undercuts their SMS plans). > It's not hidden. All people have to do is read the TOS. It's all right there. Yet most people just don't want to take the time to do it and then get made about it. Can't blame the carriers for that. Well, carriers are the ones calling their plans "unlimited" and hiding the actual caps either buried deep in the ToS or behind the vague "reasonable usage". So don't blame people for not wanting to wade through pages of legalspeak just to learn that you lied and "unlmited" is just "50Gb and then throttled". Fedup Agreed. The problem is the AMOUNT of data consumed by a given user account - no how it is consumed. If carriers are concerned about individuals abusing their network, then they need to flag those accounts that use an excessive amount of bandwidth - whether it's through tethering or directly on the device itself. I could easily burn through 150GB/mo on my TMO Note 4 w/o tethering simply by leaving my Blue Iris app connected and streaming 24/7. So it's actually very easy to abuse the system without ever turning on the tethering. Ravonus Damitri this guy is a nut ha... I agree with you 100% bro. Ravonus um yes you can fake it... Sure you can't block the traffic... but you sure can make it seem like the traffic is coming from your phone and not being used to tether.. Which is what these apps do.. SMH lol Latheryin If that is what you wish to believe. OK. Android Developer Is the tether solution needed even if you do it using USB ? Fulbring What a stupid move. I pay for the premium for Netflix and I never thought that I might have to cancel my service just because they did this. The only reason why I have root is because of AdAway and TitaniumBackup. I still use the stock OnePlus 3T ROM. Wasn't expecting this at all.... Kinda suck. Will be interesting to see how many customers they lose. Julian Berger Not enough to change it back... 4Ui812 DRM has no place in our lives. I suspect Netflix will have a change of heart within 6 months. Branko Xiaomi phones say bye bye to Netflix. Google go fuck yourselves. Steve_Jobroni Go fucking buy a windows phone. 天地人 Seriously though Windows phones are great. The only problem with them is the lack of applications. Otherwise, it runs great on low-end hardware, has a great UI, the homescreen is innovative, synchronisation with Windows PCs is cool, etc. dukaki Don't forget that you can use the Netflix website on Edge instead of their shitty app, and it streams at full 1080p, even on my L650 with a 720p screen. 天地人 Wait the Netflix application hasn't an option to stream at FHD? dukaki Nope, just 480p like on android. The device has to be "certified" and there are no certified windows phones afaik. The WP app doesn't even have downloads yet, I think. Edit: Just checked, no option to download here but you can on the desktop app. EowynCarter Might end with a visit at the apple store in my case. Windows phone is kind of not supported anymore. Jimk4003 This is Netflix, not Google. Cyber_Akuma Google invented this SafetyNet crap, let anyone use it for any reason (Hell, Pokemon GO of all things started using it), and over the last year have been making it even more and more strict and unforgiving. So no, a HUGE part of the blame does lie on Google for being openly hostile towards rooted users and not giving a damn about them. Jimk4003 There are legitimate reasons to use Safetynet to check the integrity of a device: Android Pay (or banking apps in general) is one example. It isn't necessarily hostility to root users; it's just a reality that Google need to be able to demonstrate to banks or other third parties that their OS is secure, and that people can't bypass built in security safeguards. Netflix need to do the same with the studios they redistribute content for; and they've chosen to use Safetynet to do it. Netflix isn't a human right; you have no inalienable right to root your phone and to use Netflix. Cyber_Akuma Except that not even my own banking app uses SafetyNet, it still has root checking and certain sensitive features are disabled if I am rooted, but not the entire app. Furthermore, it IS hostility to rooted users, because anyone can toss SafetyNet into their app for any reason whatsoever (such as games using it "just because" in case of cheaters... which doesn't even help at all to stop them). Google has been completely unwilling to work out ANY sort of compromise or method that can keep a phone secure without basically tossing rooted users under the bus. Jimk4003 What sort of compromise do you envision? Cyber_Akuma I am saying that they didn't even try. PCs by default obviously allow admin accounts all the time, even as the main user account (as much as that is not recommended) yet can maintain security. Google when they were confronted with people who were hurt by SafetyNet, legitimate users mind you, basically just shrugged them off and didn't even bother considering what could be done to allow the device to remain secure while also having such safeties in place. I mean, all these apps that you can use on your phone, can also be used on a PC, many of them available in either a browser or native app format, yet it remains secure. There is no reason this could not be done with Android, especially considering it used Linux as a base, they are just refusing to even consider it. Jimk4003 Don't you already have that choice? Your phone is sold without root access (i.e. no admin rights), and you can then choose whether or not to root your device and gain elevated privileges. If you do choose to root your device, you will lose access to some Safetynet enabled applications. You can, of course, unroot if necessary. Cyber_Akuma First of all, not all phones are. Especially in non-US countries. Second, it shouldn't have to be a choice. How many PC apps refuse to run under an admin account? Practically none. I shouldn't have to choose between having root access or being able to use a apps that more and more are starting to add this nonsense to them. Third, it's not even just root, even having an unlocked BOOTLOADER now, even if your rom is 100% stock and unrooted, can trip SafetyNet, it didn't used to be that strict. It's ridiculous to claim one should be able to have one or the other, even SafetyNet could have been designed to not be this brokenly strict, but Google had no interest in doing so, and they are rapidly making having root more and more useless while we still have to deal with all the junk they force on your phone from the manufacturer... that you can only remove with root. Jimk4003 Well, it is what it is. You believe you shouldn't have to make a choice, whereas I believe life is all about making choices and living with the outcomes. We seldom get everything we want, and neither Netflix, nor rooting, are inalienable rights. Whether or not you think it should be a choice, it is one; choose what you feel is best for you. Cyber_Akuma That's not even an argument, that's just trying to claim that the status quo should remain for no reason other than it is the status quo. It shouldn't have to be a choice, and arguing that people have to choose between root and having an increasingly less amount of apps just because "it is what it is" is insanity. In fact, it wasn't even the status quo before until Google started pulling this nonsense with SafetyNet a short while ago. That doesn't mean people should just accept it. Jimk4003 It's not an argument, because there is no argument to be had. The reality of the situation is self-evident; you can't have a rooted device and install Netflix via Google Play. Accepting the status quo has nothing to do with it; it's simply acknowledging reality. You have to choose what's more important to you; Netflix or rooting your phone. Finding the reality frustrating, as you clearly do, won't make it any less real. If this was a serious discussion on human rights; censorship, migration, justice, gender equality etc., then it's important in a democracy to be aware of your rights and responsibilities, and challenge the status quo where necessary. But this isn't anything like that. This is two for-profit corporations, Google and Netflix, who provide services to which you have no fundamental right to access, nor any obligation to use. You can choose to pay for their services and accept their terms and conditions, or you can choose not to. You don't get to pick the terms and conditions of the service someone else is providing you; however you are free to not use the service if you don't like the terms and conditions under which they are provided. That's it; it's no simpler or more complicated than that. Ranting on the internet about how unfair you perceive it to be is irrelevant. Again, it is what it is. Cyber_Akuma Again, there is no "it is what it is" argument. There should be no choice, PERIOD. You are basically saying that people should not complain about this just because "it is what it is". No, it is NOT what it is, it should NOT BE what it is, and people can and WILL complain that it SHOULD NOT be what it is. You aren't even making any rational arguments anymore, just re-stating what the current situation is and then basically claiming that people should not want or expect better. Jimk4003 You can want or expect better if you like. Netflix, like every other for-profit enterprise in a capitalist system, will either succeed or fail based on its ability to turn a profit. Right now, Netflix is turning a profit, and clearly thinks it can be more profitable by excluding rooted users whose theoretical ability to circumvent DRM restrictions may impact its ability to secure rights to new content. Clearly you disagree with their stance, and the only way to see for sure if your disagreement is warranted is to watch their financial performance from here on out. None of the above changes the fact that you aren't entitled to Netflix. You've chosen to root your phone, and Netflix have recently chosen to exclude rooted users. That leaves you with a choice to make. Even if you think that choice is unfair, even if you think you should be able to have both. The reality is you can't have both, and you will have to choose. Again, Netflix isn't a right. Go elsewhere if you disagree with their business practices; that's how capitalism works. Beyond that, you're just having a spat with reality; and that's a tough fight to win ;) Cyber_Akuma Actually, what do you think would lose them more profits, the theoretical minority OF a minority that MIGHT rip movies on their phones (which still requires a Netflix account in the first place) or blocking that 25% minority? Also, drop this "right" nonsense. No, seriously, drop it right now. People are paying for a Netflix account, they DO have a right to get the service they paid for. Netflix made zero warning or mention of this impending block, they pulled it out of nowhere for paying customers. So sorry, but they DO have a right to the service, since they are paying for it. Sony was found to be legally in the wrong when they removed the OtherOS feature from the PS3, because why? Because people PAID for the console when it had that feature, they DID have a right to what they paid for. You're just having a spat with arguing for argument's sake when you don't even have an argument. Jimk4003 There is no argument; it's the reality of the situation. Netflix have implemented DRM controls that block access to the Netflix app via the Play Store on rooted devices. I do understand why Netflix want to tighten their DRM procedures, and I do understand why some people have been left frustrated by this change. The reality is, however, if you want to download the Netflix app via Google Play, you will need an un-rooted phone; such as the phones used by the majority of Android users. That's all that's happening. I get that you don't like it. But stamping your foot and shouting 'no fair, no fair' achieves nothing. Netflix are entitled to run their business how they see fit within the law; and consumers get to choose whether they want to give Netflix their business or not. That's all there is to it. Don't like the way Netflix do business; don't give Netflix your money. Cyber_Akuma All you are doing with the "it is what it is" argument is just repeating what the article is saying. That is not conductive to anything. Anyone who has read the article knows what is happening right now. And sorry, but you are doing the same stamping your foot with the "well, it is what it is" argument. Not to mention that you are also wrong, because over the last 5 or so years ALONE there have been dozens of examples of consumers speaking out against policies or DRM and the companies begin forced to reverse it from the backlash. So you are doing nothing but hurting legitimate users by trying to argue "it is what it is". And again, no, they are not entitled to run their business in a way that without warning locks customers out of what they paid for, Sony tried this... and got in legal trouble and lost. So sorry, but you are wrong, and you have been nothing but wrong this entire argument. Netflix isn't' "entitled" to do this, people DO have a reason to complain, there IS a reason to complain, complaining HAS changed such practices before, and all you are doing is further hurting legitimate users by attempting to insist the "it is what it is" non-argument. Your entire argument has been fundamentally wrong from the start. Jimk4003 It's not my argument; it's simply Netflix's position. I get you don't agree with it, but it's totally valid for Netflix to wish to strengthen their DRM procedures. You do know I'm not responsible for Netflix's decision making, right? It is what it is; I wouldn't get too upset about it. Cyber_Akuma Again, "it is what it is" is not a valid argument. Jimk4003 No it's not an argument. Again, there is no argument necessary; the reality of the situation is self-evident, and no amount of arguing here will change it. The fact is this; YOU rooted your phone. You weren't forced. You should have known that by rooting your phone you are modifying the device beyond its factory specification. You should have known that this essentially makes you responsible for the proper operation of the device; you no longer have the device manufacturer or Google to turn to when software that you have modified doesn't work as expected. You should also have known that rooting prevents a device from complying with the compatibility test suite, and that this can affect your devices ability to function correctly. You should have been aware of the SafetyNet API, and anticipated the fact that this API would be adopted more and more broadly as Google promoted its usage. You can't blame Google for this; as before, once you modify your device beyond its factory spec, you're responsible for supporting yourself. Rooting a device is at the owners risk. You've now found yourself in a situation where a modification you have made to your device prevents you from accessing a service you want to use. That's on you; no-one made you modify your device, no-one said they would take responsibility for the changes you have made to your device, and rooted users are expected to assume liability for any ramifications and complications they face as a result of their decision to modifying their device. Netflix are well within their rights to enforce DRM on their product by using the SafetyNet API provided by Google, and the Google documentation clearly states rooted devices will fail the CTS check. This documentation is publicly available. You went ahead and rooted your device anyway. That's on you. It's no-one elses job to make sense of the decisions you have taken. You're free to carry on using Netflix if you return your device to a state where the integrity of the device can be verified. Or you're free to carry on using a rooted device and living with the compromises that entails. Your choice. Cyber_Akuma I don't think you get it. All you are doing is parroting what the article is saying. Furthermore, despite there being plenty of examples of complaining doing EXACTLY what you claim it cannot do, that is to change such decisions, you keep repeating that "complaining will do nothing". You are a broken record, arguing the same "it is what it is" argument over and over so you can avoid actually thinking. An argument (and yes, no matter how much YOU stomp your feet that it is not, it IS an argument) that has already been disproven over and over and over. You also ignored that there are many countries where phones are already sold rooted, or how such things don't effect using such services on a PC with admin rights which are the same thing, or the dozens of other holes in your logic large enough to sail a ship through. There is no "you should have been aware" because this is a total lapse in common sense and my device is in no way incompatible from a hardware or software level, but rather, the app is purposely rejecting it. Furthermore, they made no prior warning whatsoever. This is like arguing "you should have known modern cars could be remotely disabled" if a dealership decides to just disable all cars with an aftermarket radio installed. I don't know where to even begin with all the broken wrong logic in that last post. Why are you even here if you couldn't care less? You are free to carry on being a living example of "First they came", but don't come crying about how nobody else is listening to you because you could not possibly be any more wrong. I DO have a right to use Netflix on my device, rooted or no, if I am paying for it. If you argue against this, you are wrong. People DO have a right to root their devices, if you argue against this, you are wrong. People DO have a right (and have many many MANY times in the past) to challenge the "it is what it is" status quo, if you argue against this, you are wrong. And I know you WILL argue against this, which will mean that, see above, you are wrong. I have been more than patient with your insane thick-headnedness. At this point I can't tell if you are being willfully ignorant or really are just that ignorant. Or just trolling, that is an option as well. There is no way anyone rational at this point can continue to argue the insanity that you have argued. Jimk4003 I interpret personal insults as an indicator that the individual making them no longer has any faith in their actual arguments, and so I think it's time to call time on this particular discussion. As you've pointed out, neither of us is getting anywhere. It's been fun, but once it starts getting abusive, the fun has to stop. It's a shame, because DRM Vs individual user rights has the potential to be a really interesting discussion topic. I hope you get what you're after; and that the reality of the situation will change to be more in line with what you think it should be. Unfortunately I imagine the situation regarding DRM and rooted devices will only get more restrictive going forward. Take care. Cyber_Akuma You purposely instigate people into losing their patience with you, and then claim "I win because you got angry", especially when the anger is because you were refusing to understand the entire argument throughout this entire mess. My1 even if you dont have any right to access netflix, the whole point of netflix and others is making it easier to use those than to do piracy but when netflix goes around branding the rooted users as pirates and blocking them, they sure arent helping their purpose. especially if netflix is (I dont have it so I didnt try) runs on VGA and DVI Screens (no HDCP) where you can just capture the stuff. I mean it's say same withz Bluray Playback on PC, in addition to needing a Bluray Drive, you need an HDCP Compliant Graphics card, bus encryption, and HDCP compliant Monitor, and not to forget You Piece of PowerDVD which you have to upgrade (aka buy again) every few years because the older versions dont get Key Updates. and then we have stuff like unskippable trailers and all the other bluntly said Bullshit when dealing with that. of course Piracy is easier, just download the file and play it on any device you want, no internet and nothing required and no problems. My1 and even if one piece of software wont run in an Admin account, with LUA even on Admin they arent having and privileges unless you kick in the UAC, and to top it, even if the app wont be running if I force it as admin, and only runs with active LUA concept, I can still run anything else as admin and screw the other software running as normal user over (cheatengine is the perfect example for this) Richard Markert Root is, by definition, unsecure. Any time you have userland processes that have access to ring0 you are inherently unsecure, as there are no restrictions placed upon running code at that point. Cyber_Akuma And yet, there are ways to run it securely on PCs. Netflix and online banking would not be available on PCs if it wasn't. My1 well but from another side, root can also be used to just patch any holes that were there. actually happened a few times before. My1 banking apps dont have a reason for a root check if they are done properly, i.e. TANs are generated with an air-gapped extra device. TANs on the phone are in general not safe and if the TAN is able to be generated offline, someone could use an exploit to root, steal the secret for TAN generation and boom, it's over. and dont even start thinking about sms-TAN, it's even worse. also when I just want to look into what my account is doing, I am not happy when I cant do so. My Bank (Hypovereinsbank) more or less recently blocked root and well I just RootCloaked that thing into oblivion and can do my stuff. but I'll probably change anyway since they sadly have no good way of TANs (just paper-based list-TANs, SMS and app) TedPhillips mostly agree. by providing a turn-key 'lockdown' check, and further by ret-conning it into playstore access (let's see how far they take that) -google is now openly hostile to anyone who bought into android for it's ability to customize and truly 'own' your own device. the open source roots of android was a big differentiator vs something like iOS, but now that they have dominate market position - they are walking away from that without concern. (only worrying about how slow they need to boil the frog to get away with it) meanwhile, what middle manager is going to say 'no' to adding safetyNet checks in their app or play store listing? it is an easy way for them to write down on potential risks, unjustified (which it pretty much always is) or not. blindexecutioner So the solution is to install from outside the play store. That's great for security. Way to go. Richard Markert No they don't. Since Windows 7, new and default users are not Admin accounts. koiulpoi Sorry, this is absolutely wrong. The first user created on a Windows PC has full administrative access, limited by UAC. You can still delete System32, it's just mildly harder than it used to be. If "new and default users" were not Admin accounts, they couldn't install software, so... Richard Markert Default user accounts are higher than Limited accounts, but not as high as Admin accounts. That's why they can install software. Linux users are not admins but can still install software, right? It started on Windows 7, expanded in 8/8.1 and now in Windows 10 a user account behaves just like a user account in Linux. It has no access to %systemdir% unless you manually go in the folder properties and give your user account Admin permissions to it. You can still run things AS admin by giving the permission at runtime, but since all that requires is pressing a button (if your built-in admin account isn't passworded, which it isn't by default, one step forward two back, sigh) and most users are too "stupid" to simply not press that button. koiulpoi It's really funny when people speak authoritatively about something they're so wrong about. The first account created by the Windows OOBE is automatically added to the Administrators group. This means they're an Administrator. They have Administrative privileges. The fact that certain actions are blocked until you click "yes" on a simple UAC prompt doesn't stop this; they're in "Admin Approval Mode", which can be disabled via GPO if you care to. If you buy a computer from Dell (example), set it up, then go to System32 and start deleting .dll files, it'll ask for administrative privileges, but you can click yes and away it goes! Some files are protected at "SYSTEM" level, which is higher than administrator, but DEFAULT USERS ARE ADMINISTRATORS. This has ABSOLUTELY nothing to do with the "password" on the built-in "Administrator" account. That account is disabled out-of-the-box. Please, you're digging a bigger hole trying to look "right". How to prove this: Set up a new computer. Set up user default for MS. Start -> Run -> netplwiz -> Be amazed that your user is part of the group "Administrators". TechGuy22 Haha kodi Doesn't matter to me I Stopped paying for Netflix long time ago. C64 Haha Teranium TV 😎 TechGuy22 I like that too. You can even get the mod one and remove the ads. Lol C64 I know, i always use those. I want to pay for the dev, but there's no option to do that. Koko time is coming with a big update to tim242 Thief. Renato Santos This is stupid. Congratulations, Netflix. Jan-Lk Else It is also getting more and more necessary to unlock / root devices due to missing updates etc. But I'm not a Netflix customer and won't become one. C64 Whahaha, this has to be the most retarded move of the year in any category (even Trump can't top this). I'm glad i don't use Old Crap Flix. A Person Hillary, then Netflix. C64 Nope sorry. Since Trump is your president i can't take America serious anymore A Person Timeout, you're not even a US citizen? No interest in your opinion. James F Wow. Just wow. I can't take you seriously either if that's how you treat people. Not cool, man. A Person "Wow, just wow"? When he can vote in our elections I'll take his opinions of our elections seriously. It is highly ill-informed anyhow. Paul Sterling A person wins! Marcelove Timeout, you are a Trump supporter? No interest in your opinion (neither anyone smart in the world). Roy Riddex Just so I'm clear on this, by unlocked are we talking about SIM unlocked? lomsha No no, unlocked bootloader. Roy Riddex Thanks Corbin Davenport Unlocked bootloader. pbergonzi I wonder how long they'll stick with that premise seeing as how much public opinion expressed here is against them. Screw them. Get the APK somewhere else or install magisk and hide your root. Too many people root their devices and have a good reason for doing so and Netflix should not penalize them. Doby Gillis Dude, normal people don't give a fuck about rooted phones. It's just the elitist twats who do it anymore. twiz0r Dude, you're an elitist twat. Richard Markert Most people who root seem to be. The sentiment among rooters is "if you don't root your phone, you're not as good as me and don't deserve to have a phone. Root you stupid noob!" twiz0r thanks for confirming your twatness. good day. C64 One word ..... Bullshit Corey Kinard I've yet to see that... Maybe you just feel like that because they do in fact know more than you? Richard Markert My first version of Android was 1.5. I've seen it for many years. How long have you been in the scene? My1 well at least a rooted phone is objectively better than a non rooted one, but relatively and subjectively speaking, if a non-rooted phone is good enough for someone then let it be so. EowynCarter My phone isn't rooted. And not compatible anymore ! Franco Fassio Unlocked bootloader maybe? EowynCarter Yes. But seam I can't lock it without wipe. So screw you Netflix. Marcelove Let me guess, your profile pic is that right? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0f0c4f3e3ce40074aebfe58d80511d4a0b7d4a94896ce54d82e448a1cd2e3ceb.jpg bruce lancaster Dude. It isn't just rooted phones - Also unlocked. Elitists get their iphones and galaxy s8s from att and verizon. Normal people get their devices from amazon, ebay, newegg, gearbest etc. Jimk4003 I'm sure Netflix are terrified that the tiny fraction of Android users who come to this site, and the similarly tiny fraction who root their phones, are bothered. The rest of the world won't care. bruce lancaster An article in Wireless Week (cellphone industry rag) a couple of months back says it's now a majority of phones in Asia that are unlocked and Europe is getting pretty close to 50/50. US passed 30% unlocked around Christmas. People aren't getting their phones from ATT, Verizon, etc any more now that they have to pay full retail and don't get a free or heavily discounted flagship device with contract renewal. They are getting them from Amazon, Gearbest, Newegg, etc and moving their sim. If I owned stock in Netflix right now, I'd sell it quick on this news. Everything that isn't already mobile is going mobile. Alienating half the European market and 30% of the US market is asinine. Fedup Yup. Ditched my flagship Samsung phone for a 'budget' Moto G5 Plus that is 100% compatible with all four US carriers (and their dozens of MNVOs). Swapping providers is as easy as changing the sim. And despite the slower spec'ed hardware, the carrier bloat-free Nougat is WAY faster than my TW Galaxy phone - and the battery life is INSANE. C64 Probably 90 % of the people don't know what root is. Almost every person I know owns an Android device, but i'm the only geek who flashes and roots his devices bruce lancaster It isn't just rooted phones but also unlocked phones. Got your phone on amazon? Got it on ebay? Got it from gearbest? Got it from newegg? Yup. No netflix for you without jumping through enough hoops that you'll actually know about rooting by the time you get it done. Fedup Are we conflating a carrier-unlocked vs. bootloader unlocked phone? They are two distinctly different things, and I doubt that having a carrier-unlocked phone (i.e. using a TMO phone on ATT, or VZ on Sprint) has any impact on SafetyNet or Widevine. pbergonzi Judging from the posts here it looks like nobody who roots their phone uses Netflix anyway so I guess it's moot. But the outcry sure did get them a bunch of free publicity. T4rd This is what Magisk is for. Pretty sure if I can still use Android Pay with my rooted 6P, I can still use/update Netflix through the Play Store. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Magisk still requires that you unlock your bootloader, which is enough to trigger safety net these days, so that won't work. TechGuy22 You don't know how magisk works do you Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I understand that Magisk is a great tool for modifying my system without actually modifying it. I understand that there are many modules that allow you to do things like hide root, bypass security modules, skin your system, and plenty of other things. What I don't understand is how you can install magisk without unlocking your bootloader. Back when I originally tried it out with pokemon go, it worked well for a while, but eventually even just having my bootloader unlocked was all it took to throw SafetyNet. If that's not an issue anymore, then great! But maybe say that instead of being snarky. Thomas Gladdines Bootloader can be simply locked after rooting and installing a custom recovery. Edwin O. Lol no You could, but then you can't flash anything with said recovery... So no point Thomas Gladdines LOL the recovery doesn't stop working after a bootloader is locked, only fastboot won't flash images but the recovery can do whatever it wants to, update the rom, edit system files etc. Thomas Gladdines That's nonsense, the recovery works fine with or without a locked bootloader. Only fastboot won't work but that's only needed when you don't have a custom recovery to flash images. Muzzy996 Well as an example for the Google Pixel: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=71901761&postcount=454 In this case all it takes is a kernel that supports Magisk and hides the fact that the bootloader is unlocked, at which point with Magisk Hide enabled all root and SafetyNet checks pass. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Excellent. I'll have to look back into this then, last time I used magisk it wasn't as capable, glad to see it's come this far. sbeaulieu Magical Hide is there for that Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Can Magical Hide hide that my bootloader is unlocked? Serious question, not being sarcastic or snarky as I was below. sbeaulieu It does make the SafetyNet check pass iJeggu Magisk itself doesn't hide an unlocked bootloader it only hides root but must custom roms simply delete the verifiedbootstate -flag which in turn makes safetynet pass even with an unlocked bootloader. Some older devices don't have this flag in their kernels in the first place so safetynet will accept that the flag is missing. Link to the patch that most custom roms (kernels to be specific) have to pass safetynet: https://github.com/sultanxda/android_kernel_oneplus_msm8996/commit/abc05b16bbd33521c2fffaf491c5657a94bfcfc5 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5b1ff3f47e32d5f57ddadcd650a5b94725bd4e6242cea92e269f51e988d0d426.png T4rd Except it's working for me right now... jonzey231 This has been happening for a week now. I tweeted it to Ruddock a few days ago. Just didn't put together that it was because I was unlocked. https://twitter.com/jonzey231/status/862122438125072384 steelew Google really needs to start stealing from the root community the way apple takes from the jailbreak community. It feels like rooting is way down except for a few (legal) use cases. If it weren't for visual tweaks & usability tweaks, I would have no need to root (personally). This kind of stuff starts to make rooting unpleasant. I already can't use fingerprint auth in my banking app any more because root. Jesús Cuenca They do. I used rooms for like 8 years maybe? And a lot of the "new features" always come of the rom or root comunity. Right now i use roms, but not root. Marcelove I'm trying to stay indoors, but is complicate... Greenify for example, works at no root devices nowadays... But is way better with root and Xposed... Doze can't compare against Greenify... Maybe at version number 20 root wouldn't be necessary... Sandeep Raghuraman What about the version downloaded from Amazon app store though? Does that work fine? TwoBit Gary It worked, but it is old version without show downloads. Go to apkmirror oculairmedia Interesting move. I flashed a custom ROM on my Nexus 6 because stock was so slow that it was getting unusable, but screw me right ? Atoqir In my country lots of stuff doesn't work on unrooted devices. My bank app, payment app and local cable TV and digicorder app all stopped working. Also s-health doesn't work anymore and soon Netflix. Time to unroot Marcelove "Time to unroot" Sheep. Richard Markert Rooting is insecure. You don't need to access the system partition except to break things. Benjamin Walburn If that were the case then this wouldn't be an issue. Nobody is looking to break their phone. Richard Markert Few people I've talked to online know what they're doing when it comes to root. Most of those end up breaking things. Rooting is far too easy and probably shouldn't exist at all. Benjamin Walburn You could say the same about anything, not just modification of phones. Maybe you shouldn't own a car if you can't fix it yourself, or have kids if you aren't a doctor. Rooting isn't easy, it's made easy by the hard work of other people. It's not up to you what other people do with their property, you have no right to say that they shouldn't. And if someone breaks their phone, what does it have to do with you? It's their hobby and their phone. You're not their daddy. senoredusty Or use Magisk DJMix No need. You could use magisk su hide for the moment. it still passes the safetynet. I too use a banking app that cannot be used on normal root proocess faceless128 "please stop giving us money and use Kodi instead" Sounds like a great business plan! JD For the sake of Kodi's developers don't say Kodi in that context. ericshmerick Hrmm, every time I hear Kodi, I think of pirated content. Guess when people are like "I use Kodi for my 30TB media collection" I stop and wonder how... Yes, ripping a lifetime of DVDs, but nah. Probably piracy. C64 I know a few how really use it legally Powsniffer0110 Yea I use it legally 95% of the time. ErectBipedal nah man, I use Kodi to browse my 30TB of linux isos. Totally legit I swear. Chazz Matthews Torrents are legal too. Just depends on the content. Mike Honestly though, if pirate add-ons wern't available on kodi, 98% of the people using it now would not have even heard of it before. Even bad publicity is good publicity. They are not going to publicly come out and say it, but the add-on's are the only reason they're well known. Andy Roid But kodi makes piracy so easy! Blian Oh god, please stop. Nobody is using Kodi for their DVD rips. Railwayman I rather say Fusion and Exodus et al instead since Kodi is... Kodi and you have to install what you want. The Netflix business plan is for her more people on Exodus, Phoenix and SALTS - not to mention Terrarium TV and MovieBox as well. Kevin Strident Kodi is open source. If Kodi stops wanting to be as useful as it is now, someone will fork it and keep it doing what its users enjoy. cbstryker Kodi is just an open source media player. To watch any pirated content you either need to download it or install an unaffiliated plugin that streams from pirated sources. C64 Next kodi wil have drm build in. So people have to use forks. I stopped using kodi since i found Teranium TV. cbstryker That makes zero sense. Kodi's reason for existing would stop. C64 That's BS my friend, Kodi (xbmc) has started on the original xbox and was made and used as a media player My1 actually it depends on how the build the DRM, if it's made to be only active when you are for example streaming netflix and does nothing for local content, which for sure can be legal (e.g. ripping DVDs in finland is no problem because CSS is not considered an "effective" protection method ever since 2007) although if the DRM would be everywhere it wouldnt be funny. Justin D Same...but with Plex and something else >.> Dany Lol I know right? I was using Kodi more than Netflix anyway so... Dmitry Stepanushkin Xposed + RootCloak or something similar will do it for most of apps for those who need root. So I think not a big problem. Abhishek Saral Not a big problem but a big annoyance. tehboogieman Hmm, rootcloak isn't working for me with netflix m477 No, it won't work. Safetynet always fails if you have closed activated, or if you just have an unlocked bootloader. Sometimes even by just having adb debugging turned on. My1 debugging is a joke right? If it's not WHAT ARE THEY DOING? I mean debugging is a core part of developing and any developer probably has it active m477 I've only seen it working like that once, so it might be an isolated case. Kan☆n MagiskSU and its manager app comes with a very good hider built-in. No Xposed needed. h4rr4r Beyond pointless. Netflix won by being easier than piracy, this threatens to turn back the clock on that. Lexster These companies don't seem to get that most people pirate because it's easier/cheaper than buying what they want. Yes, it's wrong, whatever, the point is streaming services made it easier for people, which outweighed the hassle of pirating it. You're right, this kind of thing is what will get people to start doing it again more. BobButtons If I can't use Netflix on my rooted phone, it's Netflix that'll go, not the root. They're encouraging piracy. Actually l like bezels Why? What do you get with root? BobButtons Primarily for system level ad-blocking. None of the non-root options can even compare. I refuse to allow ads when they have the ability to fill the entire screen and vibrate the phone. Even with being able to block ads, I still purchase the ad-free option of apps I support. YaKillaCJ Exactly. Screw it, I only have Netflix for convenience. This will also have negative impact on many devices and average consumers even if they never unlock or root. A lot don't have Google certification, such as upcoming OEMs. Then theirs beta roms like Xiaomi and OnePlus that run awesome. Marcelove Funny thing: I was about to become a subscriber of Netflix after seeing House of Cards by PirateBay but now through the official channel because I thought that Netflix deserved my money... Look : deservED... But this movie will keep me at PirateBay... Funny thing 2: I have a Moto G5 that I could unlock and root and I didn't it just because I wanna see how things are nowadays without root... And I use a lot of apps that would work better with root (Greenify for example)... So I would be able to use Netflix... And I won't and will stay that way only because this douchebag move... Congratulations Netflix... Funny thing 3: So happy that I waited till House of Cards release to become a subscriber... Netflix should learn something from Frank Underwood... And from Blockbuster... tim242 Yeah, sure you were. Once a thief, always a thief. koiulpoi This is the most untrue statement I've read on this website. Thomas Elephants can fly 天地人 http://gadling.com/2012/06/10/airline-transports-herd-of-african-elephants-photos/ koiulpoi Nice! You matched it. 天地人 Yes, because illegally pirating from huge corperations which constantly attempt to and successfully brainwash people into agenda using various tricks, is somehow bad? You're not supporting the creators of the show, sure. But you're also not supporting the 6 Jewish companies that control 90% of American media. Anyways, with your little money you wouldn't be benefitting anybody. Do you honestly think those Jewish companies are dying to get a hold of your $120 you payed for Netflix this year? Probably not. The creators of the show, are well off anyways. Don't companies pay them to have their content on their platform and pay for their production cost and wages? Then; they've already been payed. I'm not endorsing piracy. It isn't the best thing to do, but I think calling people a "thief" and grouping them with people who have actually stolen things off individuals which mean a lot to the individual and murdered some individuals in the process, is just stupid. It's not the same as 'stealing' bits of 1s and 0s. Again, I'm not endorsing piracy, however there are a lot of good reasons to pirate movies and TV shows. Paul Sterling You're a thief. People leave their families for months to give you works of art. Games, movies, music. You can't throw them a few bucks? I'm legit, always will be. Also, tax helps everyone. Your wall of text is just trying to convince yourself, thief. 天地人 Nope. A thief is different from a pirate, besides, they've already been payed. And I was talking about TV shows and movies, but you're too dense to realise it. jj14x Not the same. If I spend time writing code for software, and decide to sell a monthly license instead of a perpetual license, that is my choice. Your choice should be to either subscribe to the monthly license, or to find a competitor software to use instead. Choosing to bypass the licensing checks makes you a thief (taking something without the owner's permission makes you a thief). And same logic applies to TV shows/movies. If you want to own the movie and watch it whenever you want it, BUY it. "illegally pirating from huge corperations which constantly attempt to and successfully brainwash people into agenda using various tricks, is somehow bad?"<-- YES - it is still illegal. Just because somebody stole your car doesn't mean you can go and steal that person's car in retaliation. There are laws and procedures on how to handle that. STDog Illegal != bad, legal != good. Thousands of unjust laws have been passed. They made actions illegal that were not bad. My1 well yeah if you actually bypass the thing you are a pirate (not a thief because stealing != illegal copy) but branding people pirates and making the software refuse if something that MIGHT be used for piracy is on the device isnt not better. 天地人 Theft is when I take your bike and it's gone and you do not have a bike anymore. When I pirate, are you losing your software or your right to sell your software? Plus, if you actually developed software, I'd probably pay for it since you aren't some big corporation. Richard Markert It's trickle-down, man. Think about if everybody thought like you. Netflix has 100 million subs and each pay at the minimum $107/yr and that's 10.7 billion. Now if that 10.7 billion were wiped out in an instant, how is Netflix going to make new shows or seasons of existing shows? It's the same with the rest of the content creation business. You and me, we're just a drop in the bucket when it comes to their revenue, but instead of scooping it out a spoonful at a time while adding water by the cup, somebody dumped the bucket over, there would be no money left to pay the content creators before content is even made. 天地人 Of course it depends on what you're watching. The same ideology cannot be applied to everything. Railwayman I guess you like DRM and proprietary vendor lock in? The only moral of the story is: Pay for legit services then and watch posted content - the creators get paid and you get proper content without restrictions. The day the industry realize that DRM, geo blocking and so forth are counter productive will be historic. My1 well I would and I do give my money for legal media consumption when possible but when some things have region locks, meaning I cant import them or other stupid Ideas like Netflix not doing rooted devices, I certainly wouldnt like giving money for something I cant use. My1 not really. I have streamed and/or downloaded stuff in the past (coz not available here) just to buy their blurays years after when it finally came to germany Fedup Love my Moto G5 Plus. Best phone I've had so far - and that's coming from a number of Samsung flagship phones. It's so much snappier and the battery life is insane. I waited a full 48 hours before caving and unlocking/rooting. Haven't looked back. I hate ads, and w/o root, you can't miracast to anything other than chromecast. Trysta Noticed this a little while ago. The crazy thing is I'm not even rooted or interested in any mods. I needed to sideload the latest version 7.1.2 because my RMA Nexus 6p refused to update on its own. I'm keeping the bootloader unlocked so I can recover if my phone boot loops. I rarely use Netflix on my phone but this is kind of annoying. I suspect this has something to do with offline movie watching (which is amazing). jj14x You don't need to unlock bootloader to sideload the full OTA images that Google publishes on their website. Tim Harman But you do need it to recover in your phone bootloops, as he said. jj14x True, but by that logic, everyone should keep their phone's bootloader unlocked all the time (because a bootloop, in theory, could happen to anyone/anytime) - not just when flashing a factory image. My1 but doesnt the actual unlock wipe everything? EowynCarter You don't ? Had to when installing a developper preview. Then I left it that way, so I won't be locked out in case of boot loop. TedPhillips or when you have some random block on disk get corrupted, ala nexus 9. ilovetesla Dumbest blocking I've ever heard Bruce Wayne I stopped rooting ages ago. Android has gotten so good that I don't need it anymore. Muzzy996 Good for you! Not everyone feels the same though, I know I sure don't. Tasker, Adaway, Greenify, Titanium, Substratum and GMD Gesture Controls are all more important to me than Netflix. The day Netflix stops working on my rooted devices (which are what I watch it on, not my TV) is the day I'll cancel my service. No big loss compared to losing root. Richard Markert Tasker is interesting but never felt the need for it. Adaway, titanium are both irrelevant on my S7, I despise gestures beyond simple swiping in the Cardinal directions, and if stock Android is so perfect why do you need to theme it? C64 I have a s7 edge and the stockrom is full of bloatware from Microsoft, Sansung and Google. More than 20 useless apps are included. So yes the s7 needed root. tim242 Wrong. Package Disabler, no root required. Richard Markert No, it doesn't. Everything not necessary for function is disableable. C64 You can't disable everything Muzzy996 Never said android is perfect, if it was there wouldn't be any competition in the market or users such as myself who feel the need to customize Android. Root is not something I push onto others, its just something that I want on my devices and I make choices about what services I use or devices I purchase based upon my ability to do it. Railwayman I take that you like ads, then? Using a non-rooted Samsung without Taller would be like using a feature phone again but with ads. Having an automated device without ads and bloat is certainly a basic requirement to me. Richard Markert Adhell and Disconnect pro. What's an ad? Railwayman I don't see any ads on my Ericsson GF388 either. Don't have to install a single piece of software in order to get there. Ericsson win, Samsung loose.:) Your Samsung still has Google ad services and so forth running even if you are blocking them on the "non root level". My devices are completely ad free with Google ads disabled system wide and in all apps. Samsung loose every time even if their followers are trying to find different "non root methods" to "solve" things that other devices do without any issues due to... root. kostas110 maybe if you use some 500+ euro smartphone from 2016-2017 something that not everyone can do C64 I disagree, Android is one big advertising if you don't use root. Apps have ads (not every app has a pro version), internet browsing sucks without Adaway (build in ad blockers in browsers aren't great), YouTube really sucks if it isn't modded (watch a 30 second ad for a 3 minute movie). And devices are full of bloatware that can't be removed without root. Even the Google stuff are bloatware (kiosk, movies,music,books etc). I also like to remove alot of system apps and replace them with my own apps that i prefer (file manager, agenda, email, music/ video player) and i really hate duplicate apps on my devices. Also Titanium Backup is important to me. So Android​ without root isn't Android for me. jetscreamer01 I use adguard to block stupid ads in my apps. Now using any commercial apps is enjoyable. Richard Markert Samsung's Internet has the Adblock extension and it literally blocks everything. I also use Disconnect Pro and Adhell for system-wide ad blocking. Titanium Backup I never really used even back when I was rooting phones - it has been replaced 100% by Smart Switch. But then, I haven't needed to restore a backup (except for switching devices) in years, probably because I don't run janky community junkroms. Muzzy996 The only reason you feel that Smart Switch completely replaces Titanium is because you never used other features of Titanium that go beyond what Smart Switch is intended for. Things like shortcuts to freeze/defrost apps, multiple version backups or market management are useful to some even if they're on rooted stock OEM ROMs. They're not must haves for the masses though but some of us do appreciate their usefulness. Cyber_Akuma I hate this response. If anything, I have found far more reasons to root than ever before. Being able to create a backup image and install security/tracking software tat can't just be wiped/uninstalled easily is a big one for example. Captain_Invisible But you don't even need to root to get blocked. Just using a custom ROM or having an unlocked bootloader triggers it.. DJMix I really couldn't understand these kind of stupid moves. I mean I kinda get for an Android Pay or some banking apps to implement these limitations. But seriously, a frickin' streaming app? Afraid they're gonna get pirated? For someone who's going to pirate, they probably could just probably reverse engineer the apk and remove the limitations or basically use older apps. Do they really have some idle engineers that they're forced to implement useless feature? ddevito Guess I'll just pirate it all soon. Their loss. JD Fuck Android If OEMs would fucking provide updates for 5 years I wouldn't need to unlock my bootloader. I'm out. I'll come back when Google fixes this shit. Also fuck Netflix. Back to pirating it is. Christopher Bement My app stopped working on my N7 when I sideloaded 5.0. Got an error when trying to play anything. I went and dropped it back to stock on the latest patch and relocked the bootloader. All working fine now. Too fucking bad, Nougat is fantastic on that device, leaps and bounds better than Marshmallow. tehboogieman Which ROM and which N7 do you have? I still have the stock ROM on my 2013 N7 LTE and have been procrastinating loading an N ROM on it Christopher Bement 2013 LTE version and I was using Nitrogen OS (fantastic and stable ROM). I am now on the latest Marshmallow just so that Netflix will work. tehboogieman As long as I can side load it and sign in I'm still ok. It's a pain, but I'd live with that. But if NF blocks root users from signing in, I'm definitely cancelling and just use one of the very easy pirate apps. Fedup As long as you can side load... Sure. But going from "hidden app in the Play store" to "sideloaded app won't run" is probably on the menu. Wayne Randall I just signed up for Netflix so I could cancel it. I'm part of the group. tim242 You paid them... Richard Markert Hahahahahaha I don't even use Netflix on my phone (screen is too small) so I don't care. But man, the tears and butthurt from the root community is hilarious. Benjamin Walburn You're a very petty child. Richard Markert When something makes me laugh, I point it out. I do that even have a dog in this hunt. I only watch Netflix on my 75" LED TV. I'm just tired of root users smugness. Almost as smug as apple users. Benjamin Walburn You're tired of people being smug in their hobbies, so you gloat about the problems inflicted on them pointlessly? Petty and a hypocrite. Richard Markert What else am I supposed to do to remove the smugness? My name is…. Get a life maybe? Benjamin Walburn Why should you? Is another person's happiness really that painful for you? You already know that they accomplished nothing more than "successfully followed instructions." It seems like your purpose would be better served by targeting that, not just being a jerk. Humbling them is one thing, being an ass is another entirely. tim242 You sound like the petty child. Stomp your foot, becauseyou don't get your way. Benjamin Walburn Not only am I not doing that, I'm not not getting my way, and "stomping​ my foot" is not an example of pettiness. Your wrongness-density is impressive. My name is…. Who beat you as a child? Richard Markert Lol koiulpoi You're on androidpolice.com... making fun of the root community... and unable to see past the end of your nose... Don't you have anything better to do? Richard Markert Actually, no. I read Android police because they have the best coverage of software. koiulpoi I didn't realize I replied to you twice. You're all over this article, with really, nothing better to do, huh? Richard Markert Yeah, I'm bored. I'm probably done stirring shit up anyway, today is water change day on my fish tanks. lomsha Tard Railwayman Are you one of those Samsung Apologists that argue against root and proudly tell everyone about the perfection known as Grace UX... just to install Package Dsabler Pro because... something disturb all "perfectness" of their system? Trying to be an "anti-social elitist" is like proudly use Simple Finder on a Mac and tell everyone that you don't need the regular Finder.;) Richard Markert I use Samsung, but only because it offers the best mix of software and hardware for me. And package disablers are garbage. Railwayman I avoid Samsung like a plague because of Knox 0x1 Warranty Void, Grace UX (TW...) and pretty ugly hardware not to mention the software design, which looks like a cheap toy, both colors, design and all S-This and S-That they preinstall. Don't forget DT Ignite so the carriers can add their share. It is always amusing when the Samsung Apologist proudly claim how good it is to live without root and how "mature Android has become" when they are talking about a heavily modified fork of it. If Samsung could replace Google Play with Galaxy Apps, they would. The only thing restricting them from further modification is the CTS in order to be able to use Play. An unrooted Samsung running Grace? It would be like having a feature phone again. Way too many annoyances and no way of making it more pleasurable since the whole thing is... Samsung. The only area where there are some reminiscence of Android is under the About box. Samsung is a disgrace not to mention a complete parody on the concept of an Android device. Not to mention their followers who recently "spotted" the bezel less display (introduced by Sharp and LG followed by Xiaomi) because... the S 8 got it AND suddenly made it a "requirement". The most kind thing I can say about that brand is this: Samsung is for the Android device and platform what McDonald's is for the thing called food.;) There are way better devices available. Buying a Samsung is like getting a Big Mac (the difference is that the Big Mac buyers doesn't claim its superiority - while Samsung buyers always try to claim how "superior" their devices are). Richard Markert Everything in your first paragraph is purely subjective. I find the design of the Pixel to be ugly, boring and derivative. AOSP design language doesn't appeal to me. I also think Samsung's software suite is better than Google's. My 935U doesn't have DTIgnite, but my 935V does...as does the Verizon branded V20, Moto Turbo2, etc. DTIgnite is a Verizon thing. Bezel less phones are sexy, for sure. That Sharp device was a Sharp device, and the Xiaomi has a CDMA radio so I could use it on Verizon , but just can't justify buying a thousand dollar device from China. It is stupidly gorgeous though. I use Samsung because I like the software design. I like the functionality of the base is and apps, and I like the S-app suite. I really miss my Note 7, and I'll be swapping up to a Note 8 when it's out. Don't get me wrong, Samsung phones have their negatives - chief among them is the fragile design and the screen edge touch rejection sucks ass. But for me, the positives outweigh the negatives. Other phones have bigger negatives for me. No IP68, no uSD card, no wireless charging, no SAMOLED display. Phone preference are always subjective. Somebody will always have a reason to pick one over another. Tell me, if Samsung is a "parody" of the concept of an Android device, what is your description of the perfect Android device? I'm guessing it's the Pixel. Railwayman Pixel is an ugly iPhone clone. The best Android device so far would be something like a Xiaomi Mi Mix running Resurrection Remix or similar ROM or something like a Mi Max but with perfection added through a Snapdragon 835, 256GB storage plus microSDand 6-8GB RAM paired with a 1440p 6.44" display or even 4K. 5000-6000 mAh battery. My Xiaomi Mi Max is excellent but would be even better with the aforementioned hardware (I can't fault is existing hardware but I am taking about a new model). A keyboard flipcover would be a great accessory as well. There are no device yet worthy of the perfect moniker yet but my Max is the best thing so far in my collection beside the Nokia Communicators and HTC TP2 and HD2 and also the Xperia Z Ultra when I do the holistic judgment. IP68? Sony all the way to me if I really insist. MicroSD? No need for a Samsung in order to get it. Yes, Samsung is a kind of a parody of an Android device die to their heavy modifications, restrictive policies, low price /performance ratio, carrier branding and Knox 0x1 Warranty Void. The upcoming OnePlus 5 looks promising - they usually get their things right. MicroSD on that one as well.;) If Samsung make a device without any BS such as restrictions, carrier links paired with good price / performance ratio I would be interested. Let's call it a Note Pro. What I don't like with Samsung are all Apologists making excuses for their policies. I have nothing against them as a company or production. They can make excellent products but their policies stop them right now. It is too much McDonald's mainstream and too little class at this time. Carrier devices are typically too mainstream than the unlocked ones. My1 well knox flag is annoying but I honestly like my Galaxy Note 4 which is the last good Samsung in my opinion becase anything later either doesnt have microSD, doesnt have a swappable batter or doesnt have both (Galaxy S6 for example) but these are 2 very important things and I really like some parts of the samsung rom, although a lot of other parts (e.g. the launcher) are junk and get replaced instantly, also root makes the thing work as I want. and well many non samsung devices use the on-screen navigation bar, one thing I despise after having a horrible experience on my tablet. and (at least outside of samsung) the fiun goes on with removing the headphone jack which is something on my absolute instant KO list for phones. I dont see the point of a digital sound connection on a phone because sound itself is analog by definition and I think the DAC in a multi-hundred euro device is better than in some cheap headphones. and not to forget the features. samsung had many features WAY earlier than AOSP did, which certainly doesnt make it so much better at least from this viewpoint, although aosp is certainly getting better with every version. but even though I like my note 4 I must say that it is by no means perfect. everything is better and worse than others if you put the right requirements in. MadMartigan What are are you, seven? me me A primary reason to root is to run adblock because Google is way too greedy. So the irony, Google's greed means there's less reason to pay for NetFlix. Let me guess... shall we? Google Play Movies still works right...? Oh yes, so long as Google makes their money.... tim242 I block ads with Adguard. No root required. Mike | Homeless On Wheels People still use Netflix? Bit Torrent is your friend. dizel123 Exactly. Everyone should stop using Netflix. Not sure how I'm gonna get the shows i currently watch on Netflix from bit torrent since they won't be made anymore once Netflix is shut down, but at least I'll have my bit torrent friend tim242 Some people like to do things properly. Railwayman You mean - Do it with DRM? You can't buy whatever device you want because a content provider disagree. You can't use the system you want because a content provider disagree. You can't use the app you want because a content provider disagree. I need a lot of apps, ads and limitations for the so called "proper way" . The "improper way" is Samsung free, ad free and bloat free - and I don't need several apps because I have just one or two streaming apps, one media player, one book reader and so on. Fast and efficient system to boot. I think I prefer to do things "improperly". Richard Markert >The "improper way" is Samsung free, ad free and bloat free - and I don't need several apps because I have just one or two streaming apps, one media player, one book reader and so on. Fast and efficient system to boot. *sigh* I bet you think deleting the APKs from /system actually gives you more space in /data, too. Railwayman Perhaps you can tell me the benefit of having Kindle, Kobo and Nook instead of MoonReader for everything. The benefits of having an uprooted system, Netflix, Hulu and a couple of apps for different cable services instead of having just one media center would also be interesting to know more about. When we are at it: Why would I want to use a 3GB+ Samsung ROM when Resurrection Remix are 600 MB and the G-Apps around 340 MB? Richard Markert I dont use any of those. Phones are too small for media consumption. I don't have any video streaming or playback apps on my phone. Nor do I have book readers, but why wouldnt I want Kindle? It's the only way to access the Amazon library... Oh wait, I forgot, you do that believe in compensating content creators. Resurrection remix, really? If I put that on my S7 edge, I'd be wiping out half the hardware's capabilities in one blow. No Samsung pay, no edge panels, no pro mode camera, no AOD, no game tools, no GearVR. And im sure none of the little things I've come to expect in my UI, like direct calling and sliding a contact to call/txt. But I can move the clock to the other side of the notification shade, woohoo! Oh and does the installer for RR rom repartition the file system? Because if not, /system will still be 3gb, not 600mb. And on top of that, I'm immediately reminded of iOS when I looked at their screenshots. Railwayman So RR looks like iOS? Interesting. It looks like Android with Material Design on my device. I buy Kindle books but send them through a plug-in since the Kindle app pretty much suck in comparison with MoonReader. Sometimes I also buy from Google Play Books and it is also a trip through the plug-in for them and then into the MoonReader library. You see - DRM is a stupidity that must go way unless they create a device wide scheme so any app can authenticate and show or play back the content. I understand that Samsung phones are too small for media consumption. A 6.44-7 inch display is different - it works comfortably without the heft of a 10-12 inch tablet. Small displays below 6-6.3 inches are just too small. So your listed features of your Samsung are hardware? They certainly sound like software to me. Or do you seriously believe that Samsung use co-processors in their device like Commodore did on the Amiga? I can assure you that your Samsung contain standard hardware with a lot of subcontracted components, especially in the US market where they even use Qualcomm CPUs. Samsung Pay? Why would I use an OEM dependent payment system? My credit cards follow a standard, why should I pick myself into a specific device OEM just to pay? It makes no sense. It is like having a car that only runs on Citgo gas or a 4" Visa card requiring different terminals than my 4.5" MasterCard. Mobile payments will be a thing when a standard are in place. Payment systems requiring me to lock myself into a specific OEM just suck. Edge panels? Don't see the need. Don't like Edge displays with their optical side effects. Flat display or just slight roundness on the edges like the BlackBerry PRIV here. Pro Mode Camera? I prefer to have the Open Camera API so any app can get RAW from the sensor and do their thing rather than locking myself into the default camera app. I prefer Camera FV-5 or A Better Camera etc. The Snap Camera is good too. Always on display? Can set it up on my device but don't see the need when there are things such as Active Display and a lot of other options. Game tools? I don't see any problems with gaming on other Android versions so I just don't see what Samsung can add in this regard. Gear VR? Why would I want to strap my device to my face when there are dedicated VR headsets available for gaming consoles and computers? I certainly prefer to have a full headset rather than using my device as one. Call features? They could be good but carrier calling is old fashioned. I use Google Voice instead and wouldn't consider going back to carrier talk and text. Don't see any benefit with having a phone number tied to a carrier of SIM card. Having more than one for different purposes on the same device without SIM dependency is the modern way. I don't know if RR repartition Samsung devices so you have to check XDA. That brand is probably the worst when it comes to ROMs anyway and a lot of my dislike of them are related to that particular issue. Samsung is nothing more than the Big Mac of Android devices and no Gear VR or Samsung Pay (it is like having a McDonald's Pay) really change anything. A mainstream device with mainstream design with too many round edges and corners not to say fragile, batteries that wear out fast due to lower quality and fast charge (which stresses the cells heavily), a software design looking "something" , bloat ware, carrier BS such as bloat ware and also the price model, Knox and root/ROM restrictions, locked bootloadern - the list goes on and on. Mainstream degenerated art is what Samsung represents. But I know the existence of people who don't believe in freedom of choice other than the freedom of buying their Samsung from their carrier and then happily oblige and reduction imposed to them all the way down to the SIM card dependent phone number and roaming charges when they travel.;) They also consider Samsung Pay to be the best thing ever - a payment system that only work on a particular OEM. It really is like a car that require Citgo gas and is unable to run on Exxon or Esso fuel. Samsung just are the Big Mac of Android devices. There are just nothing "classy" over such a carrier mainstream brand. If you want to know what luxury are? Look at Vertu. Richard Markert A 7" device is too small. My tablets start at 10" minimum , and go to 12" maximum. Content consumption is unpleasant on anything smaller, and I barely watch anything on a display smaller than one of my 24" computer displays. Yes, you're right almost all of them are software features, but they are locked out when you put a junkrom on there. And Samsung Pay? Well, call me when Android Pay is compatible with magstripe readers. My bank still doesn't support Android Pay that I know of, either. GearVR. How shall I put this? Computer VR is currently overpriced - unless you want to go ahead and buy me a $600 headset, a pair of controllers @ $130 each, AND you still need to buy me a $1400 PC to run VR titles at an acceptable framerate, because while my laptop can still run AAA titles at high framerates and 1080p, it can't do VR that good. My GearVR cost me $50, it's a convenience thing, every VR title is locked 60fps, the graphics are "good enough" and I can even take calls from VR with my Bluetooth headphones. I don't care about Google Voice. Or any sort of data-based calling. US data networks are still too unstable and limited. I am pretty much guaranteed to be able to make a call anywhere I can see at least the tiniest bit of 1x signal, but if the data network is gone, or you used all your gigabytes, you can't make calls anymore on your preferred number. A lot of these things you say you simply "don't need" them, and that's how I feel about root. And about pretty much everything you care about. I don't do ebooks, I don't do movies or tv, I barely play basic games. I do listen to a LOT of music though, and yes a lot of it was stolen from when I was younger and stupider and didn't understand that without compensation there will be no content. Oh, and BTW, Knox is a good thing. It's how I have system-wide ad blocking without rooting, and how I can have my Secure Folder. You seriously think Vertu phones are luxury? Classy even! Vertu are tacky, garish and gaudy. "Look at how much money I have." Nothing classy about that ugly diamond-crusted turd. Look, I really don't care what your choices are. I'm glad you have the choice to find a device that makes you happy. But you seriously need to stop acting like your choice is the only choice. It's not. And I hope to god it never will be, because at that point, Android will no longer be a platform that fits my needs and I might as well go to Apple. Because you see, what fits my needs, is a device that provides me with everything I have, out of the box, without having to modify it. Samsung does that. They give me everything I want, and nothing I don't. And when the Note 8 comes out, the S-Pen is going to blast it so far ahead that there simply won't be any other phone in the running, not even the S9. I would still have my Note 7 if they would let me. Railwayman Good that you have your Samsung. Also great that you have your 10-12 inch tablets. I assume you bring them everywhere? Very is easy more elegant than a Samsung. It doesn't mean they are the best but way better looking than a Galaxy 8, which I have been tried and I just don't see any reason to get it because of the way Samsung design things. You like to be locked down to a carrier. Google Voice work perfectly well here without any network problems. If the network coverage is so bad that modern services doesn't work I rather jump to a satellite provider if I really need the ability to call from the middle of nowhere. I wouldn't get VZW and eliminate my device choice site to them being very restrictive about what I am allowed to use. Having a carrier dependent phone number is very... 1996. I just don't accept such a limitation - especially not the thing called roaming. I just switch my SIM card to a local one and continue to receive calls as usual. The beauty of GV. If you think iOS is the way to go if Grace UX would disappear I think you should get the iPhone then. It seems like out of the box is the most important aspect. I just don't know any device that has an out of the box experience even close to my requirements. Samsung is certainly furthest way from them. I just dislike their devices because of their design, software, carrier affiliation and serious restrictions. They just feel like a budget device full of carrier advertisement and bloatware. Richard Markert I disagree with you in every possible way. Yes, I do take at least my Surface 3 almost everywhere. My Z10 LTE goes when I'll want to play games or watch Netflix on a tiny screen with crappy headphones. Vertu: You say elegant, I say gaudy, tacky, trashy and fucking ugly, like most things marketed to people with more money than God and less sense than a cricket. I don't know where you live, work, play or travel, but many times a year I'm driving in places, especially the highways, that will have no data coverage. It's that simple. All your google voice hijinks mean nothing when you have -100 dBm of 1x and the mobile data network is completely unavailable. I can still make and receive calls at that point, because Verizon, but you're shit out of luck because you only give people your GV (interface is barf, btw) number. Oh, and for the record, I just flashed the US Unlocked FW to my S8, so now I have no Verizon junkware or restrictions, like my S7e before it. And yes, at this point in my life, I'm sick and tired of having to do the software developers' job for them. When I was younger I found all that rom cooking, kernel coding, smali editing, adb pushing, su manipulating stuff fun and exciting, but now all I want is a phone with the features that I want that Just Works OOB. I also feel the way you do about stock android. It's design, included software, limitations and style are not appealing. And every phone is "a carrier advertisement", and has always been that way. Until the S8, every phone came with a carrier logo if you bought from a carrier. I get what you want from a phone, I really do. You want a basic device with no features that you can add onto to do what you want. But man, you gotta stop acting like you're the Westboro Baptist Church and Samsung is the homosexual community. derp_cookies So I agree this is a dumb move but everyone is overreacting by threatening to pirate content. This is a niche problem as less people root now, especially since Android pay won't work when you do it. So Netflix isn't any less accessible than it was before. I watch 99% of Netflix at home on my Roku. Luxferro It's not just rooting. My Nexus 6P is running stock google rom, no root, w/ just unlocked bootloader, and netflix is gone in my play store. Not that I watch TV on my phone... but my shield tv is also unlocked... so it's probably just a matter of time. Roh_Mish Dammit Netflix, you make me want to go popcorn time route. My current primary phone and my iPad are what I use to watch netflix and both of them is stock so i don't have anything to worry about but this just feels wrong. Between this and Amazon not releasing the TV app for my sony TV, which they support outside, popcorn time (and in extension piracy) just seems easier. Vivek Rameses This is why we have piracy. Miguel Angel But ...why? occono Distributors want Netflix to stop any possibility of making DRM-Free backups on the content. Railwayman Good luck with that. If it can be played, it can be recorded. As long as the Netflix content is visible somewhere a copy can be recorded so again, good luck with blocking. Mariano Moreira Even more strange is while Netflix app is removed from Playstore, Netflix VR is still.in Playstore. Manually flashing Factory Image for Google Pixel is how I get me OS updates and I choose to leave bootloader unlocked, rather than relocking every month.(which would include full wipe) So I guess they don't care about security for the few users whom might use Netflix VR with Daydream compatible device? tehboogieman I'm not familiar with the Pixel, but almost every Nexus device lets you lock without wiping all your data. Maybe that requires root though, I really don't understand the details on how it works, but hopefully you can find a way to do it. Mariano Moreira To clarify: In order for me to install Factory Image every month, I need to have Bootloader unlocked. Doing the Factory unlock will wipe the device. Locking the device doesn't wipe the device, but Factory unlocking the bootloader will wipe the device. tehboogieman Yeah, sorry I wasn't more specific. I use an app called BootUnlocker. It lets you lock and unlock the bootloader without wiping at will. Since an app can do this, I'm assuming that it can be done via ADB. Also it might only work on older devices, but maybe there's a way to replicate this action on newer devices as well Mariano Moreira I don't understand why Google is promoting Security by having the device fully-locked, yet still relies on ADB fastboot unlock/OEM Unlock commands to flash factory images? saf1927 Why are using factory images when Google provides OTA images too, and these don't require an unlocked bootloader, nor a wipe? Mariano Moreira I am using Factory Images because I can choose to only use Bootslot B this way. Bootslot A on this current Pixel and the 3 before it has the non-working mic and no working headphone jack issue. I hear the issue is resolved on newer handsets, but have not RMA'd this device yet. I need the microphone and headphone jack, so letting the phone do an OTA and move me to Bootslot A is no-go. *I have N2G47O installed on both Bootslot A and Bootslot B, currently. Only Bootslot A has the audio issue even thought the exact same Factory Image is installed. saf1927 Oh, wasn't aware of that. Did it affect all the old devices? I got mine at launch but haven't experienced the issues you describe. Is there a way to reproduce them? I normally either take the OTA or flash the OTA images via fastboot. Mariano Moreira Allegedly only 1% of devices (I just have bad luck, I suppose.) https://support.google.com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsIW_gxTpXX3s/?hl=by I have posts around late November- early December on in that thread about mic/headphone jack issue My 1st device was fine until after the 2nd Update, but I had not diagnosed Bootslot A/B discrepancy. Wasn't until after 2nd Device (1st Replacement) that I have been able to always get Bootslot A to have faulty mic on my replacement devices. My Cousin and his girlfriend both have Pixel XLs. He had a dead Mic out of the box but currently neither his nor his Girlfriend's Pixel XL has mic issue. Even with forcing Bootslot A for a month of testing. I most likely have another faulty device, just this is my 4th Pixel from Google and everything is fine except Bootslot A. jdrch It's not just Netflix. The HDHomeRun Prime app doesn't work on rooted 7.0+ devices either. Jsilvermist Good to know, will no longer recommend Netflix to anyone when I'm asked... James F News flash: when you explain to most normal people why you don't recommend Netflix, they won't care, because it doesn't affect them. D13H4RD2L1V3 This is stupid. I had to root my phone to be able to hide the navbar at any time I want and also to gain better battery management controls and other stuff that I sorely wished Google had added to stock Android way sooner. And I was considering a Netflix subscription. No longer...... Sruly J I know it's not fully a solution which is "worth it", but the app Custom Navigation Bar offers the ability to hide status bar/narbar without root. Although like you said, you had other reasons to root, so... My1 yeah, I do root for theming and stuff, but srsly they literally are throwing oil in the Piracy and DRM discussions with this. Diar I pay for Netflix so I can watch the content any way I want guilt free, whether that's their app or other locations on the Internet. F their VPN blocking and DRM. If they make their app impossible to use, I just won't use it. They'll still get my money but they will lose any data/tracking since I'll still be watching their shows, just outside of their ecosystem. Dummies. ReedSolomon Between the SJW nonsense like Bill Nye, the ipv6 tunnel blocking (rather than simply defaulting to ipv4), increases in price, less and less quality content, and now this, I see little reason to keep paying for Netflix. robogo I understand Netflix' reasons, I really do - they need to protect their property and investment. But I can't really say I understand the way they're doing this. This is a good way to alienate the small percentage of power users who root their devices for various, but perfectly valid and understandable reasons. And no, this will not make me cancel my membership as long as the app works. Cancelling membership is a silly, overblown reaction to what is, in my mind, a minor nuisance. D13H4RD2L1V3 I personally just find it a dumb move. Seems like an easy way out. Dmitri Smirnov > perfectly valid and understandable reasons. And what reason would that be? Preventing people from ripping their content? Doesn't stop them in the slightest, root-detection in circumvented rather easily as well as safety net, we have PokemonGo to thank for that - a lot of people were motivated to crack it and they succeeded. > Cancelling membership is a silly, overblown reaction to what is, in my mind, a minor nuisance. Cancelling membership is valid form of feedback to the company, that trying to tell it's customers that they are not allowed to own their device that they paid their money for, if they want to watch a movie. robogo You misunderstood, it seems. A perfectly valid and understandable reason to root one's device would be, e.g. Xposed framework, theming support, tethering, backing up stuff with Titanium Backup, etc. Please read my comment once again. EowynCarter Well, if and when it stops working on my phone, what will be a major nuisance. robogo Agreed. I'll have to find another way then. But I'll deal with that when the time comes. Manbearpig I member when netflix released there app for Android and they did the same thing. I would just download the app and be good to go. After awhile though I stop rooting I miss it sometimes Cyber_Akuma I warned people when Pokemon GO of all things had a surprise update that silently added SafetyNet that this garbage was going to become more and more common. Mario RUN uses it too, and now Netflix.... soon apps everywhere are going to add SafetyNet and block rooted devices as standard practice. Google has been incredibly hostile towards people who actually want to own or have control over their devices or even their PC Software over the last few years. And over the last year google has been making SafetyNet more and more harsh, now even tripping if your BOOTLOADER is unlocked even if your phone is not rooted. Pokemon GO and Mario RUN were a small crowd, but I hope after Netflix of all things starts using it (and make no mistake, this is just the beginning) that people will finally push back against Google's hostility towards rooted users. EowynCarter Yeah. Or I might seriously consider going the iOS way. Though iOS would pose other problems. (Bye paylib) BillPosters I rooted my Android phone to get rid of the annoying camera shutter sound, and to prevent apps from stealing my contacts, and to basically take control of my device rather than letting Google run the whole show, and because of that I can't update Netflix? Good riddance Netflix. iKon I'm pretty sure you can go in the camera settings and take of the camera shutter sound?.... .. In some region-specific firmware versions or certain devices you can't do that. Railwayman There is a better solution: Declare the device a DRM free zone and use everything else. DRM to me is "Don't Restrict Me!" and an excellent reason to give certain companies the middle finger telling them to just go and F themselves. The most ironic thing here is that removing Netflix or using DRM otherwise doesn't stop piracy. On the contrary - By buying and using DRM content you get to travel in the cargo hold with no heating while the pirating consumer get first class service: more content, no restrictions, no copyright trailers or ads before the movie start and stop on. Even better: They can use whatever apps or ROMs they want. Would I unroot my device in order to get DRM content onboard? No way!!! If Netflix are so scared - block the client on Mac OS X and Windows et al. Piracy doesn't usually happen with an Android device as a source but rather computers and HDCP rippers. Another thing also to the DRM companies: Everything that can be played back can be recorded! (Good old piracy saying) Netflix out, Fusion with Exodus, SALTS and Phoenix in. Kodi with Rapier skin is much nicer than the Netflix client and Trakt integration make this way a much better one than going down the DRM route, sitting with an uprooted stock ROM and Netflix.;) TechJunkie198 ? netflix isn't scared. the studios require the drm. and netflix isn't concerned with the small percent of users who root their devices. Railwayman Doesn't matter. Go and enjoy your DRM services.;) DRM is a pest and that is why the pirating community offer a superior product. It is easier and more hassle free to just put Netflix where they belong and use Exodus et al or MovieBox or Terrarium TV and so on. To those who now consider unrooting because of Netflix: Just don't - use other services instead. Richard Markert So when everybody takes your advice and uses a service that doesn't compensate anybody in the content creation business, and all the high-quality media is gone, don't go crying about there being nothing good to steal anymore, k? Railwayman Even better: DRM and proprietary vendor lock in are scrapped and replaced by standards. If they want some kind of protection - make it device wide and linked to the account signed in so playback works in different apps - only thing needed is to call the system wide authentication system. I am against DRM and vendor restrictions. Original content without any of the BS is what the world need. Piracy is a symptom of several problematic things such as geo restrictions, root restrictions and the failed idea of the "right of no distribution" - i.e. the content exist but stubborn companies deny distribution using silly arguments. I always remove DRM from purchased content in order to have full control including the basic right of using whatever app or equipment for playback. Richard Markert Start developing the solution, and start a content creation company that can compete with the big boys when it comes to quality content. Or, you can sit around and whine online about the content creators not wanting the people who don't follow rules to play in their gated sandbox and get mad when you crawl over the fence. Railwayman I take that you like DRM and proprietary vendor lock-in. It is easy to avoid the gated sandbox so no need to whine. It is easier to just fire up Exodus rather than relocking the bootloader and flashing a stock ROM or remove SuperSU in favor of Magisk just to be able to get Netflix. DRM is such a waste of time. It's not necessary to develop a new service since the content are available DRM free already. Standards for media and books etc does exist or did you miss EPUB, PDF, AAC, MP3, MP4 and so on? Perhaps you prefer such a format as ZNO or Apple modified EPUB that only works with iBooks? saf1927 Magisk seems to do the trick. Helios What about my non-rooted OnePlus One? It's also listed as incompatible.. '-_- 天地人 Don't OnePlus devices run a custom ROM and have unlocked bootloaders? Android Developer How can they block people who root the device from installing the app? The play store doesn't have this filter. Maybe after the install they do this check? Richard Markert If you're really an Android Developer, you would know that SafetyNet is what's doing this "behind the scenes". Android Developer I'm talking about the article. They say that Netflix blocks rooted devices, and I know that this isn't an option on the developer console. Google doesn't have anything related to rooted devices there. Ezio I have about 200 original blu-ray disks, go to cinema, and I'm Netflix subscriber. Now I won't get app updates (or even worse I won't be able to use it in the future) just because I like to use my custom rom. Thank you. This is really a bad move. AdjustedFlow I thought netflix was about providing a better service than piracy. Now they're literally pushing me back to piracy. What the heck? Dany If for "root" they mean administrator privileges, don't we already have that on windows 10? So why Netflix doesn't block desktop version too? P.S. by the way...whatever man! I was using Kodi more than this crap anyway... Miku is Best Vocaloid This means Netflix won't be getting my business anymore. Paul Sterling No worries here, when you're legit. Take my money, I'm not cheap. Give me a service, I'll pay you. I don't need to rob. What am I? 13 living with my mom using Napster? Naw, grew up. Don't have any Tim foil hats. My wallet grew up too. ast00 This is a dick move that could have been avoided. If they want us to pirate their content instead, we will pirate their content. We tried doing it the legal way, but they didn't allow it. Their problem, not ours. EowynCarter Umf. **checks google play ** No longer compatible with my nexus 6 . But nexus 4 still ok. For crying out loud! I'm not rooted or using a custom ROM. Pyramid Power netflix is just losing money. it's saying to those people, 'go to thepiratebay!' RemiV2 I guess I'll just keep torrenting then. Thanks, Netflix.

Netflix is a client app. If I can, with a rooted phone, fake my subscription, or somehow cause a major security issue, that is not a problem with me, that is a problem with you pushing out a vulnerable app to millions of users. Sure, it would be my fault for exploiting it, but there is no-one but you who managed to put the problem in place. A CLIENT app should not be anything but a front-end representation of an API run by your servers. The CLIENT should have nothing but a CLIENT ID to use with the API. The CLIENT should NOT be able to change JACK SHIT with the API, it should only be able to get search results, get access to encrypted streams, etc. If your client CAN change JACK SHIT (which one could assume is true, since you are so actively hiding your code) then you have a major security vulnerability... This is a problem with your code, not anyone's rooted device... Hell, you don't even need a rooted device to access the applications code, just download an APK of the app, extract it, and decompile it... Jesus netflix, get your shit straight you bendy pos... My1 I think their problem is rather that rooted users *might* be able to capture the decrypted stream using root or whatever and they are afraid of that. although on PC you have admin permissions and netflix has no problems iirc. Linus Monie Yeah, exactly, its not like people will prefer to pirate the stream on their phone (at least I wouldn't...), so that was my first thought of why they made this change. Now that I think about it though, its probably not so much of a Netflix decision as it is a licensing issue with one of their "film sources". (can't think of a better word for it rn..) Licensing issues are a bitch when you need to adapt to as many as Netflix has... My1 yeah true. pirating on phone makes (quoting austin from game theory) NO. GOD. DAMN. SENSE. I mean I dunno whether you can automate that so good and/or get it fast enough, especially with the relatively low storage, no LAN capability and so on. BahnStormer Netflix is used more on tablets and TV boxes, these tend to be used for several years longer than phones and even Google now only updates their devices for <2 years (Samsung / streamer manufacturer's do this even less!)... We HAVE to run the likes of Lineage if we want the devices to be secure! Bye bye Netflix, even Amazon Video lets us use rooted devices! jcopernicus People don't understand IP and lambast a company protecting it. Of course. My1 I have never tried but if netflix can run over a non-HDCP connection like DVI or VGA, there's literally no reason to use a phone for piracy. RemixedCat well they got rid of 5 star ratings, deleted tons of shows I was in the middle of, and the roku app is hella slow and takes 10 freakin minutes to load (by comparison my OS install from power on to desktop was 8 minutes on my samsung 850 500GB SSD!!) Tobi I'm running LineageOS on my Oneplus One to lengthen the lifespan of my device. Why must I be punished for that? I'm going back to pirating content. StankyChikin Possible that the movie industry is pushing this? SkullOne Shhhhh. Don't use logic here. It's not allowed. It's simply easier to blame Netflix and believe that they have a vendetta against the teeny tiny, itsy bitsy amount of root users out there! StankyChikin Forgive me plz lol username_not_valid This isnt about Netflix, its about its content providers. There is this notion that you can copy files and therefore pirate content if you are rooted. We all know its rubbish, Netflix probably knows its rubbish, but that doesn't change anything. If Netflix wants shows, its has to abide by its license agreements. There is really nothing Netflix, Amazon, Sky or any other streaming service can do about it. The fact that almost all pirate content comes from PCs and HDCP by-pass devices doesnt mean a thing. TedPhillips at least in practice, unlocking your bootloader/being rooted has no impact on your widevine support level. now, i'm not sure if the oem could supply a high-level drm library on a pre-rooted device, due to agreements, but modification after the point of sale is a different matter. meanwhile, keep on streaming netflix on your 'rooted' computer - gasp!~ Richard Markert >meanwhile, keep on streaming netflix on your 'rooted' computer - gasp!~ I don't even need an admin account to steal Netflix on my PC. Since the Windows 10 app and browsers BOTH work over analog, all I need is an inline box with a DSUB VGA connector and simply capture the entire output from the VGA port. My1 or use DVI if possible, even better. Valerie Frye-Preter Did they do this because of the stolen season 5 of Orange is the New Black? TedPhillips wasn't that stolen before it was available for streaming? so i don't see how it could be. TedPhillips when the device can be retroactively uncertified, as safetynet mutates over time, that's a step beyond the usual forced obsolescence of artificially short software support windows. now instead of buying a new phone every 18-24 months, it could be literally whenever they feel like moving the goalposts. Mike Hunt I don't understand. I am a Netflix subscriber, but will probably have to unsubscribe now since I bought a rooted Chinese mediabox for my TV. This sucks, as I liked and supported NetFlix's business model. Richard Markert Which box do you have?

Ajmobileguru First DirecTV Now and now Netflix. I dont see the point. As if rooted users were pirating the streams or movies. Rooted users on non-nexus/pixel devices already were getting only 480p because of widewine crap and now this. Anunnaki This is why people switch to apps like Popcorn Time and Terrarium TV. Biga173rd Popcorn time still works? Anunnaki When I last checked few months ago, it was working. No idea about the current situation though. Biga173rd Okay Erin Andrews Oh that's easy, they block my device I cancel my subscription. Say goodbye to my 15 dollars a month. piggynuts Stopped playing Pokemon, stopped using Snapchat, next to go is Netflix. I refuse to say bye to root. BobButtons Magisk. While some say it's hit and miss with Pokemon GO (idk, I don't play it) it's never not worked for me with Snapchat/Android Pay/Mario Run. cliff_dangers Why does everyone freak out about a rooted phone but my PC which is wide open is not a problem? What makes smartphones so special? Doro Manekia ΝετΦλξ Ανάθεμα σου.Χα χα χα Το Μαααακα.

Loco Mole Netflix content isn't that much better these days, so if they choose to distinguish themselves by being a d*ck to consumers who care about using our devices the way we want to, then f u too, Netflix, I got plenty of other legit streaming content. Fedup Let's see... Piracy: $0.00, no ads, no DRM, no device/location/time restrictions Legit: $$$, ads out the as$, DRM limiting options, shows locked to specific devices, locations, etc. Keep on making the decision easier for us, Netflix. xyz Fortunately, the Pirate Bay is accessible from all devices and regions without any geo-blocking. berserksgangr Well, my Nexus 7 with Lineage it's not working even without root (error 9) Nick Riley This is utterly stupid! Corvus Dove Remember that time that making things more difficult for software and media pirates through DRM while possibly messing with legitimate customers paid off and prevented piracy? Me either. Asbjørn The problem here is that most users root their phone to get the updates that their OEM doesn't want to make available. If Android had proper updates, rooting would not be so necessary. Patel Nisha Root user here. How do I use Magisk for this? I have it installed and new to the Magisk(haven't had a rooted phone in a while)? Keletor Does it stop you from sideloading it? I mean really, if you are rooting your phone you most likely will find a workaround. Luxferro Not yet, but you can be sure the app will stop working in the future. Znuff The download feature is not working for me anymore.

The only way I can watch overseas now is using Mediahint.com - nothing else works. Luxferro Just use usenet. They are forcing their legit customers to piracy... DDS This move will not stop people from pirating their content, it will encourage it. Exactly the opposite of what they're trying to achieve. But tell that to the a**hats who control the money... Ubelsteiner And thus, Plex and Kodi become even more popular, as Netflix drives a nail into it's own coffin.

Nick Coad I can guarantee you that Netflix doesn't make these choices willingly. The production companies they purchase shows off are notoriously backward when it comes to technology and unfortunately Netflix relies on them to survive.

McHenryGames Main reason to root is XPosed. Screw Netflix and screw Google. Brian Both my phone and tablet are as they left they left the factory.

These are some of our favourites for when you've got five minutes or five hours to waste. Atari Breakout Image: Screenshot Run a Google image search for "Atari breakout" and you're met with a version of the classic game you can play in your browser. Use the cursor keys as controllers. The classic Google search page Point your browser at https://archive.google.com/heart to relive your youth with the classic Google search page. It still works, but the results page is the modern version. Are you feeling lucky? Click I'm Feeling Lucky on Google with nothing in the search bar and you're given a random Google link to try — it could be anything from mini puzzles to charity drives. Pac-Man Image: Screenshot Atari Breakout isn't the only game that gets a Google Easter Egg spin. The 2010 Google Doodle version of the classic title, Pac-Man, can be brought back with a simple Google search for "pac-man". Search box tricks Image: Screengrab Several Google searches give entertaining results. Some of our favourites? Try entering "do a barrel roll", "google in 1998", "askew", "<blink>", or "sonic the hedgehog." Search box tools These Eggs aren't really hidden surprises, more useful tools. You can run Google searches for "flip a coin" or "roll a die" to do just that, or use "timer" or "stopwatch" for those apps. Solitaire Image: Screenshot You're still after another game aren't you? Typing "solitaire" into Google gives you a web version of the classic card game. If you don't like cards, try entering "tic tac toe" instead. Bacon numbers Every movie star is less than six steps away from Kevin Bacon and Google can help you prove it — type the name of almost anyone followed by "bacon number" to get the link. Search in pirate or Klingon Google knows more languages than you might have realised: you can load up the search results page to display labels in pirate, Klingon or hacker speak, should you need to. The Loch Ness pegman Normally he's yellow. (Image: Screenshot) Search for "loch ness" on Google Maps and the iconic pegman figure turns into the shape of Scotland's most famous mythical (?) monster. No sightings of the actual Nessie, though. Use the Force, Luke Image: Screenshot The Star Wars scroll Easter Egg has come and gone from YouTube, but this one lives on — enter "use the Force, Luke" as a YouTube search to send the results into flux. Brush up on your trivia Knowledge is power and you can get more of it by searching for "fun facts" on Google. When you've absorbed the information, click Ask Another Question for a new fact. Endless dinosaur running If you find yourself without internet on your smartphone, pass the time by loading up Chrome for iOS or Android and tapping the dinosaur to launch an endless runner. Travel by dragon Image: Screenshot One for the Welsh here. If you choose to navigate from Snowdon to the Brecon Beacons and "dragon" appears as a travel option. Unfortunately, no dragons appear on screen. The Emmett Brown pegman You might have noticed this already, but when you view older imagery in Street View (via the drop-down menu in the top-left corner), the pegman turns into Emmett Brown. Cast spells on Android Call up the Google voice interface on Android via "OK Google" and you can cast a couple of Harry Potter spells: "lumos" to turn on the flashlight and "silencio" to mute all sounds.

Business News Home > Business > Business News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 29 May 2017 Apple bringing artificial intelligence to chips Booming field: A man uses his phone as he walks past an Apple store in Beijing. Engineers at Apple are racing to catch their peers at Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc in the booming field of AI. — Reuters SAN FRANCISCO: Apple Inc got an early start in artificial intelligence (AI) software with the 2011 introduction of Siri, a tool that lets users operate their smartphones with voice commands. Now the electronics giant is bringing artificial intelligence to chips. Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way the company’s devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence – such as facial recognition and speech recognition, said the person, who requested anonymity discussing a product that hasn’t been made public. Apple declined to comment. Engineers at Apple are racing to catch their peers at Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc in the booming field of AI. While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice-recognition, competitors have since been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home digital assistants. An AI-enabled processor would help Cupertino, California-based Apple integrate more advanced capabilities into devices, particularly cars that drive themselves and gadgets that run augmented reality, the technology that superimposes graphics and other information onto a person’s view of the world. “Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI,” said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst and co-founder of venture capital firm Loup Ventures. “At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence.” Apple devices currently handle complex AI processes with two different chips: the main processor and the graphics chip. The new chip would let Apple offload those tasks onto a dedicated module designed specifically for demanding AI processing, allowing Apple to improve battery performance. Should Apple bring the chip out of testing and development, it would follow other semiconductor makers that have already introduced dedicated AI chips. Qualcomm Inc’s latest Snapdragon chip for smartphones has a module for handling AI tasks, while Google announced its first chip, called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), in 2016. That chip worked in Google’s data centres to power search results and image-recognition. At its I/O conference this year, Google announced a new version that will be available to clients of its cloud business. Nvidia Corp also sells a similar chip to cloud customers. The Apple AI chip is designed to make significant improvements to Apple’s hardware over time, and the company plans to eventually integrate the chip into many of its devices, including the iPhone and iPad, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. Apple has tested prototypes of future iPhones with the chip, the person said, adding that it is unclear if the component would be ready this year. Apple’s operating systems and software features would integrate with devices that include the chip. For example, Apple has considered offloading facial recognition in the photos application, some parts of speech recognition, and the iPhone’s predictive keyboard to the chip, the person said. Apple also planned to offer developer access to the chip so third-party apps can also offload AI-related tasks, the person said. Apple may choose to discuss some of its latest advancements in AI at its annual developer’s conference in June. At the same conference, Apple planned to introduce iOS 11, its new operating system for iPhones and iPads, with an updated user-interface, people with knowledge of the matter said last month. The company is also said to discuss updated laptops with faster chips from Intel Corp. An AI chip would join a growing list of processors that Apple has created in-house. The company began designing its own main processors for the iPhone and iPad in 2010 with the A4 chip. It has since released dedicated processors to power the Apple Watch, the motion sensors across its products, the wireless components inside of its AirPods, and the fingerprint scanner in the MacBook Pro. The company has also tested a chip to run the low-power mode on Mac laptops. In 2015, Bloomberg reported that Apple’s culture of secrecy stymied the iPhone maker’s ability to attract top AI research talent. Since then, Apple has acquired multiple companies with deep ties to AI, has begun publishing papers related to AI research, has joined a key research group and has made hires from the field. In October 2016, Apple hired Russ Salakhutdinov from Carnegie Mellon University as its director of AI research. — Bloomberg Tags / Keywords: Apple Related Stories Related Stories Apple and Nokia settle patent dispute and sign new deal Apple invests US$200mil in Corning Apple becomes first US firm to top US$800bil value Apple market cap larger than the economies of 45 of the 50 US states Bosch wins IPhone orders in blow to InvenSense You May Be Interested YTL REIT buys Majestic Hotel for RM380mil cash ML Global banks on orderbook to sustain Poor showing at Sudirman Cup costs Vivian-Khe Wei place in world meet Get smart about the idiot box The man who rebuilt this city Racing for a better tomorrow Others Also Read Tax reform draws Indian SMEs into digital economy Cycling for fun helps us bond, says unity advocate More US tourists coming to our shores soon Property Related advertisement Latest News S&P sees no need for an out-of-schedule China rating review Hong Leong Bank Q3 net profit up 14% AirAsia warns of free ticket scam Market to continue range-bound trading Lenovo’s struggling mobile business sets sight on high-end market Most Viewed in Business AirAsia warns of free ticket scam Bank Negara kicks off fintech sandbox Boustead records RM2.38bil revenue YTL REIT buys Majestic Hotel for RM380mil cash Voir Holdings looking to enter construction and logistics Online traders must register with CCM Ringgit opens slightly lower against US dollar ML Global banks on orderbook to sustain Zukri: Islamic banking sector ripe for M&As Foreign buying stretches to 16 consecutive weeks advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo Do you Google? Good news if you're already heavily invested in the Google ecosystem on your iPhone. You can switch to Android in an hour or two and keep your evening free for seeing friends or browsing Netflix. Otherwise, better cancel those evening plans. Those of you who spend all your time in Gmail, Google Calendar and Google Maps for iOS can simply install those apps on your brand new Android device, sign in using your Google account credentials, and pick up where you left off. The same applies for Google Photos and Google Drive. Google Drive can handle contacts and calendars for you. Image: Google Unlike Apple, Google doesn't have a dedicated app to help you defect to its mobile OS, but it does have a website with a lot of the information you're going to need: essentially you're instructed to use Google Drive to copy over contacts, photos, videos and calendar entries, which we'll cover in more detail below. If you're thinking about switching from iOS to Android in the future, or like to swap mobile OSes on a regular basis, then Google's cloud-centric services make the task much easier — so your best off keeping all your data there. By contrast, the only official Apple app you can get on Android at the moment is Apple Music. Messages and emails Extricating yourself from iMessage is perhaps the biggest challenge facing those jumping ship to Android. iMessage doesn't work on Google's platform, and there's no way to export all your message history into a comparable Android app. You're going to have to say goodbye to iMessage, but you can at least ensure a clean break. As soon as you know you're making the move go into your iOS and navigate to Messages in Settings and turn iMessage off, then go to FaceTime in Settings and turn that off too. Apple's full instructions are here. If you have some precious iMessages or plain old SMSes you can't leave behind, you'll need to rely on third-party software and some rather convoluted processes to back it all up. iSMS2droid promises to import messages from an unencrypted backup you made in iTunes on your computer into Android. If you don't need the backup on your phone, then PhoneView (macOS) and CopyTrans (Windows) are two of many tools that will let you browse your old missives to your heart's content. It's goodbye to iMessage. Image: Screenshot As for emails, Apple's system supports IMAP, so you can carry on checking your iCloud emails through Gmail on Android if you're not having a fresh start and giving up your old email address completely. Tap the drop-down arrow on the Gmail app menu, choose Add account, and follow the configuration instructions provided by Apple. It's the same process if you're using any other kind of email app on your new Android device, like Outlook from Microsoft. The only requirement is that it supports the popular IMAP protocol. You have a couple of other options if putting your iCloud account directly into Gmail doesn't appeal. You can have all your Apple iCloud emails automatically forwarded to your new Gmail address, by going into iCloud Mail on the web and setting up forwarding — you can even delete the originals after they're passed on. Alternatively, you can export all your old emails using Mail on a Mac just in case you ever need them again, then close down your Apple account. Contacts and calendars As long as you just want to make a one-way, one-time switch from iOS to Android, then Google Drive for iOS makes the process of moving contacts and calendars over simple enough. Once you've got the app installed on your iOS device, open the menu then tap Settings and Backup. Choose the data you want to transfer across to the equivalent Google accounts, tap Start Backup and you're on your way — everything from iOS and iCloud gets picked up. Make sure you're on wi-fi, and the iPhone is plugged in during the switchover. Also note, that any previous backups you've done will be overwritten. macOS can help make switching calendars easier. Image: Screenshot If you want a two-way sync, which you might if you're using your Android phone with an Apple laptop, then it's a lot more complicated. The best option, really, is to switch to using Google contacts and calendars as much as you can, and then adding your Google account to the relevant apps in macOS (Add Account from the main app menu in both cases). Even then you need to make sure you're always adding events to the Google calendars (or contacts) and not the iCloud ones for them to show up on your phone. If you absolutely must keep both Google and iCloud services running concurrently, and syncing with each other, then you'll need to put your trust in a third-party app for macOS or Android. Photos and videos Since Google Photos came into the world it's actually pretty easy to get all your personal photos and videos moved over to Android, via Google's servers, as long as they're all still on your iPhone: Install Google Photos for iOS, opt to back everything up, and away you go. You can either pay Google for storage and keep everything at full resolution, or accept some resizing (images max out at 16 MP, videos at 1080p), and store as many photos and videos as you like on the web, free of charge. The process is even more straightforward if you use the Google Drive app as we described in the section above, and Google Photos even supports Live Photos these days, using those extra few frames of animation to create a GIF for you. The only negative is that the albums you've created in iOS don't get copied over (everything appears as one long list of pictures), so you need to create them again. Google Photos can transfer images and videos. (Image: Google) All that is easy enough but if you've got photos in iCloud you've moved off your iPhone then you might have a problem or two on your hands. As we explained in our full guide to the topic of switching between Apple Photos and Google Photos, just about the only option open to you is downloading them all from iCloud to a macOS or Windows machine then uploading them again using a Google Photos client. It's a little convoluted but it's manageable, and it's a lot easier than using the export options in iCloud on the web, which are practically non-existent. If you don't have a computer to act as the middleman between iCloud Photo Library and Google Photos then you're stuck — you'll have to borrow a laptop from someone. Music and movies As we now have Apple Music on Android, getting your iTunes music on your Android device is no longer the exercise in frustration it once was. As far as tunes you've actually purchased directly from iTunes, it's probably the best option out there, though you do need to have signed up for an Apple Music subscription to be able to use the app and get at your purchases. Otherwise, it depends on where your music is and how it's stored. Any plain old MP3s you were syncing to your iPhone from iTunes can be uploaded to Google Play Music instead (50,000 of them can be stored for free), or you can use something like DoubleTwist, which is just about the leading choice if you want to keep on using iTunes alongside Android for your music. If you're signed up for Spotify you just need the Android app. Apple Music, now on Android. Image: Screenshot Likewise, if you've been accessing all your movies and TV shows through Netflix, Plex or Google Play Movies & TV then you just need to find and install the relevant app for Android and you're ready to go. All these services let you stream to multiple devices from a single account, so you can carry on using your iOS device if you need to. However, any videos you've purchased from iTunes won't run on Android at all — there's just no app to do it unless Apple ever gets around to making one. Several tools out there will do the job of removing iTunes DRM for you, but since we're getting into murky legal territory with that, we'll leave you to discover them for yourself. If you've invested hundreds of dollars in an iTunes digital library then you can still watch it on macOS, Windows, and the Apple TV, but not Android. Apps and games Generally speaking, all the apps you use on your iPhone are going to be available on Android as well, though there are a few exceptions — like Overcast and Day One. In terms of paid-for apps, you're going to have to pay for them all again, unfortunately, though something like a Spotify subscription buys you access on both Android and iOS. Whether all your data (from documents to saved games) moves over with you is another matter and worth checking up on before you make the switch. If you're in any doubt, get in touch with the developer directly to see what the situation is (you might be out of luck with anything that relies heavily on the iCloud storage system). Some paid-for iOS games, like Alto's Adventure, are free to play on Android. (Image: Noodlecake Studios Inc) We can't give you a guide to everything out there, but think about your productivity, fitness, and banking apps. Assess how much data is stored locally and what's going to happen to it. If you can, keep your old iPhone and new Android phone running alongside each other for a while until you're certain everything's been moved over successfully without too many bumps in the road. You might not believe it if you've read everything that's above, but moving from iOS to Android is actually much easier than it used to be, thanks mainly to an increased focus on cloud services (even, belatedly, from Apple itself). As long as you take your time, and don't live your life inside iMessage, you don't have to feel daunted by the task.

According to Google’s Keyword Tool, the name “Melania Trump” gets up to 10 million searches per month, while Melania’s first name alone gets up to 100,000 Google searches per month. Whereas plenty of the searches about Melania are queries about Melania’s age, nationality, IQ, or her family, up to 10,000 searches per month are entered into Google about Melania’s fashion choices. Up to 100,000 people type “Melania Trump dress” into Google each month. Now that Melania has returned from her jaunt to several foreign countries with President Donald Trump to the White House, Melania leaves in her wake a plethora of photos that display the dresses, shoes, and pants she chose to wear across her journey. As reported by ABC News, much of the attention that Melania received regarding her latest fashion choices included an expensive Dolce & Gabbana jacket. The Washington Post reports the cost of the jacket at $51,500, which represents the median 2015 U.S. income. Feedback about that pricey jacket can be seen in tweets below.

Melania joined others on the balcony of City Hall, in Catania, Italy. On Twitter, however, controversy has erupted over the high cost of the designer jacket worn by Melania. Melania Trump waves.

Google reports that up to 10,000 people type in the term “Melania Trump modeling pictures” each month, proving there’s a crowd interested in Melania during her younger days.

It was again in 2001 when Melania and Mr. Trump attended an American Cancer Society gala fundraiser in New York City. Melania Knauss and Donald Trump in 2001 in New York City.

Surprise: @BreitbartNews ridiculed Michelle’s $2,300 dress, praised Melania's $51,500 dress. https://t.co/T5F5UmuOag — James McPherson (@JimBMcPherson) May 28, 2017 “Ridiculous. Pinning signs that read ‘Let them eat cake’ all over herself would have had the same effect.” “She wears $51,000 as her husband strip needed services from the poor and pays ZERO in taxes.” “The only thing these people are in touch with is GREED! Melania $51,500 Coat Is the Actual Definition of Out of Touch.” “Kleptocracy: the jacket Melania Trump wears costs $51,500, and if you want to buy one just like it, you have to make a $25,750 deposit.” “Hypocrite #TrumpTrain yeah you couldn’t use $51,500.” Breitbart used to be so outraged by Michelle Obama clothing costs. Weird that they're silent when Melania Trump wears a $51,000(!) coat. pic.twitter.com/KHTqReJA6R — Matt McDermott (@mattmfm) May 26, 2017 [Featured Image by Domenico Stinellis/AP Images] Share 32 Tweet 0 Share 0 Share 0 Pin It 0 Contributor Paula Mooney Tags: melania, melania trump, Melania Trump Dress May 28, 2017 Portland Trail Blazers Mock Draft: Team Could Target John Collins, Justin Patton In 2017 NBA Draft May 28, 2017 Seattle Mariners Rumors: James Paxton Ready To Join Starting Rotation Comments LATEST HEADLINES Venus Williams Battles Sjogren’s Syndrome At French Open As Net Worth Surges, Will She Win At Roland Garros?

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AI Guest Voicebot market growing faster than ever, but here’s a realistic take S. Jason Prohaska, MediaMonks May 28, 2017 4:54 PM Image Credit: Shutterstock.com/Peppinuzzo Voice technology that power devices like Amazon’s Alexa and Google Home is the next frontier for tech companies. Facebook’s announcement to launch ParlAI recently only intensified the industry’s ambition to reach the ultimate goal of having meaningful conversations with computers by voice. But let’s hold our horses; we’re not there yet. At my company, we’re receiving increasing requests from brands eager to explore this emerging utility, and at the same time, working with engineering and product teams to understand exactly what it can do. As it stands, we still have leaps to make, but one thing is sure: voice activated tech is set to get smarter, faster. Recently, I was speaking with a top executive at a leading global consumer products company and while watching TV, he saw an interesting ad for a similar product to his own. This prompted him to test Alexa. He asked what the best brand for the product category was. Alexa promptly responded with a list of competitors. Later, one offered to send him a sample, and the other listed best prices. This goes to show that while we may not yet be having meaningful conversations, voice activated tech is rising and so too are opportunities for brands to embrace it. The good, the bad and the promising A recent study shows the US market for voice-activated assistants has grown nearly 130% since 2016. Today, Amazon Echo (Alexa) and Google Home — which differ from Apple’s Siri and Google Now in that they’re independent, stationary devices — dominate the market. Their main function is to provide a “smarter home” by calling up music, reminding you of your agenda, and even answering trivia questions. One of the biggest benefits of voice-activated tech is saving time. Speaking is more natural than writing, and because you don’t have to take out your phone, it’s faster too. It’s also more accessible for those who, for one reason or another, aren’t able to use keyboards or screens. Enthusiasts such as Hugh Durkin, a Product Manager for Intercom, have even exclaimed: “Soon, unnecessary typing and tapping on a keyboard will be a memory of the distant past.” Perhaps. But this feature is still prone to error. When many people are speaking close to a device at once, they tend to have difficulty actually hearing the activation phrase. In the end, if you have to repeat your request again and again, it can be more time consuming than just walking over to flip a switch. There’s also the issue of privacy to consider. Burger King’s recent TV ad using “OK, Google” is a prime example of this. The ad used the wake word “OK, Google” to prompt devices to describe its burgers, but within hours of release — and hilarious edits to the Whopper Wikipedia page — the commercial was pulled. The widespread coverage of this highlighted that voice technology is still new for many, and the idea of anyone, or anything, listening to what people is unnerving. These issues are mere glitches, however. The biggest challenge is that although we’ve created processes that allow computers to get better at translation, voice recognition and speech synthesis, most computers still don’t understand the meaning of language. Mark Zuckerberg said himself: “No AI system is good enough to understand conversational speech just yet. [It] relies on both listening to what you say and predicting what you will say next, structured speech is still much easier to understand than unstructured conversation.” And, research confirms the average person is struggling to find value adopting voice tech in their daily lives. Brands should start preparing for tomorrow, starting today At it stands, the list of current limitations is long. Despite these drawbacks, advances in machine learning mean that computers are getting better at recognizing what people are saying. We’re not there yet, but Zuckerberg’s ambition may not be far off. In 2011, the global voice recognition market was valued at nearly 47 billion. Six year later that figure has more than doubled to 113 billion. Along with Facebook’s new announced investment, there’s a rush to accelerate the transition from speech recognition to natural language processing at scale. Once this is achieved, Zuckerberg’s wish for computers to have more sophisticated conversations will become possible. Brands can start preparing for this new frontier today. As my earlier example of Alexa demonstrates, soon more and more consumers will be turning to these products to compare, review and shop. Brands need to anticipate this change now by integrating these devices in their e-commerce and marketing strategies. In much the same way online shopping transformed the brick and mortar retail experience, voice activation technology will take this further. Each day, the promise of meaningful conversation and results-oriented solutions provided by humans interfacing with computers is evolving. Let’s all continue to explore and contribute to these technologies as they become smarter, and more meaningful…one word at a time. S.

Security Minister Ben Wallace blasted “duplicitous” online firms such as Facebook and Google for selling users’ personal data yet refusing to assist the authorities with investigations. Getty Images 4 Security Minister Ben Wallace blasted ‘duplicitous’ firms for selling data yet refusing to help authorities In an attack on trendy tech bosses, he raged: “Sitting on a bean-bag wearing a T-shirt doesn’t make you some freedom-loving hippie. “They love their shareholdings, their super yachts and their billions.” He called managers “ruthless money-makers” who thought nothing of flogging their users’ personal information.

BUDGET BOONDOGGLE: President Donald Trump proposed a federal budget that will cause “tremendous fiscal pain” to Indian country if passed, wrote Kevin K. Washburn, former Assistant Secretary of Indian Affairs at the U.S. Department of the Interior. MARCH AGAINST MONSANTO: While Trump and his cronies and relatives line their pockets and cut the national coffers, people are still pushing back against the practice of equating corporate profit with public prosperity. Most recently was the sixth annual worldwide march against Monsanto, which took place in 200 cities throughout more than 60 countries. The marchers were protesting the pesticides and genetically modified foods that the corporate giant is notorious for producing. DAPL DOOM: The giant bank corporation U.S. Bank has amended its Environmental Responsibility Policy to ban funding oil and gas pipelines. And a big-data analysis revealed that contrary to the protestations of pipeline companies about their adherence to safety, spills happen all the time. And in the bombshell department, The Intercept published an investigation showing the lengths—and depths—that Energy Transfer Partners went to in monitoring and interfering with water protectors at Standing Rock. GOOGLE DOODLE DOO: Google Doodle acknowledged Mohawk activist Richard Oakes on what would have been his 75th birthday. During much of the ’60s and ’70s, Oakes, an alumni of San Francisco State University, peacefully protested for the rights and recognition of Native American peoples. Born on May 22, 1942 in Akwesasne, New York, he was murdered at age 30. BEARS EARS DOS AND DON’TS: Confusion has reigned over what can and can’t be done at Bears Ears National Monument. There is, in fact, a FAQ issued by the Bureau of Land Management that details some Bears Ears dos and don’ts. Some want the designation rescinded. BISON BONANZA: First a buffalo calf was born on the Wind River Reservation in Wyoming, the first progeny of a herd the Eastern Shoshone and Northern Arapaho tribes received last year. Then the Bronx Zoo in New York City, which had received eight bison from the Fort Peck Indian Reservation last November, welcomed no fewer than six calves. SUFFERING SALMONIDS: A new study found that most of the migrating salmon and trout in California could become extinct within a century if stronger measures are not taken to save them now. Nearly half of all salmon species face extinction in 50 years if trends in the state stay the same, scientific assessment found. THIS WEEK IN CULTURAL APPROPRIATION: A 42-foot tall totem pole carved by Brad Bolton, a white man with no traditional training in Native carving, was nixed by the board of the Oregon Country Fair in Veneta, Oregon, after carving-family members of the Siletz, Grand Ronde and several other tribes spoke out against it, one of them calling it “the worst appropriation I’ve ever seen.” Tangental to the appropriation theme is that of racism, which came up when a woman put herself in redface at a parade—she said it was theater, the ACLU and Natives said, Um, no. NATIVE FOSTER HOMES NEEDED: During National Foster Care Month, tribal nations have been raising awareness about the need for more Native foster homes in the United States, reports Suzette Brewer. One of the major areas of focus this year has been addressing the shortage of certified Native homes for children in state custody, as the majority of tribal children in foster care are in non-Native placements. THERE’S AN APP FOR THAT: Indian Country Media Network has launched its new digital books publication platform, with its first title The Bering Strait Theory, by historian Alexander Ewen (Purepecha), available for sale at Indiancountrymedianetwork/books. In addition, having achieved the milestone of receiving approval to be sold on the Apple’s app store, Indian Country magazine is now available for reading on the iPad, and subscriptions are available in the more than 230 countries served by iTunes newsstand around the world.

Photograph: Yui Mok/PA Privacy & the media Publishers call for rethink of proposed changes to online privacy laws Warning that new regulations will give Google, Apple and Facebook too much control of advertising and personal data Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Mark Sweney @marksweney email Sunday 28 May 2017 19.01 EDT An alliance of news publishers has called on European regulators to rethink proposed changes to online privacy laws, arguing that they will potentially kill their digital businesses and give Google, Apple and Facebook too much control of advertising and personal data. More than two dozen leading publishers – including the Financial Times, Guardian, Le Monde, Spiegel, Telegraph, Daily Mail and Les Echoes – have signed a letter to the European parliament, which is deliberating proposals to tighten up how data is gathered and used by web companies. The publishers argue that new regulations relating to “cookies” – small files that remember users’ digital habits therefore allowing the targeting of relevant ads – could cut off their ability to build digital revenue. Currently, when users visit an individual website or app they are asked if they will consent to a cookietracking them. Under the European commission’s plans, consumers will in the future instead be asked to make a single choice to accept, or reject, cookies from all websites and apps only on one single occasion on their phone or browser. Publishers argue that creating a single “switch” will most likely result in consumers taking the simplest route of opting out of all cookies, leaving them with scant information to support their targeted advertising models. In turn, this would leave the few digital giants used by most consumers to access the web, and those like Facebook that have their own giant data mining capability, in control. “Given that 90% of [digital] usage across Europe is concentrated in the hands of just four companies: Google, Apple, Microsoft and Mozilla, this [proposal]... has the potential to exacerbate the asymmetry of power between individual publishers and these global digital gateways,” the letter says. “The current ePrivacy proposals will result in the data of European digital citizens being concentrated in the hands of a few global companies, as a result of which digital citizens will become less protected. It will give those global companies a tighter grip on the personal data of European digital citizens.” Under the proposals, publishers would be allowed to lobby consumers to go into their settings and unblock individual sites and “white list” them, but news organisations believe that in practice this would prove to be an extremely difficult task. The proposal has been compared to the ad-blocking battle in which publishers ask the increasing number of those who use the software to turn it off, or add their businesses to a white list, explaining how advertising is essential income for many digital news businesses. The proposals are likely to further exacerbate the huge issue publishers already face as Google and Facebook sweep up as much as 90% of all new digital display advertising. “The practice of serving relevant advertising to readers is now an established norm in the advertising industry, and is essential to ensure that publishers can compete with Google and Facebook who already control 20% of total global advertising spend,” the letter says. “If as a result of these proposals news publishers were unable to serve relevant advertising to our readers, this would reduce our ability to compete with the capabilities of dominant digital platforms for digital advertising revenues, ultimately undermining our ability to invest in high quality journalism across Europe,” the letter says. In recent months, Google, which owns YouTube, and Facebook have faced a barrage of criticism for allowing ads to run next to inappropriate content such as extremist videos. The companies have also faced a number of issues that have hurt their previously unquestioned ability to accurately target ads, such as brands being charged for ads viewed by “bots”, computer programmes mimicking an internet user, and Facebook admitting to a number of measurement errors. “The Commission’s ePrivacy proposals will make it more difficult to ensure transparency ... and remove any distinction between publishers who place a high value on trust of their users, and those who do not,” the publishers’ letter says. However, the bad press has so far failed to dent their popularity with advertisers with Google and Facebook enjoying a near duopoly of control of the £11bn UK digital advertising market. Publishers say that they support the overall objective of the draft “ePrivacy” regulation, which they say has the “potential to clean up the digital economy”, but they need to compete on a fair playing field. “Citizens are rightly concerned about the use of their personal data by third-party companies of whom they have never heard, and have no idea about the role that they play in their digital lives online,” the letter says. “[But] the commission’s proposals threaten to prevent news organisations from delivering basic functionality such as the marketing of products and services, the tailoring of news products to the needs and desires of news consumers, and relevant and acceptable advertising.” Topics Privacy & the media Privacy news Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Reuse this content most viewed The Guardian back to top home US politics world opinion sports soccer tech arts lifestyle fashion business travel environment all sections close home US politics world UK europe americas asia middle east africa australia cities development opinion sports soccer MLS NFL MLB NBA NHL soccer live scores tables competitions results fixtures clubs tech arts movies tv & radio music games books art & design stage classical lifestyle food recipes health & fitness love & sex family women home & garden fashion business economics sustainable business diversity & equality in business small business travel USA europe UK environment climate change wildlife energy pollution science media selected crosswords blog editor quick cryptic prize quiptic genius speedy everyman azed weekend video Media › Privacy & the media back to top UK UK politics education media society law scotland more become a supporter make a contribution Facebook Twitter jobs guardian labs subscribe all topics all contributors solve technical issue about us advertise with us contact us work for us complaints & corrections terms & conditions privacy policy cookie policy securedrop © 2017 Guardian News and Media Limited or its affiliated companies.

Uber and Lyft will be back in Austin on Monday © Provided by USA Today Wall Street's exclusive "$1,000 Stock Club" could soon be welcoming two new members. Quotes in the article Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▲ 995.78 +2.40 +0.24% Berkshire Hathaway Inc BRK.A ▲ 248,540.00 +690.00 +0.28% The stock prices of online retailer Amazon.com and Google parent Alphabet are within a few bucks of $1,000, the latest sign that big, dominant tech companies are driving the U.S. market higher. At their peak Friday, Amazon (AMZN) shares hovered around $999, while internet search giant Alphabet topped $996. (Google first crossed the $1,000 threshold in 2013.) So should Main Street investors cheer when a company passes the $1,000 milestone, or worry? Many Wall Street pros say the figure is just a marker that catches people's attention and has little bearing on the future performance of either the companies or market. But these fast-rising stock prices do raise some yellow flags, even for people with index funds diversified across the broad U.S. economy. For sure, topping a share price of $1,000 is a "trophy" for companies and a clear "sign of success, domination and growth," says Dan Seiver, professor of economics at Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo, in California. Only seven U.S. stocks are trading above that milestone, according to S&P Dow Jones Indices, but three generate very little trading activity. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) is the highest-priced stock at $248,540 as of Friday's close Amazon, which is up more than 30% this year and 1,500% since the current bull market for stocks began in 2009, is riding its success as a dominant force in shopping and as a key player in artificial intelligence, where it is best known for its Echo device. Amazon is also huge in the fast-growing "cloud" computing business. Alphabet's Google is the biggest player in the online ad search space.  One potential negative is that Amazon's and Alphabet's commanding positions are the latest signs that the U.S. stock market is being driven by a few big stocks, which makes it vulnerable if they fall out of favor and their shares turn lower. Load Error Major stock indexes like the Standard & Poor's 500 and Nasdaq are weighted by a company's market value. That means the more valuable the company, the bigger the effect it has on the index, both up and down. The five biggest stocks in the S&P 500 (Amazon ranks No. 2 and Alphabet is No. 5) have accounted for nearly one-third of the large-company index's 8% gain this year, says Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P Dow Jones Indices. "It tells you how much narrower the market has become and how much influence (Amazon and Alphabet) have on the stock indexes," says Gary Kaltbaum, president of Kaltbaum Capital Management. If this trend continues, it could be a cause for concern, as "eventually the market (takes down) the big dogs." Michael Farr, president of money-management firm Farr Miller & Washington, warns that investors buying "passive" funds that track indexes like the S&P 500 might have more exposure to tech than they think. "The investment implications of this trend are profound," Farr says. "Investors who think they're getting broad exposure through the purchase of an ETF that tracks the S&P 500 may not know that they are heavily concentrated in a few stocks."   A market led by a small group of highly valued companies, he adds, could be a sign of an "aging" bull market. "Participation by a broader base of stocks in a wide range of industries shows conviction in the economic outlook," Farr explains, "as well as the ability of U.S. companies to grow earnings." When a stock gets very high, it's also less affordable for individual investors. "It makes the stock a little less accessible in the eye of the retail investor," says Lindsey Bell, market strategist at CFRA, a Wall Street research firm. When a company gets as expensive as Amazon, she believes it should consider splitting its stock to make it more affordable, as Amazon did three times in the late 1990s. And Apple, for example, in June 2014, did a 7-for-1 stock split which increased its pool of shares by seven times and reduced each share's price from roughly $645 to $92. Paul Hickey, co-founder of Bespoke Investment Group, sees one benefit to a stock being out of reach for most investors: "It could lessen volatility (or wild price swings)," he says. "With a higher share price, there is a tendency to see less 'fast' money going in and out of the stock." One Wall Street pro equates pricey shares with a frothy market.  "When I hear a stock is at $1,000 I always think it's a bubble no matter what the company," says Chris Rupkey, chief financial economist at MUFG Union Bank. Alphabet is trading at nearly 35 times earnings, nearly double the price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500. Amazon's P-E is north of 180 times earnings. "These stock valuations are pretty high," Rupkey says. "Investors better hope these two companies business models are sustainable for the long haul."

CNBC reports that Waymo, owned by Google’s parent Alphabet, is charging ahead of companies like Ford and Tesla in its driverless vehicle development. The most recent data (from six months ago) shows the firm had driven 635,867 miles (1,023,328km), with the average failure rate sitting at 5127 miles (8251km) per disengagement – the moment when the human supervisor must re-take control to prevent an incident. Meanwhile, Ford – which plans to introduce its driverless fleet around 2021 – had only driven 590 miles (949km), with a failure rate of 196 miles (315km) per disengagement. It is worth noting, however, that these numbers are specific to California, and Ford does much of its testing in Michigan. Above: Ford Fusion with autonomous sensor systems Google has driven over 1000 times more miles autonomously in California than the US automotive giant, with other companies like Tesla (550 miles, 3 miles/disengagement) and Mercedes-Benz (673 miles, 2 miles/disengagement) also lagging behind. Of all the car companies, General Motors (GM) has completed the most distance using autonomous technology (9668 miles), while BMW has the best failure rate (638 miles/disengagement). Earlier this week Ford’s Smart Mobility chief, Jim Hackett, was promoted to the CEO role after former boss Mark Fields retired, hinting that the Blue Oval is wanting to put more focus on driverless technology, especially considering the company was so bold in its forecast of a 2021 introduction for its autonomous ride-sharing fleet. According to the report, Waymo has a fleet of around 60 autonomous-capable vehicles – which includes the Chrysler Pacifica people mover (top) – while Ford only has a pair of Fusion sedans (known here as the Mondeo).

Starting May 31st, T-Mobile will kick off its #GetOutoftheRed promotion to help Verizon customers switch to T-Mo. Verizon customers in good standing with their carrier can get their iPhone or Google Pixel paid off by T-Mobile when they switch to T-Mobile and sign up for T-Mobile One, and they can keep their existing device. The phones that qualify for this promotion include the iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, Google Pixel, and Google Pixel XL. T-Mobile says that these devices were selected because “phones need certain software to be globally compatible, and some phones don’t yet have that software.” Magenta does say that it’s working with unspecified device makers to make more phones compatible with this promotion. Additionally, Verizon customers switching to T-Mobile must add T-Mo’s Premium Device Protection Plus insurance plan to their device to qualify. This insurance plan costs $15 per month and includes protection against loss, theft, and accidental damage, McAfee ID Protection, McAfee Content Protection, and other features. T-Mobile says that it’ll pay Verizon customers that take advantage of this promotion with a digital prepaid MasterCard card that typically arrives within 15 days. While this #GetOutoftheRed promotion is focused on Verizon customers (because VZW phones are unlocked), T-Mobile is doing something for AT&T and Sprint subscribers, too. Starting on May 31st, AT&T and Sprint customers can switch to T-Mobile and get their existing device paid off when they buy a new phone from T-Mobile on EIP. And unlike Carrier Freedom, those customers won’t be forced to trade in their existing device. Finally, T-Mobile says that starting tomorrow, May 25th, T-Mobile One customers with at least two voice lines can get two additional lines of service for the price of one. The cost of the second line will be offset by a bill credit.

(J²) Right… I’d found that the system doesn’t consistently apply these. TylerCameron Yeah their billng process it’s horrible Steve_NYC So true. I actually considered moving to the T-Mobile One Plan even though it would have cost me more money, just to get away from the insanity of their bill credit process. I finally got things straightened out, but I am sure it will be a problem in the future. It’s gotten to the point that I think it’s deliberate. Mike I had a free line from November that I had to call in every month. to get credit. They finally fixed it to be automatic this month. best part I got extra bill credits for months since last November and my bill is now negative so I didn’t have to make a payment this month. Al William So in order to get the free line, you need to have at least a total of 4 voice lines? Corey Jalette You need to have 2 voice lines to get this promo, which you get 2 lines for the price of 1. So in total you end up woth 4 lines, 1st 2 have to be voice, the 2 you’re adding could be whatever you want. So if you’re on the 2/100 plan right now if you add 2 tablets it would be 120 a month (20 per tablet but 1 is free) or if you add 2 voice lines it would be 140 (40 for adding a 3rd line then 4th is free) Al William Thanks for the clarification! So minimum 2 voice lines and the other 2 could be voice or data. I just wish they get rid of these bill credits. Sometimes it’s such a nightmare. Corey Jalette It can be yes but that’s how pretty much everything is done. Just like they had a free line deal in march it’s listed on my account as a free line on us but I still get the charge on my bill, but it’s auto credited. The only time it wasn’t was the first month because I added it before the end of the billing cycle. Cost $49 but they also credited my account manually that one time. Haven’t had an issue since. AWasserberg7 This article mentions Magenta. What *is* Magenta? Is that some cute term of affection for T-Mobile? kev2684 Are you serious? It’s their brand color. VZW = Red AT&T = Blue T-Mobile = Magenta Sprint = Yellow Nobody Special Cricket (umm, green) lol Genecio MetroPCS= Purple Black&Orange= Boost The Waz Just confirmed by T-Force that if you have a 2 for 100 plus a “this ones on us promo” giving you total 3 lines, you will lose your free line if you take advantage of the promotion of 2 for 1 tomorrow. They stated that they have to move you to a different Tmobile One plan….makes no sense since there is only 1 plan…… Corey Jalette This is ONLY if you’re adding a voice line people. If you’re adding tablet/smartwatch/mobile Internet plans that doesn’t affect your phone plan promo of 2/100. Corey Jalette Add 2 tablets with unlimited data on your plan for $20/month. They frequently have a free tablet promo with qualifying data plan. Snatch those up and you’re golden. The Waz Yes this will affect both. IF you have the 2 for 100 and the “this one is on us” free line….you will lose both promotions…confirmed with t force and John directly. Ben Also why can’t the t force reps do this. Seems very simple. chnage to the 4 plan rate, open the C-2 documentation, search this one on us, ask supervisor to open the page, enter the code on my account to reflect the 4th line as being free. And then add the 1 for 2 lines, or 50 percent off a one more line. This way I keep hookup and this one on us promo. and also eligible for future lines down the road. Yea this is very strange Ben Also why can’t the t force reps do this. Seems very simple. chnage to the 4 plan rate, open the C-2 documentation, search this one on us, ask supervisor to open the page, enter the code on my account to reflect the 4th line as being free. And then add the 1 for 2 lines, or 50 percent off a one more line. This way I keep hookup and this one on us promo. and also eligible for future lines down the road. So yea im wondering is anyone can find a loophole or something Andrew Singleton the reason is that you’re on a 2-line promotional plan paying $20 less than everyone else, and you’ve added a line. since you’re unable to add another line on that plan, you are forced to switch to a 3+ line plan, and that will cause activation-related discounts to drop. Corey below is correct, because internet lines (tablet, watch, syncup drive) are their own rate plan and don’t affect your voice configuration. Ben Also why can’t the t force reps do this. Seems very simple. chnage to the 4 plan rate, open the C-2 documentation, search this one on us, ask supervisor to open the page, enter the code on my account to reflect the 4th line as being free. And then add the 1 for 2 lines, or 50 percent off a one more line. This way I keep hookup and this one on us promo. and also eligible for future lines down the road. J Gerard Yeah! Let’s switch to T-MOBILE because we want to not be able to make phone calls half the time, and not have a signal to look something up when we actually need it. Oh yeah, and to not be able to upload pictures of something fun that we’re doing until we’re at home connected to WiFi later that night or the next day. Before any of you “magenta” fans TRIES to defend them… I’ve been a Verizon customer for about 12 years except for 6 months last year, when I switched because of crappy TMobile’s cheap prices and convincing (misleading) advertising. It was HORRIBLE. I used to get pissed and call them to ask why I could never get a signal. After 6 months, I finally admitted to myself that it was a ridiculous mistake and switched back to The Red! NEVER any issues with Verizon’s service. Never. “Magenta” is only good at talking a big game. If anyone’s thinking about switching to T-Mobile, DON’T DO IT. They are the worst. Go to any other carrier. Doesn’t have to be Verizon. kev2684 It’s all about location, location, location. Just because your area is bad, doesn’t mean everybody will have the same problem as you. J Gerard … EXCEPT that I live in a city. Oh, and Verizon’s coverage is flawless here. I happen to also know (through friends) that AT&T and Sprint are good here, too. Oh, but it’s all about location, location, location. Weak argument. T-Mobile just sucks! There’s a reason it’s so CHEAP! Austin8480 … OK JGerard. Next time, PLEASE use all capital letters to truly get YOUR point across. What I find PATHETIC is that you are a die hard Verizon turd in a TMobile blog. Oh wait, I meant Verizon TURD. Forgot to emphasize that. NOBODY in this room gives a flying —- about your opinion because you slummed it for 6 months and went to Magenta and it was as big of a mistake as…well, I will let you figure it out. J Gerard You were so busy typing a 3rd grade level post that you forgot to make a point. Here’s one for you: T-Mobile is inferior to almost all other carriers. Austin8480 If T-Mobile is so inferior, why are you even giving this blog the time of day. Are you upset that no kids want to hop in your van and eat your chocolate, so you are going to take out your frustrations on the inferior wireless network? thepanttherlady *Tip* Starbursts don’t melt :D theseanteam The hate is strong in this one. Those six months must have really scarred you or something. When you say almost all other carriers, which ones are you referring to? There are only four major carriers after all. And actually, that argument about location is a pretty strong one. T-Mobile’s network is the fastest in many locations, but can be really poor (or even non-existent) in others. The same can be said about everyone–including Verizon. Every carrier has their strong and weak areas. For someone to deny such would have to either be 1) ignorant 2) biased beyond belief or 3) troll. yankeesusa Yea, it still amazes me that people complain about coverage and then lump everyone else in america as having the same coverage, like we all live in the same area. Oh well. People never learn. I’m just happy tmobile works for me and that my data speeds are the highest iv’e ever had. At my house i’m getting close to 100megs almost every time. But hey i guess that’s not good enough for some. thepanttherlady I moved to Crestline a couple of weeks ago. No service. :'( kev2684 I had to google where that is lol :D Yeah it’s rural Ohio but I suppose Band 12 is coming? I’ve seen sightings on Band 12 in Jacksonville, FL lately as well as other parts of the country it’s currently not available. They’re probably working on it at the moment. thepanttherlady Sorry, I should have been more specific. It’s Crestline, CA. I made the same mistake when I called a county office but only Googled Crestline. Guy was really confused as they don’t have my address there. Took me a minute to figure out he was in Ohio. LOL kev2684 You’re literally live in a mountain! Views must be spectacular! thepanttherlady Some of them really are. :) Zacamandapio Verizon here we gooooooo. By the way, we went to Lake Gregory. :) thepanttherlady I’m literally 7 minutes from there. Went there 2 weekends ago to check it out. Water level is a little on the low side. Met a couple that same night that said they’d drained it for some reason and cited “water politics” because I guess the locals aren’t happy about it. Drove up from the Hesperia side this past Saturday and got to see Lake Silverwood. Will have to check it out this summer. Nice drive but hated seeing so many dead trees. :( ETA: I had to get Frontier (Verizon) internet so I could actually use my cell phone. What really sucks is: 1. I literally just got a hotspot through T-Mobile a month ago when they were offering another free line. It’s unusable. 2. I now HAVE to buy phones that have WiFi calling. Blah! thepanttherlady From the day we moved in 5/7: http://imgur.com/UQHsBZF http://imgur.com/t9Z64Q3 http://imgur.com/tm7ReiU And the lake :) http://imgur.com/1YUxwV9 http://imgur.com/tnGMcoq http://imgur.com/zhY16YK http://imgur.com/eaXr58H http://imgur.com/JO9BHJW Sharti24 Who will you be switching to? thepanttherlady I’m not switching. Yet anyway. I lose service 1/2 way up (or down) the mountain so I’ll probably have to get a very cheap pre-paid service/phone for emergencies in case I break down. Not all turnouts have a call box. I still work in Orange County and T-Mobile works fine most places I go. If it starts to be a problem then I’ll have to consider my options. Sharti24 Have tmobile send you a range extender. Not the one you plug into the internet but the one that has two boxes that boosts signal Berzerker Yeah, if you live in Bumblefuck, Montana, don’t switch. Greg Piller Shoot, I just signed up in Montana for TMO. Guess I’m “bumblefucked” lol. I have traveled to every state and been in EVERY U.S. major city multiple times living in every timezone and 11 states. My goodness you have a warped idea of “crap state”. Montana is paradise partner. You have to be from either NYC or California with that f’ed up mentality. He is right & not just in “crap” places but a lot of places like Chicago, IL where I was born and raised. Verizon & AT&T ARE better, Considerably better now in most places but TMO is gaining on them quickly & may reach parity in a few years. When THAT happens if TMO is still competitive, one would have to be a lunatic to stay with AT&T or Verizon. Berzerker …lol. I never said Montana was a “crap state.” It’s the easiest thing to think of when you think of wilderness where you won’t have service for miles. I could have picked a bunch of states, but Montana has, IIRC, the smallest habitation of humans to state ratio, behind Alaska of course. Easy target. Greg Piller To me 4 lines for $120 with TMO is enough of a savings to ditch AT&T. Verizon & AT&T and some of their customers can be arrogant & I think John Legere is one helluva CEO. I can pick up a burner sim with AT&T’s Cricket when I travel a bit and use it until TMO improves in Montana & then it’s sianara to ATT. Happy to be back with TMO. I was formerly a customer since the Voicestream days but when I moved west couldn’t keep them. Their coverage improvement in Montana & the nation as a whole with him at the helm has been nothing short of INCREDIBLE. I hope if the Sprint deal happens Legere is retained as CEO. mreveryphone Hummm… I travel the country for my job and I rarely have issues with T-Mobile… Is it perfect?? No… But no carrier is.. Verizon worked out for you, that’s great. T-Mobile works for millions, that’s also great. But this butt hurt rant is ridiculous and pure comedy! J Gerard “butt hurt rant” is kind of a dumb way to describe what I’m saying. But, I’ll consider the source, eh? Do you know ANYONE who thinks that T is better than V? Nope. So, the difference between us is that I choose to have a better service and I’m willing to pay a little more for it. You are cheap, and you’re willing to have an inferior service because it’s cheaper. That’s it. You know Verizon is better than T-Mobile Francisco Peña Anyone switching carriers should NEVER just switch without taking advantage of the initial return period. I was with VZW for yrs myself. Loved it, with my UDP that was grandfathered. Even went through one wave of price hikes to stay. Then the wife wanted a non-feature phone, and the price hike for her would have boosted out then $108 monthly payment, to $160 once we got a basic data plan, her line access fee (joke) and a new phone. So I looked into TMo. I purposely bought a phone the yr before that worked with Tmo and VZW (moto X DE) and signed up for one line of TMo, switched my Moto to Tmo and reactivated an older LTE phone I had back on VZW. Then I went around for a week doing speed tests everywhere I went. Stuck in traffic? speed test. Both side by side on the seat. Mall? yup, side by side in my hands. Work? yup. Home? yup. I hated VZW at work because my Moto could never get a signal inside the building, which caused my battery to die quickly each day. TMo? got a strong signal. Home, both were weak, but about the same. Driveway? same. So after 10 days, I went in to TMo and switched. Got 2 new phones (had a deal on G4s then) and was spending $140 for 2 lines/10GB each (was the $100/2L/10GB deal) with those phones. Has it been perfect? no. Has it been enough to switch back? no. After some finagling, got a $70 plan with 6GB each for 2 lines. Then have gotten a free line on top of that.. so now I pay $130 for 3 lines, with 6GB each (two don’t come close, mine has Stash so I’m good) and 2 new G6 phones. So for the price, its awesome. Can I deal with some poor service on the outskirts of town? sure. Oh, that Moto X? got it on the 3rd line… theseanteam I don’t think anyone has ever claimed that T-Mobile has better coverage than Verizon, but the point is it has the same quality of coverage in many places. Where I live, T-Mobile has equal coverage and faster speeds. It might not be like that for you, as everyone’s experience will vary. I’m sure if others suffered with bad service, they would switch carriers as well. But your superiority complex is just silly. mreveryphone I know plenty of people that think T-Mobile is better than VW… And I know people that think the opposite, it depends where you live. The service was inferior for you but not for me by any means… I appreciate the cheap name calling, I’ll be cheap all day if it means saving money but getting better service FOR ME… I’ve had service in buildings where others on VW had 0, I’ve smoked people on VW in data speeds tests so I’ll be cheap all day long!! Lol Vazaha There’s an unwritten agreement when you join T-Mobile that you will refrain from living in or going to crappy places. If you live in a decent place T-Mobile is fine. If T-Mobile sucks in your area, you know why :). Vazaha But seriously, I’m always envious of ATT and V when I go to crap places. tranceformer978 Why are you going to crap places? Melissa Cardenas Well what the hell are you doing on this website then? This is a T-Mobile forum obviously most people on here have T-Mobile and they Happy with it so they ain’t gonna listen to you . T-Mobile did not work in my old house so i had Verizon. Now in my new house Verizon don’t work at all and i had to get T-Mobile again because T-Mobile works here fine , So no carrier is perfect. It all depends on location!! J Gerard I get tech news alerts on my phone and things like this come up sometimes and I click on them. I believe that’s allowed! Apparently, what’s not allowed here is proper grammar and punctuation. I almost had to have your post translated in order to read it, but I figured it out eventually. Where did you go to school? Melissa Cardenas What ever im in a hurry and didn’t have time to spell check .But seriously don’t change the subject i don’t get why people like you come talk trash on a T-Mobile forum. ?? Makes no sense haha . And what ever im PRETTY sure you understood fine what i wrote in my first comment. Bull that you almost had to get it translated. Omar Boyer Melisa hes just being an idiot haha i understood perfectly well your first post. And i see they gave u some thumbs up on that first post so others also understood you no need to translate it . Ignore this lowlife with nothing to do. If he wants to stop making an Azz out of himself he should just block the notifications he gets from here. Melissa Cardenas i have better things to worry about ;) omar. And like you said he should just turn off notifications from here then. Eric Harlow Don’t give J Gerard the satisfaction in getting a reaction out of you and allow him to control the situation don’t dumb down to his level Eric Harlow Get off Melissa Cardenas butt about grammar here. This is a forum! Not a college message board or an college English Composition course. T-mobile has improved drastically within the last 3 years. T-mobile works for me out here in San Diego and in my future home in Missoula, Montana. I have mental disabilities that I got serving in The US Navy for twenty years and I dislike your comments towards Melissa Cardenas. This is a T-mobile fan website to discuss peacefully about T-mobile, so get your BIG RED DUMB AND DUMBER ASS OUT OF HERE. Andrew Addison You just made my night with that bomb diggity comment towards that boozo the snow clown filled with stuffy nose, trying to come off as English weirdo professor correcting people on their grammar fool there Bro. Is this guy here serious right now? He had no reason to talk down to someone like that and also talk down on the finest company/carrier, advising everyone to stay away from the best carrier/company which that one being T-Mobile-MetroPCS. We will forever be way Better in USA than any other carrier would have been. Eric Harlow OOH REALLY!!! HOW AWESOME!! Glad I made your night! RLB63 I actually feel sorry for you. How miserable your life must be for you to spend so much time on a site of a company you seem to hate so much. Cellphone companies aren’t making political statements. Seem way to smart for that. Don’t attack social issues. Attacking T-Mobile worth while to you and to spend so much time. You must not have anything better to do with your life. Eric Harlow I think you were supposed to reply back to J Gerard not me. I have been a T-mobile customer for over ten years and I am happy to be a T-mobile customer. Haze1nut English is a 3rd language for me, behind French and Portuguese. Correct my grammar for me, will you. It obviously makes you feel superior. Ascertion You think everyone that switches to T-Mobile can’t “Make calls half of the time”? You’re out of your mind! Tony Chen agreed, t mobile has gained millions of customers each quarter. if the drop calls were so bad why would t mobile gain 100% of new customers agaIN? another blockbuster quarter by t mobile. moonoverparma Funny, I’ve never had a problem. Nobody Special Several years ago i had a verizon phone (when the iphone’s came out they were the only one that were selling them with unlimited data at that time) and i had T-Mobile flip phone that i was using to make international calls. I have to admit, Verizon was more reliable than T-Mobile during my cell phone usage. I chose T-mobile over Verizon because of many reasons…. but it was never due to their coverage, because their coverage was horrible… but since then their coverage has improved. But i switched primarily due to the inexpensive international calls. That was a deal breaker for me, i was content with the terrible coverage with anticipation that they would improve their service. and with Verizon i was paying around $89 dollars for unlimited data and text and 450 minutes of voice calls. my tmobile line (from what i can remember) was around $78 dollars for unlimited talk and text and data. But fastforward to today, I have 5 Unlimited Everything (data/text/voice) lines with unlimited international calling (mobile+landlines) and international text for a low cost of $110 plus taxes and fees. Believe me i checked, Verizon or AT&T have nothing in comparison to what i have with T-Mobile. And i am not bashing you or Verizon at all, Verizon does have a more reliable coverage area but in the end i sided with T-Mobile over Verizon. If Verizon ever came up with incredible deals like T-Mobile has been doing almost every month i wouldnt turn down a great opportunity. RECAP: Verizon “Better Coverage” T-Mobile “Better Prices” It all boils down to what are you comfortable with. Im comfortable with crappy coverage. And My T-Mobile calls do drop often, but what i do is (i press redial) GOTCHA :) Gust OK so here’s the deal. In the morning when you wake up if you have T-Mobile you have to get up take a shower have breakfast shave go outside of your house in other to make a phone call. If you have AT&T or Verizon in the morning when you wake up you can reach for your cell phone and make a phone call. It is that simple. But you know what I have T-Mobile because over one year it saves me about $200 as compared to AT&T or Verizon. So I put up with the crap! Timothy Poplaski T-Mobile supports WiFi calling. You don’t have home WiFi? DM725 How do you not have wifi calling enabled? Maybe you need to buy a phone from the last 2 years… (My Motorola Nexus 6 Supported Wifi Calling….) RLB63 They have equipment they they will ship out for free with a deposit that will boost their signal on your house if you don’t have Wi-Fi calling. My phone automatically switches on Wi-Fi when I get home. Not for signal or to save data. It’s because with all the talk that cell signals MIGHT cause cancer why risk it? It is able to enable Wi-Fi, and it disables it when I leave the house. So that might be an option if you have Wi-Fi…. Phone Guy All lies. So funny, yet sad. yankeesusa LOL, not everyone lives where you live and have bad coverage with tmobile. 4 years ago i would have never used tmobile, now i no longer have sprint and got rid of my verizon line because tmobile is great for me where i live and work. I just recently drove across florida,georgia,nc and tennesse and had no issues. I was able to test it side by side with an att phone and the whole time both phones had coverage except up in the smokies near newfound gap where no one has signal. Don’t lump everyone in the same pile just because it doesn’t work for you. DM725 LoL, where the hell do you live? eanfoso The only one after verizon is at&t because we know that sprint and us cellular sucks more than t mobile Andrew Singleton T-Mobile has the lowest churn rate (people trying it and leaving) of all carriers. Could you please explain why? J Gerard Ha! Oh, I promise you I don’t feel like an idiot surrounded by people who work themselves up into a breathless rant trying to defend a crappy service. gmo8492 Crappy for who exactly, churn has gone down to record lows and T-Mobile has over 73 million subs, so if it doesn’t work out you can switch. Brad C It’s not for everyone, but has worked damn well for me for 12yrs.. I *actually* tried Verizon a few months ago, and came back after two weeks after awful LTE performance JG You’re cracking me up reading your comments! I have TMo and put up with their spotty coverage because I’m paying less per month staying with them. I can admit that. There is alot I enjoy about TMo, but dropped calls and dead zones IS a reality. I have a band 12 phone in metro PHX. Not sure why others feel the need to berail someone who doesn’t agree with them just for argument’s sake. Timothy Poplaski Because you aren’t saying, “Bad coverage in PHX”, you’re saying “Bad coverage”. I can drive for at least an hour in any direction and have solid coverage. It all depends on where you live, and you’re phone. Even phones with band 12 won’t all have the same results because some phones get better reception than others. So, I won’t even argue about coverage in PHX. Never been there, likely never will, so it just doesn’t matter to me. My excellent coverage probably doesn’t matter to you. It’s all about where you use your phone. navi harriram Dude you could of tested the network out on a $10 weekly plan or $3 daily. You don’t buy cell phone service every day so do the work. The sales rep just wants a commission check so they’ll say anything to get you to switch. That’s why I don’t work for wireless companies anymore. Too much bull to deal with yankeesusa Not everyone is defending a company that may or may not work depending on where you live. But many people actually do research and pick a company that specifically works for your needs depending on your area. I had verizon and sprint before tmobile and i have never ever gotten the speeds i get now not to mention i have great coverage ‘WHERE I LIVE”, YOU SEE, that’s the important thing, i researched and made sure it worked for me. I don’t just blindly select a company just because their commercial says so. Screamin That’s strange because T-Mobile has been #1 in customer service AND satisfaction for well over 2 years now… and yes, that includes coverage. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) I am thinking about switching to Verizon due to poor coverage. In San Diego area I get one to bars. I moved from Minnesota and T-mobile coverage in MN is excellent there with all bars. In San Diego it’s very poor in some areas. When iPhone 8 is release I am switching to Verizon. I love T-mobile plans but coverage in my area is poor. Sharti24 Agreed. On base (32nd street) forget about tmobile coverage. sprint excels on 32nd. go over to corando island its even worse! just throw your phone over board. no tmobile coverage on the air base at all. im using an iphone 6s Band 12 which is deployed in SD yankeesusa I agree, if in your area tmobile is not good and is affecting productivity or just not letting you use your phone to its fullest your’e better off changing. I have great coverage where I live and work and when i travel over 99% of the time i have no issues. But i got my wife on cricket which is att so for the times where tmobile may not get signal i have the att towers just in case. I’m on an old grandfathered single line plan that allows work discount so i’m keeping as long as i can. Screamin Sometimes it’s not always the cell coverage causing the issue, but the phone itself, especially if it’s an older device that supports fewer cell bands. With T-Mobile’s latest acquirement of spectrum you can expect a huge improvement in cell signal, both in range and structure penetration, within the year. Of course you can switch if you want, but they’re only going to get better. They’ve more than doubled the coverage in the past 2 years and have just as much coverage as Verizon with a network that’s actually futureproof unlike the other guys. DM725 Agreed, I know people that don’t realize they are using a phone without band 12, that doesn’t have wifi calling or Volte support, and has an extremely weak antenna. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) My phone is iPhone 7 and not an old device: Andrew Singleton if you hold an iphone 7 next to a galaxy s8, the s8 will have more bars every time. that’s due to a more powerful signal on galaxies and the fact that bars don’t mean anything with low-frequency spectrum. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) My roommate is on T-mobile and his current phone is galaxy s8. We experience the same issue. RLB63 Have you talked to T-Mobile C.S.? If they get people complaining about certain areas they tend to look into those areas. Is it outside or inside or both where you have problems? Inside out could be the building. They can seems you a device to boost the signal for your phone. Patel Nisha You couldn’t pay me to use a iPhone . And why would I switch Verizon to T-unmobile. So I can have a sub par data connection with hardly any coverage…. Andrew Why are you on TmoNews, then? Andrew Addison Lol I was just thinking the exact same thing. Lol DM725 I’m sorry you live in a place that T-Mobile doesn’t prioritize. Here in NY, we have no such issues. Andrew Singleton the offer is also good for pixels, and you don’t know anything about the network. in 1 year, verizon will wish it had t-mobile’s network. browne81 I cavy take this anymore. There is always someone in these forums going miss information. I have to speak up. As awhole some networks are better than others. I’m not going to get into my opinion on which is better nation wide. What I will say is this. The best carrier is the one that works where you frequent the most. No matter what carrier a person loves there is another person out there that thinks it terrible. So all these people saying bad things about T-Mobile should get the facts straight. Lastly I due example I don’t like sprint but I know there are people that have a great time with them. You don’t see me on a sprint site saying how bad they are. Is my spelling perfect no. Is my grammar perfect no. It’s this a college paper? No. So I really don’t care. AJ2 still waiting for them to do a $50 deal for single customers. browne81 They have a prepaid plan for 45 Select a phone: (optional) + - Any - 3G|4G U301 USB Modem Acer Aspire One Netbook Acer Liquid

By Robert Epstein, opinion contributor - 05/28/17 06:00 PM EDT 22   Over the last decade, many influential people have wondered whether “Big Tech” and democracy can coexist. They have included Stanford legal scholar Nathaniel Persily, distinguished journalist Thomas Edsall, and Robert Reich, who served as secretary of labor under President Clinton. The latest take on the issue is an engaging book by Jonathan Taplin, former director of the Annenberg Innovation Lab at the University of Southern California and, in earlier manifestations, tour manager for Bob Dylan and a film producer for Martin Scorsese. The subtitle conveys a quick overview: “How Facebook, Google, and Amazon Cornered Culture and Undermined Democracy.” “Move fast and break things” — Taplin’s title — was, at least until 2014, the corporate philosophy of Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg. Taplin interprets that philosophy liberally and applies it to several Big Tech moguls, especially PayPal co-founder Peter Thiel; Google co-founder Larry Page; Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. In its original use, the phrase described the rapid deployment of innovative software projects. But to Taplin, it means something much darker: to replace all the failing systems of society with technological systems controlled by benevolent billionaires. ADVERTISEMENT Once these new systems are in place, Taplin says (quoting Israeli historian Yuval Noah Harari), “humans will lose their authority, and humanist practices such as democratic elections will become as obsolete as rain dances and flint knives.”   He reports, accurately, that Google now dominates five of the six billion-user online markets — browsers, video, mobile, search and maps — and that Facebook dominates the only other such market — social media. He also asserts that some of the Big Tech execs have megalomaniacal ideas about the duty they have to save the world while becoming even more obscenely rich, much like the supermen they admire in Ayn Rand’s “Atlas Shrugged.” But Taplin seems unaware of the immense powers these new supermen are actually wielding. Since 2013, my research team and I have been studying new forms of influence the Internet has made possible that are unprecedented in human history. We have not been studying “fake news,” which is a very visible and old form of influence that mainly serves to confirm the beliefs people already have. And no, we have not been studying how negative messages can spread like wildfire through social interactions — also a very old and visible form of influence. The impact of such mechanisms is trivial compared with the new techniques, such as the Search Engine Manipulation Effect (SEME), which Taplin mentions. Ronald Robertson and I discovered SEME in 2013, showing that biased search results can invisibly shift the voting preferences of undecided voters by between 20 and 80 percent. But SEME is only one of four powerful new forms of influence my colleagues and I have discovered in recent years, and I’m sure there are others, with new ones coming soon. New forms of influence like SEME are now affecting the decisions of billions of people every day without their knowledge. The Big Tech oligarchs are well aware of their new powers. As Google’s Eric Schmidt said onstage a few days after the November 2016 election, “How people get their information, what they believe, what they don’t, is, I think, the project for the next decade” (click here for the video). And evidence is mounting that they are actually using these tools. As we recently reported, in 2016, Robertson and I recruited a Nielsen-type network of field agents who allowed us to track their election-related searches for nearly six months before Election Day. Based on the 13,207 searches and 98,044 web pages we captured using this new monitoring system, we found that Google’s search results were biased toward Hillary ClintonHillary Rodham ClintonIs it still possible to stop ‘Big Tech’ from killing democracy? Hillary Clinton for 2020 ‘not a good question,’ says Rahm Emanuel Graham: Comey should be held accountable for acting on bad intel MORE in all ten of the top search results over most of this period — enough, perhaps, to have invisibly shifted more than two million votes. I’m now working with colleagues from Princeton, Stanford and elsewhere to expand the monitoring system so the manipulative shenanigans of Big Tech companies can be continuously monitored on a large scale. Exposing online manipulations might finally force Big Tech companies to be accountable to the public and might even save democracy. This brings me to my one gripe about Taplin’s book. Toward the end of this disturbing tale of greedy billionaires, he finally gets to his solutions: Facebook and Google, he says, must “alter their business model,” although he has no idea how to make this happen. Anyway, he says, maybe we can build a “parallel structure” of “nonprofit distribution cooperatives” that will once again allow creative artists to earn a decent living. Seriously. That’s it.  That’s how this illuminating book ends. Whatever happened to saving democracy? To Mr. Taplin I say: How about joining my colleagues and me in building a worldwide monitoring system that will force Big Tech companies, now and in the future, to behave responsibly?

Morris Fortune May 28, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share Android Malware 'Judy' Hits as Many as 36.5 Million PhonesMore The security firm Checkpoint on Thursday uncovered dozens of Android applications that infected users' devices with malicious ad-click software. In at least one case, an app bearing the malware was available through the Play app store for more than a year. While the actual extent of the malicious code's spread is unknown, Checkpoint says it may have reached as many as 36.5 million users, making it potentially the most widely-spread malware yet found on Google Play. Google removed the apps after being notified by Checkpoint. Get Data Sheet, Fortune's technology newsletter. The malicious apps primarily included a series of casual cooking and fashion games under the "Judy" brand, a name borrowed for the malware itself. The nefarious nature of the programs went unnoticed in large part, according to Checkpoint, because its malware payload was downloaded from a non-Google server after the programs were installed. The code would then use the infected phone to click on Google ads, generating fraudulent revenue for the attacker. The infection may have spread even more widely than Checkpoint's estimates, since not all of the extensive line of "Judy" apps are included on Checkpoint's tally - it's missing Fashion Judy: Magic Girl Style and Fashion Judy: Masquerade Style, among others. All installments of the series do appear to have been pulled from Google Play. The "Judy" apps were published by an apparently Korean entity known as ENISTUDIO. However, iterations of the same attack were found on a handful of apps from other publishers. This is not the first instance of a malware infestation making it through the screening process on Google Play, nor is it the most damaging - Checkpoint did not find any evidence, for instance, that "Judy" compromised data on infected phones. That Judy was able to hide on Google Play for so long highlights the tradeoffs of Android operating system, which is often seen as more open but less secure than Apple's iOS.

In fact, we heard the phrase "AI first" as a description of Google's current plans. You probably have a little sliver of Google's AI capabilities in your pocket right now—Google Assistant. There's one place in particular Google really wants Assistant to live, and that's in your car. Voice commands in general are extremely well-suited to the car, so it should come as no surprise that Google had two Assistant-infused "Android Automotive" demos on-hand at I/O—one from Volvo (above) and another from Audi. It's more clear now than ever that Google wants to be the smart interface for your car, and it plans to do it with Assistant. Your car with Android The Android Automotive project (just an internal name for now) was rumored in 2016, and the first demo of such a system was showcased at CES early this year. This is distinct from Android Auto, which Google released alongside Lollipop. However, it took several months before the first aftermarket head units and new cars arrived with support for the platform. Progress on Auto has been slow ever since. It does barely anything now that it couldn't do at launch. Perhaps that's because Google is currently more interested in making Android the car's operating system. With Android Auto, your phone simply projects an interface to the car's display, but Android Automotive is a car that actually runs Android as its infotainment system. There have been cars running Android before—many Honda and Hyundai vehicles still do, actually. They're very old builds that are almost completely unrecognizable as Android, though. By working with automakers, Google can make the interface more modern and get its services embedded in the car. The two Android Automotive concepts being demoed at I/O were surprisingly full-featured. Check out our video from the event if you want to see how Android in the car actually works. One of the first things you'll notice about this new take on Android in the car is that it's fast... well, faster than Android Auto. Android Auto tends to lag heavily at times for no discernible reason. The fact that it's still preferable to the stock in-car software is a testament to how little automakers have innovated in this space. The two interfaces demoed were also very different from each other, indicating Google might give automakers even more freedom to modify Android than phone OEMs do. Actually, the Volvo interface was visually similar to Volvo's current software (which is not Nougat, obviously). Both demos were based on Android 7.0 with an eye toward migrating to Android O when it's final. Importantly, Android Automotive runs Google services and Android apps without connecting an Android phone. The apps are essentially the same as the ones you currently use in Android Auto. They're limited to audio and messaging apps, and you do have to wonder how long those apps and services will be up to date. Phone updates can take ages, and cars could be much worse. Assistant everywhere An often expressed fear is that a car with Android-based infotainment features will eventually become extremely outdated. After all, you keep a car much longer than you do a phone. Will the apps and services running on that car ever be updated? Will developers eventually drop support for in-car apps on these older versions of Android? There are a lot of unknowns right now. Audi's Demo Googlers seem to have a go-to line when you ask about updates to Android-infused cars—they talk about Project Treble. Google is cognizant of the fact that automakers seldom update the software on cars, but the hope is that updates will still happen occasionally if Google can make it easier. There's also a lot of talk about Assistant in the car, and I had several Googlers cite this as a way to make apps and services more accessible while you're driving regardless of what version of Android your car runs. Apps installed in the car might not be updated very quickly (or at all), but that's not a concern in the cloud. After connecting an app or service to Assistant, it's accessible from your phone, a Google Home, Android Auto, or even a car running Android that hasn't seen an update lately. Thus, developers don't necessarily have to worry about specifically supporting old versions of Android in the car, they simply need to take advantage of Assistant. You can do things with Assistant voice commands that are very much outside the bounds of road-safe media and messaging apps. Assistant's smarter voice commands have the potential to be extremely useful while you're driving. There was a wall of smart home devices next to the Volvo car in order to demonstrate how you could adjust your humble abode in advance of your arrival. Hot day? Crank the AC before you roll into the driveway. You also have more control over the car with Assistant as part of the car's OS—for instance, you could control the climate or open the sunroof, which isn't feasible in Android Auto. Having Assistant built into the car also means more people will use it. Even iOS users who don't have an Android phone to plug in will be able to use Assistant in these vehicles, and that gets them into the Google ecosystem. Assistant is very much hit or miss right now. Sometimes you ask Assistant a question or issue a command only to be greeted with a cloyingly polite apology. Still, it's getting better, and some of the things Google demoed could be great experiences. Regardless of possible update issues down the road, Google's involvement with car infotainment will lead to more modern versions of Android at launch, and Assistant could help your car's software remain useful.

Oleg Vorkunov Google now worked much better than assistant. Now I want to throw my watch and phone away. leganzish Android Auto is as good as dead. It barely got more functional since its introduction and will only languish more now that Google has moved on. The thing I don't like is the car being data independent. That's the beauty of the "projection" method of Android Auto. I don't want to live in a future where I have a data connection for my phone, my tablet, my watch, my car, my refrigerator, my washer, and my dryer. I want a data connection for my phone and everything else to be able to piggy-back off of that. whispy_snippet I really doubt it's dead. What about the millions of people who don't intend to buy a car for years or have just bought a car with Android Auto? The majority of people sit in this category. Sure, "Automotive" is probably the future. But I think Android Auto has plenty more to come. leganzish I'm not saying its going to disappear of the face of the earth tomorrow. Just that it will languish. It has already had fairly slow adoption. I would expect adoption rates to slow now that Google has tipped their hand on the next automotive initiative. If consumers get frustrated at the Hangouts situation, I think the very careful/conservative (when it comes to tech progress) automotive brands will be extremely hesitant to invest in Android Auto when it appears to have fallen out of Google's favor. whispy_snippet Hmmm I'm still not convinced. For one, getting car makers to adopt Android Auto has been challenging enough. Convincing hundreds of car makers to suddenly drop their existing operating systems and hand full control to Google is going to take a lot of persuasion and a lot of time. In the short to mid term it's going to be easier to convince car makers to offer a "plug and play" connectivity feature that consumers demand, without the need to cede full control to Google. Remember, a lot of people use iPhones and will demand Apple CarPlay in their next vehicle. Do you think Apple is going to develop a CarPlay app for Android Automotive? I've no doubt Android Automotive is what Google sees as the end goal. But developing a full featured car OS from the ground up, for every single car maker, is an enormous task. In the meantime there are millions and millions of car owners out there with no intention of buying a new vehicle for years. Google has recognised this and its why Android Auto can now run as a stand alone app on phones. And because this app can run on millions of phones, it offers developers plenty of incentive to support it (and thus support Android Auto as a platform broadly). leganzish All good points. I completely agree with you on what consumers and car makers will want. I just fear that Google will ignore Android Auto for the sake of Android Automotive. They've got history of continuing to support "first ideas" along side "second ideas" (Gmail alongside Inbox) and history of neglecting the first after a competing project launches. I'll be interested to see which way this goes. xyz Those people will be stuck on old versions that will never be updated. Standard Google policy. If the car owners have any sense, they'll switch to Apple for their future auto software needs. Filipe Santos Car Assistant first, Waze last JasonIvers Android Automotive is still better than some proprietary junk infotainment system from a car manufacturer, even if it's never updated at all. At least you have a reasonably good chance third-party developers will actually build something for it without having to be paid to do so. whispy_snippet My biggest worry about our new world of connected cars is security. Just wait until someone hacks a vehicle's control inputs and causes a crash. What are Google, Apple, car manufacturers, etc going to do about this looming question? abqnm I think that would come down to car manufacturers hardening and isolating essential control systems so they can't be accessed in the event the infotainment system is hacked and somehow allows access to the CAN-BUS. Still, even with access to CAN-BUS, proprietary software over encrypted connections is generally required to access control systems. So it's not like someone can just hack the infotainment system and suddenly can control your steering remotely. There would be a massive amount of protocol reverse-engineering work needed, and it would be on a per-model, per-software build, per-control surface basis. The Jeep exploit that was demoed a couple years back required them to reverse engineer and spend many hundreds of hours to do so. It's a concern, sure, but not a major one. whispy_snippet If a car being hacked could result in someone's death then I would consider it a major concern. The reputation of connected cars and their associated manufacturers and developers are at stake. Just one death as a result of a car being hacked could ripple through the media and cause millions to question the safety of something like Android Automotive. I obviously don't understand how one would hack a car and I'm sure it's ridiculously complex. But if it's possible, I really hope the companies that have our lives in their hands are doing everything they can to mitigate a disaster. It might sound dramatic, but I think it's really important to keep asking these questions. Software exploits are rare, but every now and again we see even the big companies drop the ball (Apple with its iCloud brute force hack, Google with its Google Docs exploit, Microsoft and the ransomware attack). If computers and software are vulnerable, that makes cars with computers and software vulnerable. And when you're hurtling along at 60mph that's well worth our concern. 1966CAH If? It's been done already! https://arstechnica.com/security/2015/07/fiat-chrysler-recalls-1-4-million-cars-over-remote-hack-vulnerability/ Sure, malicious hackers didn't do it, but the remote vulnerability was exploitable over the internet. It's not the only one of its kind, but the most severe I've read about. abqnm Since it relies on assistant, does that mean that all cars must now have a data connection? Does or can it use the phone's data connection? There was no indication of connection sharing in the Volvo demo. I really don't want to see cars that I have to pay a monthly subscription fee for a data connection just to be able to tell it to turn off my seat heater. RyanWhitwam The demo cars both had dedicated LTE. That's the way it works right now. Presumably, it would be possible to share the data connection, but that would be up to automakers. whispy_snippet Surely a wireless charging pad with NFC that triggers a WiFi tether arrangement makes sense. Every phone in the near future and onward is going to have wireless charging - we just need an agreed standard of course... ekngee i think Android Automotive is more of a motive-ational push to say "hey, it's easy to use Android to build your infotainment system, rather than do your own from scratch". Android Auto should still stay, because as stated, updates are a big unknown, so i'd rather be safe updating my phone than the car. SAM Few years down the road, people will be talking about android fragmentation on cars, how only 1% of cars are on latest Android version and Android O still wont die. xyz No thanks, don't want malware in my car. Nor do I want to buy a new car every 2 years. I'll stick to Apple on this one.

BlackBerry KEYone review: A tale of a decent phone full of annoyances Jordan Palmer Follow View All Posts 2017/05/04 6:00am PDTMay 4, 2017 9 Plus 1 on G+ 20 Share on Facebook 48 Share on Twitter Total Shares77 Blackberry KEYone News Phone Reviews Reviews Article Contents 1 Specs 2 The Good 3 The Not So Good 4 Design & build quality 5 Display 6 Battery life 7 Audio 8 Call quality & connectivity 9 Camera 10 Software 10.1 BlackBerry apps 10.2 Settings & general UI 10.3 Performance 11 Value 12 Conclusion The KEYone, the latest in the BlackBerry Ltd/TCL collaboration, is a phone that returns to the Canadian brand's iconic roots, for better or for worse. With Nougat and a strong focus on security, the KEYone is aimed at enterprise users and long-time fanatics. Overall, the spec sheet for this phone is nothing chart-topping. The SoC is over a year old at this point and the screen has been downgraded from the year-and-a-half-old Priv's, but using the KEYone was mostly a pleasant experience until after about a week with it. That was when I started experiencing rather noticeable slowdown and other problems. So what does a proverbial return to form for BlackBerry mean in the ever massive Android space? Well, there's not really a simple answer. But let's get going — we've got a lot to cover. You don't want to be here all day, do you? The unit that I've been using for the last week and some change is pre-production. There have been a few hiccups with the software along the way, which I'll note in the appropriate section below. Most of these problems will hopefully be fixed before the KEYone is available for sale. Specs Display 4.5" IPS LCD 1620 x 1080; 434 ppi CPU Snapdragon 625 GPU Adreno 506 Software Android 7.1.1 Nougat; BlackBerry Security RAM 3GB Storage 32GB, expandable via microSD Cameras 12MP IMX378 (1.55μm) rear, 8MP front Battery 3,505mAh; Quick Charge 3.0 Misc USB Type-C 3.1, fingerprint sensor, 3.5mm jack, physical keyboard, NFC Connectivity 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, dual-band; Bluetooth 4.2; LTE bands 1/2/3/4/5/7/12/13/20/25/26/28/29/30 Measurements 149.3 x 72.5 x 9.4 mm; 180 g Buy BlackBerry The Good Software The "stock" take on Android with BlackBerry's apps is great. It feels like what Motorola does: functionality added on top of Google's vision. It has the latest security patch and Android 7.1.1. Battery life My time with phones from the likes of Huawei and Xiaomi has somewhat desensitized me to stellar battery life, but the KEYone is definitely above average. Screen The color accuracy, brightness, and viewing angles are spectacular. The screen crisp and more than adequate, despite its odd size and aspect ratio. Fingerprint sensor I am not sure from where the fingerprint sensor was sourced, but it's almost on Huawei's level for speed and accuracy. Seriously, my success rate has been almost perfect. Build quality The KEYone is one hell of a solid device. The aluminium frame combined with the soft-touch back make the phone feel extremely durable. The Not So Good Ergonomics/weight The KEYone is chunky and is a bit difficult to hold. Typing with one hand on the physical keyboard is also a pain. And even though it's only 180 grams, the KEYone feels very dense and heavy. Using it single-handed is not a pleasant experience for long periods. Speaker I know this should go without saying, but the speaker quality on this phone is pretty terrible. Performance Major lag, homescreen redraws, and RAM management issues led to a phone that, after about a week of use, became almost unusable. Design & build quality To give you some perspective on the KEYone and its design, the marketing materials say that the phone is "Distinctly different. Distinctly BlackBerry." That last part, and to an extent the first, is quite true. BlackBerry (well, it's really TCL, but you know what I mean) has opted for what you might call the quintessential look that defined the heyday of Research In Motion. And while that seems like a negative at first glance, the KEYone's design exhibits some modernization in its overall execution. This phone garnered more looks, comments, and questions in my time with it than any other I've used — I'd say that it comes close to the amount of attention I received when smartwatches were still young. The physical keyboard is what drew people's eyes. The whole front face would throw anyone for a loop, especially when we're starting to see such high screen-to-body ratios these days. Not a single person that I've come across thinks that this is a pretty device... and I agree with them. The KEYone is not beautiful, elegant, slim, or anything else like that; it is aimed at a niche that, in theory, cares little for those things in a pocket computer. From the back, the phone looks fairly unassuming and normal. The soft-touch finish feels like it was ripped off of the good ol' OG Nexus 7. My fingertips glide across the band-aid texture, but when push comes to shove, my hand grips it solidly. Coupled with an aluminium frame, the KEYone feels sturdy, durable... and like a brick. To put this kindly, it is one hell of a chunky phone — I actually had 2010-2011 phone era flashbacks when I removed it from the box. At 180 grams (6.35 ounces for you Imperial folks), the KEYone gets quite heavy in the hand after prolonged usage. See, I have this odd tendency to support phones with my little finger while I'm using them; BlackBerry has made me decide to try to break that habit. I know that I mentioned it briefly, but let's talk seriously about the KEYone's keyboard. When smartphones were starting to trend toward on-screen keyboards, I was not happy. I liked the tactile response of my Droid and Droid 2, and haptic feedback was just not as satisfying. I had also not learned to type without looking on my G1 or HTC Hero, a problem I did not have with any of my Droids or BlackBerries. I eventually got over myself and became a solid fan of SwiftKey and the navbar that Google brought to Android with Ice Cream Sandwich. Now that I'm all done reminiscing, let's get back to the topic at hand. The KEYone's backlit keyboard is really good, if not a little weird after spending the last several years with a software variant. If I were a keyboard nerd like Ryan, I'd describe the travel distance, tactile feel, and the like — I just like my gaming mice and PC hardware. While the keys are much too small for my taste, I found that I actually had very few errors in general usage. Each one is easily pressed and responds with a solid click. The layout is obviously QWERTY (duh), so it's pretty easy to get to the point where you're typing fairly quickly. So far, the only things that have taken me some time to adjust to are the symbol layout and the placement of the left shift key versus ALT. Most of my errors have been activating the alternative mode instead of capitalizing the next letter. If you're into it, there are 52 programmable keyboard shortcuts that can open apps or contacts. For instance, you could assign a long press of 'c' to open Chrome, 'f' to start up Facebook, and so on. There's one catch, though: it's limited to the BlackBerry Launcher. In any other, long-pressing a letter will bring up a phone search for shortcuts and apps that are associated with that key. One of the other interesting features is the flick gesture, which inserts the first SwiftKey-like prediction when you, well, flick your thumb up the board. My biggest gripe about the keyboard is the fact that I have to see it every time that I am using the phone. Whereas the Priv has the sliding mechanism to mask its keyboard when you aren't using it, the KEYone's stares you in the face. This reduces the screen size to 4.5" and a 3:2 aspect ratio. I understand that this design choice was made in the spirit of the BlackBerries of old, but I can't say that I am a fan. And if you don't like the physical keyboard or just don't want to use it all of the time, you can use the software version. However, unlike the Priv, this is not the best option. A full-screen keyboard on this smaller display is not the most pleasant of experiences. The fingerprint sensor is fantastic. Embedded in the space bar, it's lightning quick and very accurate. Only Huawei's sensors have proven so reliable for me, which should tell you something. The front of the phone has the screen, the capacitive navigation buttons, the keyboard, and the front camera (and earpiece/sensors) along the upper aluminium bezel. The back has the rather large camera module (there's still a hump, by the way, despite this thing being a brick) and BlackBerry logo. On the top of the frame, you will find the 3.5mm headphone jack. The left side only has the power button, while the bottom houses the speaker grilles and the USB Type-C 3.1 port. Finally, the right side is home to the SIM tray, volume rocker (which feels cheap and hollow) and what BlackBerry calls the "Convenience Key." Both it and the power button feel only slightly more solid than the volume rocker and I'd honestly rather see one of them be textured or differentiated in some way from the other. Just because they're on opposite sides of the phone does not mean I didn't mix them up from time to time. The Convenience Key is a tertiary button that is customizable and can be mapped to almost any action you want. It can open a certain app, activate one of many shortcuts, or perform a few system functions like power off. At this moment, I have it mapped to Google Now since Assistant is tied to a long press of the home button. Let's just say that I've opened Now a lot more than I usually do. It's cool to see BlackBerry trying to cater in some form to power users by adding in this key. At least this isn't chained to a useless virtual assistant. Overall, the KEYone is well-built, but it is a polarizing device in its design and construction. Some people will love it, while I think that most won't. It doesn't have the sneaky, incognito aspect that the Priv did, which is not necessarily a bad thing. Whether you like the look of the phone or not is entirely up to you — I'm just not the biggest fan of it. Display When discussing the KEYone's display, most will inevitably focus on the aspect ratio, i.e. its general shape. BlackBerry went with something decidedly more square than what most of us are used to. Despite this, the 1620x1080 IPS panel is crisp, clear, and quite bright. I am rather fond of the color reproduction, and I found this to be one of the more accurate panels that I've used. There's even an sRGB mode. The viewing angles are superb and the screen is just a joy to look at. It also gets very bright for outdoor use. The display is not the KEYone's strongest aspect, but nor is it the weakest. The resolution is more than adequate especially given the total screen size. There really isn't that much more to say on the matter: great screen, awesome colors, but it won't blow you away. Battery life With a 3,505mAh battery, you'd expect the KEYone to last a long time. I mean, that's one of the features that BlackBerry is hoping encourages people to buy this phone. The good news is that it is certainly above average. After using Huawei and Xiaomi devices for the last few months, I have gotten used to a phone that can easily get me through a day, so I am glad that this one continues the trend. During my testing, I had the screen at 100% brightness with plenty of texting, emailing, messaging, and several attempts to watch YouTube videos and play games. Not only did I get over five hours of screen-on-time, but the idle drain on the battery was practically negligible. The largest battery to ever come in a BlackBerry phone and the screen resolution help to contribute to the claim that you can get 26 hours of "mixed use," but if you run low, Qualcomm's Quick Charge 3.0 is supported. When you plug the phone in, you are presented with two options: Charge Only and Boost Mode. The latter is touted as "giving you the most efficient charge possible, even if you only have a few minutes." Good on BlackBerry for making another phone with good battery life. It's pretty damn stellar. Audio When I think of a BlackBerry, I don't always picture a phone with the best sound quality and output. Sure, it might get the job done, but you know what I mean. In all fairness, the KEYone is not meant to be your media player — rather, it's not supposed to be the one on your desk that pleases your ears the most. It gets the job done, that's about all I can say. The sound that pushes out of the headphone jack is tolerable and works just fine for the gym or other activities where you won't be lugging around high fidelity cans. The external speaker is subpar, even considering that this is a smartphone. For music or notifications, there is plenty of distortion and crackling at 80%+ volume. The cacophony at that level is awful, so I've left the KEYone in vibrate-only most of the time. At least the phone has a good vibration motor. Call quality & connectivity When I first received the KEYone and inserted my SIM card, I was sorely unimpressed. Mobile data would not work due to a problem with the APN settings and the phone presented me with an annoying notification telling me that there was a problem. After some digging and chatting with "people in the know," I found out that this was a known issue with this pre-production build of the software and it was being addressed in preparation for the final release. After manually setting up the APN for my MVNO carrier, my wireless connectivity has been passable. Call quality reached my expectations — Bluetooth and WiFi have also been reliable. I have had my LG Watch Urbane (Android Wear 2.0), Moto 360, and Samsung Gear S3 connected to it during my entire usage. None have had any issues staying connected, nor did I have trouble with any of the Bluetooth headsets I tried. Reception, however, was another matter entirely. The phone constantly dropped calls or failed to make them at all. I also frequently lost data connection or experienced slower speeds than what I am used to on my carrier. The KEYone also experienced cell signal holes that have never been there — I went through a hole near my house every day, but all of my other devices were just fine in the same area (same SIM, etc). It was extremely frustrating. Camera I'll admit: I went into all of this not expecting much from the camera. Come on, it's a BlackBerry. But seriously, the KEYone's is legitimately good. It performs well in low-light environments with post-processing that is kind to photos. I'm certainly glad to see BlackBerry carry on where the Priv's camera left off. With all of that being said, it cannot quite hold its own next to the Pixel, GS8/GS7, or even the P10. The KEYone can put out good-quality pictures that are crisp in detail, but with some aggressive smoothing in post-processing. Those of you who pay attention will notice that the KEYone packs the same sensor as the Pixel, the IMX378. While that certainly can lend itself to good photos, it's not the be-all, end-all. My opinion is that this is one of those phones where it's more difficult to take a bad picture. This camera is like a jack-of-all-trades — you'll get great outdoor, indoor, and nighttime photos. Will they have that so-called "Wow!" factor? Well, that depends on you. Moving around to the front, BlackBerry opted for an 8MP fixed focus, 84° wide angle shooter. LCD flash is also included. Supposedly, this is best suited for those video conferences where you're not in a position to get somewhere with better lighting. This is the official blurb on the matter: "For times when you have to take a video conference on the go, the device includes an 8MP front camera with fixed focus, LCD flash, and 84-degree wide angle lens." Just own up to the fact that you put in an LCD flash for selfies; there's nothing wrong with that. Wrapping all of this up, let's go over the camera UI. It's basic, but in a good way. In Auto, you are presented with the upper bar that has the settings for flash, timer, aspect ratio, and HDR, as well as the general options. Along the bottom is the gallery preview, front/rear camera switcher, shutter button, mode selection, and visual effects. In the options, you have the control mode, where you choose between auto and manual. Then there's the JPEG fine or standard compression choices, face detection, and video resolution stuff. The KEYone can go all the way up to 4K30fps, but you lose "enhanced video stabilization" above 1080p30, which is kind of a bummer. Contrast this camera app UI with something from Huawei and you'll see why I am a huge fan. There aren't as many options, but what's there is useful and mostly necessary. Good job, BlackBerry. Previous Next Software When the Priv launched a year and a half ago, the general consensus seemed to be that the software was good. Much like Motorola and OnePlus, BlackBerry has gone with a "stock+" take on Android, i.e. where Google's vision is kept intact, but useful features are added on top to better the user experience. The KEYone follows the same logic, though with Nougat 7.1.1 running underneath this time around. The BlackBerry brand is built on security, reliability, and stability. When the company shifted over to Android from the corpse that was BB OS, it brought with it some of the hallmarks upon which it had built its reputation. There was a commitment to updating to the latest monthly security patches, the DTEK security suite, and even some hardware modifications that all helped to ensure users had the safest and most secure take on Android. Now we're here with the KEYone and that focus is still on-point. On the surface, the software looks like stock Android, but there's a bunch running under the hood, from the apps to the settings and options. I'll go through both of those elements in their own sub-sections to follow. I think you'll be as surprised as I was in regard to the level of depth and detail with each addition made. Not all of it is useful, in my opinion, but it's there. BlackBerry apps This is one of the pillars for BlackBerry's plan to draw potential customers. My time with BlackBerry's phones was so long ago that I hardly remember what BB OS was like (and I never even used v10). Even if I did, I can tell you right now that I was not a hardcore user, so the KEYone gave me my first experience with a lot of the apps that BlackBerry loyalists swear by. The Hub app is where it's at, at least in terms of sheer power user capability. This functions as a place where you can see all of your messages, emails, texts, and other related notifications. It pulls from Gmail, your default SMS app, IM services, and various social media platforms like Facebook, Instagram, Pinterest, and LinkedIn. Due to the volume of incoming emails and the email-fu that I am forced to do each day, I ignore Gmail in Hub. It was just too difficult since it still doesn't support the tabbed inbox or filters/labels as well as I'd like. You can also set up custom views for Hub, where you select what accounts will show up — this is how I was able to successfully "ignore" Gmail. For enterprise users, this could be the way you separate your work and personal data. While this is all great, I frankly got bored when trying to make Hub work to my advantage. It can take a lot of work, time, and effort to get it the way you want it. I have no doubt that some people will do this, because there is much power to be had in the app, but it is not for everyone.   Nipping at the heels of Hub in terms of marketing importance, we have DTEK. Though it's still being hyped just like it was when the Priv launched, it remains a mostly useless, feel-good example of the placebo effect. You're presented with red Xs, yellow exclamation points, and green check-marks that denote your level of security in various areas. It's a centralized location to show the average user the basics of Android security, which isn't a bad thing. I suppose I am shrugging it off because I know what I'm doing when it comes to this stuff and my perfectionist/completionist nature hates not seeing green check marks. Since I am not going to change my usage habits, then I might as well not look at annoying yellow exclamation points. For those of you who are wondering what my DTEK status is, I am sitting firmly at "Fair." As annoying as that is, at least I am using a BlackBerry device (because that's one of the security checks). I can sleep a bit better tonight knowing that. If you hit green on all criteria, then your needle will be in the "Excellent" range on the gauge. Good for you.   DTEK is actually worth a damn when it comes to showing what apps are accessing certain permissions and notifying you when they do. Or you can have it inform you when a specific application is requesting certain permissions. For example, I can tell DTEK to let me know when something accesses my calendar or to notify me when Action Launcher alone tries to read it. There are certain people who will love this — I am not one of them. BBM is here, for some reason. It's still the same old app and I really don't feel like going over it. Basically, if you use BBM then you know what it is. If you don't, you're not missing much. There's still no SMS functionality; Android Messages is your default out of the box. The Calendar app is cool, I guess. It still has the "Meeting Mode," which automatically silences your phone when you're in a meeting according to your calendar. There are also options for creating events in different time zones from the system one and whether or not the app informs you if events conflict. It's a neat take, but I wouldn't call it special. Finally, there are various note-taking, task, password management, and photo markup apps. None are particularly worth paying attention to and I am sure there are better offerings from either Google or other third-party developers. I don't want to waste too much time with them. Settings & general UI Apps are great and all, but what about overall user interface? Like I said, the software is "stock+" Android. It looks, feels, and functions much like Nougat would on a Nexus or Pixel, but there are additional options to play with. Most of them lie in the display settings menu, so I'll address some of them. There's the color balance slider (for cool or warm, or somewhere in between) How you want the Recents menu to look — you have the choice of Rolodex, which is the normal way, Tiles, and Masonry A green bar along the edge of the screen that shows the battery level remaining while charging (it's neat and I've seen it before in custom ROMs) An option to double tap to wake/sleep the phone. There's one final piece that I want to address in more detail. It's called the Productivity Tab and it exists as a small white bar on the far right edge of the screen (its position and thickness can be adjusted). If you've used Action Launcher and the Quickpage feature, then that's basically how this works. If you have no idea what I'm talking about, the Productivity Tab pulls out from the side of the screen and has five sections. The first is a calendar widget showing you what you have going on that day or the next. After that is a Hub shortcut to show you any unread messages. Sections 3 and 4 are a todo and contacts list, respectively. Finally, there's a settings sub-menu for the Tab, where you adjust position, transparency, height, thickness, etc. I like the Productivity Tab for little more than the calendar widget, which is exactly what I use the Quickpage for in my default Action Launcher setup.    The other addition you'll see in the system settings is for the Convenience Key, which I mentioned all the way back up closer to the top of this review. It's the thing under the volume rocker that looks/feels exactly like the power button. Oh, yeah, you can map it to open whatever app or shortcut you want. I find it mostly useless. but some may find it to their liking. The sub-menu itself is pretty straightforward: it shows you what the key does, what action is currently assigned to it, the option to clear said action, and a short list of what you can map to it. Here's what's available to choose: "Open app" will bring up a list of everything you have installed "Speed dial" allows you to set a contact to the key (don't do this) "Send message" allows you to open either an email or a text to send to a specific contact "All shortcuts" brings up a long list of all the shortcuts that BlackBerry thinks you could ever use/need. Once you make your choice, that's what the Convenience Key will do until you select something else. It only works when the screen is on and unlocked, so keep that in mind. There's a gestures section, but it only has the toggle for the double-tap power button for camera shortcut. Not sure why this is off on its own, but whatever. The sound settings still has the "Notify during calls" and "Flip to mute" options — I disabled the former because who needs that. The security area is actually almost stock, except for the picture password. By the way, skip that, too. Developer options has the sRGB mode toggle I mentioned earlier (which always turns itself off when I back out of the menu), but it's missing the OEM unlock entry. Because this is BlackBerry, so no unlocking or rooting for you. Everything else is all the same as a Nexus or Pixel. BlackBerry Launcher, the default out of the box, is pretty basic. You have the option for those keyboard shortcuts and little else of note. After I toyed around with it for a bit, I moved on to Action Launcher. The notification shade and Quick Settings are also just like stock with the same animations and everything.   If you're super paranoid about people peering over your shoulder to look at the stuff on your screen, BlackBerry provides you with the Privacy Shade (via the Play Store). This prevents others from physically seeing private and sensitive content by blocking out everything except for a tiny viewing area. How big this little window is depends on what size you want, but even with Privacy Shade active, you can still interact with your screen. It's neat, I suppose. You can adjust the shape and background transparency via the little menu that appears when the Shade is active. Performance The Snapdragon 625 powering all of this is not too bad of a chip. Though decidedly midrange and a year old at this point, it carried the KEYone along better than I would have thought initially. However, after about a week, the lags, stutters, and hiccups started to settle in, with the most noticeable being exiting the camera app, constant homescreen redraws, and apps not remaining in memory very well. The camera thing was especially bad when I used the power button shortcut to launch the camera from a locked state; exiting after this caused the phone to hang for almost thirty seconds. Following that, there'd be another forty-five seconds of unresponsiveness, even from the fingerprint sensor or power button. Suffice to say, it was quite annoying and dismaying. I am not sure whether this is a bug in the pre-production software or not; regardless, it was irritating and made using that shortcut more than useless. As time went on, the sheer sluggishness of the phone became quite apparent. Animations would lag, the whole OS would hang when launching apps at random intervals, and my homescreen redrew every time I went back home (I used BlackBerry, Action, and Nova Launcher — all with the same result). I also experienced some seriously aggressive RAM management/problems. As an example, I opened a new app for the first time and needed to sign in. I knew my password, but needed my 2FA code. Switching over to Authy, I grabbed the code and double-tapped the recents button to switch back to the original app... only to find that it needed to reload, requiring my credentials again. After all of that, the 2FA code had expired. Rinse and repeat; I just used Authy on my PC to get signed in after a near instance of rage quitting. That's just a singular example, but things like that happened often. Geekbench 4 was having troubles The Adreno 506 GPU is pretty capable, though. The only problem is that there is no reason to game on this phone — not only is the screen quite small for such an activity, but the keyboard and overall design of the phone's face make gaming uncomfortable. The GPU is just wasted potential, I'd say. These issues could be related to this pre-production hardware and software, but there was a point at which the KEYone became unusable. These problems persisted through reboots. Performance for the first several days was quite good, but it deteriorated very rapidly. Surprisingly so, actually, which made the disappointment I felt seem worse. I should note that I will be retesting everything with a production model when the phone is released to see if these issues persist. Value As we near the end of this journey review, I'm left with a few questions. The one I will ask and hopefully answer in this penultimate section is this: Is the KEYone worth it? Besides the horribly stylized name and physical keyboard, what is the value proposition of this phone? It will retail for $549 USD, which puts it at the high end of the midrange spectrum. That's still a hefty sum for a year-old SoC and some very fast performance degradation, even though both of those come with a decent screen, good camera, and awesome overall software experience. Even with all of the security stuff and the keyboard, I am not entirely convinced that $549 is a good price. $349 is probably the most that I would pay for this phone, especially when you consider that a Pixel is $100 more than the asking price ($650) or that a OnePlus 3T starts at $440. Both phones come with better internals, a similar overall UI/UX, and better cameras. What makes the MSRP even more painful is the subpar performance (note: again, this could be related to the pre-production hardware/software), something that I cannot in good conscience ignore or fail to mention in this regard. You will be much happier with what OnePlus, Google, and even Samsung have to offer you. BlackBerry is likely going to aim this at the enterprise, which may not care about the price tag as much as us normal consumers. Those users, however, do want a phone that's going to work well no matter what they're doing. The long and short of it is that if you're considering this phone as one of your options, then I'd say go with the OnePlus 3T as the best value for your money; if your budget is a little more flexible, then go with a Pixel or Galaxy S8. If you're really interested in one of these, just wait until they go on sale. Conclusion So who is the KEYone for, exactly? According to BlackBerry, it's meant for: "people who use their phones more for communication rather than media consumption, people who are tired of having the same one as everyone else, people who are professionals and rely on their phone to get things done, and people who are looking for something durable that will last through a busy day." If you want my opinion (and you did just read this whole thing, so why wouldn't you), I would say that the KEYone is for the BlackBerry power user of yore. I never was one, but I do know a few who still talk about their old phones. This phone is for them. Minus the DTEK50 and DTEK60, the KEYone is BlackBerry's (and TCL's) latest real attempt at the Android side of things since the Priv. From my time with it, the KEYone failed at providing a good user experience, even though it is a little eccentric and anachronistic in a cute way. BlackBerry returned to its roots with this phone, its aim fixed squarely on the fans of old. Personally, I happen to prefer the glass slabs that we have nowadays and I think that the KEYone is a relic of a long bygone age. I eventually adjusted to the form factor and physical keyboard, but even after reaching that point, I still did not enjoy typing (versus my current neutral feeling on the matter with the software versions). Simply put, I do not like the KEYone. I do, however, appreciate a solid, well-built device even if it is a brick. But good construction is only a single criterion when evaluating a device for recommendation and I don't think that the average consumer or even an Android nerd would enjoy using this phone. It's kind of ugly, bulky, dense, and one of the main draws, the keyboard, is a novelty at best. This is definitely a niche product and I usually frown on that because it's so limiting — honestly, that's probably just the business student in me talking. BlackBerry/TCL clearly have a target market for the KEYone that they believe is slavering for it (I am certainly not in it). That being said, narrowing down to a specific demographic does not excuse a poor user experience. I've said it plenty of times in this review, but I'll say it again: I know that the model I have is pre-production hardware and software. Bugs, janks, and other oddities are to be expected. There was supposed to be an update for the review units, but I have not received it as of this writing. I like what the KEYone is trying to be and do. It's a quirky little thing that was actually fun to use sometimes just because it's so different. The "stock+" Android is also quite refreshing and helped to subdue some of my frustrations early on. But being unique with great software cannot carry a phone through the trials that this phone presented. And no, the irony of this is not lost on me — I usually get the phones with outstanding hardware and bogus software. The Snapdragon 625 is a decent chip in its own right; on paper, I should have never had the problems I did. Odds are, either you have already decided that you want one of these or your company's IT department will purchase them in bulk. In both of those cases, I wish you the best and hope that you have the best experience that this phone has to offer. Perhaps the issues I've had will be fixed with production hardware or a few software updates down the line, or maybe it's all been down to bad luck in the silicon lottery (#jordansluck). But I just have a feeling that the KEYone will go down as one of those Android phones that has a cult following, but is ultimately worth more in a few years as an antique than as a daily driver today.

It probably has its niche, but I agree that the era of the keyboard phone has passed, and for good reason. I'll take my big screen and easy one-handed typing, and honestly, I sincerely doubt I would ever be faster on a hardware keyboard. We're all so used to software boards and such autocomplete wizards that I bet 90% of people out there would never get close to matching their speed with a touchscreen on one of these chiclet boards. I also don't really think the camera seems like anything all that special, at least based on the samples here. Nick Becker Honestly, the physical keyboard was the only reason I was considering getting one of these. What I really want, though, is a new version of the HTC G2/Desire Z. YaKillaCJ I still have 1 in a drawer somewhere. That device was awesome and innovative. Hmm, maybe if HTC should look into the keyboard. Nick Becker I still have mine, too. It's just too old now for modern apps. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Phone with a 625... If you're not getting the Z Play, you're doing it wrong.... And well I completely agree with you on hardware keyboards being ridiculous in 2017 robogo Lenovo P2. Same specs, 5100 mAh battery. steadymobb Will the p2 ever get 7.0 though? Prob not... tonkerdog1 . No keyboard. Made of plastic and no Blackberry software. Completely different phone. robogo Was referring to the similarities with the Z Play. Sohit Especially considering the LG G6 is on sale for $500 Francois Nguyen I actually HATE most touchscreen keyboards, even if if's for typing small messages. I even hated landscape mechanical keyboards because I always break the sliding mechanism over time -_-. Being used to portrait mechanical keyboards (and old PC keyboards from the 90s) for so long, the only cellphones that lasted for me were a BB Q10 for 2 years (and a Palm Treo 680 for 5 years before that). I abused the heck out of Android Runtime for gathering my most needed apps. I tried iOS for 1 year and never got used to the keyboard. I tried several Android phones that didn't last 3 months for me. I'm glad now that the KEYone will show up in June 2017, even if it's WAY too late for me and I'm ironically not interested in buying it lol. Jack ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ mostly nostalgia. Honestly I will buy it if the price drops to $400 level YaKillaCJ My bet is the lags are due to stock 7.1.1. The 625 is very capable of everyday task proven by other OEMs. Something Xiaomi's Miui has a huge advantage over nearly everyone, optimization while including plethora of features. Proven by the Redmi Note 3 Pro (SD650) and Redmi Note 4x (SD625). Plus this price is just too much and I said it when it was announced. Yet so many nay sayers were upset at my comment siting its niche product. While a Niche allows it to be sold for more than Xiaomi and Huawei offerings, it doesn't justify pricing past Flagship specs. This cost more than OnePlus 3/T, ZTE Axon 7 & Xiaomi Mi5 that offer Flagship specs/hardware, thriving OEMs and update history. Not to mention Miui and OxygenOS. Blackberry should drop the price and use Android 7.0 instead until Google themselves stabilize Android 7.1.x. Miku is Best Vocaloid I don't think it's an issue with the Android version. My Moto Z Play has been running LineageOS ever since it became official and I haven't encountered any lag issues, even after a few weeks. If an unofficial version of 7.1 can run perfectly on the 625, there's no reason OEM 7.1 can't run properly on it. YaKillaCJ My key words were stock. As in they never optimized the Android software. Great examples is how Miui and OxygenOS takes whatever version and clearly tweak and optimize it. So I'm not surprised LOS runs great, it includes a modified/optimized kernel, drivers, blobs, default apps, etc tailored for your device. Throwing straight up stock versions of Android that basically just runs without optimization nor bug fixes is something TCL is known for. Look at Blu for example. HabsSuck what a hate on commentary, come to expect it from some HumbleButBlunt Although I agree with your comment I find it hilarious coming from someone who's screen name is "HabsSuck". DEVVVV Too bad BlackBerry continues to do what got them in trouble in the first place. this is due to total lack of innovation. Blackberry was a one hit wonder and if they don't get someone in there that possesses innovation they are done. HumbleButBlunt They are already done making devices... tonkerdog1 . Who makes the IPhone? Apple.......nope HumbleButBlunt Your comment is completely irrelevant here and lacking any intellectual value. Apple is legally considered a hardware design and manufacturing company and they reap all of the amazing profits from their overly high set profit margins. BlackBerry is legally a software company that has no footprint in the hardware design and manufacturing business anymore. Apple does ALL of the R&D and then pays multiple 3rd party manufacturers under contract to manufacture the iPhone for them under the premise that all of their terms are met. Those companies CANNOT; under any circumstance: utilize any of those products within another product, whatsoever. Why? Because it is Apple's intellectual property. Because of those facts, In BlackBerry's case, they have a say in the overall design but they do not do the R&D. BlackBerry does not pay for the materials and they do not pay a 3rd party manufacturer to make the devices. Instead, they license the Brand and their Patents. The manufacturer owns all of the intellectual property (except the brand and the Patents) and therefore owns most of the profit. Nate650 Total lack of innovation!? This phone showcases innovation in many ways, such as the capacitive keyboard which they have a patent on. The same can't be said about the popular iPhone. All Apple has basically done in the last five generations is change the screen size. Michael Tran Does it have always listening "ok google" That would be a dealbreaker for me if it doesn't have it. Pat Richardson Your reasoning about the keyboard does not work for me. "Easy one hand typing" isn't even a thing anymore now that phones are 5.5" to 6" and touch/swype (word prediction selected "tofu") is a pain because of poor predictions. Since there is only one small flag ship phone (Sony xperis compact) one hand typing shouldn't even be an argument against a physical keyboard, which is more accurate, quick, and does not require looking at the keys. Every other word on swipe I swear I have to rewrite because of horrible predictions. And touch doing is no better since you cannot feel the keys I agree with everything else toy said about the phone though. Marcelove Start using Swiftkey and stop complaining...😉 Pat Richardson That's funny because that's what I'm using ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ I used it. It's sh1t. As with every other bajillion VKB out there. I don't need keyboards that try to learn and output what it thinks I'm typing. I need a keyboard to output what I type, nothing more. Capacitive screens are inherently inaccurate. Imparus The size isn't really an argument when it comes to keyboard, pretty much every keyboard support "one hand" mode, where you can make it smaller, so even if it is big you can still reach all the letters with one hand. Pat Richardson While I can concede to this, phones are no longer small enough for one-hand general use. Trying to tap that top right button with your left hand puts you at risk of dropping your phone, so you mostly operate your phone with two hands anyway. To make a keyboard smaller for one hand typing is counter-intuitive for a screen size that's more operable with two hands. Maybe during situational uses the one handed mode is fine. Anyway, despite this argument the physical keyboard I find is much more accurate and comfortable than touch typing. Winston They know there's a very dedicated niche dedicated to this class of smartphone, and seeing how they're the only player in a field with very dedicated fans, I don't blame them for charging the significant margin. Chris Oh "LCD" flash??? David Ruddock The screen flashes white. DEVVVV the screen flashes white?? So that must mean only for selfies. what if I am doing a recording? and want to see how it is recording in real time?? ecnjnr Tbmobn fby Uo B Mayoo Did it hurt when you fell on your keyboard? Kieron Quinn Maybe they just put their KEYone in their pocket ecnjnr 6P ;) ecnjnr My virtual keyboard posted this from my pocket, lol. Can't wait for a physical keyboard phone. Mayoo http://whatyearisit.info/img/what_year_is_it.jpg ecnjnr 2017 :) Miku is Best Vocaloid There's something called "locking" you may have heard of it :^) Cinj Still don't understand why BB dumped their own OS in favor of Android, especially since BB10 was capable of running Android apps. That's like buying a Mac just to format the drive and put Windows on it, what's the point? I bought my mom a Blackberry Classic and it's a great little phone especially for more tech challenged people who don't need or want all the bells and whistles that come with the two major players. If BB is going to shift to just making mediocre Android phones, they may as well close up shop already. Francois Nguyen Some reasons I guess (based on my own experience with BBOS 10): - Software AND hardware issues on double-tapping on the hardware keyboard - lack of apps - lack of support from major players (facebook, BB itself) Cinj My response to each point: - No opinion since I haven't encountered this - 99% of apps are garbage so no big deal - You can't as easily help clog the internet with pics of the unimpressive food you just ate, unfunny memes, and "like, share, and type amen or you're going to hell" spam? How will humanity survive??? - Quite the opposite. BB is way less obtuse in it's interface than the constantly changing Android one. Android and it's apps are like a hieroglyphic tile puzzle that keeps getting shuffled with every update. Try teaching a tech illiterate parent how to operate Android, I dare you. - Neither of those really have a distinct advantage over the other. But it's nice to have options all the same. - See previous opinion on apps Not trying to slam you or anything, just giving my take. I think we need more options in the marketplace, not less. That's really my main gripe. But I know that's a fantasy because people generally gravitate towards a duality, so for now we're stuck with iOS and Android until some paradigm shift occurs. Francois Nguyen My responses to your responses lol: - it's not a widespread issue; it's not surprising a lot of people didn't know about it - that 1 % of good and varied apps is what everyone I know (tech illiterate or not) makes the switch to iOS or Android so I wouldn't ignore that - I agree with you on your statement. Most consumers disagree on this, though... My friends ABSOLUTELY need to tell the world what they eat for supper and what they read when they're in the bathroom, for example. - Most people that tried my BB Q10 or any Z10 in kiosk ABSOLUTELY disagree with your statement. They're all biased towards iOS or Android, I know (me too, BTW). But that's how sad the situation is when BB got too late to the consumer market. There's no incentive to switch OS. About teaching Android to a tech illiterate, I always did that to several 65+ years people in my neighborhood who never touched a PC in their daily life because it's too complicated for them. In short, BB OS = complicated, Android = easy, iOS = too easy. YMMV. - That's not a big issue now for developers. It's gonna be an issue when most apps (garbage or not) require Kitkat or later. Lack of incentive for devs = lack of enthusiasm for the platform. Winston Compatibility =/= native support. android apps run TERRIBLY on BB10 Cinj To be fair, most Android apps run terribly on Android too. And you're really not missing anything if you're unable to run most of the schlock that infests the play store anyway. Metallinatus Android apps have Google Play Services on Android, which is essential for a hell load of apps to work.... DEVVVV Chen ruined BlackBerry HumbleButBlunt Looks like the stock market disagrees with you. Nate650 The answer is simple: it didn't sell well and the lack of an ecosystem. Being able to run Android apps is not the same as having access to Google Play. ecnjnr I hope Blackberry resolves the performance issues by launch, or I'm reconsidering my purchase. Thanks for the review Jordan Palmer You and me both. ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ I'm just curious if you guys ever got updates. Some other reviewers stated they got at least 3 updates after receiving the review unit. Jordan Palmer I received a single update after this review went live. So far, it has only fixed some of my cell connectivity issues. Nothing else. Suicide_Note Even if they do that, it's still a mediocre phone. ecnjnr I'm a fan of physical keyboards. This phone is a Moto Z Play with a slightly bigger battery, a newer version of Android, a better camera and a physical keyboard. That's worth $100 to me, but maybe not for you. freshprince_87 Moto Z Play has a bigger battery Nate650 Bigger by a whopping 5 mAh. freshprince_87 Yep. Makes all the difference Miku is Best Vocaloid You can wait for the Moto Mod that will have a physical keyboard. ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ If they do a portrait version that is. Martin Rios Dude it depends on the market... Yeah say that "virtual keyboards are better than physical keyboards, swipe, etc.) but there are some folks that are waiting for the rise (or maybe it's the hype) for these kind of devices. Also another point is this sentence >>> "people who use their phones more for communication rather than media consumption, people who are tired of having the same one as everyone else, people who are professionals and rely on their phone to get things done, and people who are looking for something durable that will last through a busy day" >>> I'M ONE OF THEM. I can give less than a f*ck about aesthetics, ceramic look and all that crap, what I want is to be able to comfortably reply my company emails, open docs, scan paperwork, take crisp photos on the field and not sweating the cold if the phone ever slips from my hand (which I doubt). Sure phone must pass through IT Dept to block lost of sh!t like social media but I have my personal phone for that. I'm hoping a OEM in the near future release a phone with nowadays hardware and inspired by a Nokia E7-00, by the way that's my company device (I rejected a trashy Samsung Grand Prime the company tried to make me use, instead I went to Ebay and got a cheap yet efficient Nokia with a horizontal keyboard, Symbian, a decent camera and EAS capabilities). Nate650 Yea, it's a big issue. I still experience performance issues on my Priv. The Priv would be such an amazing device if they address those issues, but it's already been over a year old and they haven't. Do employees even use their own phones? They have to know about these issues by now. Kawshik Ahmed Does the stock 'Blackberry Launcher' supports Android 7.1's 'Launcher Shortcuts' or you have to use a 3rd party launcher ?? Muzaffar I don't understand that BB named it KEYone instead of Mercury. Venice also looks promising at first but becomes flop latter. Nate650 The name is the least of their problems. The performance issues and price are more important. Muzaffar That's why it becomes a flop. paul4tA I skimmed most of the review and went straight to the performance, because if they haven't fixed that from the PRIV, nothing else matters. I love my physical keyboard and have actually come to appreciate some of the other features over time, but I don't think I can take another year of the terrible performance, waiting sometimes minutes for the software to catch up with me. Nate650 It's interesting that not all the reviews mentioned poor performance. That leads me to believe there is a particular culprit and that it's fixable. Jordan L 2 things: I need this on Verizon for one of my bosses, and where can I buy it? Jordan Palmer Updated the buy link. It's up in the specs. BB will be releasing a CDMA version sometime near the end of the month, I think. John Just hold off for 10 years or so until Blackberry's keyboard patents expire and we'll see it put to use by more competent manufacturers. HumbleButBlunt BB doesn't manufacture devices anymore. Cuvis They still hold the patents, and license them to TCL. HumbleButBlunt Yep, that is very true. Licensing out patents isn't manufacturing though and the initial comment was specific to manufacturers. Cuvis Not really. The poster was talking about Blackberry's keyboard patents expiring, and the comment about manufacturers could be talking about Blackberry's current licensees (ie TCL) rather than Blackberry itself. HumbleButBlunt You're absolutely correct, he could have been. He is an active Disqus member though and if that were the case, I would certainly expect that he would add that clarification when I replied to him or at least within the last 11 days. That makes it difficult to assume he wasn't just taking a troll-shot at BB not realizing he was out of the loop with what he thought was true. I will agree that I assumed that he didn't know that information, based off of the delivery of his message. ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ Probably earlier, when someone somewhere somehow leaks it China and other knockoff makers start building them. RickMLA Battery pull. Fixes everything. Francois Nguyen Battery is non-removable on the KEYone... ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ Hold the power button for 32 seconds = Battery Pull Reset. JL It´s incredibly horrible! Dragos Lucian So Blackberry is starting to be like an ass itch, and I bet the majority doesn't like that feel. And while we're at it: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Rla7wt8wKGM djinn123 Just because you don't like PKB's it doesn't mean they aren't for someone else. I'm tired of hearing "who uses PKBs these days" or to that effect. If you can't understand why some people NEED it, then maybe you can just stfu? Stefan Seidel Is the keyboard touch sensitive like on the Priv? That's by far the most favourite feature on my Priv, and I'm sad everytime it doesn't work in an app. Also, as to add something useful to the physical versus virtual keyboard discussion: - multi-lingual virtual keyboards have only come up recently. I frequently write in different languages, and having to manually switch between them just doesn't work (especially when sometimes you insert a word from another language in the middle of a sentence) - I am a Sysadmin and every so often I do need to get in to some server from my phone. Doing that with a on-screen keyboard is nothing short of having a hot iron stamp on your forehead. Having the full screen AND quick and easy access to non-alphanumeric characters is such a huge plus that it would justify any price (if you need it for work/serious business). I agree that using Swype or Gboard with swiping is pretty darn good when it comes down to just blurting out some natural language. Anything beyond that is a pain. J.L. “J7” Gatewood StarrWulfe Yes to every point here. 1. you can have one main language and 2 secondary languages on the blackberry keyboard. Type in English or Spanish for example, and get spellcheck/suggestions for both without switching anything. Not sure if this works with Asian languages though; I need to switch into Japanese all the time. 2. You can turn one of the shift keys into CTRL. There's also a virtual keyboard that will only display TAB and SUPER keys somewhere in the Play Store. Just long press space and switch to that when running Termux and SSH your heart out; this is also my #1 reason for wanting this phone. Hamilton Jimenez Vasquez I think physical keyboards are way better than touchscreen keyboards, but.... I wouldnt switch my large 5.7 and beautiful screen just to have a nicer keyboard, not in this world. Not sir. dabug91 So annoyed that this phone even exists. Blackberry needs to do the world a favor and permanently exit the smartphone business. They should have closed shop more than 6 years ago. Nate650 And how would that benefit you? Martins Nkem AndroidPolice and the rest needs to start pairing phones and reviewers better. What good does it do when the reviewer has already made up his mind about the device before trying it out. tonkerdog1 . I've had mine since Saturday and love it. I've only charged it twice! The keyboard is great, and the shortcuts are fantastic. Coming from apple I love the hub and the extra security is a nice to have. The camera is very nearly as good as my S7 edge, and I much prefer the textile rear. Who cares about 32gb of internal storage, when an extra 64gb costs about £10. People keep on harping on about the specs of the processor, but I genuinely haven't noticed much of a difference between it and my S7. The S7 in benchmarks is much faster, but just like a car it'll be much faster to run out of battery too. DevonUK I have one (living in UK) and I can say all the software / bug issues mentioned seem to have been worked out. I am a heavy user and have had zero problems. My only issue is although the keyboard is good - it's still not as good as the old Blackberry's because it's still squished a bit, however I am finding it easier everyday but I doubt it will ever be as good. Battery life is incredible - blows away every android and iphone I have had and I have had a lot. Full day/night and still 20 plus pct in morning. Very very well built - everyone who notices the phone and asks to hold it says the same thing. Iphone 7 Plus and Samsung both look nice in TV adverts but drop one and you are buying a new one the next day. Keyone feels like you could throw it against a wall and other than maybe denting the wall you would have no issues. I have dropped it a few times and zero problems. For me the best thing about it is the Blackberry software - it just works and make life so much easier. If Blackberry offered HUB etc. for iphone they would make a fortune and once the standard android version is just as good on any android as it is on a Blackberry branded device I think it will be a game changer. I would love to see all the phone makers offering a "secured by Blackberry" version of their phones. genericanimefan Don't know what build version your model was running but the one I had for two weeks worked a charm. Yeah it was no pixel but I didn't have any noticeable slowdowns during my time, even under heavy usage. Gaming however is not something I spent any real time testing. The thing does certainly feel heavy for it's weight but I like that, it feels solid, Nokia solid. Is it that solid perhaps not but it felt a lot better than most phones I've used recently. But yeah the cost... I enjoyed using it but I really wouldn't be able to justify the price to people for what it has.

Google is now offering four free months of Google Play Music for new subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/26 2:17pm PDTMay 26, 2017 76 Plus 1 on G+ 594 Share on Facebook 94 Share on Twitter Total Shares764 Google News Right now it looks like Google is running a special offer for Google Play Music. New subscribers that sign up here can get four free months of service instead of the usual three. No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it. It could save you an extra $10. Again, this particular offer is only for new subscribers. I've been a fan of Play Music for a long time, though the device removal limit does get in the way when you switch between devices and ROMs as often as I do. Being able to mix your own library with those of a service also comes in handy. That way I can continue to support artists I am passionate about, without eschewing the larger selection of a subscription offering for the purposes of content discovery, all while being able to fill the gaps in that library. There are a lot of different music services out there, but if you're interested combining your curated library with music available via a subscription, then your options are limited. Spotify does allow you to play back locally stored files, which is convenient, but it isn't quite the same. Amazon also allows you to upload your music for playback via Amazon Music, and with Amazon Prime membership, you get a small library of streaming music to go along with that. For $10 a month ($8 for Prime members) you can access their full library as well. But, Google Play Music has a great interface and plugs nicely into all the other Google services we love. Maybe with this new offer, it's time you gave Google Play Music a chance? After all, even if it doesn't end up working out, you still got four free months of music out of the deal.

Carson Saldanha Wait, wdym 3 different countries? Did you share it with others or something? Ailín Ó’S I live in Ireland, so that's my main account. I have a secondary account based in England as part of a mail forwarder service I use, and my bf is Greek so I had him check the code on his account :) Carson Saldanha Oh wow! Carson Saldanha Hey, since I know it worked for you, are you able to use YouTube Red along with this Play Music free trial? Because my YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled for me. Ailín Ó’S No, unfortunately not as I live in the EU and YouTube Red is only available in USA. Carson Saldanha Weird, I'm in the US though. Ailín Ó’S Ooh that is odd. Sign out of the app then sign back in maybe? Carson Saldanha No luck :( I'm in contact with Google support atm Hopefully they can sort this out Mike Worth it alone for Youtube Red MisterAlex Sweet, I wasn't sure if that was included. Thanks. Should mention that in the main blog post. Ben Still no student membership >:( Ailín Ó’S Spotify is a great alternative @€$£5/month. Ben I know that's what I use just because it's half the price. Ailín Ó’S In Ireland Vodafone have a partnership with Spotify whereby it costs €5 standard instead of €10 regardless of if you're a student or not, they even bundle it with some of their plans. Vodafone do the same in some other countries they operate in (not all). Maybe see if any network in your country has a partnership like that? Worth a shot! Ben Oh yeah I'm on EE in the UK and I've got Apple Music for free for 6 months but like iTunes is a massive stinking turd. Ailín Ó’S I'd rather go back to the days of getting music via Bluetooth from friends than use crApple Music 😂😂 Rahul Krishna In india, we have play music for 1.4 usd/month Umang Ladia I'm only seeing 2 months offer in India.?? Rahul Krishna Well I subscribed to it when it launched here (about 2 months ago), so I can't confirm that. But at this price, there is nothing to be disappointed about. aRvInD I wish Spotify launches soon here. I can't keep using that patched version here...!! Rahul Krishna Me too xyz As it should be, you can't charge European or American prices in India. Rahul Krishna Yes true. There are lots​ of people here with a very cheap Android phone. They cannot pay much money. Julian Coronado That's actually what's keeping me away from Play Music. I've used my free months and I loved the Youtube Red too. But as a student, Spotify for $5 / month is too great to pass up on. Emiliejmosley Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Cakefish Spotify ftw ToniCipriani ✓pǝᴉɟᴉɹǝʌ I don't think this is a new offer, got this a while back. In fact my 4 months is expiring next week. Prefer Spotify over it. Song selection a tad bit weaker, and for foreign songs it tries to translate the song names to English and makes it hard to look up. folkrav I like it, it's way cheaper than Spotify for me - my mother, my sister, my wife and myself each pay 30$ a year and we're set - but Jesus do I hate the clients. I don't like the website's interface, I hate the Android app. But yeah, I'll deal with it cause it's cheap, I guess. Carson Saldanha Got it! Yay! Jim I wish I could somehow get it on my Amazon Echo hahaha. I guess if I had paid for a Google Home it would be worth trying out. Forget vega #getEVGA Why google play music isn't available in my country ? Ailín Ó’S Try Apple Music? They seem to be just about everywhere. Iamsecond And this is why Apple continue to dominate, because Apple are truly interested in being an international company whereas Google is just playing at it. Such a shame xyz Because Google sucks. Bartek Juszczak My GPM radio's are so good these days I love that Google is so into AI. Whether It's just "I'm being lucky" or radio from a specific song, band or album they very rarely disappoint me these days. I just make sure to thumbs up if it plays a song I particularly love. I am a student and could go cheaper with spotify but the AI generated playlists have me locked in. If it's £5 cheaper but I'm not gonna enjoy it nearly as much then it's not really a good deal. AndTheWorldMayNeverKnow I used the 3 or 4 months free trial during the holidays then bought the family plan for $14.99 a month. 4 people in my family us it and it works great, the app could use some tweaks but it's really good overall. paev If you listen to main stream music it doesn't really matter what service to use. However, if you like something unusual, weird or other languages then Google is a way to go. I found bands on Google music that Spotify displayed as not found. Google also have new synth bands that Spotify doesn't. I'm for Google too. Daniel I discovered that GPM is kinda like a music label. I once went to a section of Google play explaining how indie artists can use GPM like a music label as long as they own all their rights. Ryne Hager Ultraista (among others) keeps me using Google Play Music as well as Spotify. Carson Saldanha Does anyone else who activated the Play Music trial have YouTube Red working as well? My YT Red doesn't seem to be enabled while my Play Music is. Michael Carr I spotted a similar offer a couple of months ago, and I took it after a day or two's thought. Just last week, I moved directly into a family plan. PewPewYoureDead It's hard to recommend Google Play Music until they revamp the UI. Margaritas Ante Porcos Google Music is the only choice in some markets, like Russia, where no Spotify or Pandora are available. There are too many shortcomings in Google Music and Google never shows interest in making services better than below average. I really wonder why Google refuses to become the best at anything. Real magic here. Pixel syndrome all the way. Yet Google Music is on my phone and I use it because there's no choice whatsoever. Rob You answered your own question. If there's no alternative, then they don't have any incentive to improve the service. SupahNin10doh Stupid Dorito logo... Raymond Berger Huh, I just subscribed to the trial but you youtube red hasn't kicked in yet. Any idea how long it takes? Iamsecond If you live in the UK, about 2 years so far h20ray Google Play Music is currently available in select territories and for select account types. Umang Ladia I'm only seeing 2 months offer in India, anybody can confirm? Mohammad Ovais Yeah, same for me. Maybe it's region limited.

Arif Gürü And stil isnt available on Turkey xyz "No telling how long this offer might last, so if you have been considering subscribing, now might be the time to do it." No thanks, I'll just use YouTube. Only thing YT needs is an option to play audio only so I can save a wee bit more data when I don't need video. Cai Copley Nope. If it wasn't for the fact work pays for Spotify Premium and the fact Spotify has Crossfade to emulate a DJ system, maybe I'd give it a whirl.

Checkerboarding, upscaling, temporal anti-aliasing, dynamic resolution. Let's give credit where it's due: at its best, PlayStation 4 Pro's utilisation of these techniques produces some impressive results for 4K displays - no mean feat considering that the Pro's GPU is relatively underpowered compared to today's mainstream PC graphics hardware. And this led us to wonder - what if those techniques were rolled out in the PC space? Could the cost of admission to the world of 4K gaming drop dramatically if the techniques championed by Sony worked just as effectively for PC gamers? EuroGamer Report: More than half of streaming users are sharing their passwords There’s no denying that the television landscape is changing the days, with cable TV putting up dismal numbers (their worst ever, actually). But as more people migrate to streaming video, the scenery there is changing as well. Nearly 3 out of every 4 (72% exactly) Americans who have cable also have access to at least one streaming service and 8% of cable subscribers plan to eliminate their service in the next year. But that doesn’t necessarily mean they’re paying for their streaming service. Streaming Observer A year of Google & Apple maps Shortly after I published my Cartography Comparison last June, I noticed Google updating some of the areas we had focused on: Coincidence or not, it was interesting. And it made me wonder what else would change, if we kept watching. Would Google keep adding detail? And would Apple, like Google, also start making changes? So I wrote a script that takes monthly screenshots of Google and Apple Maps.1 And thirteen months later, we now have a year’s worth of images... Justin O'Beirne How Facebook's tentacles reach further than you think Facebook's collection of data makes it one of the most influential organisations in the world. Share Lab wanted to look "under the bonnet" at the tech giant's algorithms and connections to better understand the social structure and power relations within the company. A couple of years ago, Vladan Joler and his brainy friends in Belgrade began investigating the inner workings of one of the world's most powerful corporations. BBC Google's AlphaGo retires on top after humbling world No. 1 The Google-owned computer algorithm AlphaGo is retiring from playing humans in the ancient Chinese game of Go after roundly defeating the world's top player this week, its developer said Saturday. AlphaGo defeated brash 19-year-old world number one Ke Jie of China on Saturday to sweep a three-game series that was closely watched as a measure of how far artificial intelligence (AI) has come. Phys.org How to build your own VPN if you’re (rightfully) wary of commercial options In the wake of this spring's Senate ruling nixing FCC privacy regulations imposed on ISPs, you may be (even more) worried about how your data is used, misused, and abused. There have been a lot of opinions on this topic since, ranging from "the sky is falling" to "move along, citizen, nothing to see here." Ars Technica The 1961 Mobot Mark II had all the moves In the late 1950s, Sandia Laboratory was looking for a way to handle radioactive materials without putting humans in danger. The answer was the Mobot—short for either “remote robot” or “mobile robot”—a remotely operated system designed by Hughes Aircraft Co. in 1959 that offered a unique and effective combination of strength and dexterity. IEEE Spectrum Faster, more nimble drones on the horizon There’s a limit to how fast autonomous vehicles can fly while safely avoiding obstacles. That’s because the cameras used on today’s drones can only process images so fast, frame by individual frame. Beyond roughly 30 miles per hour, a drone is likely to crash simply because its cameras can’t keep up. MIT How Anker is beating Apple and Samsung at their own accessory game Steven Yang quit his job at Google in the summer of 2011 to build the products he felt the world needed: a line of reasonably priced accessories that would be better than the ones you could buy from Apple and other big-name brands. These accessories — batteries, cables, chargers — would solve our most persistent gadget problem by letting us stay powered on at all times. The Verge Apple is working on a dedicated chip to power AI on devices Apple Inc. got an early start in artificial intelligence software with the 2011 introduction of Siri, a tool that lets users operate their smartphones with voice commands. Now the electronics giant is bringing artificial intelligence to chips. Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. Bloomberg The history of RPGs Computers and RPGs have always gone hand-in-hand. Even when the best adventurers could hope for visually was a few letters and numbers on a screen, what better way could there be to handle stats, die-rolls and complex calculations? Soon enough, though, computer RPGs were capable of doing much more. PC Gamer Nanogenerators could charge your smartphone Researchers at the Georgia Institute of Technology have been exploring the applications and commercial potential for triboelectric nanogenerators (TENGs) since 2012. These so-called TENGs essentially harvest static electricity from friction.

But what would the future of intelligent devices look like if we could bounce from using Amazon’s Alexa to order a new book to Google Assistant to schedule our next appointment, all in the course of a single conversation? The latest episode of our AI podcast dives into this question as part of a conversation with Kitt.ai founder Xuchen Yao. Previously, developers would rely on either a clap or a button to trigger an intelligent device, which would negate the point of a “hands-free” experience. But Snowboy, a tool kit developed by Kitt.ai, solves this problem. “Before Snowboy, there was no, like, open community solution in the market,” Yao said, in a conversation with our podcast’s host, Michael Copeland. Yao noted the possibility of combining the services offered by various companies through their intelligent devices. “In the future, I would not be surprised to see a device, a 4-in-1 device, that has all the bigger companies’ backend waiting to serve you,” said Yao. “And then people can choose whoever’s services to use just by selecting this trigger word.” When Yao first tried to bring a conversational engine to the market in 2014 (Kitt.ai’s Chatflow), the closest thing that existed was Siri. But now, taking in the burgeoning development of AI technology, he’s optimistic that the next generation will experience more conversational and natural device interactions. “I imagine in five to 10 years, we’re going to have the personal assistant everywhere we go,” he predicted.

Name: Subject: Message: New Personal tab in Google Search will show results from Photos, Gmail, and more Newsby Jimmy Westenberg12 hours ago 1 274 35 Oftentimes when performing a Google Search, you’ll be shown personal results from Google Photos, Gmail, Calendar, and a variety of other services. Say, for instance, you’re looking up the word dogs. Google Search will comb through your Photos and Gmail accounts and display all the relevant dog photos and emails you may have in those services. It’s a little feature that can really come in handy at times, though these personal results don’t always show up for every search. Now Google is adding a Personal tab to Search that lets you see results from your Google applications. Once you perform a Google Search on the web or on your mobile device (unfortunately it’s not available in the Google app for Android), you’ll be able to select the Personal tab from the More dropdown menu. You’ll then be shown all relevant photos, videos, emails, and more from your Google apps relating to that topic. Plus, to give you peace of mind that these things aren’t out there for the world to see, Google will also display a “Only you can see these results” message next to each card. The addition of a Personal tab will certainly help make searching for calendar events and photos much easier. Unfortunately Google Drive and Keep support doesn’t seem to be live right now, but we’d assume support will be added in the future.

[Deal Alert] $1 Google Play movie rental (ends July 7th) Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/28 9:56am PDTMay 28, 2017 41 Plus 1 on G+ 138 Share on Facebook 54 Share on Twitter Total Shares233 Deals Google News The movie-related deals continue! Google must be paying attention to the forecasts for this weekend in anticipation of ruined family outings. There is a list up on Google Play of 100 different movies, and renting any one of them is just $1 right now with the new promo. If you haven't seen Logan, Arrival, or Get Out, now you can give it a watch on the cheap. And if the kids are starting to go crazy being trapped indoors at grandma's, you can quickly toss up Moana, Finding Dory, or The Incredibles and save yourself for an hour or two. The offer ends on July 7th, and you may have to follow specific steps to redeem it. There are a few caveats. For one, you only get one rental at this price, and two, the deal might not appear for everyone. Your deal might also be be different, some are seeing $1.50. Redeeming the offer might also be a bit awkward, as it seems to be tied to a user-specific coupon code. To use it you need to go to the Google Play Movies page and see if you have the ad visible below. Clicking the ad opens a prompt to redeem the offer. Google says that this offer is only open to specific users based on their purchase history, so YMMV. If everything goes smoothly, you'll have your $1 rental in no time. The full terms and conditions for the deal are available below. $0.99 for any movie rental Get any one movie rental of your choice for $0.99. Choose any title from the newest releases to classics including the selection below! Discount will be added to "Account => Rewards" and applied at checkout. Watch anywhere including offline on your mobile laptop tablet and supported Android devices. Redeem your offer by July 7 2017 on Google Play from compatible Internet connected devices using a Google account. Limit 1 per user. Nontransferable. No cash value. Cannot be used in conjunction with other offers or discounts except Google Play Gift Cards. This offer is open to specific Google Play users based on purchase history. Age restrictions apply.

Not sure what they're welcoming me back from. It wasn't all that long ago I rented Arrival from them. Ryne Hager I was curious what the differences by account might be. I'll update the post to include that. Hurricane Andrew Same here, I got the $1.49 deal yesterday. nagi Does not seem to be active in Hungary. Probably US-only. Arnaldo Rodriguez For me its $0.99 but when I get to the checkout, its $4.99 again s_bomb Same for me, no discount being applied Mathew Michel I'm guessing we aren't eligible since we use the discounts regularly: "This offer is open to specific Google Play users based on purchase history." s_bomb I had to click the banner advertising the deal and "accept" the deal, after that it is being applied. Gilberto Just as @s_bomb:disqus said, I had to click the banner first, and the price is $1.49 -_- me me I see the $0.99, I pick a film, I see rent/buy SD/HD, click on SD rent and it shows $4.99, right upto the point of debitting my credit card. That appears to me to be actually $4.99, not $0.99 ? Ryne Hager Yup, you have to actually redeem their coupon code via an advertisement you'll see on the main page for Google Play Movies, as noted in the article. me me Well that appears not true / applicable. I see $0.99, and then I click on it and it gets right up to the point of about to debit card and its $4.99. So its clickbait to fool me into paying $4.99. Nope. Ryne Hager Unfortunately, if you don't redeem the code via the advertisement on the Play landing page, you won't get the discount. me me Ahh. So YOUR LINK is bad. What i did: Ignore your link. Go to play.google.com Movies then the $0.99 is shown, click on that, then the film, then at checkout its $0.99 shown. Thanks for bringing to our attention, figured out valid method eventually. iboalali It's a shame that I will never rent or buy any movie or TV show from the play store, because I can't get anything in English (I live in Germany). Except if I want to watch something in German. I rather buy/rent from the Microsoft store, they offer everything in German and English for me. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Wait, where is me me so they can complain that it's still too expensive? Keith Taylor Since I have 5 different accounts I just used on of my secondary ones. blazingwolf I'm getting an offer for 2 episodes of a TV show for $.99. I would rather have the movie but I guess this is better than nothing. ROB Same here... can't imagine a show I would want to pay to see lomsha Shows on 1 account but not the other lol. dullknives same. primary accnt - nothing. secondary accnt - offer is there. pfmiller It says an offer to welcome you back, so it's probably for accounts that haven't used Google Movies recently. roebling "La La Land", the big winner of the last Academy Awards, is on the $0.99 list OtisFeelgood Offer showed up as $1.49 for me. Marty Damn! I was really hyped about this. Sadly the only movies I would have been interested in suck. Logan, The Great Wall and Split all suck. 30014 Logan and Split were awesome, not interested in The Great Wall. Justin Osborne Ah, I reported this about a month ago, it's been going on for some time now. 😛 Marty Tried to rent Passengers and was charged $5.99. Got a refund. iKon Guys, just download Shoebox. Any movie for free. Y'all don't need these offers AC I don't really care about not being eligible for the discount, but it's REALLY tacky of Google to splash the offer screen up for everyone and then sweep the rug under unsuspecting users that didn't receive the promo.

Typically, the site offers up a 90-day free trial when you sign up, but it’s now giving new subscribers an extra month of free time. The service allows users scan up to 50,000 songs from their music library, and listen to custom radio stations on their computer or mobile device. Users who use the free tier have to contend with ads, but subscribers who pay $9.99 (or $14.99 for a family account) can avoid ads, listen to over 35 million songs, download music to listen offline, and get access to YouTube Red. Google has offered similar deals in the past, and Android Police notes that it’s not clear how long the deal will remain active. At the very least, it’s an opportunity to check out the service if you’ve never tried it, and you can always cancel your subscription when your four months are up.

Go to play.google.com Movies then the $0.99 is shown, click on that, then the film, then at checkout its $0.99 shown. Thanks for bringing to our attention, figured out valid method eventually. iboalali It's a shame that I will never rent or buy any movie or TV show from the play store, because I can't get anything in English (I live in Germany). Except if I want to watch something in German. I rather buy/rent from the Microsoft store, they offer everything in German and English for me. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Wait, where is me me so they can complain that it's still too expensive? Keith Taylor Since I have 5 different accounts I just used on of my secondary ones. blazingwolf I'm getting an offer for 2 episodes of a TV show for $.99. I would rather have the movie but I guess this is better than nothing. ROB Same here... can't imagine a show I would want to pay to see lomsha Shows on 1 account but not the other lol. dullknives same. primary accnt - nothing. secondary accnt - offer is there. pfmiller It says an offer to welcome you back, so it's probably for accounts that haven't used Google Movies recently. roebling "La La Land", the big winner of the last Academy Awards, is on the $0.99 list OtisFeelgood Offer showed up as $1.49 for me. Marty Damn! I was really hyped about this. Sadly the only movies I would have been interested in suck. Logan, The Great Wall and Split all suck. 30014 Logan and Split were awesome, not interested in The Great Wall. Justin Osborne Ah, I reported this about a month ago, it's been going on for some time now. 😛 Marty Tried to rent Passengers and was charged $5.99. Got a refund. iKon Guys, just download Shoebox. Any movie for free. Y'all don't need these offers AC I don't really care about not being eligible for the discount, but it's REALLY tacky of Google to splash the offer screen up for everyone and then sweep the rug under unsuspecting users that didn't receive the promo.

[Deal Alert] Several movies and TV episodes on Google Play are on sale for Memorial Day Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/27 6:37pm PDTMay 27, 2017 55 Plus 1 on G+ 125 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares227 Deals Google News If your Memorial Day weekend plans are being ruined by poor weather, Google has an offer for you. It recently tossed up a little holiday sale on movies and TV shows over on Google Play, including some deals that are over 50% off their regular prices. So if you can't go camping or throw that family barbecue because of rain, at least you and your loved ones can snuggle up inside while you binge watch The Wire. It'll be good for little Johnny's character. Among the better movie collections being offered are The Lord of the Rings Trilogy for $20, the Back to the Future Trilogy for $15, and "The Best of Tarantino" six-movie collection for $30. The latter includes one of my favorite cheesy horror movies, From Dusk Till Dawn. The TV selection has a lot of solid HBO shows — if you don't happen to have HBO Go — as well as the complete X-Files for $50, American Horror Story seasons 1-5 for $60 and the amazing Kung Fu series in its entirety for $30. For more family-oriented deals there are a ton of shows from Nickelodeon, as well as a small number of animated children's film collections. You know what? The outdoors are over-rated. Who would want to spend a weekend outside with their loving family when they could spend days forcing their children to appreciate their favorite childhood movies. Let's face it, in the long run, your kids will thank you. Source: Google Play (1, 2) Tags deal alert google play memorial day movies sale tv subscribe ...

Older films.... and things I've already seen or don't want to see. Eric Braun Then don't buy, problem solved. me me Correct. So they get no money which is less than if they charged less for them to intersect the value.

As you might be able to guess from the name, it is designed to make finding job openings easier and more effective - for both applicants and employers. The feature appears to be going live on Google Search, at least for some users. Currently, searching something like "barista jobs" just returns a list of results from job listing sites. With Google for Jobs, you get a much cleaner interface with more details, plus modifiers like 'Full-time' and 'Starbucks.'    Left: Current layout; Center, Right: New layout This doesn't seem to be live yet for everyone, including myself, but let us know in the comments if you see it.

A product called “Google Attribution” was unveiled at a marketing conference this month in San Francisco by the internet giant. Google has long been able to determine when users click on an ads and make a purchase, but linking online and offline habits takes its analytics a step further. Google senior vice president Sridhar Ramaswamy, who announced that Attribution is in test mode with a limited number of partners and will be rolled out to more advertisers in coming weeks, touted the tool as being able to answer the long-challenging question of whether marketing campaigns are working. “Google Attribution makes it possible for every marketer to measure the impact of their marketing across devices and across channels,” Ramaswamy said. “Data-driven attribution uses machine learning to determine how much credit to assign to each step in the consumer journey — from the first time they engage with your brand for early research down to the final click before purchase.” Real-world customer email addresses or loyalty plan information can be woven with Google data from services such as AdWords, Google Analytics and DoubleClick Search to provide “a complete view” of marketing performance, according to the company. Using artificial intelligence, or machine learning, to better analyze and understand consumer behavior to target ads and promote sales was a major theme of the conference. Ad ‘holy grail’ For several years now, AdWords has enabled advertisers to measure visits to real-world stores stemming from online campaigns, Ramaswamy noted. “Still, measuring store visits is just one part of the equation,” Ramaswamy said. “You also need insights into how your online ads drive sales for your business.” Real-world transactions matched back to Google ads are handed in “a secure and privacy-safe way,” with store sales information reported in aggregated and anonymized forms to protect individual privacy, according to the company. Tying online activity to offline shopping decisions has been a “holy grail” for advertisers for quite some time, and comes with worrisome privacy implications, according to ACLU senior policy analyst Jay Stanley. Attribution threatens to intrude on a core tenant of privacy, that people can have dealings with one party not spill over into affairs with other parties they interact with, Stanley contended. “This is an evolution, not a revolution; another step toward increased monitoring of individuals,” Stanley said. “Each step raises the question ‘Where does this all stop?’” Stanley expected Google to be on its best behavior when it came to handling the growing trove of information about users, but that even the best of intentions could crack under the “enormous hydraulic pressure of the profit motive.” “We have the full fury and genius of the capitalist system being driven toward monitoring people in ever increasing detail and companies are competing to do so,” Stanley said “It will not stop without some sort of rules in which we as a society express our values through legal protections.” AFP Share.

The new app, which supports glide typing, lets users search straight from the keyboard, using normal Google search. Once the information is found, user can send it into their application without leaving the keyboard, technewsworld.com reported. No matter what application a user is using, SMS, email, WhatsApp or messenger, the Google logo is always present in the keyboard. “It’s like having a google search in any app, right from the keyboard . . . so we called it a Gboard,” said Google in a video posted in its YouTube account. “Solutions like Google’s Gboard and glide typing are designed to simplify and speed up common tasks. That can be a real boon when you’re under time pressure or are trying to create a complex message on a keyboard of limited size,” Principal Analyst at Pund-IT Charles King was quoted as saying in the same report. Emojis can be searched easily in the search bar. Typing words like “angry,” “pizza,” “cat,” and “car,” user can see all the relevant emoji characters in an instant. In addition, the application can be customized depending to the user’s liking. The user has the option to unable the glide typing, toggle things like auto-correction, auto-capitalization, enable caps lock, among others. Right now, Gboard app is only available in the United States and company has yet to announce when it will be available to download elsewhere.

It’s very colorful and lovely OLED screen is slightly smaller than the touch screen, but the player itself feels quite a bit smaller and lighter.

Attribution threatens to intrude on a core tenant of privacy, that people’s dealings with one party would not spill over into affairs with other parties with which they interact, Stanley said. “This is an evolution, not a revolution; another step toward increased monitoring of individuals,” Stanley said. “Each step raises the question: ‘Where does this all stop?’” Stanley expects Google to be on its best behavior when it comes to handling its growing trove of information about users, but said that even the best of intentions could crack under the “enormous hydraulic pressure of the profit motive.” “We have the full fury and genius of the capitalist system being driven toward monitoring people in ever-increasing detail and companies are competing to do so,” Stanley said. “It will not stop without some sort of rules in which we as a society express our values through legal protections.” Google and Facebook Inc dominate the online ad world, and what one does to prove its worth to advertisers is likely to be copied by the other, Silicon Valley analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group said. 1 2 NEXT › This story has been viewed 1028 times.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AI Tech giants acquired 34 AI startups in Q1 2017 Reuters May 28, 2017 9:33 AM Above: Sundar Pichai, chief executive officer of Google, onstage at Google I/O 2017. (Reuters) – A total of 34 artificial intelligence startups were acquired in the first quarter of this year, more than twice the amount of activity in the year-ago quarter, according to the research firm CB Insights. Tech giants seeking to reinforce their leads in artificial intelligence or make up for lost ground have been the most aggressive buyers. Google has acquired 11 AI startups since 2012, the most of any firm, followed by Apple, Facebook and Intel, respectively, according to CB Insights. The companies declined to comment on their acquisition strategies. A spokesman for Apple did confirm the company’s recent purchase of Lattice Data, a startup that specializes in working with unstructured data. The first quarter also saw one of the largest deals to date as Ford Motor Company invested $1 billion in Argo AI, founded by former executives on self-driving teams at Google and Uber. Startups are looking to go deep on applications of artificial intelligence to specific fields, such as health and retail, industry observers say, rather than compete directly with established companies. “What you will see is very big players will build platform services, and startup communities will migrate more to applied intelligent apps,” said Matt McIlwain, managing director of Madrona Venture Group. Healthcare startup Forward, for example, is using artificial intelligence to crunch data that can inform doctors’ recommendations. “For people who really want to focus on core AI problems, it makes a lot of sense to be in bigger companies,” said Forward Chief Executive Officer Adrian Aoun, who previously worked at Google. “But for folks who really want to prove a new field, a new area, it makes more sense to be separate.” Artificial intelligence companies that do remain independent field a steady stream of suitors: Matthew Zeiler, chief executive of Clarifai, which specializes in image and video recognition, said he has been approached about a dozen times by prospective acquirers since starting the company in late 2013. Clarifai’s pitch to customers such as consumer goods company Unilever and hotel search firm Trivago is bolstered by its narrow focus on artificial intelligence. “(Google) literally competes with almost every company on the planet,” Zeiler said. “Are you going to trust them with being your partner for AI?” Tech giants have been locked in a bidding war for academics specializing in artificial intelligence. Startups rarely have the capital to compete, but a company with a specialized mission can win over recruits, said Vic Gundotra, chief executive of AliveCor, which makes an AI-driven portable heart monitor. “They say, ‘I want to come here and work on a project that might save my mother’s life,’” Gundotra said.

This shot of a giant American flag being unfurled across FedEx Field on the 10th anniversary of the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks shakes a bit, and the audio is too muddy to make out the announcer’s words. YouTube’s content screeners, however, had a different problem with that video of a patriotic pregame ritual: They judged it not “advertiser friendly” and therefore disqualified it from featuring ads that might make its author some spare change. That Alphabet, Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) subsidiary fixed the mistake after I inquired about it. But the underlying problem remains: It’s hard to screen the stuff random people upload to YouTube. Advertiser anxiety Historically, YouTube has been a money-making machine for its corporate parent. Google doesn’t break out its share of its total ad revenues, but it’s long touted that video-sharing site as a strong contributor to those revenues. In February, however, the TImes of London reported that YouTube was pairing mainstream ads with videos uploaded by jihadists, neo-Nazis and other extremist elements. That represented a massive failure of YouTube’s “programmatic” ad-matching software, which is supposed to fit ads to the interests of the expected audience of a clip. More than 250 brands quickly responded by pulling their ads from YouTube. Over April, the ad-analytics firm MediaRadar estimated that 5% of YouTube’s U.S. and Canadian clients had fled the service. Google apologized and said it would implement stronger safeguards against ads showing up next to videos that would embarrass or horrify ad clients. That’s what David Heyman ran into with his video of a giant American flag. Heyman is a D.C. sports fan whose most-viewed video is a 2008 clip of President George W. Bush throwing out the first pitch at Nationals Park. He was surprised to get a “Your video can’t be monetized” e-mail from YouTube. YouTube’s rules That message explained that Heyman’s video “may not be advertiser friendly.” A Google support document says that term covers “sexually suggestive content,” “violence,” “inappropriate language,” “promotion of drugs and regulated substances,” and “controversial or sensitive subjects and events.” Heyman was annoyed more by the principle of the thing than the potential lost revenue, since he says he’s “never received a dime” from YouTube ads. He requested a review of that decision and got the same answer. “My guess is since my video has ‘9/11’ in the title, that is it,” he wrote in an email. “There is no reference or voiceover to the attack.” I e-mailed Google to ask what had happened and got a vague mistakes-were-made response: “sometimes we make the wrong call on content​.“ The YouTube spokesperson who sent that said Heyman’s video now had ads enabled. So we can still only guess whether mentioning 9/11—a widely discussed topic seared into many American’s memories—will to continue to upset YouTube’s sensibilities. (I can’t rule out Washington’s hapless, apparently hopeless NFL franchise being the sore subject here.) A hard job for men or machines But there’s no mystery about the degree of difficulty of reviewing this content. With some 400 hours of video uploaded to YouTube every minute, the site has to make snap judgments on a flood of new content that never stops.   This is the same basic problem that Facebook (FB) faces when it tries to ensure that Live streaming doesn’t get abused to broadcast crimes. Both companies have spent heavily on human screeners and on artificial-intelligence filters. Google’s apologetic post cited plans to hire “significant numbers of people” and develop “new tools powered by our latest advancements in AI and machine learning.” But the people and the software can still make mistakes. “This story does not surprise me,” e-mailed Siva Vaidhyanathan, director of the Center for Media and Citizenship at the University of Virginia. “My sense is that Google hopes the algorithms get more sensitive and precise as they gather more data and learn the difference between a patriotic expression and a paranoid expression,” he said. “But video content remains the hardest to read for a computer.” In this case, the system failed in about the least damaging way possible. The video had no risk of being taken down, the income at stake was theoretical at best, and a single query from a journalist got things squared away. But more and uglier errors are inevitable as politicians invoke the American flag and 9/11 in their speeches. Email Rob at rob@robpegoraro.com; follow him on Twitter at @robpegoraro.

Retires After Dominating Humanity’s Best Players EntrepreneurWhat Entrepreneurs Need to Stop Doing Right Now FashionThis Dress Made Out of Upside-Down Jeans Costs $445 UberUber and Lyft Will Be Back in Austin on Monday Fashion Judy: Pretty Rapper Style is one of dozens of Android apps found to infect mobile devices with malware. Enistudio Android Android Malware ‘Judy’ Hits as Many as 36.5 Million Phones David Z. Morris May 28, 2017 The security firm Checkpoint on Thursday uncovered dozens of Android applications that infected users’ devices with malicious ad-click software. In at least one case, an app bearing the malware was available through the Google Play app store for more than a year. While the actual extent of the malicious code’s spread is unknown, Checkpoint says it may have reached as many as 36.5 million users, making it potentially the most widely-spread malware yet found on Google Play. Google removed the apps after being notified by Checkpoint. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. The malicious apps primarily included a series of casual cooking and fashion games under the “Judy” brand, a name borrowed for the malware itself. The nefarious nature of the programs went unnoticed in large part, according to Checkpoint, because its malware payload was downloaded from a non-Google server after the programs were installed. The code would then use the infected phone to click on Google ads, generating fraudulent revenue for the attacker. The infection may have spread even more widely than Checkpoint’s estimates, since not all of the extensive line of “Judy” apps are included on Checkpoint’s tally – it’s missing Fashion Judy: Magic Girl Style and Fashion Judy: Masquerade Style, among others. All installments of the series do appear to have been pulled from Google Play. The “Judy” apps were published by an apparently Korean entity known as ENISTUDIO. However, iterations of the same attack were found on a handful of apps from other publishers. This is not the first instance of a malware infestation making it through the screening process on Google Play, nor is it the most damaging – Checkpoint did not find any evidence, for instance, that “Judy” compromised data on infected phones. That Judy was able to hide on Google Play for so long highlights the tradeoffs of Android operating system, which is often seen as more open but less secure than Apple’s iOS.

PhoneDog Android And Me TodaysiPhone NEW Call T-Mobile at (855) 668-8976 TmoNews Unofficial T-Mobile Blog, News, Videos, Articles and more Navigation Home Submit News 700MHz LTE map Upcoming Phones HOT TOPICS: Samsung Galaxy Note 7 LG V20 Google Pixel Extended Range LTE Android 7.0 Nougat You are here: Home > T-Mobile offers to pay for Verizon switchers’ phones, two-lines-for-one deal also coming T-Mobile offers to pay for Verizon switchers’ phones, two-lines-for-one deal also coming May 24, 2017 Alex Wagner 103 Comments Yesterday T-Mobile CEO John Legere teased that T-Mo had multiple announcements coming up, and today a couple of them have been made. Starting May 31st, T-Mobile will kick off its #GetOutoftheRed promotion to help Verizon customers switch to T-Mo. Verizon customers in good standing with their carrier can get their iPhone or Google Pixel paid off by T-Mobile when they switch to T-Mobile and sign up for T-Mobile One, and they can keep their existing device. The phones that qualify for this promotion include the iPhone SE, iPhone 6s, iPhone 6s Plus, iPhone 7, iPhone 7 Plus, Google Pixel, and Google Pixel XL. T-Mobile says that these devices were selected because “phones need certain software to be globally compatible, and some phones don’t yet have that software.” Magenta does say that it’s working with unspecified device makers to make more phones compatible with this promotion. Additionally, Verizon customers switching to T-Mobile must add T-Mo’s Premium Device Protection Plus insurance plan to their device to qualify. This insurance plan costs $15 per month and includes protection against loss, theft, and accidental damage, McAfee ID Protection, McAfee Content Protection, and other features. T-Mobile says that it’ll pay Verizon customers that take advantage of this promotion with a digital prepaid MasterCard card that typically arrives within 15 days. While this #GetOutoftheRed promotion is focused on Verizon customers (because VZW phones are unlocked), T-Mobile is doing something for AT&T and Sprint subscribers, too. Starting on May 31st, AT&T and Sprint customers can switch to T-Mobile and get their existing device paid off when they buy a new phone from T-Mobile on EIP. And unlike Carrier Freedom, those customers won’t be forced to trade in their existing device. Finally, T-Mobile says that starting tomorrow, May 25th, T-Mobile One customers with at least two voice lines can get two additional lines of service for the price of one. The cost of the second line will be offset by a bill credit.

(J²) Right… I’d found that the system doesn’t consistently apply these. TylerCameron Yeah their billng process it’s horrible Steve_NYC So true. I actually considered moving to the T-Mobile One Plan even though it would have cost me more money, just to get away from the insanity of their bill credit process. I finally got things straightened out, but I am sure it will be a problem in the future. It’s gotten to the point that I think it’s deliberate. Mike I had a free line from November that I had to call in every month. to get credit. They finally fixed it to be automatic this month. best part I got extra bill credits for months since last November and my bill is now negative so I didn’t have to make a payment this month. Al William So in order to get the free line, you need to have at least a total of 4 voice lines? Corey Jalette You need to have 2 voice lines to get this promo, which you get 2 lines for the price of 1. So in total you end up woth 4 lines, 1st 2 have to be voice, the 2 you’re adding could be whatever you want. So if you’re on the 2/100 plan right now if you add 2 tablets it would be 120 a month (20 per tablet but 1 is free) or if you add 2 voice lines it would be 140 (40 for adding a 3rd line then 4th is free) Al William Thanks for the clarification! So minimum 2 voice lines and the other 2 could be voice or data. I just wish they get rid of these bill credits. Sometimes it’s such a nightmare. Corey Jalette It can be yes but that’s how pretty much everything is done. Just like they had a free line deal in march it’s listed on my account as a free line on us but I still get the charge on my bill, but it’s auto credited. The only time it wasn’t was the first month because I added it before the end of the billing cycle. Cost $49 but they also credited my account manually that one time. Haven’t had an issue since. AWasserberg7 This article mentions Magenta. What *is* Magenta? Is that some cute term of affection for T-Mobile? kev2684 Are you serious? It’s their brand color. VZW = Red AT&T = Blue T-Mobile = Magenta Sprint = Yellow Nobody Special Cricket (umm, green) lol Genecio MetroPCS= Purple Black&Orange= Boost The Waz Just confirmed by T-Force that if you have a 2 for 100 plus a “this ones on us promo” giving you total 3 lines, you will lose your free line if you take advantage of the promotion of 2 for 1 tomorrow. They stated that they have to move you to a different Tmobile One plan….makes no sense since there is only 1 plan…… Corey Jalette This is ONLY if you’re adding a voice line people. If you’re adding tablet/smartwatch/mobile Internet plans that doesn’t affect your phone plan promo of 2/100. Corey Jalette Add 2 tablets with unlimited data on your plan for $20/month. They frequently have a free tablet promo with qualifying data plan. Snatch those up and you’re golden. The Waz Yes this will affect both. IF you have the 2 for 100 and the “this one is on us” free line….you will lose both promotions…confirmed with t force and John directly. Ben Also why can’t the t force reps do this. Seems very simple. chnage to the 4 plan rate, open the C-2 documentation, search this one on us, ask supervisor to open the page, enter the code on my account to reflect the 4th line as being free. And then add the 1 for 2 lines, or 50 percent off a one more line. This way I keep hookup and this one on us promo. and also eligible for future lines down the road. Yea this is very strange Ben Also why can’t the t force reps do this. Seems very simple. chnage to the 4 plan rate, open the C-2 documentation, search this one on us, ask supervisor to open the page, enter the code on my account to reflect the 4th line as being free. And then add the 1 for 2 lines, or 50 percent off a one more line. This way I keep hookup and this one on us promo. and also eligible for future lines down the road. So yea im wondering is anyone can find a loophole or something Andrew Singleton the reason is that you’re on a 2-line promotional plan paying $20 less than everyone else, and you’ve added a line. since you’re unable to add another line on that plan, you are forced to switch to a 3+ line plan, and that will cause activation-related discounts to drop. Corey below is correct, because internet lines (tablet, watch, syncup drive) are their own rate plan and don’t affect your voice configuration. Ben Also why can’t the t force reps do this. Seems very simple. chnage to the 4 plan rate, open the C-2 documentation, search this one on us, ask supervisor to open the page, enter the code on my account to reflect the 4th line as being free. And then add the 1 for 2 lines, or 50 percent off a one more line. This way I keep hookup and this one on us promo. and also eligible for future lines down the road. J Gerard Yeah! Let’s switch to T-MOBILE because we want to not be able to make phone calls half the time, and not have a signal to look something up when we actually need it. Oh yeah, and to not be able to upload pictures of something fun that we’re doing until we’re at home connected to WiFi later that night or the next day. Before any of you “magenta” fans TRIES to defend them… I’ve been a Verizon customer for about 12 years except for 6 months last year, when I switched because of crappy TMobile’s cheap prices and convincing (misleading) advertising. It was HORRIBLE. I used to get pissed and call them to ask why I could never get a signal. After 6 months, I finally admitted to myself that it was a ridiculous mistake and switched back to The Red! NEVER any issues with Verizon’s service. Never. “Magenta” is only good at talking a big game. If anyone’s thinking about switching to T-Mobile, DON’T DO IT. They are the worst. Go to any other carrier. Doesn’t have to be Verizon. kev2684 It’s all about location, location, location. Just because your area is bad, doesn’t mean everybody will have the same problem as you. J Gerard … EXCEPT that I live in a city. Oh, and Verizon’s coverage is flawless here. I happen to also know (through friends) that AT&T and Sprint are good here, too. Oh, but it’s all about location, location, location. Weak argument. T-Mobile just sucks! There’s a reason it’s so CHEAP! Austin8480 … OK JGerard. Next time, PLEASE use all capital letters to truly get YOUR point across. What I find PATHETIC is that you are a die hard Verizon turd in a TMobile blog. Oh wait, I meant Verizon TURD. Forgot to emphasize that. NOBODY in this room gives a flying —- about your opinion because you slummed it for 6 months and went to Magenta and it was as big of a mistake as…well, I will let you figure it out. J Gerard You were so busy typing a 3rd grade level post that you forgot to make a point. Here’s one for you: T-Mobile is inferior to almost all other carriers. Austin8480 If T-Mobile is so inferior, why are you even giving this blog the time of day. Are you upset that no kids want to hop in your van and eat your chocolate, so you are going to take out your frustrations on the inferior wireless network? thepanttherlady *Tip* Starbursts don’t melt :D theseanteam The hate is strong in this one. Those six months must have really scarred you or something. When you say almost all other carriers, which ones are you referring to? There are only four major carriers after all. And actually, that argument about location is a pretty strong one. T-Mobile’s network is the fastest in many locations, but can be really poor (or even non-existent) in others. The same can be said about everyone–including Verizon. Every carrier has their strong and weak areas. For someone to deny such would have to either be 1) ignorant 2) biased beyond belief or 3) troll. yankeesusa Yea, it still amazes me that people complain about coverage and then lump everyone else in america as having the same coverage, like we all live in the same area. Oh well. People never learn. I’m just happy tmobile works for me and that my data speeds are the highest iv’e ever had. At my house i’m getting close to 100megs almost every time. But hey i guess that’s not good enough for some. thepanttherlady I moved to Crestline a couple of weeks ago. No service. :'( kev2684 I had to google where that is lol :D Yeah it’s rural Ohio but I suppose Band 12 is coming? I’ve seen sightings on Band 12 in Jacksonville, FL lately as well as other parts of the country it’s currently not available. They’re probably working on it at the moment. thepanttherlady Sorry, I should have been more specific. It’s Crestline, CA. I made the same mistake when I called a county office but only Googled Crestline. Guy was really confused as they don’t have my address there. Took me a minute to figure out he was in Ohio. LOL kev2684 You’re literally live in a mountain! Views must be spectacular! thepanttherlady Some of them really are. :) Zacamandapio Verizon here we gooooooo. By the way, we went to Lake Gregory. :) thepanttherlady I’m literally 7 minutes from there. Went there 2 weekends ago to check it out. Water level is a little on the low side. Met a couple that same night that said they’d drained it for some reason and cited “water politics” because I guess the locals aren’t happy about it. Drove up from the Hesperia side this past Saturday and got to see Lake Silverwood. Will have to check it out this summer. Nice drive but hated seeing so many dead trees. :( ETA: I had to get Frontier (Verizon) internet so I could actually use my cell phone. What really sucks is: 1. I literally just got a hotspot through T-Mobile a month ago when they were offering another free line. It’s unusable. 2. I now HAVE to buy phones that have WiFi calling. Blah! thepanttherlady From the day we moved in 5/7: http://imgur.com/UQHsBZF http://imgur.com/t9Z64Q3 http://imgur.com/tm7ReiU And the lake :) http://imgur.com/1YUxwV9 http://imgur.com/tnGMcoq http://imgur.com/zhY16YK http://imgur.com/eaXr58H http://imgur.com/JO9BHJW Sharti24 Who will you be switching to? thepanttherlady I’m not switching. Yet anyway. I lose service 1/2 way up (or down) the mountain so I’ll probably have to get a very cheap pre-paid service/phone for emergencies in case I break down. Not all turnouts have a call box. I still work in Orange County and T-Mobile works fine most places I go. If it starts to be a problem then I’ll have to consider my options. Sharti24 Have tmobile send you a range extender. Not the one you plug into the internet but the one that has two boxes that boosts signal Berzerker Yeah, if you live in Bumblefuck, Montana, don’t switch. Greg Piller Shoot, I just signed up in Montana for TMO. Guess I’m “bumblefucked” lol. I have traveled to every state and been in EVERY U.S. major city multiple times living in every timezone and 11 states. My goodness you have a warped idea of “crap state”. Montana is paradise partner. You have to be from either NYC or California with that f’ed up mentality. He is right & not just in “crap” places but a lot of places like Chicago, IL where I was born and raised. Verizon & AT&T ARE better, Considerably better now in most places but TMO is gaining on them quickly & may reach parity in a few years. When THAT happens if TMO is still competitive, one would have to be a lunatic to stay with AT&T or Verizon. Berzerker …lol. I never said Montana was a “crap state.” It’s the easiest thing to think of when you think of wilderness where you won’t have service for miles. I could have picked a bunch of states, but Montana has, IIRC, the smallest habitation of humans to state ratio, behind Alaska of course. Easy target. Greg Piller To me 4 lines for $120 with TMO is enough of a savings to ditch AT&T. Verizon & AT&T and some of their customers can be arrogant & I think John Legere is one helluva CEO. I can pick up a burner sim with AT&T’s Cricket when I travel a bit and use it until TMO improves in Montana & then it’s sianara to ATT. Happy to be back with TMO. I was formerly a customer since the Voicestream days but when I moved west couldn’t keep them. Their coverage improvement in Montana & the nation as a whole with him at the helm has been nothing short of INCREDIBLE. I hope if the Sprint deal happens Legere is retained as CEO. mreveryphone Hummm… I travel the country for my job and I rarely have issues with T-Mobile… Is it perfect?? No… But no carrier is.. Verizon worked out for you, that’s great. T-Mobile works for millions, that’s also great. But this butt hurt rant is ridiculous and pure comedy! J Gerard “butt hurt rant” is kind of a dumb way to describe what I’m saying. But, I’ll consider the source, eh? Do you know ANYONE who thinks that T is better than V? Nope. So, the difference between us is that I choose to have a better service and I’m willing to pay a little more for it. You are cheap, and you’re willing to have an inferior service because it’s cheaper. That’s it. You know Verizon is better than T-Mobile Francisco Peña Anyone switching carriers should NEVER just switch without taking advantage of the initial return period. I was with VZW for yrs myself. Loved it, with my UDP that was grandfathered. Even went through one wave of price hikes to stay. Then the wife wanted a non-feature phone, and the price hike for her would have boosted out then $108 monthly payment, to $160 once we got a basic data plan, her line access fee (joke) and a new phone. So I looked into TMo. I purposely bought a phone the yr before that worked with Tmo and VZW (moto X DE) and signed up for one line of TMo, switched my Moto to Tmo and reactivated an older LTE phone I had back on VZW. Then I went around for a week doing speed tests everywhere I went. Stuck in traffic? speed test. Both side by side on the seat. Mall? yup, side by side in my hands. Work? yup. Home? yup. I hated VZW at work because my Moto could never get a signal inside the building, which caused my battery to die quickly each day. TMo? got a strong signal. Home, both were weak, but about the same. Driveway? same. So after 10 days, I went in to TMo and switched. Got 2 new phones (had a deal on G4s then) and was spending $140 for 2 lines/10GB each (was the $100/2L/10GB deal) with those phones. Has it been perfect? no. Has it been enough to switch back? no. After some finagling, got a $70 plan with 6GB each for 2 lines. Then have gotten a free line on top of that.. so now I pay $130 for 3 lines, with 6GB each (two don’t come close, mine has Stash so I’m good) and 2 new G6 phones. So for the price, its awesome. Can I deal with some poor service on the outskirts of town? sure. Oh, that Moto X? got it on the 3rd line… theseanteam I don’t think anyone has ever claimed that T-Mobile has better coverage than Verizon, but the point is it has the same quality of coverage in many places. Where I live, T-Mobile has equal coverage and faster speeds. It might not be like that for you, as everyone’s experience will vary. I’m sure if others suffered with bad service, they would switch carriers as well. But your superiority complex is just silly. mreveryphone I know plenty of people that think T-Mobile is better than VW… And I know people that think the opposite, it depends where you live. The service was inferior for you but not for me by any means… I appreciate the cheap name calling, I’ll be cheap all day if it means saving money but getting better service FOR ME… I’ve had service in buildings where others on VW had 0, I’ve smoked people on VW in data speeds tests so I’ll be cheap all day long!! Lol Vazaha There’s an unwritten agreement when you join T-Mobile that you will refrain from living in or going to crappy places. If you live in a decent place T-Mobile is fine. If T-Mobile sucks in your area, you know why :). Vazaha But seriously, I’m always envious of ATT and V when I go to crap places. tranceformer978 Why are you going to crap places? Melissa Cardenas Well what the hell are you doing on this website then? This is a T-Mobile forum obviously most people on here have T-Mobile and they Happy with it so they ain’t gonna listen to you . T-Mobile did not work in my old house so i had Verizon. Now in my new house Verizon don’t work at all and i had to get T-Mobile again because T-Mobile works here fine , So no carrier is perfect. It all depends on location!! J Gerard I get tech news alerts on my phone and things like this come up sometimes and I click on them. I believe that’s allowed! Apparently, what’s not allowed here is proper grammar and punctuation. I almost had to have your post translated in order to read it, but I figured it out eventually. Where did you go to school? Melissa Cardenas What ever im in a hurry and didn’t have time to spell check .But seriously don’t change the subject i don’t get why people like you come talk trash on a T-Mobile forum. ?? Makes no sense haha . And what ever im PRETTY sure you understood fine what i wrote in my first comment. Bull that you almost had to get it translated. Omar Boyer Melisa hes just being an idiot haha i understood perfectly well your first post. And i see they gave u some thumbs up on that first post so others also understood you no need to translate it . Ignore this lowlife with nothing to do. If he wants to stop making an Azz out of himself he should just block the notifications he gets from here. Melissa Cardenas i have better things to worry about ;) omar. And like you said he should just turn off notifications from here then. Eric Harlow Don’t give J Gerard the satisfaction in getting a reaction out of you and allow him to control the situation don’t dumb down to his level Eric Harlow Get off Melissa Cardenas butt about grammar here. This is a forum! Not a college message board or an college English Composition course. T-mobile has improved drastically within the last 3 years. T-mobile works for me out here in San Diego and in my future home in Missoula, Montana. I have mental disabilities that I got serving in The US Navy for twenty years and I dislike your comments towards Melissa Cardenas. This is a T-mobile fan website to discuss peacefully about T-mobile, so get your BIG RED DUMB AND DUMBER ASS OUT OF HERE. Andrew Addison You just made my night with that bomb diggity comment towards that boozo the snow clown filled with stuffy nose, trying to come off as English weirdo professor correcting people on their grammar fool there Bro. Is this guy here serious right now? He had no reason to talk down to someone like that and also talk down on the finest company/carrier, advising everyone to stay away from the best carrier/company which that one being T-Mobile-MetroPCS. We will forever be way Better in USA than any other carrier would have been. Eric Harlow OOH REALLY!!! HOW AWESOME!! Glad I made your night! RLB63 I actually feel sorry for you. How miserable your life must be for you to spend so much time on a site of a company you seem to hate so much. Cellphone companies aren’t making political statements. Seem way to smart for that. Don’t attack social issues. Attacking T-Mobile worth while to you and to spend so much time. You must not have anything better to do with your life. Eric Harlow I think you were supposed to reply back to J Gerard not me. I have been a T-mobile customer for over ten years and I am happy to be a T-mobile customer. Haze1nut English is a 3rd language for me, behind French and Portuguese. Correct my grammar for me, will you. It obviously makes you feel superior. Ascertion You think everyone that switches to T-Mobile can’t “Make calls half of the time”? You’re out of your mind! Tony Chen agreed, t mobile has gained millions of customers each quarter. if the drop calls were so bad why would t mobile gain 100% of new customers agaIN? another blockbuster quarter by t mobile. moonoverparma Funny, I’ve never had a problem. Nobody Special Several years ago i had a verizon phone (when the iphone’s came out they were the only one that were selling them with unlimited data at that time) and i had T-Mobile flip phone that i was using to make international calls. I have to admit, Verizon was more reliable than T-Mobile during my cell phone usage. I chose T-mobile over Verizon because of many reasons…. but it was never due to their coverage, because their coverage was horrible… but since then their coverage has improved. But i switched primarily due to the inexpensive international calls. That was a deal breaker for me, i was content with the terrible coverage with anticipation that they would improve their service. and with Verizon i was paying around $89 dollars for unlimited data and text and 450 minutes of voice calls. my tmobile line (from what i can remember) was around $78 dollars for unlimited talk and text and data. But fastforward to today, I have 5 Unlimited Everything (data/text/voice) lines with unlimited international calling (mobile+landlines) and international text for a low cost of $110 plus taxes and fees. Believe me i checked, Verizon or AT&T have nothing in comparison to what i have with T-Mobile. And i am not bashing you or Verizon at all, Verizon does have a more reliable coverage area but in the end i sided with T-Mobile over Verizon. If Verizon ever came up with incredible deals like T-Mobile has been doing almost every month i wouldnt turn down a great opportunity. RECAP: Verizon “Better Coverage” T-Mobile “Better Prices” It all boils down to what are you comfortable with. Im comfortable with crappy coverage. And My T-Mobile calls do drop often, but what i do is (i press redial) GOTCHA :) Gust OK so here’s the deal. In the morning when you wake up if you have T-Mobile you have to get up take a shower have breakfast shave go outside of your house in other to make a phone call. If you have AT&T or Verizon in the morning when you wake up you can reach for your cell phone and make a phone call. It is that simple. But you know what I have T-Mobile because over one year it saves me about $200 as compared to AT&T or Verizon. So I put up with the crap! Timothy Poplaski T-Mobile supports WiFi calling. You don’t have home WiFi? DM725 How do you not have wifi calling enabled? Maybe you need to buy a phone from the last 2 years… (My Motorola Nexus 6 Supported Wifi Calling….) RLB63 They have equipment they they will ship out for free with a deposit that will boost their signal on your house if you don’t have Wi-Fi calling. My phone automatically switches on Wi-Fi when I get home. Not for signal or to save data. It’s because with all the talk that cell signals MIGHT cause cancer why risk it? It is able to enable Wi-Fi, and it disables it when I leave the house. So that might be an option if you have Wi-Fi…. Phone Guy All lies. So funny, yet sad. yankeesusa LOL, not everyone lives where you live and have bad coverage with tmobile. 4 years ago i would have never used tmobile, now i no longer have sprint and got rid of my verizon line because tmobile is great for me where i live and work. I just recently drove across florida,georgia,nc and tennesse and had no issues. I was able to test it side by side with an att phone and the whole time both phones had coverage except up in the smokies near newfound gap where no one has signal. Don’t lump everyone in the same pile just because it doesn’t work for you. DM725 LoL, where the hell do you live? eanfoso The only one after verizon is at&t because we know that sprint and us cellular sucks more than t mobile Andrew Singleton T-Mobile has the lowest churn rate (people trying it and leaving) of all carriers. Could you please explain why? J Gerard Ha! Oh, I promise you I don’t feel like an idiot surrounded by people who work themselves up into a breathless rant trying to defend a crappy service. gmo8492 Crappy for who exactly, churn has gone down to record lows and T-Mobile has over 73 million subs, so if it doesn’t work out you can switch. Brad C It’s not for everyone, but has worked damn well for me for 12yrs.. I *actually* tried Verizon a few months ago, and came back after two weeks after awful LTE performance JG You’re cracking me up reading your comments! I have TMo and put up with their spotty coverage because I’m paying less per month staying with them. I can admit that. There is alot I enjoy about TMo, but dropped calls and dead zones IS a reality. I have a band 12 phone in metro PHX. Not sure why others feel the need to berail someone who doesn’t agree with them just for argument’s sake. Timothy Poplaski Because you aren’t saying, “Bad coverage in PHX”, you’re saying “Bad coverage”. I can drive for at least an hour in any direction and have solid coverage. It all depends on where you live, and you’re phone. Even phones with band 12 won’t all have the same results because some phones get better reception than others. So, I won’t even argue about coverage in PHX. Never been there, likely never will, so it just doesn’t matter to me. My excellent coverage probably doesn’t matter to you. It’s all about where you use your phone. navi harriram Dude you could of tested the network out on a $10 weekly plan or $3 daily. You don’t buy cell phone service every day so do the work. The sales rep just wants a commission check so they’ll say anything to get you to switch. That’s why I don’t work for wireless companies anymore. Too much bull to deal with yankeesusa Not everyone is defending a company that may or may not work depending on where you live. But many people actually do research and pick a company that specifically works for your needs depending on your area. I had verizon and sprint before tmobile and i have never ever gotten the speeds i get now not to mention i have great coverage ‘WHERE I LIVE”, YOU SEE, that’s the important thing, i researched and made sure it worked for me. I don’t just blindly select a company just because their commercial says so. Screamin That’s strange because T-Mobile has been #1 in customer service AND satisfaction for well over 2 years now… and yes, that includes coverage. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) I am thinking about switching to Verizon due to poor coverage. In San Diego area I get one to bars. I moved from Minnesota and T-mobile coverage in MN is excellent there with all bars. In San Diego it’s very poor in some areas. When iPhone 8 is release I am switching to Verizon. I love T-mobile plans but coverage in my area is poor. Sharti24 Agreed. On base (32nd street) forget about tmobile coverage. sprint excels on 32nd. go over to corando island its even worse! just throw your phone over board. no tmobile coverage on the air base at all. im using an iphone 6s Band 12 which is deployed in SD yankeesusa I agree, if in your area tmobile is not good and is affecting productivity or just not letting you use your phone to its fullest your’e better off changing. I have great coverage where I live and work and when i travel over 99% of the time i have no issues. But i got my wife on cricket which is att so for the times where tmobile may not get signal i have the att towers just in case. I’m on an old grandfathered single line plan that allows work discount so i’m keeping as long as i can. Screamin Sometimes it’s not always the cell coverage causing the issue, but the phone itself, especially if it’s an older device that supports fewer cell bands. With T-Mobile’s latest acquirement of spectrum you can expect a huge improvement in cell signal, both in range and structure penetration, within the year. Of course you can switch if you want, but they’re only going to get better. They’ve more than doubled the coverage in the past 2 years and have just as much coverage as Verizon with a network that’s actually futureproof unlike the other guys. DM725 Agreed, I know people that don’t realize they are using a phone without band 12, that doesn’t have wifi calling or Volte support, and has an extremely weak antenna. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) My phone is iPhone 7 and not an old device: Andrew Singleton if you hold an iphone 7 next to a galaxy s8, the s8 will have more bars every time. that’s due to a more powerful signal on galaxies and the fact that bars don’t mean anything with low-frequency spectrum. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) My roommate is on T-mobile and his current phone is galaxy s8. We experience the same issue. RLB63 Have you talked to T-Mobile C.S.? If they get people complaining about certain areas they tend to look into those areas. Is it outside or inside or both where you have problems? Inside out could be the building. They can seems you a device to boost the signal for your phone. Patel Nisha You couldn’t pay me to use a iPhone . And why would I switch Verizon to T-unmobile. So I can have a sub par data connection with hardly any coverage…. Andrew Why are you on TmoNews, then? Andrew Addison Lol I was just thinking the exact same thing. Lol DM725 I’m sorry you live in a place that T-Mobile doesn’t prioritize. Here in NY, we have no such issues. Andrew Singleton the offer is also good for pixels, and you don’t know anything about the network. in 1 year, verizon will wish it had t-mobile’s network. browne81 I cavy take this anymore. There is always someone in these forums going miss information. I have to speak up. As awhole some networks are better than others. I’m not going to get into my opinion on which is better nation wide. What I will say is this. The best carrier is the one that works where you frequent the most. No matter what carrier a person loves there is another person out there that thinks it terrible. So all these people saying bad things about T-Mobile should get the facts straight. Lastly I due example I don’t like sprint but I know there are people that have a great time with them. You don’t see me on a sprint site saying how bad they are. Is my spelling perfect no. Is my grammar perfect no. It’s this a college paper? No. So I really don’t care. AJ2 still waiting for them to do a $50 deal for single customers. browne81 They have a prepaid plan for 45 Select a phone: (optional) + - Any - 3G|4G U301 USB Modem Acer Aspire One Netbook Acer Liquid

Image Credit: VGBA I’ve formed a lot of opinions about the game industry over the years. And I recently got the chance to spout them in a conversation with Steve Goldstein, president of Turtle Rock Studios, the maker of the Evolve video game published by Take-Two Interactive’s 2K label in February 2015. At UCLA, we gave a talk before a group of game industry lawyers from the Video Game Bar Association. We were encouraged to talk about the whole industry’s trends, and we started by noting how conservative the console game industry has become, with huge budgets that are forcing publishers to be very careful when it comes to launching original games. Sequels rule, and that’s a sad reality. We also talked about the cycles that favor the creation of new kinds of games and platforms, as well as the cycles where big game companies either retrench or expand their investments in games. Joseph Olin, executive director of the Video Game Bar Association, peppered us with questions toward the end. Here’s an edited transcript of our conversation. Above: Dean Takahashi (left) of GamesBeat talks about the game industry with Steve Goldstein of Turtle Rock. Image Credit: VGBA Steve Goldstein: For the past four years now, I’ve been the president and general manager at Turtle Rock Studios. We’re an 80-person developer. Our latest console release was Evolve, which came out in 2015. Prior to that, we created Left 4 Dead, which was a big hit a while ago. Since that time, up until last year, we’ve been a one project studio. But starting in the tail end of 2016, we split the studio into two departments. One is focused on service-based games, and the other is focused on VR. GamesBeat: When you’re looking a few years out and you’re going to make one bet on one big game that will take you a few years to make, how do you plan that? How do you decide what to target, what the market will be like, what the audience wants? Goldstein: There isn’t an opportunity anymore, unfortunately, to try to guess what’s going to happen a few years out. The industry’s changed quite a bit when it comes to large-scale games. When you look at the console environment, that’s no longer a space for independent developers to work in. Our last game had an enormous budget, yet it’s competing with games that are internally developed by publishers, which have budgets that are anywhere from two to four times the amount that we spent. That’s a problem in a couple of ways. One, publishers don’t want to make bets on new IP given the cost of development. Two, if they are going to make a new IP for console, they’re probably going to do it internally, just because they feel they can control those costs better. How many new, successful franchises have been created with the latest generation of consoles? Bloodborne? GamesBeat: Nintendo’s Arms is coming soon. Goldstein: Well, Nintendo is a separate issue. Their games don’t cost as much as development on PlayStation and Xbox. GamesBeat: Horizon Zero Dawn. Goldstein: It’s not a franchise yet, but I agree. That’s two. How long have the consoles been out? 2013? That’s not a good sign, guys. When you look at the state of the industry, if we can only name a few new franchises for this console generation, I don’t see how they continue. Above: Aloy has guts in Horizon: Zero Dawn. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi GamesBeat: There’s a trap for the industry, though. There’s no better way to squeeze innovation out of games than to leave behind this tent-pole strategy. Justin Bailey of Fig just did a talk at our GamesBeat Summit. He pointed out that there used to be a tent-pole strategy, where you had a big flagship game to make all the money and pay for your bets on everything else. EA in 2008 had 60 games. Last year, it had eight — all of them big bets and none of them [were] really experimental. Goldstein: It doesn’t even have to be experimental. It’d just be nice if it was another IP, something that’s not going into the fifth or sixth iteration. Going back to what you asked earlier, how do we figure out what we want to do? We figure out what fun game we want to play, but we also look at the market and say, “Here’s a hole right here.” We start targeting that. But we don’t target boxed products anymore. We just won’t approach publishers with a concept where we say, “This’ll cost $60, and then, we’ll make another $50 worth of DLC.” It doesn’t make sense for us as a business to get into that space. There’s no benefit for an independent studio. It’s unfortunate. I love consoles. I like making cool stuff and pushing the envelope. But it doesn’t make good fiscal sense anymore. GamesBeat: There are still areas where there can be some innovation — like on the PC and mobile. Dead by Daylight is a brand new IP that came from Behaviour Interactive. It’s an online game about trying to escape from a serial killer. You have one killer and four victims. Goldstein: Sounds familiar [laughs]. It’s a great example, actually. We put out Evolve with a similar concept, four versus one, but it was an enormous experience in a $60 box. We look at how Dead by Daylight got picked up. It had a $20 price point, cost $7 million to develop, and it’s a much smarter move for doing that kind of innovative stuff. It’s a small ask for the user to embrace it, and it’s also a small ask when it comes to development. What I’ve seen in the market lately — the games business is more Dickensian than it’s ever been. It’s the worst of times for guys making big budget titles, but it’s the best of times for people who are able to put something out that cost them $5 million or less. What Justin’s doing is fantastic. I’ve also seen lately that the elusive “game fund” is starting to happen now. These funds are coalescing where they can put in [$1 million to] 2 million to see [if] an independent studio can develop something well. But when that happens, all those companies are going to be PC focused. Console will be an afterthought for them. Above: A monster from Turtle Rock’s Evolve. Image Credit: Turtle Rock GamesBeat: It’s interesting how these cycles happen in the game industry. You think it’s going all in one direction. Disney, for example, invested heavily in games and then decided to blow it all up. They let go of Avalanche Studios in Utah, the maker of Disney Infinity, and shut the game down. That was a huge investment. But then, Warner Bros. picked up about half of that developer. Yesterday, NBC Universal announced that they hired Chris Heatherly, who had been doing mobile games for Disney. He’s going to create a 50-person game publishing operation focused on mobile and VR. There’s a cycle here that happens. While Disney lost its religion as far as internally produced games, now Universal is picking that up. There are still opportunities. It’s a $110 billion business. Parts of it are growing — like mobile games. While in many ways it’s a bloodbath right now, it’s currently $38 billion, and it’s projected to go to $65 billion by 2020. There’s continuous renewal in the game industry. It does grow bigger over time. But there’s a lot of risk. Goldstein: It depends on where the renewal is coming from. You’re talking about multinational conglomerates expanding their presence in the games business. That’s great for those companies, but then, the question becomes, what happens to independent developers in that ecosystem while this is going on? It feels like Amazon is almost taking over the industry with the amount of hiring they’re doing, but that’s all being built internally. You have a lot of people, a lot of more senior people getting pulled into these larger organizations and, I think, leaving this chasm where there used to be a lot of independent developers. Those are all going away. The reason we still have a lot of independent developers in the business is largely because of VR. I’m sure that anyone representing developer clients, you’ve probably done at least 10 or 15 VR deals in the past year. For us, working with Oculus was pivotal. We weren’t seeing that ability to take on a larger project, and yet, here come these guys, and they need a ton of content quickly. Google is like this as well. They’re offering the best deals in the industry. They’re incredibly developer friendly. Going back to the panel yesterday, when they were talking about all the various contract points that publishers will focus on — these guys are great because they understand that they need an independent development community to exist. In order to make sure that community exists, they’re incentivizing developers to make cool stuff. Under those deal terms, you’re making royalties right off the bat. One of the coolest things that’s happened to us in the past couple of years is we actually had a profit distribution to our employees because of what we were able to achieve on Oculus. That’s never happened with large-scale development. I’m hoping that, as other companies start entering the VR space and also see a need to populate their hardware with a bunch of content, that they follow suit. Maybe we can dial back terms that have become very difficult for developers now in games and adopt those friendlier terms from VR. Those are the things that are going to sustain this business. Above: Dean Takahashi (left) of GamesBeat with Steve Goldstein of Turtle Rock. Image Credit: VGBA GamesBeat: I get a drift from you that the life of an independent game developer is hard and getting harder. But collectively, if you see the opportunities for independent developers, that’s encouraging. There’s always some other source of wherewithal to get your games done, whether it’s money or new platforms. And there are cycles to this. I remember when Microsoft entered the console business. They were seen as the great hope for a revival of the American game development industry. It had weakened a great deal. Everyone felt like they were dependent on the Japanese platforms. Microsoft funded a lot of ideas out there, and some of them were very bad, but one of them was Halo, which made the Xbox take off. Eventually, Microsoft figured out where their hits were coming from and reinvested a lot of money there. They went through a cycle during that console generation, and you can see Oculus doing the same thing now. Facebook put $250 million into VR startups. They pledged to put in another $250 million. But they’re starting to cull things now. They just decided to cut Oculus Story Studio. You can expect that these patterns happen, and it’s good for developers who — they might view VR as the part-time job they take while they figure out what to do in the future. Goldstein: I’d disagree with that. I think a lot of developers are looking at VR and — we’re certainly looking at it as a requirement, a skill set that we’re building now because it’ll be an expectation in five years. Story Studio is a unique situation. Yes, Oculus is, I perceive, culling on the basis of some things are working and others aren’t. But Story Studio was a weird situation for them because that was an internal content team for Oculus. Facebook has never really been about building its own content, rather having others build it for them. They may have decided to go back to that old way of thinking, the more institutionalized way of thinking. Question: Isn’t part of that just, it’s early in the cycle as far as hardware, and you need hardware installation to be able to sell your software? You’re spending X to make a story-driven experience, and it’s not appealing to the early adopter of your platform. So you close this down, and then, when there are 6 million headsets in circulation, you come back to it. Goldstein: That’s a fair point, too. They were Rift only. That’s a rough installed base right now. Whereas Gear has 7 million units out there and probably much more than that as the [Galaxy S8 smartphone] takes off this holiday. VR is going to happen. It’s just that the way it’s going to happen will surprise people. I don’t think anyone expected mobile to be the thing that most people experience VR as. Everyone pictured the big-budget crazy experience. But in reality, when you show up at the AT&T store and they hand you this thing, and your kid grabs it and puts it on and has a great time, that’s how VR is going to become mainstream. GamesBeat: [Unity Technologies CEO] John Riccitiello has a nice comment about how everybody thought VR would be like this (straight-line growth) and reach $100 billion at some point in the near future, when in fact it was going to be more like this (a curved growth path that starts out slow). You still get to $100 billion, but it’s a much slower takeoff than everybody was originally forecasting. You adjust your business to deal with this kind of curve as opposed to a straight line. Jason Rubin, the head of internal games at Oculus, was saying that VR is the hardest medium, or the hardest kind of product, to develop these days. There are no rules. You have no idea if you’ll get it right. You’ll fail a few times before you get to the right product. You have to do a lot of prototyping. And you can’t shortcut that process. You can’t just say, “I’ll make the successful one now.” You have to continuously experiment and deal with the fact that a few early efforts are going to fail. That’s a hard bet for any kind of business person or investor to make. It has to be fueled by the Facebooks of the world. Goldstein: The weird thing about VR, one of the things I think about — when you think about the very early days of the games business, or the home entertainment business, where you had … even before the Atari 2600, you had Pong. Pong was this giant console you’d attach to the antenna inputs and that whole deal. That had a pretty rapid adoption rate. It was a mass market thing. People could grab it, take it home, and have a good time. That led to further advances and development of technology that resulted in the 2600 and so on. With VR, it’s almost the opposite. VR is giant corporations determining that they are going to set their stake in what the future of computing is going to be in 10 or 15 years and then trying to force that on the mass market. It’s fascinating to watch. I don’t know how long it’s going to take for them to get there. Facebook is going to do it. Microsoft is going to do it. Google is going to do it. But it’s a long-term vision that’s not going to be adopted by consumers in the same way that other electronic entertainment devices were many years ago. Above: Tim Sweeney at GamesBeat Summit. Image Credit: GamesBeat GamesBeat: I don’t necessarily believe that VR is the high school project sort of thing. I do think it’ll be transformative. It’s going to go by different names. Augmented reality is part of it as well in some ways. More recently, Tim Sweeney of Epic Games was talking about the metaverse. Ever since Snow Crash came out in 1992, everyone wants to build the metaverse. Second Life was a first attempt at that. Sweeney now thinks that within three years, somebody can do it. Somebody can go back to that original vision and build this virtual world that we can live in. You have things like Ready Player One, with the movie version coming out next year. It’ll be interesting to see what other things are timed to come out with Ready Player One. Tim is very concerned about whether this metaverse is going to be open or not. He sees the platform companies making their plays to be the owner of the metaverse, to own it in every way — from payment platforms to content to data access — data that you may think is private but that’s really owned by them. You can see different companies jockeying for this position. We were talking about the cycle among the platform companies. It seems clear that to the platform companies, games are a means to an end. They want to control the platform and set it in the direction they want. Games are always great boosters for platforms, so they’ll support games. If you look at SoftBank as an example, what the heck is SoftBank doing? They own Sprint. They want to merge it with T-Mobile. They bought ARM for $32 billion. At the time, Masayoshi Son, the CEO of SoftBank, said that he’s preparing for the singularity — the day when artificial intelligence is smarter than the collective wisdom of all humanity. He’s preparing for this in a practical way. He’s raising a $100 billion fund to make the singularity possible in the next 30 years. He bought ARM to have a computing platform to make it, to have the artificial intelligence platform. Then you ask, “Why does he care about games?” Last week, SoftBank invested $500 million in a 100-person startup in London called Improbable. Improbable is basically making a cloud-based operating system that enables very small game companies to make large online worlds. That’s the metaverse, a collection of worlds all running on Improbable technology. It’s interesting to see companies stepping up and saying, “I want to own this. Games are a way for me to get there. I’ll invest along the way.” Developers, in some ways, can foresee this and go along for the ride because they want to create great games. Goldstein: Creating a metaverse is certainly above my pay grade. I just like making sure we can employ our people and make some cool stuff. I think the issue around that is, yes, conceptually this sounds like a great thing. If you read Snow Crash, it doesn’t sound like that great a thing to me. In fact, it sounds pretty horrible. But just because you have a giant world with tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people playing simultaneously, it doesn’t mean that’s going to be a fun experience. There’s been a lot of these goals that very high-minded people will set around games. “I want to see a game with armies of 10,000 versus armies of 10,000!” That’s not necessarily fun. You as a player are inconsequential in that world. That’s not a good time. But when you bring it down to five on five, suddenly, you have games where people get all excited because that’s meaningful to the player. You’re contributing in a meaningful way. I’m interested in what the Improbable guys are doing. It’s pretty fascinating tech. I’m also interested to see what kind of games actually come out of it because I don’t fully understand how to make something where you’re participating amongst thousands a really good time. Above: Masayoshi Son, CEO of SoftBank. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi GamesBeat: There’s this top-down view of what makes sense to invest in, like Son’s point of view, and then, there’s a bottom-up view, things that happen in the game industry and bubble up through creativity. It’s nice when those meet. League of Legends is an example. Nobody would have predicted that was a game that was going to really take off. In fact, I remember being asked to meet with the Riot Games people before they launched League of Legends, and I just did a phone call because I didn’t feel like I had the time to deal with them directly. I didn’t predict that whatever they were working on was going to be any good. But it bubbled up. Then, it came into the sights of Tencent, and they eventually bought majority control of Riot Games. Now, it’s this essential community enabling Tencent to get to its larger platform goals over time. Games provide those huge, rabid, engaged communities. Goldstein: That’s always the goal. When you talk to guys at Riot and other people that are getting into esports and trying to push that, it’s not about creating a particular piece of content. It’s about creating a lifestyle and building that content around the lifestyle. It’s a key distinction. If you’re creating a lifestyle, that means you have a huge community that’s embraced everything you’re doing. If you ask that community, “What do you do on the weekend,” they say, “I play League of Legends.” It’s not, “I play video games.” It’s, “I play League of Legends,” in the same way you’d say, “I play golf.” If you can build that kind of community, you don’t have much to worry about as a business. That game will go on forever. How much room is there for multiple games like that? I’m not sure. Again, let’s name the successes. When you look at traditional sports, you have the NFL, NBA, MLB, things like that. I’m sure there’s a professional curling league for our Canadian friends, but it’s not doing the kind of numbers the NFL is. When you extrapolate that to games and the kind of investment VCs are making in esports, I don’t know if there can be a lot of NFLs. Question: Wouldn’t you rather be a profitable curling league team than an unprofitable NFL team? Goldstein: I’m a game developer. I don’t even understand profit [laughter]. So yes, to answer your question, but the profitable curling team isn’t going to make profits that are interested in the kind of people who want to invest in the hopes of you becoming the next NFL. Question: Who is investing in games, then? GamesBeat: An interesting fact from last week. Google bought its first game developer, the makers of Job Simulator, Owlchemy Labs. That’s an investment. Goldstein: Google is pushing hard. Oculus is still greenlighting content and investing in games. There are several Asian companies investing, but you have to hit a certain threshold before they’ll invest. Development side attorneys, how many of you have done prototype deals this year? A couple. I’ve done more prototype deals this year than in probably the past five years. That’s where a lot of publishers are now heading. “We’re not going to greenlight your $20 million project, but we’ll give you a prototype deal, and then, we’ll see.” That’s hugely problematic. One, it gives you anywhere from six months to, if you’re lucky, a year to put a team on something like that. Two, because it takes an average, as everyone knows, [of] about six months to get a publishing deal done, whoever’s financing that prototype is essentially ensuring that four or five months later, you’ll be shopping that prototype to all their competitors. But that’s how publishers are functioning right now. The good news for developers in that is that once you’ve got somebody to fund your prototype, then you can approach these companies in Asia that won’t sign on with you unless you have a prototype to show. It’s become a very bizarre ecosystem, but that’s what’s currently happening. Above: Supercell and Space Ape Games have teamed up as partners. Image Credit: Space Ape Games GamesBeat: Tencent has become the world’s largest game company, with $10 billion in revenue. NetEase is also in the top 10 for public companies reporting game revenue. On the platform side, Google, Microsoft, Sony, and Apple are in that bunch. EA and Activision Blizzard as well. You can say that all of them are investing in games in some way. SoftBank just said, with the Improbable deal, that they’re investing in games. Magic Leap raised $1.5 billion. All the companies that invested in Magic Leap are investing in games. It’s not really good on the granular level, though, where you’re talking about making investments in individual studios or projects. There are a few funds that got created in the last six months or so. The Russians did one, a $100 million fund to invest in either user acquisition for mobile games or development studios. Goldstein: There are more avenues of funding now, but it depends on the type of games you’re making. If you’re going for that $5 million budget or under, you have a lot of alternatives out there. I think Fig is one of the coolest things I’ve seen in a long time. Justin and his crew are smart. It’s like Kickstarter — for those of you that aren’t familiar. They have reward-based crowdfunding — spend $30 and get a t-shirt and get a copy of the game — but they’ve also used the JOBS act in order to create securities that are essentially a piece of the game. As an investor, you can buy into a Fig-supported game and reap profits, hopefully, later down the line when the game goes live. They’ve done well with that. I forget what they did on Pillars of Eternity 2, but I want to say it was [$4 million to] $5 million when they finished that round. GamesBeat: Every one of their fundings has been successful, too. There hasn’t been a project that’s failed to meet its target yet. Question: They’ve also been very selective. Goldstein: Right. They curate. GamesBeat: Kickstarter seems to have gotten a worse track record lately as far as hitting targets, but Fig and other equity crowdfunding companies seem to be picking up some of that slack. Goldstein: The curation aspect is really smart. The problem with Kickstarter is people have had enough with funding games that never come out, or the developer implodes, or somebody flies off to the Bahamas with a suitcase of money. At least with Fig, they know because they’ve done their examination of what studios are coming, the type of IP that’s going to be made, how the game fits in their slate — they operate more like a publisher, at least from the standpoint of developing a series of games that people will be interested in. Because they’ve done that, that results in those games getting made and coming out. Question: You were talking about stagnation in the industry, given the lack of new franchises in this generation. How much of that do you think is a market force, as far as gaming companies targeting their core audience, which has grown with certain franchises over time? If you have this core following for something like Zelda, it makes sense to continue to make Zelda games. How much of that stagnation is really just the market saying, “This is what we want. We want more of the franchises we’re familiar with?” Goldstein: Everything you describe is part of the problem. People think they want new stuff, and then, when you put out new stuff, they decide they want to stick with the next whatever it may be, Call of Duty or something like that. Publishers looking at that are going to narrow their scope because they only have so many dollars to spend on development. They see that fewer games are coming out, but people are spending more per game. They’ll spend $60 bucks on the box and another $50 on DLC. It’s all combined. It’s unfortunate because those systems provide a great opportunity to make new stuff, but new stuff is just too risky. Especially when you know that you can get a consumer for $100 [to $120] once you bake in ongoing content. Question: This is one maybe exceptional example, but a counterpoint would be something like Breath of the Wild. Zelda has a formula that’s worked for decades. To some extent, that bleeds into Breath of the Wild, but that game was also a huge departure for Nintendo in the way they designed it, and it was a huge success. It seems like there is still room, even if you end up following this trend as a developer — catering to fans with the franchises they like — there’s still room for innovation. Goldstein: I don’t know. The question of budget is always going to come into play. Nintendo games, the budgets on them just aren’t equivalent to what you have going on with Destiny, as an example. To Nintendo’s credit, they did create a franchise for this generation. Splatoon is a great game. It’s a lot of fun. There’s a sequel coming out and good for them. I also think Nintendo has historically been a bit of an outlier when you talk about consoles. Is the Switch even a console? Is it portable? What is it? It’s a smart move on their part because I think they understand that people want their entertainment to be mobile, something they can carry with them at all times. I can’t tell you how many people I’ve talked to who say, “Man, the Switch is amazing. I was playing it on my TV, and then, I took it to bed and kept playing Zelda.” That’s a huge move on their part. It also ties into — when you look at the direction of VR, AR, MR, wherever it’s headed, it’s all going to be essentially a portable device that you have on you at all times. That totally got off track, sorry. Above: Call of Duty: World War II is happening. Image Credit: Activision GamesBeat: One thing I wonder is, why aren’t some of the portfolio strategy companies beating the companies that have focused down so much? You think of Activision and how they used to be. Now, they’re a three-game company: Destiny, Skylanders, and Call of Duty. That switch they made was probably one of the most brilliant moves any company has made — to go down to just three games and focus on them and turn them into multi-billion-dollar franchises. They’re profitable. They’re in the top-10 public game companies because of that strategy. Electronic Arts is making more money. Its stock price is a lot higher. It also went from 60 games a year down to eight. But what seems healthy for the industry, to me, is more like the tentpole strategy I described, where you have a portfolio of games and you can experiment based on revenue coming in from your big hits. That’s a good thing, I think, when you have that level of experimentation within each company. Glu Mobile, though, is not successful as one of those kinds of companies. It a collection of many different genres of games within one mobile-game company. They logically should be more successful than Supercell or Machine Zone or King. But those companies are more like Activision. They have one or two or three games. Above: Go Go Genji Ranger. Image Credit: GamesBeat Goldstein: To be fair, Activision is more than a three-game company. It’s probably a seven-game company because you have to factor in Diablo, World of Warcraft, and Overwatch. Candy Crush as well. In some ways, I guess Overwatch really is an example of the tentpole strategy. Revenue from Warcraft and Diablo funded 10 years worth of development on what ultimately became Overwatch. Some companies can still afford to do that. It’s just that everybody else in the world, other than Blizzard, doesn’t really have that luxury. Question: What we’re seeing to some extent — game concepts come from two places. They come from game designers or they come from marketing. The marketing department sometimes comes up with game ideas — a product person in a game company’s marketing department who’s been trained at Nestle or Procter and Gamble will sit there and run the numbers and say, “We need another Call of Duty. We need another Destiny.” I don’t think that person is going to innovate. That person is going to do what mathematically makes the most sense based on MBA training. Where you’re going to get Minecraft is from one guy who has the passion to build something and becomes a game designer. Innovation is going to come from smaller groups. Hopefully, they’ll drive innovation. You’ll always have these huge companies, to an extent, like you have in the film industry. They’ll do another Fast and Furious movie because market research tells them how much money it’s going to make. They’re not going to do indie-style movies themselves. Indie studios will do those, and maybe they’ll get bigger distribution. But the real innovation will come from smaller companies. Goldstein: Absolutely right. The giant publishers have essentially become Hollywood studios. I can’t tell you how many meetings I’ve had where someone will say, “We want to find a game like Rocket League.” And I sit there thinking, “No, you don’t. If you did, you would have signed Rocket League.” Everyone’s expecting that suddenly they can duplicate the innovative thing that they didn’t recognize in the first place. Question: And it’s because that’s not what they do. If you’re a product marketer, don’t try to be a game designer. The game designers have the vision to say, “I have something new that people haven’t played before, and I’m going to pursue it. I may create what people are going to want to play next year.” People don’t necessarily want to play what’s hot now. They’re playing it, but they don’t know what’s coming out a year or two from now. It’s our job to figure out what they’ll want to play in two years. It’s not the marketer’s job to do that. Question: The great irony of this whole thing is that, as the business has grown — we all talk about how the game business is bigger than the film business. Well, you get all the film business issues that way. You look at the movie business this summer. There’s a couple of enormous movies doing all the business. Everything else is either terrible or a big flop. This King Arthur movie that came out this week is going to be something like a $130 million loser. As the game business, we take a lot of pride in how we’ve grown from selling games in baggies at flea markets to becoming what we are today. You get the good and the bad with that. What we’re focusing on here now is that there’s a bad side to that growth, too. You can lose innovation when you have such big money decisions that have to be made. Goldstein: Going back to the console discussion and the major publishers, you’re losing innovation there. The company that I think has been doing it right for a long time now, actually, is Tencent. Riot is the big example, but Tencent has made investments in a lot of developers that people aren’t aware of. These developers are running their games on their own. They’re publishing games on their own. They don’t need to take heed of a third party pressuring them to go in a direction they don’t want to go. There’s going to be a lot of innovation coming out of that model, where you have developers building good, sizable businesses. They may not be billion-dollar franchises like League or an Activision game or an EA game, but they have a nice, respectable business that allows them to make the games they want to make. Above: Tencent’s booth at ChinaJoy 2015. Tencent is China’s biggest game company. Image Credit: Dean Takahashi Question: It may be a window, though. As that matures, then the window begins to close. What was once an opportunity like that is no longer there. Then, you have to look somewhere else. Goldstein: Well, that’s always the case. We’re always scrambling. Question: On the console side, we’re talking about boxed games and how there isn’t innovation. There is innovation on the download stores for the consoles. That’s where an indie can come in and do something on a smaller budget, try a new type of gameplay, and put it out there. It may be over time that, as retail decreases and digital increases — that’s already happening. It’s more than 50 percent of revenue for people like EA. But as that continues to become the primary method of distribution, it’s possible that that’s where you’ll see innovation. That’s the window for the indies into the console space, the PlayStation Store, and Xbox Live. That’s where they can distribute things that can’t get on Walmart shelves. Goldstein: You can certainly have companies doing a decent business from that. But I think those companies are few and far between, the ones that are successful at that. Question: It really all comes down to what we talked about yesterday. It’s my personal belief, at least, that the industry has to be more developer friendly. Your joke about profit — developers don’t make money. It’s a rare developer that does, one in a thousand. You’re working a lot of hours and just hoping to make next week’s payroll. Goldstein: We’re in the lottery ticket business. GamesBeat: I like to think of forces in the industry and counter-forces or counter-strategies to them. Apple is very strong, but it’s also very proprietary. You’d expect a counter to arrive in the form of Android. Steam is the counter to Windows. Question: It’s not so easy to put up an independent game from a studio no one’s heard of up on Steam and make your money back, though. People think it is, just like at one point they thought you could put anything on iOS and make your money back. Goldstein: I’ve had plenty of meetings asking if I could make something like Ark. The new one now is Battlegrounds, I think. GamesBeat: But the force that’s stopping some of this — FIFA is already huge. It sold 21 million units this past go round. It made $800 million in revenue from FIFA Ultimate Team, the DLC. Developers who once were available to do something else are now just making DLC, making Ultimate Team content nonstop. They’re doing live operations year round. That’s definitely the case across the mobile industry. Any successful games are live operations games. Those teams are preoccupied with the current hit. It does fund other games that are possible, but those teams are staying in place. The Call of Duty teams stay in place. They’re not doing original work. Goldstein: I’m not going to say what publisher it is, but when it comes to these franchises, the developers that are working on them don’t want to make new stuff. New stuff isn’t allowing them to go buy a Porsche every other year. They’re all doing very well working on established franchises. There’s no incentive for them to say, “Hey, management, I’d love to pitch you my new idea.” That doesn’t make sense. Going back to the question that was raised earlier, why isn’t there more innovation? There’s no incentive for internal teams on successful franchises to make something new. Why take the risk?

LG V30 to come with slide-out second display? by Joe Roberts 15 hours ago 0 shares Read Comments Google revealed this month that LG will be releasing its next 'V' phone this year, and though we don't have a name for the phone yet, we expect it to be called the LG V30. Details are somewhat sparse at this point, but we do know the handset will be the next 'Daydream-ready' phone – meaning it'll work with Google's VR platform. It's also expected to run on the upcoming Android O operating system, but beyond that, there's no real concrete specs to go on. Related: LG G6 Happily, a few leaks have provided some possible feature insights, including this new one from trusted tipster Evan Blass, AKA @evleaks. The journalist took to Twitter to debut the following images which reveal the V30 could come with a secondary slide-out display. Blass does make sure to say he isn't sure the design shown in the above images reflects where the phone is currently, so it could be LG has changed its plans since the picture was produced. But, if the design has remaind the same as these mock-ups, it seems the V30 could come with a slide-out secondary display which would sit below the main screen. This screen looks as though it would be used to display a keyboard, search results, and other navigation controls – similar to Apple's Touch Bar on the latest MacBook Pro model. At this point, there's no way to know whether these images are an accurate representation of what LG will debut on the V30 when it actually launches. The phone is expected to arrive around Septemeber/October, but for now, all we know is it will be arriving in 2017, so stay tuned for more.

[Deal Alert] Several movies and TV episodes on Google Play are on sale for Memorial Day Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/27 6:37pm PDTMay 27, 2017 55 Plus 1 on G+ 125 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares227 Deals Google News If your Memorial Day weekend plans are being ruined by poor weather, Google has an offer for you. It recently tossed up a little holiday sale on movies and TV shows over on Google Play, including some deals that are over 50% off their regular prices. So if you can't go camping or throw that family barbecue because of rain, at least you and your loved ones can snuggle up inside while you binge watch The Wire. It'll be good for little Johnny's character. Among the better movie collections being offered are The Lord of the Rings Trilogy for $20, the Back to the Future Trilogy for $15, and "The Best of Tarantino" six-movie collection for $30. The latter includes one of my favorite cheesy horror movies, From Dusk Till Dawn. The TV selection has a lot of solid HBO shows — if you don't happen to have HBO Go — as well as the complete X-Files for $50, American Horror Story seasons 1-5 for $60 and the amazing Kung Fu series in its entirety for $30. For more family-oriented deals there are a ton of shows from Nickelodeon, as well as a small number of animated children's film collections. You know what? The outdoors are over-rated. Who would want to spend a weekend outside with their loving family when they could spend days forcing their children to appreciate their favorite childhood movies.

gizmodo Deadspin Fusion Gizmodo Jalopnik Jezebel Kotaku Lifehacker The Root gizmodo The Best Stuff to Do On the Google Homepage That Isn't Googling David NieldYesterday 11:25am Filed to: Google Android Easter Eggs mobile desktop 10 6 Edit Promote Share to Kinja Toggle Conversation tools Go to permalink Image: Screenshot When Google’s engineers aren’t busy upgrading the serious stuff inside Google’s email apps or mobile OS, they like to leave little treats and games inside Google’s products—everything from humorous search results to hidden creatures. These are some of our favorites for when you’ve got five minutes or five hours to waste. Atari Breakout Image: Screenshot Run a Google image search for “Atari breakout” and you’re met with a version of the classic game you can play in your browser. Use the cursor keys as controllers. The classic Google search page Point your browser at https://archive.google.com/heart to relive your youth with the classic Google search page. It still works, but the results page is the modern version. Are you feeling lucky? Click I’m Feeling Lucky on Google with nothing in the search bar and you’re given a random Google link to try—it could be anything from mini puzzles to charity drives. Pac-Man Image: Screenshot Atari Breakout isn’t the only game that gets a Google Easter Egg spin. The 2010 Google Doodle version of the classic title, Pac-Man, can be brought back with a simple Google search for “pac-man”. Search box tricks GIF Image: Screengrab Several Google searches give entertaining results. Some of our favorites? Try entering “do a barrel roll”, “google in 1998", “askew”, “<blink>“, or “sonic the hedgehog.” Search box tools These Eggs aren’t really hidden surprises, more useful tools. You can run Google searches for “flip a coin” or “roll a die” to do just that, or use “timer” or “stopwatch” for those apps. Solitaire Image: Screenshot You’re still after another game aren’t you? Typing “solitaire” into Google gives you a web version of the classic card game. If you don’t like cards, try entering “tic tac toe” instead. Bacon numbers Every movie star is less than six steps away from Kevin Bacon and Google can help you prove it—type the name of almost anyone followed by “bacon number” to get the link. Search in pirate or Klingon Google knows more languages than you might have realized: you can load up the search results page to display labels in pirate, Klingon or hacker speak, should you need to. The Loch Ness pegman Normally he’s yellow. (Image: Screenshot) Search for “loch ness” on Google Maps and the iconic pegman figure turns into the shape of Scotland’s most famous mythical (?) monster. No sightings of the actual Nessie, though. Use the Force, Luke GIF Image: Screenshot The Star Wars scroll Easter Egg has come and gone from YouTube, but this one lives on—enter “use the Force, Luke” as a YouTube search to send the results into flux. Brush up on your trivia Knowledge is power and you can get more of it by searching for “fun facts” on Google. When you’ve absorbed the information, click Ask Another Question for a new fact. Endless dinosaur running If you find yourself without internet on your smartphone, pass the time by loading up Chrome for iOS or Android and tapping the dinosaur to launch an endless runner. Travel by dragon Image: Screenshot One for the Welsh here. If you choose to navigate from Snowdon to the Brecon Beacons and “dragon” appears as a travel option. Unfortunately, no dragons appear on screen. The Emmett Brown pegman You might have noticed this already, but when you view older imagery in Street View (via the drop-down menu in the top-left corner), the pegman turns into Emmett Brown. Cast spells on Android Call up the Google voice interface on Android via “OK Google” and you can cast a couple of Harry Potter spells: “lumos” to turn on the flashlight and “silencio” to mute all sounds.

No matter the platform, the same SEO principles apply if you want your e-commerce store to be found in search results. With some simple tweaks and optimizations to your Shopify store, you can improve your visibility, rank on the first page for your targeted keywords, and make the sale. While you may not outrank Amazon on day one, this Shopify SEO guide will walk you through everything you need to position your store for success. Launching Your Shopify Store Your store theme should match your brand style and make sense for your inventory. But also think about the impact on speed and usability, as these factors will greatly affect SEO. Before you buy or install a theme, verify that it won’t hurt your speed and performance. Run the theme URL through a tool like GTMetrix or Web Page Test. While the numbers will be different on your store, it will give you an idea of the resource demand of the core theme you’re building on. Run the theme URL through PageSpeed Insights. Since Google’s analysis of your page is ultimately what matters when you want to rank, verify that Google evaluates the code positively. When it comes to speed, the Turbo Shopify theme from Out of the Sandbox is my favorite right now. This theme is optimized for speed without sacrificing form or functionality. Installing this theme on a client site cut loading time by 75 percent. We routinely see clients keep load times under five seconds when they launch to a lean and clean theme. A smart theme selection will set you on the right path in terms of branding, user experience, and SEO. Technical SEO Without a strong foundation, SEO is just wainscoting on a pile of rubble. But when you build, reinforce, and maintain a strong foundation, SEO tweaks will add that decorative flourish to set you apart from the competition. Always optimize your site for customers, first and foremost. On-page SEO The same SEO elements that apply to a regular site apply to Shopify (here’s a great SEO checklist): Upload a robots.txt file so bots can crawl your site. Ensure you have an XML sitemap to guide Google through the architecture of your site. Install Google Analytics. Validate HTML and CSS. Purchase an SSL certificate and upgrade to HTTPS. Correct any crawl errors and redirect issues. Include target keywords for a given page in the title and H1. Optimize meta descriptions, as this can affects click-through-rate (CTR). Optimize headings (H1s, H2s, etc.) in a natural way. Optimize images (file name, alt text, and image size). Optimize all future pages as you add them, including collections and product pages. You’ll also need to re-optimize your content periodically to better target the keywords that convert the most. SEO is an ongoing process. Tweaks will always be needed because search algorithms are constantly changing – and so are your customers’ wants, needs, and behaviors. Run your site through an auditor like WooRank. Check back in every few months to make sure your corrections have taken hold and identify any new issues. On-page Optimizations in Shopify Shopify makes it easy to set your basic on-page details directly in the backend. Navigate to Sales Channels > Online Store > Preferences. On this page, you can update your homepage title and meta description. This is also where you can link your Google Analytics account. Individual product title and meta descriptions can be set directly on the page: Need to set up redirects? This can be done via Sales Channels > Online Store > Navigation. Click the “URL Redirects” button in the top right. Here, you can manage redirects and add new ones. Shopify automatically generates an XML sitemap of your store. You can find it by going to yourdomain.com/sitemap.xml. While Shopify isn’t quite as SEO-friendly as sites on WordPress with a plugin like Yoast, you can optimize almost everything directly through the dashboard. Apps Shopify has a pretty awesome collection of free or low-cost app integrations to take your store to the next level. Our clients have had great success capturing abandoned carts and re-engaging past customers with Conversio (formerly Receiptful). Bold Apps can help with sales and upsells, not to mention Sweet Tooth Loyalty Program and MailChimp integration for your email marketing efforts. The Shopify Reviews App or Yotpo are amazing as they add review schema right onto the product to help click-through rate in the SERPs. Apps can help with everything from driving newsletter sign-ups to running sales. However, apps can slow down stores and cause some conflicts, so choose wisely. Speed Speed should always come before cool features. Why? Forty percent of users will abandon a page if it takes longer than 3 seconds to load. In fact, a single second delay in page loading can drop conversions by 7 percent. For an e-commerce store, that could cost thousands in lost sales each year. Mobile users are impatient. A slow store is bad business. Optimizing your Shopify store for speed is almost exactly the same as any other website. Small improvements like the ones listed below should help improve load times: Minify code (CSS & JavaScript) Compress images Minimize redirects Enable browser caching Use a content delivery network (CDN) You can see a full list of recommendations and see how your store measures up when you run your domain through a tool like GTMetrix. Speed matters for user experience, but it’s also a Google ranking factor. The faster your site can be without stripping elements that provide an optimal user experience, the better. User Experience Ask yourself these questions to evaluate whether your Shopify store offers an excellent user experience: Does the homepage explain what your store is all about? Is it easy to understand? Is the site structured well? Is the page layout clear, consistent, and visually appealing? Are the graphics welcoming and consistent? Do your product images show high-quality graphics of what you are selling? Is there good use of white space? Is the content too dense? Are navigation buttons and tabs consistent and intuitive? Is the relationship between the page and navigation clear? Is there a clear “path” for users to follow from first landing on the site to buying a product? Is the content unique, well-written, and accurate? Are there ads, interstitials, pop-ups, or any other obtrusive elements on the page? If so, are they displayed in a professional manner? Are there calls-to-action (CTAs) on the page, and are they clear and intuitive? If you can say an emphatic “yes” to all of these questions, you’re on the right track to delight your users and Google. If you’re hesitant about any of the above elements, go back to the drawing board. You can draw in visitors through paid ads, organic traffic, or social, but the page has to serve their needs. Otherwise, metrics will confirm your site just isn’t cutting it and everything will suffer — including search rankings. User testing can help you get a more accurate sense of how customers interact with your store and shine a spotlight on problem areas. Optimizing Your Store for Conversions Conversion optimization is all about getting visitors to engage with your content, like you, trust you, and ultimately buy your product. Each of these actions at one level or another is associated with a site-level metric that influences your site’s Google rank. After all, users who take an action on your site contribute a lower bounce rate, longer time on site, higher pages/session, and more. Without worrying about a single technical detail, shifting your mindset to associate conversion optimization with rankings benefits will pay tremendous dividends. If Google sees that users click to your store and buy something, that can positively influence your rankings. Google wants to show the most relevant and useful results to users. Make your site exactly what your customers want and need. Content A beautiful website without quality content is like a top-line Viking range with no ingredients to cook — a total waste. All the little optimizations and tweaks I detailed earlier mean nothing if they’re not building on a rich, deep, and insightful foundation of high-quality content. Homepage Your Shopify homepage represents who you are, what you do, what you offer, and your unique value proposition. Harris Farm Markets is one site that does a great job with their homepage layout and content: It’s hyper-visual and rich in content. From the first look at the page to the final scroll, you get a total sense of who they are, what they do, and what makes them different from a supermarket. Muse is another great example: Must makes it clear what the product is and how it can help from that first hero image to the research partners that provide credibility. Product Pages Ensure your product pages are fully optimized. Pasting the same generic sentence on each page won’t cut it. Write a unique, captivating product description. To avoid duplicate content, add variants to each product. This way, you won’t have to come up with new content for red and blue versions of the same shirt. To better serve your customers, have shipping, return, and sizing information available on the page. Ensure your images are optimized with a descriptive file name and relevant alt text. Consider enabling reviews on the page. Not only does it provide more value/info for customers, but it’s free content! Don’t use manufacturer descriptions! Write your own. Duplicate Product Pages If duplicate products are unavoidable, apply the rel=canonical tag to the product you want to take priority. If this is an ongoing issue like if your store is duplicating products across collection pages, you can install an app like the NoFollow and NoIndex Manager to take control over what gets followed and indexed. Deleting Products When a model becomes obsolete or you move on to a different stock, do you just delete the product? This can cause big SEO issues. Ensure you set up 404 redirects for all deleted products. Link to the most similar live product if you can, or the most relevant collections page. If nothing applies, redirect to the homepage. The Perfect Product Page Here’s an example of an exceptional product page: It has: Tons of content broken up into different chunks for readability and flow. Variants all on the same page to avoid duplicate content issues. Visual, informative content about features and specs, and even includes videos of the product in use. A review app, giving 800 words of additional content. Tabbed content allows you to add depth to the page without cluttering it. Here’s a great example: Collections Shopify automatically creates collections pages. You don’t have to make the pages visible on your site, but they represent a huge ranking opportunity for category keywords if you choose to use them. If your collections pages are just product lists, you’re missing an opportunity. We’ve been doing content projects for a lot of our e-commerce clients to grow their collections pages, and we’ve seen great results. For instance, instead of just a generic “jeans” or “men’s jeans” page, make a “skater jeans” or “baggy jeans” landing page building on a collection. These hyper-targeted keywords convert really well. Blog A blogging strategy is really important, especially for e-commerce. Maintaining a blog will: Provide value to users. Help you target long-tail keywords. Improve your organic search visibility. Give you more content to promote on social. Use tools like Google Trends and BuzzSumo to identify keyword opportunities and stay ahead of the curve on evergreen and trendy topics. Write long-tail content that has your product as the answer to a commonly asked question. Browse social media, Quora, Reddit, and niche forums to find these questions. Remember, a blog can be so much more than pure text: Post videos. Do a Q&A. Post how-tos. Create an infographic. Post gift guides, style guides, and lookbooks. Integrate buy buttons and strong calls-to-action (CTAs) to make blogs an important part of your sales funnel. Off-page Optimizations All of your on-page optimizations are just one part of the puzzle. Your store’s off-page presence is just as important, if not more. In other words, you need to market your Shopify store. Get the word out there. Put effort into a comprehensive, strategic social media presence. Do outreach and online PR. Build a robust backlink profile from trustworthy, authoritative domains. All of these efforts will help build brand awareness and affinity, which will ultimately increase search demand. Conclusion From choosing an SEO-friendly theme to core optimizations (on-page, speed, UX, CRO, content, and off-page), the recommendations in this guide should help steer your Shopify store to improved and sustained rankings success. Plan and deploy your SEO strategy using Shopify’s built-in features; monitor your results through keyword tracking software and Google Analytics, and adjust and experiment until you strike gold. Just remember: SEO alone isn’t enough for Shopify success. Search engines want to satisfy users, so always optimizing for your customers will delight two birds with one stone.

LinkedIn recently provided some insight. As the leading social media channel for business and professional networking, LinkedIn is essentially a job search engine, so it’s able to distill extensive career related information using its own data analytics. Based mainly on total views of job postings by thousands of companies, LinkedIn published its most sought-after companies findings in May, ranking the top 50 employers nationally. Not surprisingly, Google, or Alphabet as it’s now branded, came out number one. The top 10 employers are: Google Amazon Facebook Salesforce Uber Tesla Apple Time Warner The Walt Disney Company Comcast NBC Universal Click here to view the entire list. For all of the companies in the top 50, LinkedIn gauged the rankings using three key data points from its more than 500-million members: - Interest in a company’s jobs - Interest in a company’s brand - Employee retention What are drivers of workplace appeal and satisfaction? Cool work settings, amenities and flexible workplace practices all combine to make for attractive jobs, but it’s much more than that. Meaning Matters More Google is known for its athletic facilities, foosball, coffee lounges and great – often free – food. Yet, the average Googler will tell you, the main reason they enjoy working there is the constant challenge of innovating and tackling massive problems ranging from creating self-driving cars to impeding extremism. Scratch the surface, and you will find several core elements coming into play, each of them representing key psychographics of work that tell us why we like or don’t like working where we do. These include feelings like meaning, purpose and a sense of belonging. I’ve done extensive research into the millennial mindset finding how these kinds of intangibles are more important than salary. The chance for career advancement is also valued more, especially among younger workers. Companies like Google that give their employees a seat at the table and a voice in the process have created employee-stakeholder cultures that promote engagement and lead to higher productivity including continuous innovation, which is THE key to competitive advantage in today’s information age and knowledge-sharing economy. I had the chance to work closely with Google’s director of Global Workplaces and Real Estate, David Radcliff, in a think-tank exercise focused on effective workplace design and practices, resulting in a best-selling book, Change Your Space, Change Your Culture. We were meeting with a group of thought leaders inside the National Research Energy Laboratory in Golden, Colorado. It’s an impressively designed place where a lot of innovation surrounding energy management takes place, usually based on partnerships between the government and corporations. Although the NREL campus produces all of the energy it consumes, making a net-zero facility of more than a million square feet, something was missing. David pointed to the extremely quiet and near-empty office spaces that we toured, saying the campus lacked the energy, interaction and collaboration needed to sustain high-level innovation. The human side of the experience was lacking, despite the physical surroundings. So it comes down to the question: What employers treat their employees like adults, emphasizing thinking space over physical work space? The Super Nucleus Chances are, the 50 companies recognized by LinkedIn, understand the value of treating work as a social experience and treating their employees as stakeholders. It appears that about two-thirds of those companies including Google have direct or indirect impact on workplace experiences for countless numbers of other employers. For example, CBRE and Jones Lang LaSalle appear in the LinkedIn rankings. They are commercial real estate providers who also advise the Fortune 1000 on workplace location, design and practice, which is another reflection why real estate and workplace departments inside major companies are gaining more influence and clout at the management table. The same holds true for HR and IT departments. Some companies are even combining their real estate, human resources and technology groups into a “super-nucleus” supporting the needs of the entire business. Corporate real estate, and the workplaces it houses, is now more integral to many corporate bottom lines, viewed as strategic assets, not as cost centers. As LinkedIn is showing us, the employee experience within those workplaces are often more valuable than buildings and land. Richard Kadzis is expert on workplace practices, location strategies, sustainability, and other disciplines impacting productivity. His career spanned more than 35 years of advocating for corporate responsibility.  TweetShareGoogle+Email View the discussion thread. © 2017 KRWG Donate Now Search Contact Us Listen LIVE Regional Local Viewpoints KRWG News Video National/World Business Health Sports Weather NM Roads TX Roads Community Events Where to Watch & Listen Radio Schedule TV Schedule PBS and KRWG Video

Google for Jobs going live for some people Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/27 4:31pm PDTMay 27, 2017 17 Plus 1 on G+ 67 Share on Facebook 72 Share on Twitter Total Shares156 Google News Back at Google I/O, a new initiative was announced called 'Google for Jobs.' As you might be able to guess from the name, it is designed to make finding job openings easier and more effective - for both applicants and employers. The feature appears to be going live on Google Search, at least for some users. Currently, searching something like "barista jobs" just returns a list of results from job listing sites. With Google for Jobs, you get a much cleaner interface with more details, plus modifiers like 'Full-time' and 'Starbucks.'    Left: Current layout; Center, Right: New layout This doesn't seem to be live yet for everyone, including myself, but let us know in the comments if you see it.

[Deal Alert] Several movies and TV episodes on Google Play are on sale for Memorial Day Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/27 6:37pm PDTMay 27, 2017 55 Plus 1 on G+ 125 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares227 Deals Google News If your Memorial Day weekend plans are being ruined by poor weather, Google has an offer for you. It recently tossed up a little holiday sale on movies and TV shows over on Google Play, including some deals that are over 50% off their regular prices. So if you can't go camping or throw that family barbecue because of rain, at least you and your loved ones can snuggle up inside while you binge watch The Wire. It'll be good for little Johnny's character. Among the better movie collections being offered are The Lord of the Rings Trilogy for $20, the Back to the Future Trilogy for $15, and "The Best of Tarantino" six-movie collection for $30. The latter includes one of my favorite cheesy horror movies, From Dusk Till Dawn. The TV selection has a lot of solid HBO shows — if you don't happen to have HBO Go — as well as the complete X-Files for $50, American Horror Story seasons 1-5 for $60 and the amazing Kung Fu series in its entirety for $30. For more family-oriented deals there are a ton of shows from Nickelodeon, as well as a small number of animated children's film collections. You know what? The outdoors are over-rated. Who would want to spend a weekend outside with their loving family when they could spend days forcing their children to appreciate their favorite childhood movies. Let's face it, in the long run, your kids will thank you. Source: Google Play (1, 2) Tags deal alert google play memorial day movies sale tv subscribe ...

If you're wondering why and how Google can make these suggestions, here are some answers about the feature and how it works. Courtesy of Google   Hayley Tsukayama The Washington Post     If you use Google's Gmail app, you may have seen something new pop up on your screen this week: suggested responses for your emails. The move illustrates one way that Google is using its increased focus on artificial intelligence and machine learning. If you're wondering why and how Google can make these suggestions, here are some answers about the feature and how it works. • What's going on? Google calls the feature Smart Reply, and it's pretty much what it sounds like. Google algorithms are scanning your messages and using the information it gleans to suggest ways that you could reply to any given message. The feature is based off an idea from Gmail engineer Bálint Miklós, Google said in a 2015 blog post. Miklós asked the Google Research team if there was any way to create some tappable template replies in Gmail. There are, after all, plenty of emails to which one could respond with just a "Got it," "Thanks," or "See you soon!" Having some pre-made responses at one's fingertips would save everyone a little more time, Miklós thought. • Why am I seeing this now? Google users have had access to this feature since 2015, but only in Google's smaller and more experimental Inbox app. And the suggestions offered by the feature have been getting steadily more advanced as it's learned from the decisions of more customers. Based on that success, Google has decided it was ready for more general use. • How does it work? Smart Reply relies on machine learning to scan the subject line and body of an email and make suggestions based on what it sees. The company said it has built up a huge bank of anonymized customer messages and response decisions to help accomplish this. It is also designed to remember your individual preferences for things, such as punctuation. So it will be able to adjust its suggestions depending on whether you're a "Thanks!" or "Thanks." type of person. Smart Replies won't appear on every email though, Google said. You're most likely to see response suggestions on emails that can be easily answered with a simple sentence or two. • So ... is someone at Google reading my email? There is no person at Google reading your email, according to Google. Even when research scientists were building the feature and trying to suss out which responses matched which messages, they designed their testing to make sure that no person ever read a Gmail user's email. But it does mean that Google's software is scanning your messages, much in the same way that its spell-checkers and spam filters do right now. Google anonymizes all the data from these tools, but the fact that your messages are being scanned is still worth noting. • Can I turn if off? Yes. You are able to turn off Smart Reply through your settings menu. • How well does it work? Smart Reply suggestions have been getting steadily better as the feature has matured and learned from users' decisions. But it's still not perfect. Language, after all, is a complicated thing. Google researchers Brian Strope and Ray Kurzweil wrote about how difficult it is to parse the sentence, "That interesting person at the cafe we like gave me a glance," in a blog post this week. --- "In proposing an appropriate response to this message we might consider the meaning of the word "glance," which is potentially ambiguous. Was it a positive gesture? In that case, we might respond, "Cool!" Or was it a negative gesture? If so, does the subject say anything about how the writer felt about the negative exchange? A lot of information about the world, and an ability to make reasoned judgments, are needed to make subtle distinctions." --- Plus, our emails, particularly from mobile devices, tend to be riddled with idioms that make no actual sense. Things change depending on context: Something "wicked" could be good or very bad, for example. Not to mention, sarcasm is a thing. Which is all to warn you that you may still get a wildly random and even potentially inappropriate suggestion -- I once got an "Oh no!" suggestion to a friend's self-deprecating pregnancy announcement, for example. If the email only calls for a one- or two-sentence response, you'll probably find Smart Reply useful. If it requires any nuance, though, it's still best to use your own human judgment.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY Search Amazon Echo vs. Google Home: Which One Should You Buy? By Craig Lloyd on May 28th, 2017 Amazon blew the industry wide open with its release of the Echo back in 2014, and has since become the company’s most popular hardware product. However, Google has since gotten in on the fun with the Google Home, a direct Echo competitor that aims to reign supreme. But which one should you buy if you’re in the market for a virtual home assistant? Here are some key points to know about both devices to see which one might be best suited for you. RELATED ARTICLES How to Set Up and Configure Your Amazon Echo How to Set Up Google Home Google Home Is Much More Knowledgeable This should come as no surprise, but when it comes to asking random questions about all sorts of facts, Google Home comes out on top. That’s not to say the Amazon Echo is completely stupid, but in our testing, there were a handful of questions that the Google Home was able to provide an answer, while Alexa simply just replied with “Sorry, I don’t know the answer to your question.” For example, Alexa wasn’t able to answer questions like “What’s the average age of a human being?” (71 years, by the way), but Google Home was able to give me the answer right away. However, Alexa was able to do a better job in some areas, like when I asked both devices “How many movies has Tom Hanks been in?” Alexa was able to come up with the answer (83 films), while Google Home simply just named off a few movies that Hanks directed. Google Home is also able to remember the previous question, which is useful. So if you asked “Who played Woody in Toy Story?”, Google Home would say Tom Hanks, and then you could follow up with “How old is he?” and Google Home would say his age, even though you didn’t directly say “Tom Hanks”. Alexa isn’t able to do this. Overall, Alexa knows some stuff, but Google knows more. Amazon Echo Is Better for Smarthome Users—For Now The Amazon Echo has been around for long enough that it has built up quite the arsenal of supported smarthome devices, including products from Nest, Philips, SmartThings, Belkin, Wink, Insteon, and many more. Google Home supports most of the big players as well, but its full list isn’t quite as extensive. However, both devices integrate with IFTTT, which then allows them to connect to a ton of different products and services that wouldn’t be supported otherwise. It’s not quite as seamless as native integration would be, but it makes Google Home feel less crippled in the smarthome arena. RELATED ARTICLE The Amazon Echo Is What Makes Smarthome Worthwhile So if you’ll be using your virtual home assistant to control all of your smarthome gear (which some argue is what makes these things so great), then the Amazon Echo is probably the one you’ll want to get—at least until Google Home obtains more support for more devices. In any case, you can view Google Home’s full support list of smarthome devices, as well as the Echo’s list. Both Have Great Tastes In Music By default, the Echo uses Amazon’s Prime Music service and Google Home uses Google Play Music, both of which are great sources for streaming tunes. The biggest difference is how many songs each service has in their catalog. Amazon Prime Music only has around two million songs available, whereas Google Play Music has an astounding 35 million songs. You’ll find most popular songs on both services, though. However, Amazon Music Unlimited is a newer service from the company that boasts “tens of millions of songs”. Even if you’re a Prime member, though, you still have to shell out a monthly payment for it. Furthermore, both Prime Music and Google Play Music require a monthly payment, with the smaller Prime Music library included in Amazon’s $99/year Prime service. Besides the defaults, though, both the Echo and Home can link to your Spotify or Pandora accounts, so if you’re committed to one of those music providers instead, it’s no problem. Google Home Has Better Physical Controls Both the Echo and Google Home come with a small handful of controls on the device itself that allow you turn the volume up and down and mute the microphone. However, the Google Home’s control interface allows you to do slightly more. The Echo includes a volume wheel that you spin to turn the volume up or down, and the mute button sits right on top of the device, as well as a button to activate or cancel Alexa. That’s pretty much it. On the Google Home, the entire top surface is a touchpad and it relies on finger gestures to control everything, which are easy to grasp. With it, you can play or pause music, adjust the volume, and activate Google Home to begin listening. However, the microphone mute button sits on the back of the device, which is a slightly awkward place for it. Google Home Lets You Beam (Limited) Content to Chromecast RELATED ARTICLE How to Control Your Kodi Media Center with an Amazon Echo One of the biggest exclusive features of Google Home is its ability to integrate with Chromecast devices, which essentially allows you to control what you want on your TV using your voice. This is possible with the Echo, but it takes a lot of time and effort to make it work (and a home theater PC of some sort). If you have a Chromecast, you can tell Google Home to play a video or a song by saying something like “OK Google, play cat videos to the living room Chromecast” and it’ll begin shuffling cat videos from YouTube on your TV. Keep in mind that this feature only works with YouTube right now. Amazon Echo Integrates with Way More Services Similar to the smarthome support that each device has, the support for general services is a little lacking on Google Home, but there’s a lot you can do on the Amazon Echo. With the Google Home, you can ask for sports scores, news, and even ask for an Uber, but the Echo can do all that and much more, including having Alexa read your Twitter feed aloud and even guide you through the 7-Minute Workout, all thanks to third-party Alexa Skills that you can download. Of course, Google Home will likely add a lot more of these kinds of features in the future, but for now the Echo takes the cake when it comes to all the random stuff it can do. RELATED ARTICLES The Best Third-Party Alexa Skills on the Amazon Echo Six Ways the Amazon Echo Makes the Perfect Kitchen Companion Google Home Can Recognize Individual Voices More than likely there are multiple people living in your house, which means multiple people using the Amazon Echo or Google Home. Both devices have multiple-account support, but only the Google Home knows who exactly it’s talking to. RELATED ARTICLE How to Add Multiple Google Accounts to Google Home This makes it way easier to get information that’s pertinent only to you. So instead of saying something like “Hey Google, what’s on Craig’s calendar for today?” (which would be weird to say my own name), you can instead just say “What’s on my calendar for today?”. The Google Home will recognize your distinct voice and name off upcoming events that are on your calendar and no one else’s. Google Home Let’s You Create Custom Shortcut Commands One feature that I’ve been dying to have on a virtual voice assistant is shortcuts, which are shortened voice commands that can substitute in for longer voice commands. The Google Home lets you do exactly this. In other words, you can set it up so that instead of saying “Hey Google, dim the living room lights to 25%”, you can just say “Hey Google, dim the lights”. The Echo doesn’t let you do this, but hopefully Amazon will kick it up a notch in the near future and add this functionality to Alexa. Both Have Decent Speakers The full-size Echo and the Google Home come with surprisingly robust speakers that sound pretty good—certainly not as good as a dedicated speaker system, but good enough to keep at a respectable volume while you putz around the house. However, the speakers on the Google Home tend to go south the louder you turn them up, so I wouldn’t want to crank the volume if I want to keep the quality decent. Of course, if you have an Echo Dot, you can connect external speakers to it as long as the stereo system you’re plugging in has an auxilary jack. The full-size Echo and the Google Home don’t have audio out ports, so you’re stuck using the built-in speakers on those. Google Home Is Cheaper Perhaps one of the biggest shockers about Google Home is the price. At $129, it undercuts the full-size Amazon Echo by $50, and with many consumers concerned about price first and foremost, the Google Home has the advantage. Of course, the Echo Dot is just $50, but it’s missing the robust built-in speakers that the full-size Echo and Google Home have. We reckon Amazon will compete with this somehow—they already dropped the price permanently from $200 to $180—but it’ll be interesting to see how cheap it gets in the future. There are other small things, of course. For example, “OK Google” doesn’t quite roll off the tongue the way “Alexa” does, which makes a bigger difference than you’d think. Conversely, Google Home comes with a customizable base, which is nice if you want it to fit in better with your home. In the end, both are really good options, and it depends on what you’ll be using it for as far as which one you should go with. The Echo is better for smarthome integration and has slightly better speakers, and it integrates with a lot of different services through third-party Alexa Skills, but the Google Home’s vast search knowledge is likely something that Amazon will never touch, and the Chromecast support is pretty neat if you’re invested in that area.

Users normally have a significant amount of data stored across these services and Google is now making it easier for them to search for their content using Google Search. It has added a new “Personal” tab to Google search for precisely this purpose. Google Search already shows a combination of personalized and personal results to users. The new tab will enable users to quickly make all public results disappear so that they can search through all of the content that they have stored across Google’s services to find whatever it is they’re looking for. The tab has been placed in the same location as the News, Images, and Shopping tabs. It can be found at the top of the results page behind the “More” menu. Once selected, it automatically narrows down the search query to the user’s personal content only. They will then see results that include Gmail messages, calendar events, and more from their signed-in accounts. Those who are searching for images can dig deeper in Google Photos or immediately open an image result as and when required. Google’s Personal tab is now live for most users on the web and mobile versions of Google Search. It remains to be seen when it will go live for the Android and iOS apps. Filed in Web.

And it's no different for the thousands of people who come to Cornwall on their holidays each year or those already living here looking for things to do on a wet Saturday afternoon. But what is it about Cornwall that has you Googling away? The search engine's predictive function gives a hint of the most popular queries. If you start to type a question, the search engine will guess what you want to know before you finish based on other searches - so we found the most popular things people want to know about Cornwall. As self-professed Cornwall experts, we thought we would have a go at tackling your burning questions on our city. Why does Cornwall...? Why does Cornwall need re-branding? Stumped on the first question - never a good start. Well we're not sure Cornwall does need re-branding, and it seems neither is Google. All our search came up with was a load of nonsensical links to old case studies. When it comes to selling itself to visitors, Cornwall is doing just fine, with picture-perfect images such as the below shot of Kynance Cove on the Lizard. Why does Cornwall have a flag? The St Piran's flag is the flag of Cornwall and the earliest known description of the flag as the standard of Cornwall was written back in 1838. It is used by Cornish people and symbol of identity and consists of a white cross on a black background. The flag is attributed to St Piran, the fifth century Cornish abbot and saint. The design is said to represent white tin flowing from the black rock, or good overcoming evil, after a black stone on St Piran's fire leaked a white liquid - and he had discovered tin.

You catch a whiff of a Cornish pasty, certain shampoo or fresh-cut grass and you're flooded with a heap of fond memories, mostly from your childhood. Known as 'odour-evoked autobiographical memory', there is research that proves odours are effective as reminders of past experience - much more so than cues from other senses. This might be because of the way your brain processes odours and memories. Scents are routed through your olfactory bulb (the smell-analysing region in your brain) which is closely connected to your amygdala and hippocampus - the regions in your brain that deal with memory and emotion. That connection could explain why a smell is tied to strong memories which come flooding back when you're exposed to a particular odour trigger. There's no denying Cornwall is a smelly place, whether you're getting a nose full of something nasty or nice. But even the pungent scents are bound to take you back to sweet childhood memories. Here's Cornwall Live's list of 11 smells that make you realise you're in Cornwall. Why does Cornwall commend edmund? Bit of a left-field one here but it's something to do with a Shakespeare play and nothing for us to worry about. Must be GCSE time of year... What is Cornwall...? What is Cornwall famous for...? According to Google's top hit "Cornwall is famous for its pasties (a type of pie often containing meat), but saffron buns, Cornish Heavy (Hevva) Cake, Cornish fairings (biscuit), Cornish fudge and Cornish ice cream are also common. Cornish clotted cream is a popular topping on splits and on scones". But we experts know it's not just culinary reasons why we're on the map. From Sennen to Looe Beach, Cornwall has miles and miles of golden sand, a beautiful ragged coastline, captivating fishing villages and when we're lucky, pounding surf. We have no shortage of unique celebrations that see thousands parade through the streets and a rich history which once saw the county at the forefront of the global mining industry, to mention just a few. Read more: Try not to laugh - Devon has just been described as a wasteland full of whingers What is Cornwall like...? Very nice thanks. A bit busy during the summer but it's a price worth paying to live here. What is Cornwall like to live in...?

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AR/VR Guest The factions of the mobile AR war Tim Merel@DigiCapitalist May 28, 2017 6:00 AM Above: Augmented reality shooter Fatheri.o Mark Zuckerberg’s “We’re making the camera the first augmented reality platform” was the most important step so far toward mass market AR. Where Pokémon Go gave many consumers their first taste of mobile AR, and Google Tango ushered in the race towards high end mobile AR phones, Facebook’s AR Platform now democratizes mobile AR regardless of hardware. Apple launching an AR enabled iPhone this year or next year could combine with Facebook to kick-start the mobile AR market at scale, and also be the final step towards the next great platform war. Consumers will win as usual, but there will be blood (as we detailed in Digi-Capital’s new Mobile Augmented Reality Report). The platform question Hardware and software platforms are so intertwined that it can be hard to tell the difference, and this has played in Apple’s favor for the last decade. But Apple, Samsung and other phone makers have done such a great job with existing hardware, that this may backfire for mobile AR. Facebook’s AR Platform, for example, has shown exactly how the major social and messaging platforms can play the game using nothing more than a standard smartphone camera. So while device manufacturers roll out new hardware to build an installed base for AR phones, established and startup social/messaging platforms could build a mobile AR ecosystem and user base in a fraction of the time at a fraction of the cost. They’ll also be able to leverage this advantage as dedicated AR phones come to market. What is mobile AR anyway? At one end Pokémon Go is what some industry insiders call “the best worst example of AR”, because its ambient mobile AR is pretty basic. Lovely graphics positioned approximately against the real world on your phone screen, using basic computer vision and positional tracking. Nonetheless it’s introduced mass consumers to mobile AR, and they’ve loved playing with it. At the other end of the spectrum is Google Tango, with hardware based immersive mobile AR driven by integrated hardware and software. Without diving into the technical weeds, Tango phones enable accurate motion tracking, area learning and depth perception in a device that looks much like any other smartphone. The difference comes from a motion tracking camera, a depth sensing camera, an infrared projector, computer vision and Simultaneous Localization And Mapping software. So virtual objects superimposed on the real world appear as you would expect them to if they were really there. But Tango’s time is yet to come in terms of consumer awareness and app ecosystem (though Google, Lenovo and Asus are trying). Facebook and Snap’s software-based immersive mobile AR is a serious contender, as it combines the ubiquity of ambient mobile AR with some of the computer vision and SLAM that previously required dedicated hardware. While Google Tango’s sensors enable heavier duty mobile AR apps, that’s not the problem Facebook and Snap are solving. By plugging immersive software based mobile AR into the largest consumer platforms on the planet, they’re democratizing mobile AR for everyone for free. And free is a good price point. This hasn’t escaped the notice of Tencent in China either. Mark Zuckerberg, Evan Spiegel and Pony Ma didn’t get to where they are by being dummies, and so it is with software based mobile AR. The cool kids There’s another factor in the democratization of mobile AR that Pokémon Go highlighted – demographics. Sixty-eight percent of Pokémon Go users are between 13 and 29 years old. Even though that came from a very specific set of circumstances, it is the largest sample set of mobile AR mass adoption to date. For comparison in terms of major consumer platforms: Eighty-eight percent of Americans from 18 to 29 use Facebook (two-thirds of them use Messenger), 76 percent of U.S. teens own an iPhone (81 percent want their next phone to be one),  75 percent of WeChat users are between 20 and 30, and 60 percent of Snapchat users are between 13 and 24. Spot the pattern? Mobile AR will be adopted by the young. Platforms that can scale mobile AR with 13 to 29 year olds will win. Apple of my eye Tim Cook loves AR, but Apple has been characteristically enigmatic about its plans. We wrote back in January that Apple could launch an AR enabled iPhone this year or next year, with Samsung and others following. But until Tim Cook says “one more thing” about mobile AR, we really don’t know for certain. So let’s think this through. For the last two years we’ve said that Apple is the best-placed of all major tech companies to drive AR, with its end-to-end ecosystem of hardware, software, app store, developers and retail. Combined with iMessage and its renewed push with stickers, an iPhone AR looks like a pretty compelling proposition. But Apple has a problem: Apple. Apple’s closed ecosystem is a huge advantage, but it’s also a weakness. Apple could provide the best and most complete experience for mobile AR, but only for folks who’ve bought a new iPhone AR. Apple expects users to replace iPhones every 3 years, which is a major driver of 200 million plus annual sales. But iPhone 7/7 Plus only makes up around two-thirds of the total. Assuming the iPhone AR is a range-topper that stimulates growth (converting Android users, reducing replacement cycles), we’re looking at an installed base of at first tens and then hundreds of millions of iPhone ARs in a few short years. But Facebook Messenger has 1.2 billion MAU, WeChat has 768 million DAU, Instagram has 400M DAU, WhatsApp Status has 175 million DAU, Snapchat has 160 million DAU. This means it could take Apple well over 5 years to deliver the mobile AR reach Facebook and Tencent potentially have today. Marc Andreessen remains right – software is eating the world. Do androids dream of tangoing sheep? Samsung and Huawei are the largest Android phone makers globally (not forgetting Oppo and Vivo in China), and these two companies could drive the hardware based mobile AR market for the larger Android ecosystem. But Samsung’s S8 and Huawei’s P10 aren’t AR enabled phones, having neither Tango nor their own proprietary AR platforms. So as discussed in January, we’re looking at 2018 as the likely inflection point for Android hardware based mobile AR. There is also the Android ecosystem challenge of the separate Google Play dominating outside China, and a fragmented set of changing players ruling app stores in China. In other words, none of the Android hardware players has the dominant end-to-end mobile AR potential of Apple. Who dares wins Sun Tzu’s “victorious warriors win first, then go to war” is a way of thinking about Mark Zuckerberg kicking off the mobile AR platform war at F8. Facebook’s mobile AR Platform wins outside China. Its user base, platforms (Messenger, Instagram, WhatsApp Status), developer ecosystem, mobile AR developer tools, mobile market experience and financial muscle guarantee its success. Plus Mark Zuckerberg’s got something to prove, justifying his $3 billion entry into VR/AR in the first place (even if that was for a VR company). It’s a really smart move, and it’s going to pay off. Big time. Tencent likely wins in China. The potential dominance of WeChat mobile AR when launched in China is as exciting as Facebook’s AR Platform outside it. The battle has already kicked off during Chinese New Year with Tencent’s versus Alibaba‘s mobile AR Hongbao (traditional red envelopes filled with cash). But the Alibaba opportunity looks very different, as it will be the AR eCommerce leader in China rather than the mobile AR platform leader. Baidu is also layering its wealth of data on the real world, but it too has a different opportunity to Tencent. Apple could become the dominant and most profitable hardware enabled mobile AR player, scaling from zero to hundreds of millions of iPhone AR users by 2021. This could become the innovation for which Tim Cook is remembered, and potentially lead towards Apple’s long term smartglasses dominance going into the next decade (assuming smartglasses solve their 5 big challenges). Apple has been looking for a catalyst to take it beyond Steve Jobs’ legacy, and this could give it a real chance of becoming a 100 year company. Samsung, Huawei and other phone makers could do very well when they start to sell AR phones, but don’t have Apple’s inherent ecosystem advantages. To do more than maintain the status quo, they might need to invest in or acquire totally new capabilities. Otherwise they could miss out on the profits others will make using their mobile AR phones. Google’s Tango is currently geared to enabling a large open mobile AR ecosystem to drive its core search advertising and Google Play revenues, similarly to its current Android approach. However as with Baidu, the mobile AR opportunity to layer its data on the real world could improve its position. Snap is already in the mobile AR business, even if it doesn’t call it that yet. But with a user base much smaller than Facebook/Instagram/WhatsApp Status and a closed platform, Evan Spiegel might think about copying Mark Zuckerberg for a change. No dog in this fight Microsoft still hasn’t announced any play for mobile AR. They’ve got massive assets in mixed reality (HoloLens) and VR (Windows VR), so it depends on whether they see themselves as a consumer or enterprise company long term. Steve Ballmer’s biggest regret is missing out on mobile. Hopefully mobile AR won’t become Satya Nadella’s. Amazon has also stayed quiet on mobile AR, despite reports of experiments with AR stores. If they’re not already working on it, this might be an area where Jeff Bezos could learn from Jack Ma. Know your enemy, know yourself The battle lines for mobile AR have been drawn, and some of the winners were clear before the first shot was fired. While it’s not too late for incumbents and startups in mobile AR, again in the words of Sun Tzu, “I have heard that in war haste can be folly, but have never seen delay that was wise.” Time to saddle up.   Tim Merel is managing director of San Francisco mobile Internet advisor Digi-Capital and the founder/CEO of Eyetouch Reality.

Google’s computers will be trying to connect the dots between what people look at after clicking on an online ad and what they purchase with their credit and debit cards at one of the advertiser’s brick-and-mortar stores. For instance, if someone searching for a pair of running shoes online clicked on an ad from a sporting goods store but didn’t buy anything, an advertiser might initially conclude that the ad was a waste of money. With the new tool, Google says it will now be able to tell if the same person bought the shoes a few days later at a physical store. • MINING CREDIT-CARD DATA Google says it has access to roughly 70 percent of U.S. credit and debit card transactions through partnerships with other companies that track that data. By scanning this data, Google says it can automatically inform merchants when their digital ads translate into sales at a brick-and-mortar store. If the program works, it could help persuade merchants to boost their digital marketing budgets. But it could also deepen worries among privacy watchdogs, who are already concerned about the digital dossiers that Google has compiled on users of its search engine and other services, including Gmail, YouTube and Android. • GOOGLE’S OPPORTUNITY The Mountain View, Calif., company already runs the world’s biggest online ad network, one that raked in $79 billion in revenue last year. That puts it in the best position to capture any additional marketing dollars spent on computers and mobile devices. Google plans to unveil the store-sales measurement tool Tuesday in San Francisco at an annual conference it hosts for its advertisers. This meeting is an opportunity not only for Google to flaunt its new tools, but to work on regaining ground with advertisers who have recently boycotted YouTube. Major advertisers began pulling back two months ago over concerns that Google hadn’t prevented major brand advertising from appearing alongside video clips promoting hate and violence. • SMARTER TRACKING Google is also introducing new ways to help merchants drive more traffic to their physical stores and to gain a better understanding on how digital ads appearing across a variety of devices are affecting their sales. Most of these new analytics draw upon Google’s inroads in “machine learning” — a way of “training” computers to behave more like humans — to interpret the data. Google’s search engine and Chrome browser are a rich source of data about people’s interests and online activities that it can feed into machine-learning systems. • DIGITAL DOSSIERS Google says its computers can collect identifying data triggered by online clicks and match it with other identifying information compiled by merchants and the issuers of credit and debit cards to figure out when a digital ad contributes to an offline purchase. Google’s tool won’t work for cash payments or the 30 percent of U.S. card transactions that Google can’t currently access. Shoppers remain anonymous, meaning they aren’t identified by their names, according to Google. And the company says it doesn’t share any of its anonymized information with its customers; instead, it targets ads at individuals who fit demographic profiles sought by advertisers.

As you might be able to guess from the name, it is designed to make finding job openings easier and more effective - for both applicants and employers. The feature appears to be going live on Google Search, at least for some users. Currently, searching something like "barista jobs" just returns a list of results from job listing sites. With Google for Jobs, you get a much cleaner interface with more details, plus modifiers like 'Full-time' and 'Starbucks.'    Left: Current layout; Center, Right: New layout This doesn't seem to be live yet for everyone, including myself, but let us know in the comments if you see it.

It recently took on Ke Jie who is currently ranked as the world’s best player of Go. AlphaGo beat Ke Jie 3-0 at the Future of Go Summit in Wuzhen, China. Google’s DeepMind division has now confirmed that AlphaGo is retiring from competitive Go. DeepMind co-founder and co-CEO Demis Hassabis confirmed that AlphaGo will not be participating in any competitive Go matches from now on. He said that this decision was made because AlphaGo’s victory at the summit represented “the highest possible pinnacle for AlphaGo as a competitive program.” AlphaGo had its first taste of victory against a legendary Go player Lee Se-dol. It defeated him 4-1 in a match that took place in Seoul, South Korea. The scheduled match between AlphaGo and Ke Jie was closely matched as many were impressed by the program’s ability to take on some of the best human players of the complex game. The team behind AlphaGo is not going to rest on its laurels, though. It’s now going to work on the next set of grand challenges which include developing advanced general algorithms that could one day help scientists as they tackle some of our most complex problems, such as finding new cures for diseases, dramatically reducing energy consumption, or inventing revolutionary new materials,” says Hassabis.

A product called “Google Attribution” was unveiled at a marketing conference this month in San Francisco by the internet giant. Google has long been able to determine when users click on an ads and make a purchase, but linking online and offline habits takes its analytics a step further. Google senior vice president Sridhar Ramaswamy, who announced that Attribution is in test mode with a limited number of partners and will be rolled out to more advertisers in coming weeks, touted the tool as being able to answer the long-challenging question of whether marketing campaigns are working. “Google Attribution makes it possible for every marketer to measure the impact of their marketing across devices and across channels,” Ramaswamy said. “Data-driven attribution uses machine learning to determine how much credit to assign to each step in the consumer journey — from the first time they engage with your brand for early research down to the final click before purchase.” Real-world customer email addresses or loyalty plan information can be woven with Google data from services such as AdWords, Google Analytics and DoubleClick Search to provide “a complete view” of marketing performance, according to the company. Using artificial intelligence, or machine learning, to better analyse and understand consumer behaviour to target ads and promote sales was a major theme of the conference. For several years now, AdWords has enabled advertisers to measure visits to real-world stores stemming from online campaigns, Ramaswamy noted. “Still, measuring store visits is just one part of the equation,” Ramaswamy said. “You also need insights into how your online ads drive sales for your business.” Real-world transactions matched back to Google ads are handed in “a secure and privacy-safe way,” with store sales information reported in aggregated and anonymised forms to protect individual privacy, according to the company. Tying online activity to offline shopping decisions has been a “holy grail” for advertisers for quite some time, and comes with worrisome privacy implications, according to ACLU senior policy analyst Jay Stanley. Attribution threatens to intrude on a core tenant of privacy, that people can have dealings with one party not spill over into affairs with other parties they interact with, Stanley contended. “This is an evolution, not a revolution; another step toward increased monitoring of individuals,” Stanley said. “Each step raises the question ‘Where does this all stop?’” Stanley expected Google to be on its best behaviour when it came to handling the growing trove of information about users, but that even the best of intentions could crack under the “enormous hydraulic pressure of the profit motive.” “We have the full fury and genius of the capitalist system being driven toward monitoring people in ever increasing detail and companies are competing to do so,” Stanley said “It will not stop without some sort of rules in which we as a society express our values through legal protections.” Google and Facebook dominate the online ad world, and what one does to prove its worth to advertisers is likely to be copied by the other, according to Silicon Valley analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group. Attribution promised to give Google a way to assure advertisers they are getting their money’s worth at the firm’s online venues. “The big problem is that showing conversion from ad consumption to purchase has been horrible,” Enderle said of online marketing. “This has been a problem for a long time. Google is trying to make a metric so they get credit for it when you do purchase after viewing an ad.” Data showing which ads are translating into real sales should mean that the relevance of ads people see online will improve as marketers abandon mis-aimed or ineffectively tailored messages, the analyst reasoned. “You are going to be hit with ads for things that you might actually want to buy, so you are going to spend a lot more money,” Enderle predicted. Worries about privacy sparked by linking offline and online activities are a decade or so late, because the time to protest was when collection began of the troves of data about people, the analyst argued. “There really is no downside to this application,” Enderle said while discussing Google’s marketing metrics move. “This is the good side of collecting data; it is what else is being done with the data that should be unnerving and that we really don’t know.” More from Media Other US studios eye Disney’s toy advantage Secret lives of Cannes' Instagram queens Lowe’s weak quarter in contrast to retail rival UAE journalists get a chance to rank PR agencies Omnicom extends alliance with Pathmatics Lessons from an exercise in failure Web TV providers train sights on MidEast Advertisers hold fast to broadcast TV tags from this storyFacebook follow this tag on MGNGoogle follow this tag on MGN filed underGulfNewsBusinessSectorsMedia tagsFacebook follow this tag on MGN+ MGNGoogle follow this tag on MGN+ MGN Also In MediaOther US studios eye Disney’s toy advantage Business Gallery Doors open to a three-day super sale Mohammad launches Marsa Al Arab project Business Videos PlayAbu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing FOLLOW US Most Popular ViewedCommentedVideosPictures 01Google linking online and offline worlds 02UAE journalists get a chance to rank PR agencies 03New radio stations hit UAE air waves Play Abu Dhabi Ship Building enjoys growing success Nov 24, 2016 Play Strata UAE leads aerospace manufacturing Oct 25, 2016 Play Video: Electronics fiesta as Gitex opens Oct 01, 2016 Play Emirates opens SkyPharma in Dubai Sep 18, 2016 13Images Mohammad launches Marsa Al Arab project May 15, 2017 6Images Dubai International Boat Show Mar 02, 2011 12Images In pictures: Looking back at business in 2010 Dec 31, 2010 9Images The Dead Photos by Tom Phillips Aug 18, 2010 Currency Converter first-currency currencyAEDDinarRupee= first-currency currencyINRDinarRupee Gulf News Brand Report   newspaper101,358 average daily circulation   WEB1,891,986 Gulf News average unique browsers   MOBILE1,729,966 mobile average unique browsers   FACEBOOK1,910,659 average Facebook likes *FOR THE 6 MONTH PERIOD ENDED JUNE 2016DOWNLOAD PDF Most Popular on Gulf News Our patience has limits, says UAE minister Viral video girl performs for Shaikh Mohammad Indian grandma in UAE sets world record 6 traffic accidents on first day of Ramadan UAE petrol prices cheaper in June Canada woos visitors, skilled workers How to maximise nutrition this Ramadan 9 best superfoods to have at suhoor Man jailed for molesting girl in hypermarket Close Recommended For You Venezuela protesters seek press freedomPUBLISHED ON May 28, 2017 VAT will bring positive changePUBLISHED ON May 28, 2017 Our patience has limits, says UAE ministerPUBLISHED ON May 28, 2017 Feedback Get The Paper Our Apps Mobile friendly version Our location Advanced Search Sitemap MY GULF NEWS GulfNews.com is the most widely read newspaper, and online site in English in the Middle East.

By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Updated: May 29, 2017 9:22 am The feature works both on the web and mobile versions of Google. Google is rolling out a new feature that allows users to perform personal searches through your personal data, like your Gmail account or Google Photo library. First spotted by Search Engine Roundtable, the Personal tab shows content from private sources, including emails and photos you have taken and uploaded to the cloud. The “Personal” tab works like any other tab on Google. All you need to type whatever you are searching for like “smartphone” and it shows you results from your Google account. You will find any email featuring the word “smartphone” or pictures stored in the cloud. The Personal tab doesn’t show up by default – you’ll have to click through to the “More” tab on the bottom. The feature works both on the web and mobile versions of Google. By adding this feature, Google has actually made it easier to find something in your Gmail or Google Photos without opening them individually, as long as you’re logged in. It is unclear right now whether the feature is limited to Gmail or Google Photos, or if it pull results from Google Drive and other Google services. Also read: Apple developing ‘Neural Engine’ chipset for future iPhones and iPads: Report There’s no official announcement from Google, but the feature seems to be rolling out slowly to users worldwide. At the time of writing, the Personal tab doesn’t seem to have made to the official Google apps for Android and iOS.

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 130 Plus 1 on G+ 337 Share on Facebook 84 Share on Twitter Total Shares551 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Jeremy Miethker that means its going to bootloop soon. that is what happened to me Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jeremy Miethker my brothers replacement phone already went into bootloop 5 days after receiving it. my phone died last week. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ARDankar I am glad I did not upgrade to nougat yet. Keep me posted on any news regarding issues with the Nexus 6P. David Droddy The Goog replaced my 6P very quickly when I demonstrated the sudden shut down problem even in safe mode and after full factory reset. Why would you report that Google is not responsive to this issue? Seanmiz Yep, I've experienced both issues on my 6P. I got hit with the bootloop of death a few months ago, luckily still under warranty with Huawei and got a replacement. I get the early battery shutdown usually in the 10-20% range. prwnd https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cd48abb593ae6c1dd226cbe06ba45cf7195abd40318303b2290ca9229846939e.png Biojoe Me too. Travis Coble Oddly enough, sometimes it shuts down early, and sometimes it's fine. However, given my use of it and constant recharging, I'm convinced that this will end up going nowhere because the problem is actually pretty normal for devices that are going on two years of age due to the use of LIon batteries. People claiming shutdown at 60%? I'd need to see it to believe it... maverick7526 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/3b98bc27cfb84fed5d59d503e403949c6d1cd50a18f37dd23dc58235aba80ad6.png It happens. It happened to me in Feb. It was very cold out and the phone just shut off, and would not turn on again until it was plugged into a charger. Brett Crowley Mine just hit a random boot loop and recovery mode is not working. Jeremy Miethker once it bootloops there is nothing you can do. it is now a cool paper weight Hussain Ahmadi I really hope they sue google for this. 6P keeps restarting without any reason, not to forget the excessive freezing issues. Google is getting very arrogant and need some spanking Hussain Ahmadi And of course this will be the last phone I've ever buy from google. Waiting eagerly for Note 8 mercado79 Yes, both issues. The battery issue was covered under warranty directly by Google. The bootloop issue occurred 1 month out of warranty and both companies told me there​ was nothing they could do for me. Marcin Nowak I had this issue since beginning of the year and Google forums just said wait for update. Finally contacted Google about it just last week feed up asking for help and they told me to F.off pretty much. zefred Got it. It started RIGHT after the one year mark. Contacted google AND Huawei, and was turned down by both. My N6p doesn't even last half a day with recharging. I need to carry extra external batteries everywhere with me, as well as a charge and cable, and the device is barely a year and a half old. NOT a happy camper :( 12321 Law360, Dallas (April 17, 2017, 5:29 PM EDT) -- Google Inc. and Huawei Technologies USA Inc. were hit with a putative class action in Texas federal court Friday over an allegedly defective smartphone, the Nexus 6P, which the user claims suffers from premature battery drainage. Plaintiff Alex Gorbatchev wants to represent a class of consumers who bought the Google Nexus 6P phones, which he says also suffer from a problem that sends the phone into a “death spiral” in which the phones suddenly switch off and then restart in what is referred to as an... https://www.law360.com/texas/articles/913933/class-hits-google-with-suit-over-defective-nexus-phones https://www.courthousenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Bad-Cellphones.pdf Claude L Now it's getting worst with android 7.1.2. I was also experiencing early shutdown with my 6p when using 7.1.1. But now I'm unable to use my phone on a daily basis without having a early shutdown. Today again battery was at 20% and last week it happened at 37%. I was so happy when I bought my phone a year and a half ago because I was able to use it for the whole day without having to charge the battery... Now I have to carry a charger with me... It sucks theadb Anything we can do in Canada? Mine just shuts off randomly all the time. This is was a RMA from an older 6P that had massive battery issues. The guy I just spoke to said my original warranty was up in January this year and there was nothing he could do. This phone shuts down randomly all the time now. I've missed by alarm to wake up twice now because it just shuts off. Only way to power it back on is to go into bootloader and restart. adi sararu mine had his 20% dying today first time... and after reading above... my time to never touch google phones again :D Steve I had same battery problem with my 6p, rather than taking out a lawsuit against Google I just purchased a new battery and replaced it. Phone no longer has the issue, lawsuit closed Kyle Snider Phone shuts off early on me allllllll the time, does this lawsuit affect us in Canada? Adam Macias I'm suffering the premature battery death. I have yet to cross the boot loop issue though. God help me if I do. Jeremy Miethker well im a not so proud owner of a $800 dollar paper weight. i cant believe how this is being handled they want me to spend $550 to replace it than they will reimburse me. are you kidding me. however was wondering if this would happen again if i did get a new one? Jacob Lunsford My 6P shuts down with anywhere from 10-30% battery remaining. pi app my problem is the uber driver app stopped working on this phone about 2 weeks ago (same app was working fine on this phone for last 8 months). when i log into uber driver app on any other fine it works fine. a chinese person told me because huawei is a chinese company and they hate uber they may have done something to prevent the app from working on their phones. i was going to buy another nexus 6p to see if same problem occurs. then i will know. my battery's been fine with my phone. Svart Adam Solander My phone shutdown at around 20-25%. Quite annoying. sleepytinksy Also have this issue - phone shut down right before the gates opened for a soccer match and they only issued digital tickets, scan-able on the phone. As you can imagine, that was less than ideal. Panda without dark circle My 6p shut down at 35% or below when I travel to Japan on winter, I thought it was because of the cold. But when I back to Malaysia, it shut down at 60% or below, not every time but this scared me. :( And yes, it doesn't warning me at all, shut down without any sign. Ahmad Zaib I am from India and facing the same issue on my Nexus 6P. The Huawei customer care response has been that they are coming up with an official response soon. This has been the status since more than 3 weeks now. Anyone here, who knows what can we expect here or how do we proceed? Tom Z 71% (seventy-one percent) Shutdown! Mine just hit a new low (or high) with this issue. I just had mine shut down at 71% (seventy-one percent) remaining battery life. This is a very big problem. I was taking pictures when the phone just went into shut down. I couldn't get it to stay running until I connected power. This needs to be fixed! I'm on the latest version with April 2017 security updates. Tom boses Same issue here. I'm reaching the shutdown at about about 38% mark! I'm frustrated at Google's inaction! Jay Miller Mine has died anywhere from 43% to 15%. It is random battery percentage for the shutdown, but it always claims it is at 15% then shuts down. The minute you plug it in and turn it on, the battery percentage is what it really shut off at, and it is usually in the high 20's. So yesterday I tried something. I went to the factory images I had for my Nexus, and through ADB, I sent it "back in time" to Android 6.0 (original release firmware). I then put it to the test. I turned on the hotspot and started playing games that I know drain the battery. I got the warning at 15%....no shutdown. I continued further. I got a warning at 14%, at 12%, 10%, 5% and eventually it shutdown at 1%. I placed it on the charger and fired it up and it was "truly" at 1% battery. I haven't seen it fully drain in months. While the claim that new batteries work, it also appears that Google has work to do on their end as well. Reversing the firmware did work for me. However, the device wanted to update immediately. I accepted the security patch, but at this point in time I will refuse to upgrade back to Nougat if I can gain the full use of my phone without it shutting off prematurely. Here is my log: Firmware I was on 05/03/2017 at 11 AM Eastern US time: N2G47H (April 2017 Security Patch) Firmware I reversed it to on 05/03/2017 at 12 PM Eastern US time: MDA89D (September 2015) Firmware after accepting most recent security patch OTA on 05/03/2017 at 6:45 PM Eastern US time: MTC19T (Android 6.0.1 but security is May 2016) Mister Sonny I'm having the early shutdown issue, for me it's consistently at around 25% battery life. This is made worse by the fact that I have an accessory almost always connected (Fitbit Blaze) NumbGrip I've been having this problem since about 6 weeks ago and it started completly out of nowhere Vince Romeo I've encountered the boot loop problem on 6p after <18 mo. Occasionally sudden shutdowns before that happened. My wife's phone is ~19+ and has sudden shutdown issues. Darshan Jain I am facing the same bootloop issue and my phones warranty has expired and Huawei and Google refused to help Shailla Chand My phone will be fresh off the charger at 100% and shut down within 15 minutes. Talk about frustrating.. Gerbil My 6p has been losing power at alarming rate always with Android system and Android OS at the top. Then it began randomly shutting down an demanding to be charged after sending a notification my battery hit 0% when I was well above 40% and failed to detect my SIM card for about 3 hours. I down own a power bank so I'm really suffering here as my phone dies midday and I can't use it for the latter half of the day. chesterbr Now that you mention... I (a no-bootloop-but-frequent-shutdown-at-30% Nexus 6P user) had a couple failures on SIM card detection. Not sure how long they lasted, removing and reinserting seemed to have done the trick... keeps one wondering... :-/ rpeltz My Nexus 6p shuts down when the battery drops below 49 percent. This can happen in as little as an hour of idle time and the phone is just over 1 year old. Cassy Forrester I had the shut off issue. It was shutting off at 99% after a couple of weeks of only shutting off at 48% and below. Still ridiculous. Anyway, I bought it through Newegg so I had to deal with huawei.. biggest fucking pain in the ass. We waited 22 days for a shipping label. Called on a thursday and they said by Monday it would be emailed. Still didn't come. Called again and they said another few days. Didn't come. Called AGAIN and after 5 hours of being on the phone (that day alone.. 15 hours total), they sent the email with the label. I sent it in and like 4 business days later it was returned.. same phone I sent it.. doesn't shut off anymore.. BUT they told us it was a software issue and that they couldn't fix the phone so they would have to replace it. Clearly they didn't replace it but it doesn't shut off so that's good right? Well no. Now my phone is not charging if I use it while it's on the charger... Also, I get the warning when it boots that it can't be checked for corruption. Fuck these people. Fuck this phone. My warranty was up by the time they sent the label but they did say they are taking phone's after warranty because they are having so many issues with this phone.. (also why they took so long to help me) Well no wonder they're taking them! They are only half ass fixing them. So if a half ass fix is worth it to you, call them. They might help. This is the US in case that helps. iRulLezZ My 6p shutted down with full battery and restarted all the time ! Nothing happes ! Pghgeek My 6p has the issue. Powers off before battery is low. Won't tun back on until connect to a charger then shows 40 to 60% battery. Have to use another phone. Don Smith My 6p purchased 11/2015 has been the most fantastic phone i've ever had but hey. Now i noticed that i never get the battery saver time. Then i researched. my phone is shutting down at 56% batter. Of course there is no warning that this is coming. So it's only useful if i'm plugged in at home, the car or traveling with my anker battery pack, Thank you anker. My exeperience with trying the warranty once is that it's worse than worthless. Details for file a clain, time passes then a letter that your claim is denied. Seems rediculous. Better to know you don't have warranty than wast your money only to be frustrated. I'm ready to give up on android and an unreliable beta company. but add me to the list of sabotaged 6p lovers. Kelly Kay Mine shuts down at 25% without fail. Robert Hynes I still have the shutdown issue....anywhere from 60 to 20%. Unlikely I will get a pixel or other Google device unless there is a fix. Maybe we just need a more high profile device like a Samsung in order to get noticed. Jeffrey Huston I started experiencing this for the first time on my Nexus 6p shortly after installing Android 7.1.2. It can happen anywhere from 20% to even 60%, and happens multiple times daily. I've had the phone for probably a year and am generally always on the latest Android version. I don't think it started immediately; might have started a week after installing 7.1.2. I initially blamed an app or a Google play services update, but I've been factory resetting my phone three times now, each time reinstalling and updating fewer and fewer things to see if it would stop happening. It hasn't stopped yet. My next step was going to be factory resetting and doing zero app installs and updates (then it's basically just a phone, gross), but then I stumbled on this article. Now I'll probably skip that next factory reset and see if Google will send me a new phone. Hans Breda I contacted Google Support about this issue. They were very cooperative and are sending me a replacement! Hope this will solve the problem. chesterbr I did not have the bootloop, but phone would shutdown anywhere below 30%. After reading some experiences here I got my battery replaced at a local shop (Mobile Klinik in Toronto, CAD$ 60 plus tax, service done in 1-hour, no data loss or anything), and the problem is GONE: phone goes down to 1% at a steady pace. Normal usage gives me an entire day, just like it did when I purchased it. I'll be sad if a class action lawsuit earns something (not for the money, but for the principle), but it seems it will give my phone at least another year of life (heck, possibly more, this phone is a beast). But I'll hardly ever buy Google (or Huawei) again - this is not how you handle such issues. Michael Magdy My Nexus 6p stuck on google screen.. And the shutdown and repeat again.. Noone could solve this till now.. Even the two companies google and huwaei don't respond or tell where is the problem I went to a software programmer.. He could do nothing also It's now just a piece of metal I need help Kishor Padghan My Nexus 6p experienced early shut down 2 times so far despite having enough battery. It can be restarted only after battery is fully discharge and charging the phone. My phone has been unreliable now, it can ditch me any time. ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.49M 471k 145k 117k Latest Deals 9 [Deal Alert] Anki's Cozmo robot is $152.99 ($27 off) on Amazon 2017/05/28 11:27am PDTMay 28, 2017 31 [Deal Alert] $1 Google Play movie rental (ends July 7th) 2017/05/28 9:56am PDTMay 28, 2017 27 [Deal Alert] Several movies and TV episodes on Google Play are on sale for Memorial Day 2017/05/27 6:37pm PDTMay 27, 2017 8 [Deal Alert] Get a 3-pack Arlo Pro security system for $450 ($130 off), if you have Amazon Prime 2017/05/27 12:04pm PDTMay 27, 2017 20 [Deal Alert] Two 6' USB-C to USB-C cables $5 at Amazon w/coupon ($7 off) 2017/05/27 10:52am PDTMay 27, 2017 Latest Poll Do you use a tablet?

There are 500 million of them sitting over on LinkedIn, which continues to add two new members at a steady rate. The secret to mastering LinkedIn for sales, however, lies in this helpful (and often ignored) feature hidden inside LinkedIn's powerful internal search engine. LinkedIn = B2B Prospecting Power The best way to go B2B prospecting online right now is to use LinkedIn’s massive internal search engine - like a Google for professionals. Because LinkedIn indexes every piece of content and word published on the site, you can search the platform using keywords and phrases (just like Google) to find what you're looking for. Even better, you can filter your LinkedIn Search results to display people, blog posts, status updates, company names, job openings or other professional topics based around those keywords or phrases you entered. When you understand the power of real-time, 1-on-1 personalization using the data available at any given moment on LinkedIn, that's when your B2B prospecting goes to a whole new level. Feeling Minnesota For example, it could be as simple as entering in a location (Minnesota), seeing someone bemoaning the weather there (a common occurrence) in a status update, and adding a comment to his or her post Even better, if this person seems like a potential sales lead or a good fit for your product or service, you can reach out and connect with him or her using the "Minnesota weather" angle as a personal note in your invitation. From that point forward, you can then begin to move your new connection (whom you've already broken the ice with) through your normal LinkedIn lead generation and sales cycle. How to Search for Posts In order to utilize this approach with LinkedIn Search, it’s important to step into the shoes of your customer and think like he or she would. Ask yourself this question: What would my ideal client or prospect type into Google when looking for content, tips or help related to a specific topic? Try and reverse-engineer the common topics, trends or thoughts your ideal clients have when searching for content or help online, and plug those terms into LinkedIn Search.  Next, filter by "Posts" and see what shows up. You can even try and search for terms like city names, state names or other markers to find people "talking" about those topics on LinkedIn (see the "Minnesota" example screenshot included in this post). It's important to note, the way LinkedIn filters its "post" search results depends on: If any of your 1st or 2nd level connections are sharing posts or status updates that include those search terms It then widens the search to anyone on LinkedIn using those search terms in an blog post or status update. Keep in mind, the "post" search results can return both blog posts others are creating that have your keywords and quick status updates someone fires off. Both are great opportunities to engage someone in their online living room, and use the content of their status update or blog post as context to begin a 1-on-1 conversation. See if you can add to the discussion, ideally by answering a question or adding a dose of your own wisdom that helps demonstrate your expertise in the area. LinkedIn & Real-Time Leads The idea is simple - you engage others around a topic they're talking about, and you do it in a way that isn't sales-y, sleazy or spammy. Rather, you add to the conversation, sharing your thoughts, answering questions or asking additional questions to keep the discussion going. Make sure you take some time today to experiment with LinkedIn Searches that you filter by posts, and be creative with your search terms and topics. If you do, you're likely going to find some warm leads and conversation opportunities waiting for you.

Google today launched the Android O Beta Program, giving owners of select devices the chance to try Android O before it launches to the public later this year. The devices that are eligible for the Android O Beta Program include the Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel C, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, and Nexus Player. If you’ve got one of the eligible devices, you can enroll it in the Android Beta Program by pointing your web browser right here. Once enrolled, your device should receive a software update within 24 hours. While the updates included with this Android O Beta Program are likely more stable that the ones offered in the Android O Developer Preview, this is still a beta that you’ll be testing. That means that software could be buggy, so you may want to think about that before enrolling your daily driver into the Android O Beta Program. Google has only announced a handful of new Android O features so far. Those include a focus on improving battery life by utilizing new automatic limits on app background performance, picture-in-picture support while watching video, adaptive icons, and more. Are you going to try the Android O Beta Program?

A product called "Google Attribution" was unveiled at a marketing conference this month in San Francisco by the internet giant. Google has long been able to determine when users click on an ads and make a purchase, but linking online and offline habits takes its analytics a step further. Google senior vice president Sridhar Ramaswamy, who announced that Attribution is in test mode with a limited number of partners and will be rolled out to more advertisers in coming weeks, touted the tool as being able to answer the long-challenging question of whether marketing campaigns are working. "Google Attribution makes it possible for every marketer to measure the impact of their marketing across devices and across channels," Ramaswamy said. "Data-driven attribution uses machine learning to determine how much credit to assign to each step in the consumer journey -- from the first time they engage with your brand for early research down to the final click before purchase." Real-world customer email addresses or loyalty plan information can be woven with Google data from services such as AdWords, Google Analytics and DoubleClick Search to provide "a complete view" of marketing performance, according to the company. Using artificial intelligence, or machine learning, to better analyze and understand consumer behavior to target ads and promote sales was a major theme of the conference. AD HOLY GRAIL For several years now, AdWords has enabled advertisers to measure visits to real-world stores stemming from online campaigns, Ramaswamy noted. "Still, measuring store visits is just one part of the equation," Ramaswamy said. "You also need insights into how your online ads drive sales for your business." Real-world transactions matched back to Google ads are handed in "a secure and privacy-safe way," with store sales information reported in aggregated and anonymized forms to protect individual privacy, according to the company. Tying online activity to offline shopping decisions has been a "holy grail" for advertisers for quite some time, and comes with worrisome privacy implications, according to ACLU senior policy analyst Jay Stanley. Attribution threatens to intrude on a core tenant of privacy, that people can have dealings with one party not spill over into affairs with other parties they interact with, Stanley contended. "This is an evolution, not a revolution; another step toward increased monitoring of individuals," Stanley said. "Each step raises the question 'Where does this all stop?'" Stanley expected Google to be on its best behavior when it came to handling the growing trove of information about users, but that even the best of intentions could crack under the "enormous hydraulic pressure of the profit motive." "We have the full fury and genius of the capitalist system being driven toward monitoring people in ever increasing detail and companies are competing to do so," Stanley said "It will not stop without some sort of rules in which we as a society express our values through legal protections." MORE TEMPTING ADS Google and Facebook dominate the online ad world, and what one does to prove its worth to advertisers is likely to be copied by the other, according to Silicon Valley analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group. Attribution promised to give Google a way to assure advertisers they are getting their money's worth at the firm's online venues. "The big problem is that showing conversion from ad consumption to purchase has been horrible," Enderle said of online marketing. "This has been a problem for a long time. Google is trying to make a metric so they get credit for it when you do purchase after viewing an ad." Data showing which ads are translating into real sales should mean that the relevance of ads people see online will improve as marketers abandon mis-aimed or ineffectively tailored messages, the analyst reasoned. "You are going to be hit with ads for things that you might actually want to buy, so you are going to spend a lot more money," Enderle predicted. Worries about privacy sparked by linking offline and online activities are a decade or so late, because the time to protest was when collection began of the troves of data about people, the analyst argued. "There really is no downside to this application," Enderle said while discussing Google's marketing metrics move. "This is the good side of collecting data; it is what else is being done with the data that should be unnerving and that we really don't know." © Agence France-Presse Share Save Facebook Share on Twitter GPlus LinkedIn Read More:  Google   internet   advertising   privacy   /news/01/06/17/after-comeleak-privacy-commission-to-test-more-websites-for-data-security /news/02/16/17/data-stolen-from-comelec-office-national-privacy-commission-confirms /news/02/20/17/privacy-commission-probes-new-comelec-data-breach /news/05/10/17/natl-id-bill-umuusad-pero-binabatikos-dahil-sa-privacy /video/focus/05/11/17/lawmakers-admit-security-privacy-flaws-in-natl-id-plan LATEST NEWS MOST READ Millennial reservists start Marawi journey with selfies May 29, 2017 San Miguel's Ang to bid for $2-B flood control project May 29, 2017 'My Dear Heart' down to its last 3 weeks May 29, 2017 ALAMIN: Recipe ng 'wonder drink' ni Dyan May 29, 2017 Zsa Zsa marks birthday with children, Conrad May 29, 2017 Recipe: Chef Tatung's Camaron Relyenado May 29, 2017 LOOK: Kim Chiu vacations in Nepal May 29, 2017 Karla, Jolina at Melai, may bagong adventure sa Leyte May 29, 2017 CHED approves tuition hike in 260 schools May 29, 2017 Indy 500: No win but no regrets as Alonso returns to F1 May 29, 2017 Swedish satire 'The Square' wins Palme d'Or at Cannes May 29, 2017 What other playoff records can LeBron James realistically break?

From the near bezel-less display to the metallic design, super large and crisp screen, and dual-camera setup, LG’s flagship definitely high on the list of best hardware for an Android device you can get right now. Illustration: Tom's GuideBut what if you love the hardware, but don’t necessarily have the same affection for the software? Well, you could always root the phone and just replace the software with a stock version of Android — though for some users, rooting can introduce its own set of perils. There is another way, though. Thanks to the sheer nature of Android, it’s actually pretty easy to get the G6 to look like stock Android without the need for all that hacking. Here’s how you can get the G6 to look like stock Android without using root. MORE: Galaxy S8 vs. LG G6: It's Closer Than You Think Launcher Let’s start with the launcher, the app that essentially controls your device’s home screen. Replacing it will probably be the biggest change you can make to your G6. While there are a ton of third-party launchers on the Play Store you can customize to mimic the stock launcher, why not use the actual stock launcher? That launcher, found on Google’s Pixel is in the Play Store, but it’ll incorrectly tell you that it “doesn’t work for your device”. So instead we’ll grab it manually from another site and install it. 1. Go to Settings > General > Fingerprints & Security > and turn on Unknown Sources. 2. On your phone, head to this site to find the APK file of the launcher and download it. 3. Tap on the download notification and tap Install. 4. And there you go. With the next version of Android now in beta, you’ve even added the new Android O Pixel launcher, too. MORE: How to Get th Android O Beta Messaging Next up, an app I can’t live without, the stock Messaging app. 1. Search for and install the Android Messages from the Play Store. 2. Open it and follow the prompts to set it as the default messaging app. Keyboard If you have the stock messaging app, why not the stock keyboard? 1. Head to the Play Store and search for and install GBoard. 2. Open it and follow the prompts to make it your new default keyboard. Dialer & Contacts We can find the stock dialer app’s APK file online, but unfortunately it won’t work for some reason. Instead, there’s a free third-party dialer that looks just like it in the Play Store. 1. Open the Play Store, search for and install exDialer. 2. Go to Settings > General > Apps > and tap on the three dots in the top right corner and select Configure Apps. 3. Tap on the Phone app and select exDialer. Calendar Google Calendar might already be on your G6, but it’s not the default calendar app. 1. Head to the Play Store, search for and install Google Calendar if it’s not already on your device. 2. Open it and set it up if you haven’t already done so. 3. Go to Settings > General > Apps > and tap the LG Calendar (just called Calendar but with the dotted icon instead of the Google Calendar icon). 4. Tap Clear Defaults. 5. To make sure we don’t get double notifications for events, tap back and go to Notifications. 6. Tap Block. Wallpaper And finally, a stock wallpaper to finish your G6’s stock look. 1. Head to this collection here. 2. Tap the one you want and long press it and download it. 3. Go to Settings > Display > Home Screen > Wallpaper. 4. Select Photos > Downloads and tap the wallpaper you downloaded and set it. And we’re done, with stock Android now essentially in place on your G6. Let us know in the comments below if you have any other suggestions for apps to make more of the system stock-like. Otherwise, enjoy!

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones Comparison screenshots showing how much Apple Maps lags behind Google Maps A detailed comparison showing Google Maps' prowess over Apple Maps, has surfaced online in a recent blog post. Vinod Yalburgi   May 28, 2017 15:40 IST Apple Maps vs Google Maps: Which mapping service is better and why Apple Maps has long been playing catch-up with Google Maps as its mapping service has been lagging behind in coverage and other mapping information. The iPhone maker is reportedly making amends to keep up with the competition in recent times, but the latest comparison screenshots published on Justin's blog suggest otherwise. As seen in Justin's comparison review, there have been significant improvements made to Google Maps over the period of last one year as opposed to minor additions to Apple Maps. For instance, you can see the Patricia's Green Park in central San Francisco being compared side-by-side on both Apple and Google Maps. Check out a few of those interesting screenshots below: Comparison screenshot showing how much Apple Maps lags behind Google MapsJustinobierne Quite obviously, you will notice the amazing details like park paths and neighbouring landmarks clearly marked out on the Google Maps, but very sparse details on the Apple Maps. Furthermore, the report adds that the accuracy of information is dubious on Apple Maps, owing to the lack of details. Comparison screenshots showing how much Apple Maps lags behind Google MapsJustinobierne It seems certain business locations are being cycled (added or removed) on a monthly basis on the Apple Maps, while Google Maps will continue displaying all existing landmark locations for a given address without any limitations. The reason for the inflated number of changes being reported on Apple Maps has been attributed to its poor geocoder mechanism. Furthermore, the finer details on Google Maps are coupled with a polished and refined interface, making the points of interest more visible to the user. With the lack of refinements, Apple Maps continues to look outdated and not user-friendly like its Google counterpart.

The apps were infected with a new type of malware named Judy, and experts estimate the malware infected between 8.5 and 36.5 million users. According to researchers from Check Point, the apps were available on the Play Store for years, but have been clean and virus-free for most of the time. It appears that starting with April 2016, the apps were slowly updated with malicious code. The purpose of this code was to launch a browser app, load an URL, and use JavaScript to locate and click on specific banners that would bring profits to the malware's creators. One company behind most malicious apps According to Check Point, almost all malicious apps were made by a South Korean company called Kiniwini, but registered on the Google Play Store as ENISTUDIO corp. It is unclear if the company added the malicious code itself, or its servers were compromised and the code added by a third-party. Furthermore, besides the hidden ad-clicking activity, the operators of the Judy malware used it to insert intrusive ads in other apps, almost to the point that users had no possibility of viewing or interacting with the original app's content. A list of apps infected with the Judy Android malware is available here. Despite apps going through periodic reviews, Google's Play Store security system, named Bouncer, wasn't able to pick up the malware's malicious activity. Nonetheless, help is coming! Google launches new Android security services On May 17, during the Google I/O annual event, Google announced a new service called Google Play Protect. According to Google, this new service continuously scans all Android apps and user devices for malicious behavior and uses machine learning to detect any suspicious activity. Once it detects a malicious app, it removes it from the phones of all users who installed it. The new Google Play Protect service suite is currently shipping to all devices with the Google Play app installed.         LATEST STORIES (9) ISIL Leave Its Military Hardware behind as It Withdraws from More Lands in Eastern Homs Iraqi Army Squeezes ISIL Remnants in Mosul City from All Directions Syrian Army, Allies Enter Town of Sawanah Southwest of Palmyra 19 Days of Saudi Crackdown on Shiite People of Awamiyah Ramadan: Iranians Reciting Holy Quran Iraqi Popular Forces Advancing in Key Area West of Mosul Syria: Aleppo Residents Celebrate Start of Ramadan for First Time after Liberation Syrian Army Forces at Gates of Strategic Town of Maskana Daily Life of Iraqi People in Liberated Area of Mosul Iranian Commander Blasts Turkey over Lax Border Control Syria: Gov't Troops Continue to March on Terrorists' Positons in Eastern Sweida US Security Firms Return to Iraq after Fiasco Syria: Rival Terrorists Restart Infighting in Idlib Province Infighting Erupts among ISIL Terrorists in Northeastern Syria Talks Continue to Facilitate Exports of Iranian Carpets to Russia ISIL Leave Its Military Hardware behind as It Withdraws from More Lands in Eastern Homs TEHRAN (FNA)- The Syrian army continued anti-ISIL operations in Eastern Homs, advancing in more areas towards Tadmur (Palmyra) and the province's oil fields after seizing control of several points.

OpEd Video Data Jobs = Sunday, May 28, 2017 Google linking online and offline worlds in new ad challenge   In Summary A product called "Google Attribution" was unveiled at a marketing conference this month in San Francisco by the internet giant. Google has long been able to determine when users click on an ads and make a purchase, but linking online and offline habits takes its analytics a step further. Advertisement San Francisco, United States | AFP |.Google is testing a way to tie online ads to brick-and-mortar store purchases, a move whetting marketing appetites while fueling privacy worries. A product called "Google Attribution" was unveiled at a marketing conference this month in San Francisco by the internet giant. Google has long been able to determine when users click on an ads and make a purchase, but linking online and offline habits takes its analytics a step further. Google senior vice president Sridhar Ramaswamy, who announced that Attribution is in test mode with a limited number of partners and will be rolled out to more advertisers in coming weeks, touted the tool as being able to answer the long-challenging question of whether marketing campaigns are working. "Google Attribution makes it possible for every marketer to measure the impact of their marketing across devices and across channels," Ramaswamy said. "Data-driven attribution uses machine learning to determine how much credit to assign to each step in the consumer journey -- from the first time they engage with your brand for early research down to the final click before purchase." Real-world customer email addresses or loyalty plan information can be woven with Google data from services such as AdWords, Google Analytics and DoubleClick Search to provide "a complete view" of marketing performance, according to the company. Using artificial intelligence, or machine learning, to better analyze and understand consumer behavior to target ads and promote sales was a major theme of the conference. - Ad 'holy grail' - For several years now, AdWords has enabled advertisers to measure visits to real-world stores stemming from online campaigns, Ramaswamy noted. "Still, measuring store visits is just one part of the equation," Ramaswamy said. "You also need insights into how your online ads drive sales for your business." Real-world transactions matched back to Google ads are handed in "a secure and privacy-safe way," with store sales information reported in aggregated and anonymized forms to protect individual privacy, according to the company. Tying online activity to offline shopping decisions has been a "holy grail" for advertisers for quite some time, and comes with worrisome privacy implications, according to ACLU senior policy analyst Jay Stanley. Attribution threatens to intrude on a core tenant of privacy, that people can have dealings with one party not spill over into affairs with other parties they interact with, Stanley contended.   "This is an evolution, not a revolution; another step toward increased monitoring of individuals," Stanley said. "Each step raises the question 'Where does this all stop?'" Stanley expected Google to be on its best behavior when it came to handling the growing trove of information about users, but that even the best of intentions could crack under the "enormous hydraulic pressure of the profit motive." "We have the full fury and genius of the capitalist system being driven toward monitoring people in ever increasing detail and companies are competing to do so," Stanley said "It will not stop without some sort of rules in which we as a society express our values through legal protections." - More tempting ads? - Google and Facebook dominate the online ad world, and what one does to prove its worth to advertisers is likely to be copied by the other, according to Silicon Valley analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group. Attribution promised to give Google a way to assure advertisers they are getting their money's worth at the firm's online venues. "The big problem is that showing conversion from ad consumption to purchase has been horrible," Enderle said of online marketing. "This has been a problem for a long time. Google is trying to make a metric so they get credit for it when you do purchase after viewing an ad." Data showing which ads are translating into real sales should mean that the relevance of ads people see online will improve as marketers abandon mis-aimed or ineffectively tailored messages, the analyst reasoned. "You are going to be hit with ads for things that you might actually want to buy, so you are going to spend a lot more money," Enderle predicted. Worries about privacy sparked by linking offline and online activities are a decade or so late, because the time to protest was when collection began of the troves of data about people, the analyst argued. "There really is no downside to this application," Enderle said while discussing Google's marketing metrics move. "This is the good side of collecting data; it is what else is being done with the data that should be unnerving and that we really don't know." advertisement In The Headlines How Tanzania, Uganda plan to finance pipeline Uganda, Tanzania and joint venture (JV) partners Tullow Oil Uganda, Total E&P and Cnooc will be Raila cleared for fifth stab at the presidency Kenyan opposition leader Raila Odinga (pictured) has been cleared by the Kenyan electoral agency News Court gives order on Ogieks’ rights   News Security and development: a case of growing restlessness in rufiji - kibiti - kilwa area   News RC: Check livestock in Ngorongoro   News Shortage of lecturers in EA worrisome   Advertisement                             Advertisement Political Reforms WARAH: Making angels out of Africa’s rogue leaders Opinion/Editorial FROM THE PUBLIC EDITOR'S DESK: Scribes’ dilemma: to be or not to be objective Opinion/Editorial WHAT OTHERS SAY: Is Kenya really exceptional in E.Africa?

Google for Jobs going live for some people Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/27 4:31pm PDTMay 27, 2017 17 Plus 1 on G+ 67 Share on Facebook 72 Share on Twitter Total Shares156 Google News Back at Google I/O, a new initiative was announced called 'Google for Jobs.' As you might be able to guess from the name, it is designed to make finding job openings easier and more effective - for both applicants and employers. The feature appears to be going live on Google Search, at least for some users. Currently, searching something like "barista jobs" just returns a list of results from job listing sites. With Google for Jobs, you get a much cleaner interface with more details, plus modifiers like 'Full-time' and 'Starbucks.'    Left: Current layout; Center, Right: New layout This doesn't seem to be live yet for everyone, including myself, but let us know in the comments if you see it.

Mattwmaster58 I guess they are rolling this out :P Vratislav Jindra How about doing something about that ugly grey status bar, Google? I get it at the search results page which is also grey (a bit lighter), but not when there is a blue action bar right underneath it. Also the shadow under the status bar from KitKat era in the main screen of Google App seems weird. Sometimes I wonder what they pay their designers for, when they can't get this basic sh*t straight.

[Deal Alert] Several movies and TV episodes on Google Play are on sale for Memorial Day Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/27 6:37pm PDTMay 27, 2017 55 Plus 1 on G+ 125 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares227 Deals Google News If your Memorial Day weekend plans are being ruined by poor weather, Google has an offer for you. It recently tossed up a little holiday sale on movies and TV shows over on Google Play, including some deals that are over 50% off their regular prices. So if you can't go camping or throw that family barbecue because of rain, at least you and your loved ones can snuggle up inside while you binge watch The Wire. It'll be good for little Johnny's character. Among the better movie collections being offered are The Lord of the Rings Trilogy for $20, the Back to the Future Trilogy for $15, and "The Best of Tarantino" six-movie collection for $30. The latter includes one of my favorite cheesy horror movies, From Dusk Till Dawn. The TV selection has a lot of solid HBO shows — if you don't happen to have HBO Go — as well as the complete X-Files for $50, American Horror Story seasons 1-5 for $60 and the amazing Kung Fu series in its entirety for $30. For more family-oriented deals there are a ton of shows from Nickelodeon, as well as a small number of animated children's film collections. You know what? The outdoors are over-rated. Who would want to spend a weekend outside with their loving family when they could spend days forcing their children to appreciate their favorite childhood movies. Let's face it, in the long run, your kids will thank you. Source: Google Play (1, 2) Tags deal alert google play memorial day movies sale tv subscribe ...

Now the electronics giant is bringing artificial intelligence to chips. Apple is working on a processor devoted specifically to AI-related tasks, according to a person familiar with the matter. The chip, known internally as the Apple Neural Engine, would improve the way the company’s devices handle tasks that would otherwise require human intelligence — such as facial recognition and speech recognition, said the person, who requested anonymity discussing a product that hasn’t been made public. Apple declined to comment. Engineers at Apple are racing to catch their peers at Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. in the booming field of artificial intelligence. While Siri gave Apple an early advantage in voice-recognition, competitors have since been more aggressive in deploying AI across their product lines, including Amazon’s Echo and Google’s Home digital assistants. An AI-enabled processor would help Cupertino, California-based Apple integrate more advanced capabilities into devices, particularly cars that drive themselves and gadgets that run augmented reality, the technology that superimposes graphics and other information onto a person’s view of the world. “Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI,” said Gene Munster, former Apple analyst and co-founder of venture capital firm Loup Ventures. “At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence.” Improved performance Apple devices currently handle complex artificial intelligence processes with two different chips: The main processor and the graphics chip. The new chip would let Apple offload those tasks onto a dedicated module designed specifically for demanding artificial intelligence processing, allowing Apple to improve battery performance. Should Apple bring the chip out of testing and development, it would follow other semiconductor makers that have already introduced dedicated AI chips. Qualcomm Inc.’s latest Snapdragon chip for smartphones has a module for handling artificial intelligence tasks, while Google announced its first chip, called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU), in 2016. That chip worked in Google’s data centres to power search results and image-recognition. At its I/O conference this year, Google announced a new version that will be available to clients of its cloud business. Nvidia Corp. also sells a similar chip to cloud customers. The Apple AI chip is designed to make significant improvements to Apple’s hardware over time, and the company plans to eventually integrate the chip into many of its devices, including the iPhone and iPad, according to the person with knowledge of the matter. Apple has tested prototypes of future iPhones with the chip, the person said, adding that it’s unclear if the component will be ready this year. Apple’s operating systems and software features would integrate with devices that include the chip. For example, Apple has considered offloading facial recognition in the photos application, some parts of speech recognition, and the iPhone’s predictive keyboard to the chip, the person said. Apple also plans to offer developer access to the chip so third-party apps can also offload artificial intelligence-related tasks, the person said. Developer conference Apple may choose to discuss some of its latest advancements in AI at its annual developer’s conference in June. At the same conference, Apple plans to introduce iOS 11, its new operating system for iPhones and iPads, with an updated user-interface, people with knowledge of the matter said last month. The company is also said to discuss updated laptops with faster chips from Intel Corp. An AI chip would join a growing list of processors that Apple has created in-house. The company began designing its own main processors for the iPhone and iPad in 2010 with the A4 chip. It has since released dedicated processors to power the Apple Watch, the motion sensors across its products, the wireless components inside of its AirPods, and the fingerprint scanner in the MacBook Pro. The company has also tested a chip to run the low-power mode on Mac laptops. In 2015, Bloomberg reported that Apple’s culture of secrecy stymied the iPhone maker’s ability to attract top AI research talent. Since then, Apple has acquired multiple companies with deep ties to artificial intelligence, has begun publishing papers related to AI research, has joined a key research group and has made hires from the field. In October 2016, Apple hired Russ Salakhutdinov from Carnegie Mellon University as its director of AI research. — Bloomberg                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Lenovo’s struggling mobile business sets sight on high-end market Apple said to plan dedicated chip to power AI on devices Singapore’s road safety campaign takes a VR twist Upcoming video games: ‘Star Trek’ VR, ‘Tokyo 42,’ ‘Tekken 7,’ ‘Dirt 4,’ ‘Wipeout Collection’ Report: Facebook leaked documents show types of content it allows Report: Facebook leaked documents show types of content it allows You won’t believe how easy it is to fool Samsung Galaxy S8’s ‘eye security’ Samsung investigating Galaxy S8 ‘iris hack’ Samsung to reveal stretchable display North Korea-linked hackers ‘highly likely’ behind WannaCry, says Symantec Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: One Direction's Styles tops Billboard with solo album Reuters Video: Europe can no longer rely on allies, says Merkel Reuters Video: Dutchman Dumoulin wins Giro d'Italia Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Related Articles Nokia, Apple bury hatchet in patent dispute Ready, Set, Go!

There is additionally some broad consensus that without stronger productivity growth going forward, standards of living for the vast majority of Americans will not improve appreciably, which is likely to fuel the current wave of populist discontent. One explanation, however, is increasingly popular even as it faces considerable skepticism among economists and policymakers: The problem is less about productivity than about our inability to measure the effect of the digital and now data revolution that has redefined the American economy. There is a growing chasm between what our economic system is and what our numbers are capable of measuring. Take Google. Its searches are used billions of times a day. Every single one is free. The same could be said of service after service, such as using Google Maps or Waze (also owned by Google), which are free to the user. While some of what they offer adds little to collective economic output (a group chat between a gaggle of teens has no immediate economic value), a considerable percentage does. A navigation app, for example, reduces time spent on the road or stuck in traffic, potentially reduces the amount of gas used, and then frees up that time and that savings for other possibly more productive uses. Several years ago Erik Brynjolfsson, an MIT economist, tried to measure what these "free goods of the Internet" might be adding to gross domestic product. The methods were innovative, trying to gauge what value people assign to their time and then multiplying that by time spent using Google and similar services. He estimated that as of 2012 such free goods might add $300 billion to gross domestic product, increasing at the rate of $40 billion a year, which would mean close to $500 billion in 2017. It's a large figure, but these were only halting initial steps in what is surely a complicated and as yet unresolved process to factor the innovations of the past decade and more into calculations of economic output and activity. In early May the Bureau of Economic Analysis released a paper concluding that its own measures of inflation and GDP had been unable to keep up with the changes in the economy, and hence had been off by as much as half a percent a year. These issues are not new, but they remain unresolved. The lessons of the Federal Reserve in the 1990s are instructive. The U.S. economy was booming, new technologies were proliferating, and yet productivity numbers were anemic. Then Fed Governor Alan Greenspan tasked the team of economists at the Fed to investigate. Building on the 1989 observation of Robert Solow that "computers were everywhere but in the productivity statistics," the Fed began to assess how productivity was calculated and understood. That led to more emphasis on different formulas such as multi-factor productivity, which went beyond looking just at labor and capital investment; they also took a longer view that new innovations can take years to show up in official statistics. Measured productivity did begin to accelerate in the mid-1990s, along with greater attention by policymakers to different formulas such as multi-factor productivity to measure it. That said, the debates today haven't altered much, with a few voices suggesting that we fail to account for the "consumer surplus" or adequately account for the gains from the digital revolution, while many others, such as Robert Gordon, contend that the productivity slowdown is a result of a mature economy that is not keeping pace with societal needs. For them, the statistics, even if slightly outmoded, reflect an unarguable reality whose economic and social consequences are evident. Even those who acknowledge some underestimation of productivity tend to argue that if you added back some amount for the hard-to-quantify effects of the digital revolution, you still wouldn't get back to the levels of the 20th century. Perhaps. Or perhaps the mismeasurement currently debated is only a portion of just how significant these mismeaurements are. Even more, perhaps the entire framework is now flawed. The hard numbers today are clearly failing to account for certain observable contradictions, such as how there can be high levels of employment combined with very little wage growth and extremely low inflation. If various free or inexpensive digital solutions are generating adequate output without adding much in the way of labor costs or capital spending, then that would explain why labor costs and capital investment are low. And if those solutions are also leading to less expensive goods and services, that would in part explain why measured productivity is weak. A cheaper digital solution leading to cheaper and more efficient goods doesn't do much for GDP or corporate revenue, but it meets collective needs just as much as a labor- or capital-intensive solution leading to more output and higher labor productivity. All of this suggests that much more attention needs to be paid to the real possibility that productivity isn't slowing the way we think, or that slower measured productivity isn't having the same consequences as when the economy was primarily based on making physical goods. Perhaps if we emphasized quantity and quality rather than market price, the optics would be different. Governments seem unwilling to allocate resources to developing a system for better accounting for free services and how the deflationary effects of technology can both improve standards of living and lower GDP. But it's clear that if we are going to understand the causes of inequality and formulate solutions, we need to start with data we can count on.

The advance allows Google to determine how many sales have been generated by digital ad campaigns, a goal that industry insiders have long described as "the holy grail" of online advertising. But the announcement also renewed long-standing privacy complaints about how the company uses personal information. Tell a friend AP Photo/Matt Rourke To power its multibillion-dollar advertising juggernaut, Google already analyses users' Web browsing, search history and geographic locations, using data from popular Google-owned apps such as YouTube, Gmail, Google Maps and the Google Play store. All that information is tied to the real identities of users when they log into Google's services. The new credit-card data enables the tech giant to connect these digital trails to real-world purchase records in a far more extensive way than was possible before. But in doing so, Google is yet again treading in territory that consumers may consider too intimate and potentially sensitive. Privacy advocates said few people understand that their purchases are being analysed in this way and could feel uneasy, despite assurances from Google that it has taken steps to protect the personal information of its users. Google also declined to detail how the new system works or what companies are analysing records of credit and debit cards on Google's behalf. Google, which saw $79 billion in revenue last year, said it would not handle the records directly but that its undisclosed partner companies had access to 70 percent of transactions for credit and debit cards in the United States. "What's really fascinating to me is that as the companies become increasingly intrusive in terms of their data collection, they also become more secretive," said Marc Rotenberg, executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center. He urged government regulators and Congress to demand answers about how Google and other technology companies are collecting and using data from their users. User privacy Google said it took pains to protect to protect user privacy. "While we developed the concept for this product years ago, it required years of effort to develop a solution that could meet our stringent user privacy requirements," Google said in a statement. "To accomplish this, we developed a new, custom encryption technology that ensures users' data remains private, secure, and anonymous." The announcement comes as Google attempts to weather an outcry from advertisers over how their ad dollars are spent. Google is working to move past an advertising boycott of YouTube, its lucrative video site, after news reports that ads for mainstream brands were appearing alongside extremist content, including sites featuring hate speech and violence. Google for years has been mining location data from Google Maps in an effort to prove that knowledge of people's physical locations could "close the loop" between physical and digital worlds. Users can block this by adjusting the settings on smartphones, but few do so, privacy experts said. This location-tracking ability has allowed Google to send reports to retailers telling them, for example, whether people who saw an ad for a lawn mower later visited or passed by a Home Depot. The location-tracking program has grown since it was first launched with only a handful of retailers. Home Depot, Express, Nissan and Sephora have participated. "Google - and also Facebook - believe that to get digital dollars from advertisers who are still primarily spending on TV, they need to prove that digital works," said Amit Jain, chief executive of Bridg, a start-up that matches online and offline behaviour. "These companies have to invest in finding the identity of the consumer at the moment when that shopper is at the cash register." Tuesday's announcement gives Google a clearer way to understand purchases than just location and allows it to understand purchase activity even when consumers deactivate location tracking on their smartphones. Google executives say they are using complex, patent-pending mathematical formulas to protect the privacy of consumers when they match a Google user with a shopper who makes a purchase in a brick-and-mortar store. The mathematical formulas convert people's names and other purchase information, including the time stamp, location and amount of the purchase, into anonymous strings of numbers. The formulas make it impossible for Google to know the identity of the real-world shoppers, and for the retailers to know the identities of Google's users, said company executives, who called the process "double-blind" encryption. Making matches The companies know only that a certain number of matches have been made. In addition, Google does not know what products people bought. "Through a mathematical property, we can do double-blind matching between their data and our data," Jerry Dischler, vice president of product management for AdWords, Google's online advertising service, said in an interview. "Neither gets to the see the encrypted data that the other side brings." The tech giant declined to describe its mathematical formulas in anything more than broad terms, citing the patent application. It said the work was based on a 2011 research paper by three MIT scientists, which was funded by Google and Citigroup. Dischler described the modelling as a "revolutionary" step forward for Google and advertisers. He added that users who signed into Google's services had consented to Google sharing their data with third parties. But the company would not say how merchants had obtained consent from consumers to pass along their credit-card information. Google said that it requires its partners to use only personal data that they have the "rights" to use, but it would not say whether that meant the consumers had consented. Read also: Google making cheap Android phones support its latest software In the past, both Google and Facebook have obtained purchase data for a more limited set of consumers who participate in store-loyalty programs. Those consumers are more heavily tracked by retailers and often give consent to share their data with third parties as a condition of signing up. Tuesday's initiative enables Google to use transaction data from a much wider swath of consumers than ever before, but the lack of detail on how personal data was being handled caused concern for privacy advocates. Paul Stephens, of Privacy Rights Clearinghouse, a consumer-advocacy group based in San Diego, said only a few pieces of data can allow a marketer to identify an individual, and he expressed scepticism that Google's system for guarding the identities of users will stand up to the efforts of hackers, who in the past have successfully stripped away privacy protections created by other companies after data breaches. "What we have learned is that it's extremely difficult to anonymize data," he said. "If you care about your privacy, you definitely need to be concerned." Such data providers have been the targets of cybercriminals in the past. In 2015, a hack of data broker Experian exposed the personal information of 15 million people.

The “Personal” tab can be found behind the “More” menu and will surface results like Gmail messages and calendar events from users signed-in accounts. For photo searches, users can either immediately open an image result or click through to do a deeper search in Google Photos. In March, Google introduced shortcuts on the Google Search app for Android, iOS and Google.com on the mobile web that gives users the ability to explore deeper within topics they care about. With shortcuts right on the home screen, users now have access to in-depth experiences across sports, eat and drink, entertainment and weather sections. Android users will find other useful shortcuts too like translate, nearby attractions, flights, hotels, internet speed test, currency converter and more.

Over the course of a year, Google quietly turned its map inside-out – transforming it from a road map into a place map. A year ago, the roads were the most prominent part of the map – the thing you noticed first. Now, the places are. And: In our Comparison last year, we found that Apple generally showed a greater variety of places than Google: But look what happens when we resurvey Google a year later: It's quite a difference – and Google's mix is now much closer to Apple's. And: Speaking of Apple... while Google has been making all those changes, what has Apple been up to? After all, Apple announced an "all-new design" for Apple Maps just weeks before Google's Summer redesign. Let's take a look at how Apple looked a year ago, before it released its new design: And now let's see how it looks today: See the difference? I don't either. Last year, in addition to the major redesign, we also got Maps apps, so everything from ride-sharing to reservation making could live in and enhance maps. We also got steady progress for Apple Maps on the web. I expect we'll see some of the next-generation of Maps updates at WWDC 2017 but here's hoping Apple can shed its dependence on TomTom data, accelerate the updates, and start closing that gap. It's not about beating Google at maps either. It's about providing quality maps all Apple's own. Many people simply use whatever's built into the phone or tablet they buy, and for iPhone and iPad, that's Apple Maps. And they deserve as rapid and continuous improvements as possible. Apple's got a great geo team, we just need to see more from them in real time. Maps for iPhone and iPad What's new in the Maps app How to find locations and get directions with Maps How to share location and directions with Maps How to delete your search history and prior destinations in Maps How to use Siri with Maps How to enable and use Maps extensions Best Maps app extensions How to change settings for Maps How to report a problem in Maps How to use Maps with CarPlay Reader comments Apple Maps vs. Google Maps: A year in analysis 23 Comments View All Comments Log In to Comment Register Sort by Date Sort by Rating wesee The week that Apple Maps first came out, I got a wedding invitation that stated, "Don't use Google Maps, because it's wrong." I knew where the church was, and sure enough Google was wrong. I tried it in Apple Maps, and it was perfect. Since then I have used Apple Maps only, and have yet to be let down. I travel all over Southern Ontario, and into the US at times. I know people find spots that are wrong, but that can be said for Google too. I'll happily stick with Apple Maps. 0 1 day ago Reply Rene Ritchie No maps really work for me. Google stopped announcing exit numbers for a while, which meant I couldn't use them on the local highways. Just last week I asked both Google and Apple Maps to take me to a local town hall. Apple showed me the wrong town, Google wanted me to go to the U.S. The floods ended here almost two weeks ago and Google still wants to redirect me around them, but wants to take me through roads blocked by construction for almost a month. I get that mapping is hard and up-to-the-minute mapping almost impossible, so generally I try to just get general ideas and not worry the details much. 0 1 day ago Reply Steve Adams The opposite for us when apple started with maps. We went to a hockey tourney with my son, his iPhone shoed the stadium on the opposite side of town and my nokia brought us right to the correct door. 0 10 hours ago Reply wvayens I really prefer the look of Apple maps. I use maps more to tell me how to get someplace rather than finding places. And I find the "look" when I'm navigating to be much cleaner and easier to read. 0 1 day ago Reply masaoota I'm totally the opposite - I find Google Maps visually a lot easier to view and follow. This is particularly so in London where they have clear classic icons on the map for underground stations and train stations which are often the main landmarks I navigate by. The Apple Maps representation of these is really poor. 0 1 day ago Reply PoisonMaps I think this is an example of why Google Maps is so much better than Apple Maps for countries outside North America. Apple Maps is very much based on roads, which is probably fine in the U.S, where most people drive everywhere, but doesn’t work elsewhere. As you say, in London people’s knowledge of the layout of the city is generally garnered from the tube map (an iconic design that I am unhealthily fond of), and so Google make sure that the stations are prominent. I don’t know for sure, but Apple don’t seem to have the same global knowledge. They have some great transit functionality, with fantastic levels of detail, but the London tube stations are barely shown on the main map unless you specifically select the Transit option. I assume that Apple Maps are coded by guys in Cupertino so this probably seems a reasonable assumption. However I guess that Google have people in each country giving feedback about what locals expect to be on a map, and that makes their maps so much better to use. Apple really need to up their game with maps, especially outside the US. I am sure that they are great for driving, but what about when walking? Especially when in the countryside, which is where Apple Maps is frankly awful. This was understandable when they first started, but is pretty pathetic 5 years later. Why do they show so few (if any) paths? Surely people in the US like to hike as well? Hopefully Apple will up their game in Maps at WWDC. They have made all sorts of amazing peripheral improvements (3D flyovers, transit, reservations etc) but the basic maps are not much better than they were 5 years ago (at least here in the UK). They still prioritise driving and ignore walking, which is pretty poor for a general purpose app. 0 1 day ago Reply indoctrahol I'll give Apple Maps another go around. The issue I have with it when using just for a little bit was there is a bit too much movement when navigating. It becomes a bit hard to reorientate your sense of direction when this happens too much. Maybe I'm just getting old. 0 1 day ago Reply Vox My only problem with Apple Maps is that it's the only option when it comes to Car Play...can't open Waze or Google Maps in the place I need them most...my car. Usually Apple Maps works well here in Monterrey (Mexico), but when it doesn't, I've got to pull out my phone holder and stick it to the window to be able to use Waze (which is usually the best of the 3 for me here). 0 1 day ago Reply Thoughter Rene, by focusing just on the look of Apple Maps, you are leaving out the huge improvements that Apple continues to roll out. For example, it's just in the past year AM has implemented the hugely beneficial "alternate routes" pop up when accidents occur. Apple Transit is also superior to GM Transit, not in number of regions yet, but in accuracy and user features. (Apple could have turned on every region at once, as Google did, if they simply were satisfied with stock data, but Google was criticized for accuracy, etc., and Apple wanted a very different user experience. Also, it would be good for you with your contacts to do an article on what is around the corner with Apple anticipated to compete its base map this year or early 2018. This will lead to some fantastic developments, such as Sky to ground zoom, again far superior than the GM Streetview which is very dated and clunky to use. 0 1 day ago Reply Thoughter Rene, also it would be great in an article to let folks know how huge mapping is in Apple's future. With the debacle of a roll out, Apple has intentionally been low key in building base map and adding features, but they are adding thousands of employees to mapping, e.g., new center in India, and mapping is integral to the future Apple ecosystem, something most don't realize. 0 1 day ago Reply SkydiverTilt Two YEARS after moving into my house I still have to tell people not to use Apple Maps. It's just awful. Apple reallly needs to allow Google maps integration into the iOS for one click directions. Apple maps isn't even close (and I'm an Apple fan boy), not by **** far. Stays deleted (thank you Apple for at least allowing it to be deleted so as not to accidentally click a link and open up that garbage of an app) 0 1 day ago Reply DannyJJK If you've read the previous comments on here, Apple Maps is certainly not garbage. Yes it's probably inaccurate in your area, but just because it's bad in one area doesn't mean it's bad all round. Google Maps is very inaccurate for me around where I live, by your logic that means Google Maps is just as garbage as well 0 15 hours ago Reply stratmansd Google Maps is really better when it comes to overall reference and map information. But when it comes to driving directions, I find Apple Maps and Google Maps are mostly the same. Google maps is good at giving you lane instructions which Apple Maps doesn't do. However, I've had Google either stop giving directions or begin giving me directions in an opposite direction. I haven't had these problems with Apple Maps. Apple Maps is usually reliable when I'm driving and using Car Play. 0 1 day ago Reply AdamHunterATC I am, for the most part, content with Apple Maps. Give me lane guidance and multi-destination routing, and it'll be perfect for me. 0 1 day ago Reply n8ter#AC Most people I know use Google Maps. I haven't driven in like... Years, Lol. So, naturally I only use Maps when told to. In that case, I just use whatever device I have. If I have my Windows Tablet, I will just use that cause it has GPS and Offline Maps. If I'm on my Kindle I'll check on that if I'm tethered. If i'm on my Phone, I will check Apple Maps, cause I don't install redundant apps on my phone (like Google Maps). I've yet to have any of those take me to the wrong place, so I pretty much don't care about these details anymore... 0 21 hours ago Reply iDonev Over where I live (Bulgaria) Apple Maps has much more serious problems than your usual "oh, there aren't enough businesses and places of interest" or the "road is closed due to construction work and it's not reflected on the map". The biggest issue Apple Maps has for me is the omission of small roads and pedestrian walkways. As such Apple Maps cannot even give me the fastest route to my location. Google Maps, on the other hand, is much more comprehensive. That said, I still prefer Apple Maps, I just need to duplicate my route search in Google Maps to make sure that I am going where I need to go and that I will get there as quickly as possible. 0 20 hours ago Reply Ttrq2001 For a very nice job with the same topic, head over here and check out what this other author has to say! Enjoy. https://www.justinobeirne.com/a-year-of-google-maps-and-apple-maps 0 11 hours ago Reply PoisonMaps That's the article that Rene is talking about. 0 11 hours ago Reply Ttrq2001 Ah got it. That article is really good! Thx PM! 0 11 hours ago Reply PoisonMaps No worries. It is a great article that gives a good insight into the difficulty of creating maps that are used for all sorts of purposes. I think they should give the user more control over what they want to see on the map. Both apps have “transport” modes, and Google have “cycling”, but why not have options for hiking, shopping, tourism, emergencies etc? Although then no-one would buy my app! 0 11 hours ago Reply Derrick4Real yes a very good article. And if it's relying on Tom Tom information it explains why for more than a year my like 30 requests for a correction of a business and address went unfixed. They probably could not fix it because it was someone else's information, which i always suspected. That said they did offer a place to offer corrections. So i figured they had some input. 0 2 min ago Reply Steve Adams Oh, for driving, at least, download HERE maps. It's the BEST mapping / navigation for driving . 0 10 hours ago Reply Derrick4Real My experience is very much the opposite. Google has always and still does have far more detail, businesses in my area, LA. The addresses and business names are more accurate too. I even told apple several times about errors that didn't get fixed until just last year. Google street view is the killer feature though and i haven't seen an apple offering that compares to that. I do wish google had a feature where i could just have it in 3d driving mode w/o navigating somewhere. And also even when you're driving or navigating it doesn't always show the map in the direction your moving which is annoying. Google also has maps inside many stores here which was actually quite useful as when i was looking for a used record store i peered inside and it was pretty easy to determine that it wasn't a traditional record store but was more of a joint selling overpriced brand new albums you could get at Urban Outfitters and incense. Apple is ok. i use it sometimes. But it really annoyed me when i used it to drive to "Walmart" only to find out it was really a "Sam's Club", a business owned by Walmart but clearly messed up on Apple's maps. Somehow I'm guessing they got the information messed up. Unfortunately the nearest Walmart was like a 25 minute drive away. And i hate Walmart. I didn't want to have to go in the first place. Interestingly, i noticed Yelp had the exact same error along with several other errors Apple's maps had. I theorized that wherever they got their data from it was the same place. 0 29 min ago Reply Menu Log in or Sign up Search Apple Apps & Games Accessories & Toys Photo & Video Health & Fitness Movies & Music Transport Security Rumors Analysis How To The Best Reviews Deals Newsletter Forums Podcasts Android Central WindowsCentral iMore CrackBerry Connectedly TeslaCentral VRHeads MrMobile Modern Dad About Contact Us Jobs Privacy & Terms Mobile Nations 500M Consumers Reached Yearly Copyright 2017 Mobile Nations Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Careers: Writer | Dev Licensing External Links Disclosure Advertising Partner
International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Computers Google's AlphaGo AI is retiring soon and here's why DeepMind's AlphaGo AI is retiring after taking down the world's elite Go players at the 'Future of Go Summit' in China. Vinod Yalburgi   May 28, 2017 12:08 IST Google owned DeepMind's AlphaGo AI retires after beating the world's best Go players Google-acquired DeepMind's AlphaGo AI has been relishing the spotlight with its unparalleled success in tackling the world's elite Go players in the extremely demanding strategy game ever made. The world number one Go player Ke Jie recently lost to the AI champion by 3-0 at 'Future of Go Summit' competition whose grand finale was set for May 27. Google had acquired the London-based DeepMind for around $500 million in 2014. Three years down the line, AlphaGo has reached the pinnacle of success after beating the world's best players in the toughest Go competition to date. With the recent culmination of the final match event at the Go Summit in Wuzhen (China), Google has decidedly pulled the curtains down on AlphaGo's further participation in the Go challenges. Having defeated the world's elite Go players, AlphaGo has cast its last competitive milestone, DeepMind CEO Dennis Hassabis explained in a recent Google Blog post. Here are a few excerpts from the post: This week's series of thrilling games with the world's best players, in the country where Go originated, has been the highest possible pinnacle for AlphaGo as a competitive program. For that reason, the Future of Go Summit is our final match event with AlphaGo.The research team behind AlphaGo will now throw their energy into the next set of grand challenges, developing advanced general algorithms that could one day help scientists as they tackle some of our most complex problems, such as finding new cures for diseases, dramatically reducing energy consumption, or inventing revolutionary new materials. Being revered as the planet's extremely demanding strategy game ever, Go has certainly paved the way for AI-assisted learning techniques driven by AlphaGo's unpredictably unorthodox approach. Ke Jie, the strongest human player in the game, has admittedly been learning from AlphaGo's wily quick-second moves to strengthen his own arsenal. AlphaGo has simply served as the stepping stone for success in the field of AI research and development as DeepMind has more ambitious plans lined up for the near future. It is reported that the British company could employ AlphaGo in practical applications for everyday use. Consequently, the company has bid for a data-sharing deal with the UK's National Health Service while the move has been criticised for its privacy issues as identifiable health data of over 1.6 million NHS patients will be at stake. Now the deal has come under the scanner of UK's data protection watchdog, the ICO. "If AI systems prove they are able to unearth significant new knowledge and strategies in these domains too, the breakthroughs could be truly remarkable. We can't wait to see what comes next," said the DeepMind CEO. If DeepMind gets its plans right, we might see the advent of a new AI-driven era with AlphaGo's innovative and unpredictably unorthodox approach to gaming. The company is expected to publish a final review paper depicting the AI's evolution from its initial matches with Lee Sedol to the final home run at the Go Summit.

A product called Google Attribution was unveiled at a marketing conference this month in San Francisco by the internet giant. Google has long been able to determine when users click on an ads and make a purchase, but linking online and offline habits takes its analytics a step further. Google Senior Vice President Sridhar Ramaswamy, who announced that Attribution is in test mode with a limited number of partners and will be rolled out to more advertisers in coming weeks, touted the tool as being able to answer the long-challenging question of whether marketing campaigns are working. “Google Attribution makes it possible for every marketer to measure the impact of their marketing across devices and across channels,” Ramaswamy said. “Data-driven attribution uses machine learning to determine how much credit to assign to each step in the consumer journey — from the first time they engage with your brand for early research down to the final click before purchase.” Real-world customer email addresses or loyalty plan information can be woven with Google data from services such as AdWords, Google Analytics and DoubleClick Search to provide “a complete view” of marketing performance, according to the company. Using artificial intelligence, or machine learning, to better analyze and understand consumer behavior to target ads and promote sales was a major theme of the conference. For several years now, AdWords has enabled advertisers to measure visits to real-world stores stemming from online campaigns, Ramaswamy noted. “Still, measuring store visits is just one part of the equation,” Ramaswamy said. “You also need insights into how your online ads drive sales for your business.” Real-world transactions matched back to Google ads are handed in “a secure and privacy-safe way,” with store sales information reported in aggregated and anonymized forms to protect individual privacy, according to the company. Tying online activity to offline shopping decisions has been a holy grail for advertisers for quite some time, and comes with worrisome privacy implications, according to ACLU senior policy analyst Jay Stanley. Attribution threatens to intrude on a core tenet of privacy, that people can have dealings with one party not spill over into affairs with other parties they interact with, Stanley contended. “This is an evolution, not a revolution; another step toward increased monitoring of individuals,” Stanley said. “Each step raises the question ‘Where does this all stop?’ “ Stanley expected Google to be on its best behavior when it came to handling the growing trove of information about users, but that even the best of intentions could crack under the “enormous hydraulic pressure of the profit motive.” “We have the full fury and genius of the capitalist system being driven toward monitoring people in ever increasing detail and companies are competing to do so,” Stanley said. “It will not stop without some sort of rules in which we as a society express our values through legal protections.” Google and Facebook dominate the online ad world, and what one does to prove its worth to advertisers is likely to be copied by the other, according to Silicon Valley analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group. Attribution promised to give Google a way to assure advertisers they are getting their money’s worth at the firm’s online venues. “The big problem is that showing conversion from ad consumption to purchase has been horrible,” Enderle said of online marketing. “This has been a problem for a long time. Google is trying to make a metric so they get credit for it when you do purchase after viewing an ad.” Data showing which ads are translating into real sales should mean that the relevance of ads people see online will improve as marketers abandon wrongly aimed or ineffectively tailored messages, the analyst reasoned. “You are going to be hit with ads for things that you might actually want to buy, so you are going to spend a lot more money,” Enderle predicted. Worries about privacy sparked by linking offline and online activities are a decade or so late, because the time to protest was when collection began of the troves of data about people, the analyst argued. “There really is no downside to this application,” Enderle said while discussing Google’s marketing metrics move. “This is the good side of collecting data; it is what else is being done with the data that should be unnerving and that we really don’t know.” Photos Click to enlarge Keywords Internet, Google, privacy Tech China’s DJI unveils $499 drone that flies from palm of your hand Hitachi develops new breast cancer detection technology Japan’s ‘Superhuman’ sports games meld high-tech and athletics Experts question alleged North Korean role in ‘WannaCry’ cyberattack Mail the editor Error Report Republishing Commenting Policy The Japan Times ST The Japan Times on Sunday What's Trending Now Expert at escaping North Korea has a message for Trump Trump son-in-law had undisclosed contacts with Russian envoy Hone your knowledge of Japanese kitchen knives Sounds of silence?

A product called “Google Attribution” was unveiled at a marketing conference this month in San Francisco by the internet giant. Google has long been able to determine when users click on an ads and make a purchase, but linking online and offline habits takes its analytics a step further. Google senior vice president Sridhar Ramaswamy, who announced that Attribution is in test mode with a limited number of partners and will be rolled out to more advertisers in coming weeks, touted the tool as being able to answer the long-challenging question of whether marketing campaigns are working. “Google Attribution makes it possible for every marketer to measure the impact of their marketing across devices and across channels,” Ramaswamy said. “Data-driven attribution uses machine learning to determine how much credit to assign to each step in the consumer journey — from the first time they engage with your brand for early research down to the final click before purchase.” Real-world customer email addresses or loyalty plan information can be woven with Google data from services such as AdWords, Google Analytics and DoubleClick Search to provide “a complete view” of marketing performance, according to the company. Using artificial intelligence, or machine learning, to better analyze and understand consumer behavior to target ads and promote sales was a major theme of the conference. – Ad ‘holy grail’ – For several years now, AdWords has enabled advertisers to measure visits to real-world stores stemming from online campaigns, Ramaswamy noted. “Still, measuring store visits is just one part of the equation,” Ramaswamy said. “You also need insights into how your online ads drive sales for your business.” Real-world transactions matched back to Google ads are handed in “a secure and privacy-safe way,” with store sales information reported in aggregated and anonymized forms to protect individual privacy, according to the company. Tying online activity to offline shopping decisions has been a “holy grail” for advertisers for quite some time, and comes with worrisome privacy implications, according to ACLU senior policy analyst Jay Stanley. Attribution threatens to intrude on a core tenant of privacy, that people can have dealings with one party not spill over into affairs with other parties they interact with, Stanley contended. “This is an evolution, not a revolution; another step toward increased monitoring of individuals,” Stanley said. “Each step raises the question ‘Where does this all stop?'” Stanley expected Google to be on its best behavior when it came to handling the growing trove of information about users, but that even the best of intentions could crack under the “enormous hydraulic pressure of the profit motive.” “We have the full fury and genius of the capitalist system being driven toward monitoring people in ever increasing detail and companies are competing to do so,” Stanley said “It will not stop without some sort of rules in which we as a society express our values through legal protections.” – More tempting ads? – Google and Facebook dominate the online ad world, and what one does to prove its worth to advertisers is likely to be copied by the other, according to Silicon Valley analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group. Attribution promised to give Google a way to assure advertisers they are getting their money’s worth at the firm’s online venues. “The big problem is that showing conversion from ad consumption to purchase has been horrible,” Enderle said of online marketing. “This has been a problem for a long time. Google is trying to make a metric so they get credit for it when you do purchase after viewing an ad.” Data showing which ads are translating into real sales should mean that the relevance of ads people see online will improve as marketers abandon mis-aimed or ineffectively tailored messages, the analyst reasoned. “You are going to be hit with ads for things that you might actually want to buy, so you are going to spend a lot more money,” Enderle predicted. Worries about privacy sparked by linking offline and online activities are a decade or so late, because the time to protest was when collection began of the troves of data about people, the analyst argued. “There really is no downside to this application,” Enderle said while discussing Google’s marketing metrics move. “This is the good side of collecting data; it is what else is being done with the data that should be unnerving and that we really don’t know.” Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on LinkedIn Share via Email In this article: GoogleSridhar Ramaswamy You may also like North Korea fires ballistic missile 2 hours ago  Technology Nigeria targets regional digital switchover plan 2 hours ago  Telecoms Why nuclear could become the next 'fossil' fuel 1 day ago  Technology Apple is working on a dedicated chip to power AI on devices 2 days ago  Technology Facebook unveils finalists in Bots for Messenger developer challenge 2 days ago  Technology The Palms Mall set to launch new web platform 2 days ago  Technology More   Latest Tension builds as security agencies beef up surveillance in South East 2 hours ago  Nigeria Obasanjo, Tambuwal, others lament youth frustration, anger, unemployment 2 hours ago  Nigeria Lagos is path to Nigeria’s prosperity, says Osinbajo 2 hours ago  Nigeria Jonathan sues for peace in Rivers’, Bayelsa’s squabbles 2 hours ago  Nigeria ‘Delayed passage of whistleblower bill threatens anti-graft war’ 2 hours ago  Nigeria More   Communication Medallion eyes four cities expansion, NSE 3 days ago   Zinox Commends FG for Executive Order on Local Content 3 days ago   Nigeria loses fresh $30b ICT investment to South Africa 23 May   Hackers demand ransom in Bitcoin 19 May   GoOnline Nigeria to empower SMEs for digital age 19 May   Top Home Nigeria National Metro World Africa Asia Europe US Politics Sport Football Boxing Athletics Tennis Golf Opinion Editorial Contributors Columnists Cartoons Business Appointments Business News Business RoundUp Industry Aviation Capital Market Communications Energy DrillBytes Maritime SweetCrude Infrastructure Money Technology Gadgets Telecoms Social Media Technology Arts Arts Art House Artfolk Revue Film Literature Music Theatre Visual Arts Features BusinessAgro Education Executive Motoring Executive Briefs Focus Friday Worship Law Media Science Youth Speak Property Environment Mortgage Finance Real Estate Urban Development Guardian Woman Entrepreneurship GW Fiction Personality Issues WIMBIZ Saturday Magazine Youth Magazine Just Human Life & Style Love & Life Transition Travel & Tourism Celebrity Brand Intelligence Gardening Weekend Beats Sunday Magazine Ibru Ecumenical Centre Campus CityFile News Feature Living Healthy Diet Living Wellbeing Newspeople Guardian TV News National Africa World Business Opinion Talks From the Street Fashion Sport Entertainment Entertainment News Music Comedy Science & Tech GTV Exclusive Home About Us Advertise With Us |     Powered by Ventra Copyright © 2017 Guardian Newspapers.

As you might be able to guess from the name, it is designed to make finding job openings easier and more effective - for both applicants and employers. The feature appears to be going live on Google Search, at least for some users. Currently, searching something like "barista jobs" just returns a list of results from job listing sites. With Google for Jobs, you get a much cleaner interface with more details, plus modifiers like 'Full-time' and 'Starbucks.'    Left: Current layout; Center, Right: New layout This doesn't seem to be live yet for everyone, including myself, but let us know in the comments if you see it.

[Deal Alert] Several movies and TV episodes on Google Play are on sale for Memorial Day Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/27 6:37pm PDTMay 27, 2017 55 Plus 1 on G+ 125 Share on Facebook 47 Share on Twitter Total Shares227 Deals Google News If your Memorial Day weekend plans are being ruined by poor weather, Google has an offer for you. It recently tossed up a little holiday sale on movies and TV shows over on Google Play, including some deals that are over 50% off their regular prices. So if you can't go camping or throw that family barbecue because of rain, at least you and your loved ones can snuggle up inside while you binge watch The Wire. It'll be good for little Johnny's character. Among the better movie collections being offered are The Lord of the Rings Trilogy for $20, the Back to the Future Trilogy for $15, and "The Best of Tarantino" six-movie collection for $30. The latter includes one of my favorite cheesy horror movies, From Dusk Till Dawn. The TV selection has a lot of solid HBO shows — if you don't happen to have HBO Go — as well as the complete X-Files for $50, American Horror Story seasons 1-5 for $60 and the amazing Kung Fu series in its entirety for $30. For more family-oriented deals there are a ton of shows from Nickelodeon, as well as a small number of animated children's film collections. You know what? The outdoors are over-rated. Who would want to spend a weekend outside with their loving family when they could spend days forcing their children to appreciate their favorite childhood movies. Let's face it, in the long run, your kids will thank you. Source: Google Play (1, 2) Tags deal alert google play memorial day movies sale tv subscribe ...

The Internet company said earlier this week that a new tool will track how much money people spend in merchants’ bricks-and-mortar stores after clicking on their digital ads. The analysis will be done by matching the combined ad clicks of people who are logged into Google services with their collective purchases on credit and debit cards. Google says it won’t be able to examine the specific items purchased or how much a specific individual spent. But even aggregated data can sometimes be converted back to data that can identify individuals, said Larry Ponemon, chairman of the Ponemon Institute privacy research firm. Google says it has access to roughly 70 percent of U.S. credit and debit card sales through partnerships with other companies that track that data. By matching ad clicks with this data, Google says it can automatically inform merchants when their digital ads translate into sales at a bricks-and-mortar store. Previously, if people clicked on an ad without buying anything online, an advertiser might conclude that the ad was a waste of money. If the program works, it could help persuade merchants to boost their digital marketing budgets. The data add to the digital dossiers that Google has compiled on users of its search engine and other services, including Gmail, YouTube and Android. Sridhar Ramaswamy, Google’s senior vice president of ads and commerce, said the new tracking system was created in consultation with “incredibly smart people” to ensure it’s not invasive. He described the program as “secure and privacy safe.” But Ponemon said that even if Google has good intentions now, companies and governments in the future might not. The kinds of data that Google is collecting also could become an inviting target for hackers, said Miro Copic, a marketing professor at San Diego State University. “The privacy implications of this are pretty massive, so Google needs to tread very carefully,” Copic said. Google already runs the world’s biggest online ad network, one that raked in $79 billion in revenue last year. That puts it in the best position to capture any additional marketing dollars spent on computers and mobile devices. When it first described the tracking program to the Associated Press, Google provided an example of how it would be able to identify a specific purchase made in a physical store by a consumer who had clicked on a digital ad run by the merchant. But Google executives stressed that it won’t be able to peer that deeply into what people are buying. Google’s tool won’t work for cash payments or the 30 percent of U.S. card transactions that Google can’t currently access. And this works only for individuals who log in. Google gives its users the option to limit the company’s tracking and control what types of ads they are shown — although in practice, relatively few users tweak such settings.

Navigation gHacks Technology News The independent technology news blog Home Header Menu Home Windows Software Firefox Chrome Google Android Email Deals Best of Support Us Return to Content Google Search gets Personal (option) By Martin Brinkmann on May 28, 2017 in Google - Last Update:May 28, 2017 2 Google launched a new Google Search feature recently that makes search even more personal than it already is with a new personal option. Google introduced the filter bubble years ago which delivers news to search users that the company believes users wants. What this means is that you are more likely to get results and information that you'd agree and interact with, than those that you don't. While that is good at times as it puts the focus on topics that you are likely more interested in, it is making it difficult to break out of the bubble to form an educated opinion about a particular subject. Google Personal Personal is a new option of Google Search that is not integrated directly in the algorithm that determines which search results are returned to users when they run searches on Google. It is a new option under the more link instead which you can load. Please note that personal is only an option there if you are signed in to a Google account, and that the new feature won't work yet for Google Apps customers. If you are not, you don't get that option. The reason for that is simple: It searches Gmail data, and maybe also other account related data, and returns results based on that. I could not get the feature to return anything though when I tried to use it. Even simple searches for Linux or known file attachments or subjects on Gmail did not return a result. Others reported that email messages and photos were returned to them when they ran searches under Personal. Closing Words Google's new Personal option on Google Search returns specific account data. It is unclear right now whether it is limited to Gmail and Google Photos, or if it pulls data from Google Drive and other Google services as well. If it is the first, it is nothing more than a basic copy of Gmail Search built right into Google Search with an added photos search component. I don't think that is particularly useful in this case. If you could get results from multiple Google services on the other hand, it could prove more useful to some users, especially those invested heavily in Google's ecosystem. Now You: What's your first impression of Google Search Personal?

No doubt that this new "personal" Google search is in total contradiction with privacy or rather (because it illustrates a context rather than creating it) is relevant of one's privacy held by an entity which is neither a family member nor a friend nor even a relative. What an odd world. Having everything one performs in a connected dimension be recorded, digested, analyzed and then spit as a cow's milk, nectar of a life. I do hope we'll always be more than a sum of equations, unpredictable so to say. Reply bruno May 28, 2017 at 5:16 pm # The "filter bubble" is overrated IMO. Just try to compare a search in incognito and see whether you'll get vastly different results.

PHOTO: REUTERS SAN FRANCISCO: Google is testing a way to tie online ads to brick-and-mortar store purchases, a move whetting marketing appetites while fueling privacy worries. A product called “Google Attribution” was unveiled at a marketing conference this month in San Francisco by the internet giant. Google has long been able to determine when users click on an ads and make a purchase, but linking online and offline habits takes its analytics a step further. Google senior vice president Sridhar Ramaswamy, who announced that Attribution is in test mode with a limited number of partners and will be rolled out to more advertisers in coming weeks, touted the tool as being able to answer the long-challenging question of whether marketing campaigns are working. “Google Attribution makes it possible for every marketer to measure the impact of their marketing across devices and across channels,” Ramaswamy said. “Data-driven attribution uses machine learning to determine how much credit to assign to each step in the consumer journey — from the first time they engage with your brand for early research down to the final click before purchase.” Google’s AlphaGo clinches series win over Chinese Go master Real-world customer email addresses or loyalty plan information can be woven with Google data from services such as AdWords, Google Analytics and DoubleClick Search to provide “a complete view” of marketing performance, according to the company. Using artificial intelligence, or machine learning, to better analyze and understand consumer behavior to target ads and promote sales was a major theme of the conference. For several years now, AdWords has enabled advertisers to measure visits to real-world stores stemming from online campaigns, Ramaswamy noted. “Still, measuring store visits is just one part of the equation,” Ramaswamy said. “You also need insights into how your online ads drive sales for your business.” Real-world transactions matched back to Google ads are handed in “a secure and privacy-safe way,” with store sales information reported in aggregated and anonymized forms to protect individual privacy, according to the company. Tying online activity to offline shopping decisions has been a “holy grail” for advertisers for quite some time, and comes with worrisome privacy implications, according to ACLU senior policy analyst Jay Stanley. Forbes releases list of world’s most valuable tech brands Attribution threatens to intrude on a core tenant of privacy, that people can have dealings with one party not spill over into affairs with other parties they interact with, Stanley contended. “This is an evolution, not a revolution; another step toward increased monitoring of individuals,” Stanley said. “Each step raises the question ‘Where does this all stop?'” Stanley expected Google to be on its best behavior when it came to handling the growing trove of information about users, but that even the best of intentions could crack under the “enormous hydraulic pressure of the profit motive.” “We have the full fury and genius of the capitalist system being driven toward monitoring people in ever increasing detail and companies are competing to do so,” Stanley said “It will not stop without some sort of rules in which we as a society express our values through legal protections.” Google and Facebook dominate the online ad world, and what one does to prove its worth to advertisers is likely to be copied by the other, according to Silicon Valley analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group. Attribution promised to give Google a way to assure advertisers they are getting their money’s worth at the firm’s online venues. “The big problem is that showing conversion from ad consumption to purchase has been horrible,” Enderle said of online marketing. Tech giants race for edge in artificial intelligence “This has been a problem for a long time. Google is trying to make a metric so they get credit for it when you do purchase after viewing an ad.” Data showing which ads are translating into real sales should mean that the relevance of ads people see online will improve as marketers abandon mis-aimed or ineffectively tailored messages, the analyst reasoned. “You are going to be hit with ads for things that you might actually want to buy, so you are going to spend a lot more money,” Enderle predicted. Worries about privacy sparked by linking offline and online activities are a decade or so late, because the time to protest was when collection began of the troves of data about people, the analyst argued. “There really is no downside to this application,” Enderle said while discussing Google’s marketing metrics move. “This is the good side of collecting data; it is what else is being done with the data that should be unnerving and that we really don’t know.” Read more: Advertisement , Google , Tech Read full story Recommended Stories OMD and Google launch Pakistan’s First Programmatic campaign First agency to launch a programmatic campaign locally, using DoubleClick Bid Manager 13-year-old Pakistani hacker helping world's top tech companies Ahsan Tahir is a rising star in the cyber security realm Is Google replacing Android with a new OS?

Don't Change Your Google Password Before Factory Resetting Your Android Phone - You Might Trip A 72-Hour Security Lockout David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2015/07/13 3:19pm PDTJul 13, 2015 639 Plus 1 on G+ 763 Share on Facebook 6 Share on Twitter Total Shares1408 Android OS Tips & Tutorials Article Contents 1 Why am I locked out of my phone for 72 hours? 2 Why is this a feature? Isn't this insane overkill? 3 Is there any way around factory reset protection once it's triggered? 4 Can I disable this feature (Factory Reset Protection / Device Protection)? 5 How do I know if my phone has Factory Reset Protection? 6 Is there any warning about this when I factory reset my phone? This isn't a news story, but more of a "public service announcement" about an Android feature not everyone may be aware of. If you've ended up here because your Android phone is telling you that, after a factory reset, you cannot log into your device for 72 hours (3 days), I don't have much good news: you're going to have to wait it out. If you want to know why exactly this happens, regardless of whether or not it has affected you, this post will at least show you how to avoid falling victim to this security measure again if you find it to be too much trouble, as well as why this feature exists to begin with. Why am I locked out of my phone for 72 hours? Back in March 2015, Google introduced a feature called Device Protection in its newly-released version of Android, 5.1 Lollipop. Part of this new suite of security tools was something called Factory Reset Protection. This is the source of the 72-hour device lockout. It is tripped by resetting your Google account password and then performing a factory reset on an Android device (with Device Protection, meaning it runs 5.1+) that account is connected to. This feature is designed to allow you time to regain control of your Google account in the event it is compromised because your phone was stolen. Think of it this way: if somebody changes the lock on a security door (your phone) the night before the building gets robbed, do you think the person changing the lock (or someone else at the lock company) might have been in on it? That's essentially the logic of factory reset protection. The idea is that your Google account and password are the "lock" and "key" that are required to open your Factory Reset Protection-enabled device (the door) after it undergoes a factory reset, and that by changing your Google account password, you're "tampering" with the lock right before you enter the door - which is suspicious. And so at that point, Google initiates a 72-hour hold on sign-ins to that "door." After that 72 hours expires, you still need to log in with the previously-connected Google account's password. The difference is that during the hold, you just can't log in at all - after the hold is over, you obviously still need to verify the account password. Why is this a feature? Isn't this insane overkill? The reason the hold is triggered is that, once your Google account is compromised on a stolen phone (easy enough to do - the thief has your Gmail and probably your phone number), there is essentially no other way to stop a thief from successfully erasing all traces of your account ever having been on said phone, since a wipe can be done directly from the recovery menu on bootup without any sort of authorization (PIN/pattern protected startup does not prevent this). That 72 hours theoretically gives you time to get your Google account back under your control and change the password again, making the thief's attempts to log in futile. If you're wondering why a thief would know your Google account password and not your PIN/pattern lock, that's actually more likely to happen than you might think: it's completely possible to reset your Google account password without knowing the current one if you've got somebody's smartphone. Two-factor authentication generally relies on SMS, so the thief would get the authenticator on your stolen phone, and you probably would also have your backup email account synced to that smartphone as well (which, hey, good personal security idea: don't put your backup account on your phone). Generally speaking, it is comparatively much, much harder to change the lock screen on a phone if you don't know the existing PIN, pattern, or password, and short of social engineering or plain luck, that's hard information to get. Is there any way around factory reset protection once it's triggered? Sadly, no. Once the protection system is tripped, you've got a functionally useless smartphone until that 3-day lockout expires. If you've been locked out of your device and are looking for a workaround, sorry: there isn't one that we're aware of. You're going to have to wait (you also cannot sign in to the phone using another account - this would kind of defeat the purpose of the feature). Those affected by this problem have confirmed Google support is of no help in the matter - they'll just tell you to wait out the timer, during which time your phone has all the utility of a paperweight. This suggests Google really has no control over the timer itself once it's been triggered, though we can't be sure. Can I disable this feature (Factory Reset Protection / Device Protection)? Nice try, phone thieves! But really, in the interest of full disclosure, yes - you can disable all Device Protection features (and it is an all-or-nothing switch), including Factory Reset Protection, and doing so is relatively quick and painless on supported devices. Here is the process. Enable developer options on your phone (Google it - it's easy, usually you just go into the settings, "about phone," find the build number (might be under software), and then tap it until it says "You are now a Developer!") Go to developer options and find "Enable OEM unlock." Check the box, and hit "enable." You will get a warning saying this will disable device protection features, and this includes factory reset protection. And I've tested it - factory reset protection no longer works with this checkbox enabled. If your device does not have an "allow OEM unlocking" option, that means one of two things. First, it most likely means it doesn't support factory reset protection to begin with, and that your phone is not protected in the event someone wipes it (or it may have a 3rd party solution!). Second, it could just mean the company that made your phone (or the carrier) decided not to include the OEM unlock toggle and is kind of a dick, and in that case, you only have one option, and it's a bad one (bottom of this section). As to what "allowing OEM unlocking" really does, it basically tells the system that the bootloader is authorized to be unlocked (note: not the same as actually unlocking it) and that Android won't stop you in the event you should attempt to do it. And yes, this makes your phone less secure, because it potentially means a thief could flash custom software to your phone, etc., and Google is politely saying it's not their problem if something bad happens when you do this. If you don't want to use the Enable OEM Unlock method or do not have such a toggle, the only other practical option to disable ADP is to run with an unsecured lock screen. Not very appealing, right? Android Device Protection requires that you have a PIN, pattern, or password for your lockscreen in order to function. Without those things, its features become useless anyway - accounts can be removed from the device without any additional authorization, and thus there's really no protection to begin with. How do I know if my phone has Factory Reset Protection? The easiest way is to just do a factory reset (while logged in to the device with a Google account and a screen PIN/pattern set) and see if you get the following dialog on startup. If you do, you've got factory reset protection. If you don't, you either don't have it or it's disabled. Device Protection should be on almost any Android device that shipped with Android 5.1 or higher out of the box. It will also work on some phones that shipped with some version of 5.0 (5.0, 5.0.1, 5.0.2), such as the Galaxy S6, and were later updated to Android 5.1 or higher. Is there any warning about this when I factory reset my phone? Nope... which seems really bad on Google's part, if I'm honest. Devices should clearly state as part of the factory reset dialogue that they will be completely locked and rendered unusable if you've changed your Google password in the last 72 hours. Does this let phone thieves know how the system works? Certainly, but it still accomplishes the purpose (prevents a wipe), and it would be much better for end users. People have already encountered this feature unwittingly after resetting their Google account passwords, only to be locked out of their only phone for 3 days with absolutely no way to resolve the issue - and these people did nothing wrong. It's totally ridiculous that this is how it works, and Google should most definitely address it. So, the lesson? In the event you change your Google account password, you must wait three days before factory resetting any of your Android 5.1+ devices you use with that account unless you have explicitly disabled Android Device Protection on them. If you factory reset one of your Android devices before those 3 days are up and then attempt to sign into that device with your Google account, you will be met with an error message and not allowed to log into the device with any account until 72 hours after the password reset occurred, which is a major bummer.

In case you've forgotten, Android is still the OS of the masses, and the masses prefer security over absolute account-level autonomy (thank that Wired editor). CoreRooted Honestly, I think Google is right about not lifting the 72 hour period on their end. We would be even more annoyed if all it took was a phone call to Google to unlock the device after it being stolen. If the thief has your device AND changed the password on it, then yes, they have your info. There isn't much that Google can do to say that the caller isn't you. I really can't see any of this as a negative. David Ruddock The lack of being informed that it will happen is the broken part. I agree a hard lockout is fine in theory, but not if you had zero idea it would happen in the first place unless you read an obscure support article. CoreRooted That's a good point (and then one thing in the article that I was shaking my head at). Google has never really been good at announcements, documentation, and marketing. I was trying to think of an instance where Google wouldn't want to let people know about this, but I really can't. It's something we WANT thieves to know about and users also. cpaixao The lock works not because changing password is suspicious, but because you might want to avoid thief from receiving emails at your logged account and browsing your personal data on apps with your account. Despite of that, you'll still able to lock and/or wipe your device with GDM from anywhere. This is the reason for GDP logic. bo ure Thanks for the acronyms, techie Genius. It renders your sentence meaningless unless we know wtf you're talking about or look them up. Bon Hey DAVID! Im not a theft i own a s6 edge plus i forgot my previous passowrd on my google accnt and may back up password in case my fingerprint will fail, now ive got 72hrs locked out. Its really heartbreaking. Is there any other way for me again to use my phone? Is it possible if i changed my password in my google accnt and used it after 72hrs locked out i can use already my s6 edge? Pls do help me. :( victoria atwood Hi can u tell me if I have this 72 hour thing..I turn my phone on it asks me for wiFi then asked me for google email and password .it tellseems me to sign in with owners account but I am the owner..I can't get on home screen or anything..I've only had my smsung edge 6 plus 2 days..Please help before I cracked up ..Thanks x David Navarro i have the same issue right now it tells me to sign in with owners account and Im using the same account can you tell me if your issue was fixed after 72 hours please. It doesn't say anything about 72 hours Shan Yousaf Hey i have the same issue yesterday. i have same error( please sign in with owners account) Kindly telll me is this issue will be resolved after 72 hours? TCH I just run into the issue today and there was no warning from google, what a shame. Oh well nothing to do now but wait those 72 stinking hours but lesson learned. Akshay I have a Moto G3, I first factory reset it in recovery mode, then changed the password from the phone. Now the phone is not allowing me to login, it returns password error with old password, but accepts new password, but after checking the new password it returns the same verification screen. Currently going through 72-hours lockout and tried many times with new password. So, after the 3 days are over, will I be able to login in my moto g3 with new password? Moirrainefortruth Well, there should be a way to go around it if you send a code from your own darn email. Google doesn't get security, they just pretend they do. Shane Johnson Honestly the phone states this when you initially setbup your first gmail with the phone. The people whobare affected by this and “surprised" are peoplr who SKIP through the set up screens. So shame on them bo ure Oh, F.U., it's impossible to read every g.d. little thing this miserable phone throws at you. EowynCarter That. No point in a security measure that can be bypassed. Though a warning would be nice indead. I finally let my bootloader unlocked. Not safe, but I'm afraid that it might prevent me from fixing my own phone in case of bootloop. Don I disagree. I'm in this situation right now. My brother sold me his phone and I asked him for his login to unlock it, but before that I decided to factory reset it to clear it. Unbeknownst to me, he was resetting his password at the same time. Now I'm toast. mfr118 Just so everyone knows I'm the reason for this PSA. Thanks Artem and David for all your help the other day. CoreRooted Ugh... sorry that hit you. 3 days without my DD would drive me insane. mfr118 Insane wouldn't be the word I'd use. I was stuck using my companies iPhone for 3 days.

You guys actually take the time to help unlike those other "Central" Android sites Guest Why would anyone mess with my Google account if they stole my phone? I'm not sure if I understand this feature. David Ruddock You can't wipe the phone to the point of it being resellable without that password - Factory Reset Protection requires it to be verified on boot after a factory reset, and Android won't fully start until the password of the last account on the device is verified. Tl;dr - if you don't have the Google account password (or get locked out after trying to change it), you can't resell the phone. Guest Oh I didn't know that, thanks for explaining. Can't you just log out of the original owner's account and delete the data of Play services, etc. before trying to do a factory reset? David Ruddock That requires the device PIN / pattern / password from the lockscreen, which must be set up for these features to turn on in the first place. GryphKid44 How can a thief change your password without being able to get past the lockscreen? It seems they would have to change your password from a different device which means that they have access to another device as well. David Ruddock It would be unlikely, but entirely possible if they steal your phone while it's not locked (eg BT smart lock, long lock timeout, etc.) nehpets In this instance where somebody has your phone unlocked already, what is preventing them from just enabling the OEM Unlock for their own use? I don't remember the developer options requiring pin/password, etc. EowynCarter Nothing. That's the reason smart lock can be used after I set my work account on my phone.Not safe. All about security vs convenient nehpets So that makes this 72 hour lockout period worthless. It will catch a whole lot of people doing nothing wrong, while anybody who nefariously reset somebody else's password using their stolen cell phone would also take 2 seconds to enable the OEM unlock and not have any issues. Brad You need the pin to turn it off whether or not the phone is "smart" unlocked... so they can't disable it. nehpets That makes a whole lot more sense. Prezes Dyrektor what about flashing a different rom? perhaps even an older version stock? wouldn't that work around this protection? EowynCarter Only if the bootloader in unlocked. And as default, you have to allow the unlock in the developers settings. Or fastboot oem unlock says access denied. Dabu So what am I supposed to do, if I'm selling a phone with this feature? CoreRooted Probably wipe the device first and then change your password afterward would be safer. Walker86 Actually that may not help in all cases. I just got hit with this because of a glitch on my Samsung Galaxy S6 where it suddenly failed to read my fingerprint and asked for my backup password, which it didn't recognize either. T-Mobile suggested a factory wipe to recover the phone, but it wouldn't recognize my google account afterwards. So, they passed me on to Samsung support who suggested I change my google account password to see if that would help - and bang here I am for 72 hours. Whatever the intention, this is a poorly thought out implementation of the concept. There should be a way to validate legitimate owners and bypass this lockout. Tardaboveme Turn off the lockscreen, then remove the google account from the phone. That should let you wipe it without it coming up after the fdr. David Ruddock Correct. ALUOp You don't change your password when you sell your phone, so you don't need to worry about this feature. Just wipe the phone. Despite the length of this article, it doesn't explain things very clearly. Cory S read more. http://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/nexus2cee_Screenshot_2015-03-12-16-48-37_thumb.png ALUOp I don't understand your point. I was telling Dabu that he needs not worry about the 72-hour thing, which this article is trying to explain and apparently got him confused. Cory S When you wipe your phone you need to sign back in with the original account to unlock it.. That part has nothing to do with password changes.. ALUOp Where in my previous comments did I say or imply signing in after wipe has anything to do with password changes? Please read or re-read my previous comments. All I said is Dabu doesn't need to worry about the 72-hour blackout this article is trying to explain. Cory S He asked what he needed to do when he sold a phone with this feature...which disabels a device after a factory reset until the original owner signs back in. He was given the correct answer above, yours would had resulted in a new owner opening up a paper weight. Demetria Streeter thats what mine is saying right now ToniLKerns ====Lates Quality performance androidpolice ...... <**** Find Here Trooper311 Happened to me about a month or so ago. I contacted Google and was told there was no way around it, even though I pressed the issue. Lesson learned the hard way. After 72 hours was up, I was able to log back in. mciuccio Hey, I just did the same thing, I changed my google password, because of a blackshades hack on my work PC. and also in trying to clean up my Note 5 I did a factory reset on it also. I have tried to log back into my Note 5 every day, I also have 2 step verification turned on now with my google account. So currently my sim card is in an iPhone 5 I suppose for three days from now, after reading this article. I am just wondering will I have to try to log in with my new google password or my old one I changes? Does anyone know? Jey New one Bunklung There was another Android Police article on Factory Reset Protection and someone posted a comment indicated that even with an unlocked bootloader and allow OEM unclocking that factory reset protection still worked even when reflashing the device to stock. The account check/FRP happens server side. http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/03/12/guide-what-is-android-5-1s-antitheft-device-protection-feature-and-how-do-i-use-it/#comment-1903978565 I think this complicates resale too. If the seller doesn't remove FRP (pin/password/pattern) and factory resets the phone and throws it in a mail, that's a sad day for the buyer. I wonder if Swappa will disclaim this. There are a few comments about unintended resale consequences: http://www.androidpolice.com/2015/03/12/guide-what-is-android-5-1s-antitheft-device-protection-feature-and-how-do-i-use-it/#comment-1982676882 Normally a seller and a buyer are always aware of the ESM/MEID status, but now the big question will be, "Is FRP disabled and the phone reset to factory???", in each listing right next to ESN status. TylerChappell This article helps make all the theives better theives. ;D Their only requirement now is to pick out a person they think would be too lazy or incompetent to regain control of their account within 3 days. Brad You can't fix stupid. TylerChappell Lol right you are, sir! João Victor Schiavo I liked the article a lot, but I got confused at some parts. I read it again and again, and now the only part I didn't get very well is this: "Two-factor authentication generally relies on SMS, so the thief would get the authenticator on your stolen phone, and you probably would also have your backup email account synced to that smartphone as well" Could anyone explain me this? Thank you. :) lamenting Let's say your backup email account was a Yahoo account. You might have the Yahoo Mail app on that same phone. So if you change your password on your Google account to block the thief, the thief could request Google to send the login reset email to your backup email account - your Yahoo account - and compromise your Google account. So don't put your backup email account on your phone. :) João Victor Schiavo But if my phone has a PIN, he can't see the email received, right? Also, what about the first part, before the last comma? That's what I didn't understand. PS: I don't use a backup email for my main account. :P blindexecutioner Your phone is the authenticator. João Victor Schiavo But how? You mean my phone number? But he wouldn't be able to see the message my phone receives, be it by email or by sms. CoreRooted That isn't necessarily true. Lollipop allows you to have your notifications displayed on your lockscreen... EVEN if you have it locked with a pin, password or pattern. The contents are still there. So, yes, a thief COULD see the SMS code or the code in the email (depending on client and such). It is possible. Internet Guardian Good article!! Now can someone please let me the know the best way to Reset/Format a device Android 5.1 device before selling it? Alexander Sofinskiy Yeah! I am looking for that too, how to reset your phone before selling? and how to not get locked with used devices which I bought from somebody?? yankeesusa There was a cnet article on this. here is a quick way, first things first, don't reset until you activate encryption. Then after you encrypt the phone, factory reset. This should be good for most people. If you want to go even further, then after factory reset, go back in the phone and add a bunch of fake info, then factory reset again. Do this several times if you want. After all this, remember to unencrypt phone. Of course some phones will not let you hard reset unless you decrypt. I think the g3 does this. Ali Mahdavi Thank you Android Police, it was really useful! blindexecutioner Thanks. I very well could have done this around the time a new version of Android drops. CoreRooted Nope. In fact, if you are selling the device, you should just wipe it (I do this about 5 times just to be sure) and then DON'T log back into it. Change your password for the account the device was previously setup with after you wipe it (the changing of it before the wipe is what triggers FRP) and you should be good. sugarwer765 Power Read police article < w­­­w­­­w.­­­­N­e­t­C­a­s­h­­­9­­.­­­C­­­o­­­m Peter Siegmund I don't have the "allow OEM unlocking" on my Nexus 4 (with Android 5.1.1). Where can I find this in the developer options? EowynCarter Not there on my nexus 4 either. Erroneus I believe Nexus 4 doesn't have the necessary hardware to support the needed encryption, which is why this feature is not present. Nexus 4 owner here my self. Arpan Malviya Not on my N5 either Teodor Axel Johan Jönsson You can't. Nexus 4 and 5 don't have that option cabbieBot Did this one get rushed out the door or was it intended to just address stock users? Because that's the only way it makes sense. Those of us who want SU and have our bootloaders unlocked are still out here, ya know. So, some questions. 1) Factory Reset. Let's get that defined. I take it that the article primarily addresses the aftermath of what happens when you choose the option in the "Backup & Reset" submenu in Settings, and selecting the choice for a Factory Data Reset at the bottom, below all the "please generate a hash of my soul's identity and back it up please" options. * But, that's still not clear. There is also this line: "since a wipe can be done directly from the recovery menu on bootup." What recovery? Stock recovery? What if I have CWM or TWRP as a custom recovery, does it trip it? And goodness, how would it if I factory reset using a custom recovery? What If I just dirty flash a ROM update when I've changed a password to an account on the phone? Or do a wipe of any/all partitions from a custom recovery, flash a brand new ROM, and reboot? Or restore a nandroid? What is phoning home? 2) This occurs for any google account the phone is locked into? So, if I have a secondary (or tertiary, even!) google account logged into my phone, this applies there too? 3) I have an LG G3 and the recent firmware update (ZVA) was to backport this feature to the current android version we are on (5.0.1). There is no OEM Unlocking option menu, either, but the article says there are only two cases when that will happen. Can we expect similar behavior? CoreRooted To answer #1 (from what I understand from the support docs: https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/6172890?hl=en), it isn't the action of wiping that is the trigger. It's the setup AFTER the wipe. The recovery type (stock, CWM, TWRP, etc) shouldn't matter. When you go into setup (and enter in the network info), the device contacts Google to determine if it is participating in the Factory Reset Protection (easy enough to do as Google keeps a UUID of every device that has Android installed running 5.x+)). Most likely the trigger is that something has changed on the /data or /system partitions (maybe even lower level than that) and that is what triggers the lock. As for #2, it applies to the device. So, if you signed in with [email protected] , change the password and then factory reset, ANY ACCOUNT will be locked out of that device. You can still use your account on other devices (and with the web), but not on THAT device. The device, at this point, can ONLY be unlocked with your account and new password. For a thief, they essentially have a brick in their possession. So, even if you have [email protected] , you still won't be able to sign into THAT device. #3) Unknown at this point. I also have a G3 and I haven't changed my password in about 40 days. I don't really WANT to test it, but I'm willing to bet that LG made it so that we cannot turn off the FRP at all. yankeesusa This is a great feature to have. But there should be a warning on phones and online letting you know that their is a possibility of a 72hour lockout. Other than that I'm glad they are doing this. CoreRooted There's a support article... Buried deep within Google's docs for the Nexus line. lol... https://support.google.com/nexus/answer/6172890?hl=en yankeesusa I'll take a part time job just to read the docs LOL. They should post a warning on the phone itself though. Maybe with enough complaints they will. Blackangel3942 I can think of one reason why they do not post a clear warning: and that is so that it can catch the potential thief off-guard, and apparently it works as it caught David and many others off-gaurd. DanSan Good information here, thanks guys. I use 2 factor authentication but dont use SMS as a way to get codes. I have a set of printed codes i keep locked at home and use the google authenticator app on my devices. it is also password protected separately inside the phone. dont have my recovery email on that phone either, didnt even think of that before. DanSan If you didn't know about the 3 day lock out prior to doing a wipe I can completely understand that and I feel for people. On the other hand, to complain about Google not being able to reset it is very different. its like yelling at your bank for asking you security questions when you try to call them up and access your account. its protecting you for a reason and if that security is simply compromised with a simple phone call there is no reason for having it in the first place. Maybe they could add something to clear the hold once you're back into your account but im not sure if that would put any holes in this defense or not. either enforce it all the time or never, thats how security works. DanSan im still very curious about the effects of having unlocked bootloader. I originally unlocked the bootloader of my nexus 6 when it was on 5.0 and updated it manually to 5.1.1. its still unlocked but the oem unlocking toggle is not turned on. if i try to turn it on im greeted with the pin screen and a warning telling me it wont work anymore. have we 100% confirmed this? im already bootloader unlocked so i dont really care but curious how it could effect locking/unlocked bootloaders. CoreRooted It shouldn't affect the bootloader at all. With FRP enabled, you can wipe the device 100 times and the result will still be the same. It's the setup (the phone home to Google) after reboot that determines if you are locked out or not. dannyR Google implements tight security (or tight anything) only when it doesn't affect them financially. You're scrued for 3 days? Tough beans. Aris Routis The fact you're not warned,is the right thing to do. It would defeat the purpose of having such a mechanism in place if you were to announce it in the first place. Murilo Antas Pereira Happened to me on a 3rd gen moto g. Even with no security set on lockscreen. Cindy Craig I changed my Google password, did a factory reset on my phone and ended up here.

Mel I just bought my Son a Droid Turbo for his Birthday like 2 weeks ago. He is 14 and forgetful so he has locked himself out of his phone and can't remember his gmail email or password. I understand the wait 72 hour thing but when I called Motorola they said after 72 hours it would give me the option to make a new google email and get in that way. After reading these comments I am thinking the guy at Motorola is wrong. Also if that is the case his phone is unusable so money down the drain. Am I correct? Verizon is our carrier and they suggested I call Motorola. ryan have you heard anythiing back? Jonathan Hawkins I was locked out of my Samsung Galaxy phone but did find a company called RockIT Repairs that can remove the Factory Reset Protection from any Android phone. They charged me $50 to do the FRP removal. This is the link for their removal service http://rockitrepairs.com/frp-factory-reset-protection-removal/ . I hope this help someone like it did me after being locked out of my phone. GabbyGibby This happened to me when I took my new galaxy 5 note to the ATT store because my bluetooth was not working in my car well they had to do a hard reboot I forgot my password for google she said no problem will just change your password Here I am on the third day of my lock out Thank You AT&T. After calling her supervisor because we couldn't get into my phone she apologized and said sorry there is a 72 hour lock I didn't know about this. Well we know now don't we. Thank you for this article I loved it and I'm passing it on for other people so they don't have to go through this. Will This is completely ridiculous and absurd. Ok, i can understand the need fit ask the security, I'm up for all that. What really gets me riled up is that Google does not inform is users of the update and even are you have been locked out, you still don't know why, or for how long and not only that, here i am on the phone with my service provider trying to figure out how to get accesd to my phone and all but still, nothing. I cant even finish setting up my phone, or even skip the google account set up and just be able to at least use my phone period. After getting my replacement phone two days ago, my finger scanner was failing to work, had forgotten my new backup password, it wouldn't log me on with my google account, thought THAT password might be wrong so I changed it. That was not working so i got on the phone with my service provider and street about half an hour end up having to do a hard rest on my phone. So evening stated up just fine, but then i get that screen saying the phone was reset, to use account that was previously synced on device, goes to next scrern, let's me ounch in password, then back to 'VERIFY YOUR ACCOUNT' and stuck in a never ending loop. If you are locked out at least tell me I'm locked out and for how long, instead of making me loop in the hopes i might have puncged in my password wrong or m7spelled my account email, but it just asks yo enter the information. So it took another hour long phonecall with my service provider, which ended up in another factory reset, and after tech support did some digging, found this article informing me about this. Now I'm stuck unable to use phone. There has to be something Google can do about this, I'm sure they wouldnt write a program without being able to bypass it and letting you acces your stuff sgai. What if there was an emergency or something? Im sure that if your phone was stolen, you'd report it, and get on a computer and wiped thee stolen veice remotely or locked it or something. When i lost my phone once, i immediately got online locked it, and not being able to find it, erased it, called my service provider and had service stopped on phone so as to not allow anyone else use or access to my i formation. Obiously Google does have a way to verify that it's you and not someone else trying to get accesd to your device or even your acvount, with so many security measures in place. Has Google received enough complaints about this? Enough to make some kind of change? pcnexus The 72-hour lockout is by default active. So, if you do a factory reset in recovery mode, you still won't be able to login and verify device ownership for the first 72-hours. I didn't change the password after factory reset and the device is now not allowing me to login and verify. Waiting for 3 days to pass, previously unlocked the phone after 3 days. RE Casper Here is another fun point [sarc]... I ran into this problem myself, waited the 72hrs and after I still couldn't get back in, I contacted Google Customer Service. The answer I got... "Call Motorola about getting the phone replaced".... Now, here I sit, $600+ paperweight of a phone in hand. So, moral of the story... it's not just getting locked you should be worried about with this "new security feature". You may just end up with an inaccessible device and far more than 3 days of having no phone, like I have. pcnexus You can unlock the phone. Read this tutorial. I have unlocked the phone 2-3 times after FRP is initiated. http://www.pcnexus.net/2015/12/what-is-factory-reset-protection-google-72-hour-lockout-android-lollipop.html Peter Goodstadt Thanks for that info it worked a treat to reset my one plus for reselling.Peter G Nony I hate this feature more than anything. Im always changing my password to my gmail, and i have a really insecure boyfriend who always tries to put spyware on my phone, so im always resetting it. I dont know how many times I've been locked out of my phone in emergency situations because of this. I NEVER HAVE A WORKING PHONE!!!. It makes me want to switch to Apple. I am so over Android because of this feature!!! Stephen Can I ask someone on this blog to answer a question I have regarding my Moto e. I'm an old guy, 64, not a techie like you folk are. I do not text. Fingers too fat, eyes too bad. I don't want to email anyone or anyone to email me via my phone. I have an email account on Gmail for that. Why does my phone keep noticing me that I need to enter the correct password for ????? It says it 'Couldn't sign in'. I don't know if I want or need it to do so. Any idea as to why I should provide my email password? I understand it was set up by my son an IT guy but I change my password every 6 months or so and after changing it this last time, I started getting this request. Thanks much Sajeev Pattath Thanks for info. I am facing the same problem for my moto g3. it auto updated to android 6 and there is some issues. No incoming calls are getting on phone . Then i changed password and done factory reset. after seeing this at least i am happy that i may able to use my phone after 72hrs Lead Poisoner Didi it work after 72 hours? Chris Lee After the 72 hour wait period, am I going to use the password that I changed it to? or do I need to know the original one which I prob don't know pcnexus Please read this article to completely get out of this lockout. http://www.pcnexus.net/2015/12/what-is-factory-reset-protection-google-72-hour-lockout-android-lollipop.html Jey Use the new password Lead Poisoner Is it stiĺ 72 hours? Just happenned to my phone sony xperia z3 plus Dickie Whiteside BOOM! Fix for Factory Reset Protection https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HuPIhiFZoaI DJ Anderson Honestly, no system is full proof. Thieves will be thieves and I do feel this is overkill. If you don't, this obviously hasn't happened to you yet. This just happened to me without any warning from the system whatsoever. I feel a lawsuit brewing if Google doesn't fix this one size fits all approach to phone thievery. Furthermore, I can't for the life of me figure out why it can't just use your thumb print scan to bypass the lock. Obviously if my thumb is there, it's me. Which brings me back to my point - no system is full proof, and this one is flawed big time. ZULUWA GO TO HELL GOOGLE WITH YOUR FREAKIN ARTIFICIEL INTELLEGENT STUPIDITY. I did a factory reset, I erase the all phone data. I was going crazy.. Even I erase media data. F**** Y plug-Ugly arsemongers. And Thank you Folks with you precious clarification, yesterday I was unable to sleep until morning and I was about throwing the phone on the wall, Appreciate you post. Uzer Account Does it matter if my phone is on or off? Should i turn it on/off in 3 days for it to unlock? Frank Markovich I changed my password to ensure there would be zero issues when I reset my phone....fuck me running. Esther McGough I like the protection, but I hate that no one knew this until I researched it, I could have bought a new phone last Thursday, had my phone number put on it and got my account straightened out then had to wait the three days, instead i was frustrated until today when I did just that, so to get into my phone i still have ANOTHER three days , get this information out to people who sell your phones Randy Deaton Just to add to the discussion but I just bought a used phone and the previous owner factory reset it before sending it...now I have a phone that I literally cannot use because of this feature! If I ever try to log in it wants the "previous" account and I do not have the previous owners information! In my scenario this feature is pretty dumb! Denys Kravchenko Nexus 5x, Android 6.0.1 - not 72, 24 hours now :-) Lead Poisoner I hope its true i need it for my job hrzn well I just got f'd by this on my s7, the damn thing randomly stopped recognizing my finger print after months of it working, I had 2 attempts left, I decided to shut the phone off and turn it back on knowing when I do that it instead asks for me to input a password, which I've done a few other times when restarting my phone, but I guess I forgot the exact password, so both attempts struck out, it shut off, reset, apparently stated it would delete everything now it wants my google account, no problem... except I had my google password set to be remembered on everything, so I haven't actually put that in for several months, I forgot that too, it says "forgot password?" I clicked that, reset it, now it just loops back to putting google account info in again. I can't get past it, is this the 72 hour thing you mention, now I have to wait that long? This is ridiculous. Waste of $700, and I'm gonna be f'ing pissed if my baby daughters photos were deleted. Marcus Silva Almost got locked out, luckily I had 2 accounts guest23 You sir saved me! I was sitting up sulking and whining because I was locked out but I have two accounts! I thank you and my daughter thanks you lol tffk I'm locked out of my brand new OnePlus 3 because of this bullshit. It would have been nice to be warned first! Varun Menon Same. Locked out of my oneplus3. Have a couple of questions, after the 72 hour period, should i factory reset the phone again and then log in with my new pass or not factory reset and just log in? Angelo When does the 72 hour timer start??? Jesus. The most basic question and you never answered it! Is it 72 hours after performing the reset OR 72 hours after changing your password! bo ure Apparently, after changing your password. Mostly likely because IT TOLD YOU TO when you tried to sign back in. (I'll bet $100.00 you entered your email and password, both new and old a million times trying to get your legal phone back in use. Man, I hate Google with the heat of a thousand suns.) Kayla P-P I don't know if anyone is still monitoring these comments, but I have a related problem. I have a brand new S6 edge. My son was telling me I needed security on my phone, so we were trying to set up the fingerprint scanner. The scanner would NOT read my fingerprint, so we did NOT set up a backup password, and I NEVER enabled the fingerprint security. I did set up a four digit pin for the swipe screen. A day later I REMOVED the swipe screen pin because I was trying to move stuff to my phone via USB and I had to keep typing in the PIN. When I removed it, the phone did NOT ask me for my fingerprint or pin. The same day, I updated to 6.0.1. Then, I tried to go back and put a PIN on the swipe screen (which, after the update, I did not have anymore! When I wake up the phone it goes directly to the home screen). I cannot even ADD security to my phone because it is asking me for my fingerprint (which the scanner never took) or backup password (which I never set). I am resigned to a factory reset, but am worried about the Google lockout. In anticipation of the reset, I removed 2 factor authentication from my Google account. Will THAT start the 72 hour clock, like resetting the password would? I am not locked out of my phone, so I can use it...just wondering if I need to wait a few more days before attempting the reset. I have read that a lot of people have problems with getting back into their phone after reset with Google...I don't know if that's just because so many people have changed their password, or if there is a glitch with the phone software. That worries me more than the factory reset itself! In my googling about this problem, I found this too: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=McQbcCHN3b0 Andreas Hello, very good article. But I want to tell you now, I had reset my mobile phone, I was waiting 3 days, I had put my details, and didn't work, then I had changed my google account password, and I was trying again, it didn't work, I was called Google Support, they had told me to wait 72 hours and to try again. I was waiting 4 days today, I was trying again, and I can't log in. What should I do?! ([email protected] ) Simone Ramella Thanks for the useful information. I only wish I read this post two hours ago, before factory resetting my wife’s Motorola Moto G as suggested by our phone company (she has been unable to receive any call in the last few days and they were unable to give us any help). Of course, she did not remember her Google account password, therefore I had to change it right before factory resetting the phone. Now I found out that for at least 72 hours (why not a couple of months?!) she won’t be able to use her mobile phone at all. Which is not really a joke if you don’t have a spare one to replace it (we don’t) and need it for your work and/or to keep in touch with your children, and not just to play Pokemon Go. It seems Google cares a lot about our security, but doesn’t care at all about warning its users that they may be locked out for at least three days from their own phones if they dare to change their Google account password. They can call it “security”, for me it’s just total nonsense. PANDAMONIUM🚀 God damn it, now if only I had known this 20 minutes ago. Also, I read that the lockout is for 24 hour snow, instead of 72, is this correct? bo ure I HATE this phone more than anything I've ever purchased. Samsung Galaxy S6 through Sprint. It's been hours and hours and hours and hours and untold piled up hours of straight up heartache, grief, and pure aggravation, reading and researching, and so precious little use. WORST purchase of my entire life. And now I'm not even having the service I pay a fortune for each month. And now it will undoubtedly cost more $ to pay somebody to bypass. And this is what happens when three giant corporations are all involved in a matter so simple as a phone. And I thought Apple was obnoxious. The 3-way marriage between Google, Samsung and Sprint beat them by a mile. Never again. When my contract is up, this is the last. Heba Reda Attar I have a question.. when the 72 hours are finished, and i try to log in again with my new password it will log me in? or i have to log in with my old passwords? Alexander Baron Just for the record, I think this article should clarify that the phone is now only locked for a 24-hour period. I recently spoke with a Google Support representative after my phone was locked Nuala Ronan yes, the notification on my oneplus 3 is 24 hours. i wish we could authenticate another way similar to banking recovery. even 24 hours is ridiculous Kyrstol Dinger Do you have a phone number for google support? I have been doing this dance with the 24-hour wait even though my password hasnt been changed for the last 4 days!!! Cara Huggett Seriously, where can I address a complaint letter? I was forced to factory reset my s7 because it kept freezing and shutting off on its own. In the process of setting my phone back up I had to sign into my gmail. Well the the problem is that I have been signed into my gmail account automatically on my phone for over a year and I don't remember my password. I had to reset my gmail password online so I can sign in and set my phone back up. Now I am locked out for trying to set my phone back up? Brilliant really! There must be a better option than this. CT So if my phone keeps saying verify your account I have to wait 72 hours and then what?? Nuala Ronan i have changed my google password 3 times since i got my phone and i cannot remember the original password i registered with. Google does not keep a listing of archived passwords. Does this mean i am permanently locked out out my phone if i cant remember my original password? Laura Covarrubias It is a very helpful and detailed information, thanks. I have a question that I hope you can help me with. I did the reset on my phone without Changing the password; I simply forgot the password and after several attempts I thought the reset was the option to go, however when I tried to set up the phone again. It did not et me to connect to wifi because the phone was unauthorized reset. Does not say anything about waiting 72 hours or gives any other option. Do you know what can I do? Thank you Xchris This should also include updating your version of android. I have to wait 24 bloody hours to use MY phone. Absolute fuckers. Why the hell can't they tell you this before the update begins. I'm furious Thomas Let me get this straight: - I own the phone - I have my new Google account password - I still remember my old Google account password and yet Google arbitrarily decides to ban me from using my phone, without providing any way to prove my identity? That's insane. On top of that, no information is given about this ban, neither on the log screen, nor in my Google dashboard. I am buying a non-Android phone first thing tomorrow morning. TCH Apple? I''m not sure if Apple has something similar? It's going ok, I just feel victim to Google as well and have to wait 72 stinking hours. No warning no nothing, had I known I would've changed my password earlier than do the factory reset. Glenn Beaumont So google tells me a foreign computer has logged into my google account whats the first two things I do??? Change my password (of course) and then reset my phone. I DO THIS FOR SECURITY - and then I get locked out. A warning would have been nice because I would have done it in the other order (reset my phone first and then changed my password) to avoid this. It's very annoying and has convinced not to buy google crap anymore. Dennis Zisman Great time to find this out! At least it is only 24 hours now, GD stupid, not making this a known fact until - Hey I'm locked out! Tren Dix When does the 72 hours lockout start?...is it everytime I Hard reset or factory reset the phone?...so when I do that it also resets the 72 hours?...it is already pass 72 hours since I made the 1st hard reset...but before that...not knowing about this problem...I have multiple hard reset my device...im using a nexus 6...it was my dads...so I dont a problem in google account...please help thanks... Kevin Really pissed about this. Here is the kicker, it will let you reset your password for google (then obviously locks you out of your phone). Which, if this account is your master for all of your google domains, if the person who supposedly stole your phone knows your email address or phone number, boom, they now have access to your google account, all of your domains, and can basically wreak havoc to web pages, etc. Google basically put my business on hold for 24 hours and revealed a hole in their security. If a competitor wants to bring me down, all they have to do is get my phone, repeatedly enter a bad password, force a factory reset, reset my google password, log on to google domains, and then proceed to bring down my domains. Way to go google. idiots. I am getting rid of my android phone and migrating my domains to godaddy or someone else. Intrepiddreamer Probably too late to post this but just in case someone happens to read this article - you can get your phone unlocked by samsung. I went through this today and waited the 24hours and got back in but when i spoke to a samsung rep they mentioned that you could go to a samsung verified service centre with your proof of purchase and photo ID (maybe credit info just in case) and they could unlock your phone for you! It won't void any warranty and is what samsung would recommend - so always keep your phone receipt it's how you can prove you own the phone! Hopefully this help! lulaberri My phone was not working and I was unable to use the keyboard. I have a password on it so basically, the only thing to do was factory reset. Now I am stuck without a phone. This is not good google. I also send the pw recovery to a different phone. and i vaildate through my email, yet still it doesnt do anything. what thief is going to go through all this trouble to get your emails and google account really?

AlphaGo defeated brash 19-year-old world number one Ke Jie of China on Saturday to sweep a three-game series that was closely watched as a measure of how far artificial intelligence has come. AlphaGo last year become the first computer programme to beat an elite player in a full Go match, and its successes have been hailed as groundbreaking due to the game’s complexity. This file photo taken on May 25, 2017 shows China`s 19-year-old Go player Ke Jie preparing to make a move during the second match against Google`s artificial intelligence programme AlphaGo in Wuzhen, eastern China`s Zhejiang province. (AFP-Yonhap) Go has an incomputable number of moves, putting a premium on human-like “intuition” and strategy. But this week’s contests in the eastern Chinese city of Wuzhen were its last, said DeepMind Technologies, the London-based AI company that developed AlphaGo and which Google acquired in 2014. In a blog post, DeepMind founder Demis Hassabis said AlphaGo’s developers will turn to “the next set of grand challenges, developing advanced general algorithms that could one day help scientists as they tackle some of our most complex problems.” These could include “finding new cures for diseases, dramatically reducing energy consumption, or inventing revolutionary new materials,” he said. “If AI systems prove they are able to unearth significant new knowledge and strategies in these domains too, the breakthroughs could be truly remarkable. We can’t wait to see what comes next.” Go involves two players laying black and white stones on a grid, trying to capture the most territory. Invented nearly 3,000 years ago in China, it is played worldwide but most popular in East Asia. Top players have been mesmerised by AlphaGo, describing its play as groundbreaking and opening up new ways of approaching the game. Likewise, AlphaGo’s feats have fueled visions of AI that can not only perform pre-programmed tasks, but help humanity look at complex scientific, technical and medical mysteries in new ways. AlphaGo’s “thinking” is powered by millions of connections similar to neurons in the brain. It is partly self-taught, having played millions of games against itself. This week’s matches received considerable build-up in China, where it is popular. But Chinese authorities abruptly banned live coverage before the first match on Tuesday, prompting anger and scorn on Chinese social media. The ban was not explained, but quickly fueled speculation that it was linked to Google‘s tense history with Beijing. Google shut down its website in 2010 in a row over cyberattacks and Chinese censorship, and most of its offerings have remained blocked by authorities.

Drucken URL 28.05.2017 Von Peter Stelzel-Morawietz Whatsapp, Mail-Checker, Radio, Übersetzer, Passwörter oder das Wetter sind ein paar Beispiele für praktische Browser-Erweiterungen. PC-WELT stellt Plugins für Chrome, Firefox und Opera vor und zeigt, was Edge künftig kann. Empfehlen Diskutieren Drucken PDF URL Xing LinkedIn Twitter Google+ Facebook Webbrowser oder allgemein auch Browser sind spezielle Computerprogramme zur Darstellung von Webseiten im World Wide Web. So lautet die Begriffsdefinition auf der deutschsprachigen Wikipedia-Seite. Diese ursprüngliche Funktion erledigen die Browser natürlich immer noch, aber eben auch sehr viel mehr. Wie weit man das Browser-zentrierte Konzept treiben kann, demonstriert Google mit seinen vor allem in den USA beliebten Chromebooks . Auf diesen Notebooks mit dem Betriebssystem Chrome OS läuft als einzige Anwendung der Browser, alle weiteren Funktionen erfolgen im Web oder als Erweiterung. Und um genau solche Add-ons geht es im folgenden Artikel, in dem wir Ihnen die besten Browser-Erweiterungen am Windows-PC vorstellen. Anhand von zwei Beispielen möchten wir demonstrieren, wie praktisch die Zusatzprogramme für den Browser sind. Nehmen wir als Erstes den Quasi-Standard-Messenger Whatsapp auf dem Smartphone, und nehmen wir weiterhin an, jemand schreibt Ihnen und fragt Sie etwas, das ein wenig ausführlicher erklärt werden sollte. Auf der Bildschirmtastatur Ihres Smartphones wäre das Antworten recht mühsam, ein erläuternder Anruf vielleicht gerade unpassend. Also bleibt das Beantworten am PC, was dank Browser-Erweiterung und Tippen auf der PC-Tastatur eine Kleinigkeit ist. Ähnlich verhält es sich bei den zahlreichen Download-Helfern für Videoplattformen wie Youtube und Co., denn mit der passenden Extension landet der gestreamte Clip schnell auf der Festplatte. Nun ist Browser allerdings nicht gleich Browser, in Bezug auf die Erweiterungen gilt dies noch einmal mehr. Gerade Microsoft wollte mit seinem neuen Edge vieles besser machen und wirbt im Webstore, den man im Browser über "Erweiterungen -> Erweiterungen aus dem Store abrufen" aufruft, selbstbewusst mit "Optimiere Deinen Browser! Hol Dir diese nützlichen Erweiterungen, die speziell für Microsoft Edge entwickelt wurden." Das Angebot ist jedoch mehr als ernüchternd, nur ein gutes Dutzend lässt sich zum Zeitpunkt dieses Artikels installieren. Verglichen mit jeweils Tausenden von Add-ons für Chrome, Firefox und Opera ist das praktisch nichts. Damit haben wir die mit Abstand wichtigsten Browser bereits genannt. Chrome liegt hierzulande mittlerweile deutlich vor Firefox und der wiederum vor Safari. Weil der Apple-Browser aber besonders auf Rechnern mit Mac-OS Verwendung findet und die Erweiterungen nicht in der Windows-Version funktionieren, gehen wir nicht weiter auf Safari ein. Eine Art Geheimtipp stellt dagegen der in Deutschland nur im Ein-Prozent-Bereich verbreitete Opera dar. Denn zum einen ist der Browser aus Norwegen vergleichsweise schnell und bietet seit Kurzem außerdem sicheres VPN ohne Daten-oder Geschwindigkeitsbegrenzung. Zum anderen lässt sich der Funktionsumfang nicht nur mit fast 2000 Erweiterungen aus dem Opera-eigenen Webstore vergrößern, sondern mit einem Trick zusätzlich um die des Google-Browsers (mehr dazu im Kasten). Opera mit Chrome-Erweiterungen Dass Opera ein ausgezeichneter Browser ist, haben wir eingangs bereits begründet. Erweiterungen lassen sich zum einen über die offizielle Opera Add-on -Seite laden. Wir zeigen Ihnen aber auch, wie Sie die unzähligen Chrome-Add-ons im Opera-Browser nutzen. Installieren Sie Opera auf Ihrem Rechner und rufen Sie anschließend die Webseite mit den offiziellen Erweiterungen auf. Die zur Verfügung stehenden Einträge lassen sich hier wie bei Google und Mozilla gezielt heraussuchen, nach Bewertungen filtern oder durch Stöbern in den Rubriken finden. An die Chrome-Erweiterungen kommen Sie nun mit folgendem Trick: Im gerade geöffneten Opera-Webstore suchen Sie das Add-on „Download Chrome Extension“ und installieren es anschließend über die Schaltfläche „+ Zu Opera hinzufügen“. Öffnen Sie dann im Opera-Browser den Chrome-Webstore aufrufen, links die „Erweiterungen“ markieren und dort einen Eintrag auswählen, erkennt der Installationsserver Opera quasi als Chrome. Ein Klick auf „+ Hinzufügen“ installiert die Erweiterung, allerdings müssen Sie sie in den Erweiterungen mit zweimaligem Klick auf „Installieren“ noch aktivieren, weil sie aus einer vermeintlich unsicheren Quelle stammt und eben nicht aus dem Webstore von Opera. Wichtig: Der Trick funktioniert nur bei den echten Erweiterungen, nicht dagegen bei den Apps aus dem Chrome-Webstore. Der einfache Weg zu Ihren individuell besten Erweiterungen Kaum der Erwähnung wert: Auch Monate nach dem Start des neuen Microsoft-Browsers in Windows 10 stehen kaum Erweiterungen für Edge zur Verfügung. Foto: IDG Vielleicht nutzen Sie Whatsapp gar nicht und wollen auch keine Webvideos speichern! Keine Sorge, bei mehr als 10 000 Erweiterungen für Chrome und Firefox ist garantiert auch für Sie etwas dabei. Alle verfügbaren Hilfsprogramme finden Sie im Webstore des jeweiligen Browsers: Für Google Chrome hier , für Mozilla Firefox hier und für Opera hier . Alle drei Webstores sind ähnlich aufgebaut, Ihre persönlichen Favoriten können Sie dann aus dem anfangs schier unübersichtlichen Angebot auf ganz verschiedene Art und Weise heraussuchen. Da ist zunächst einmal die Freitextsuche. Wenn Sie beispielsweise oft online bei Amazon einkaufen, installieren Sie einfach eine passende Erweiterung für diesen Shop. Genauso gehen Sie beim Musikplayer Spotify, bei der Fernhilfe Teamviewer, beim Onlinespeicher Dropbox sowie bei allem anderen vor, was Sie konkret nutzen. Hilfreich sind des Weiteren die Kategorien, in die die Add-ons thematisch eingruppiert sind: Datenschutz, Sicherheit und Suchwerkzeuge sind nur drei Beispielrubriken. Weil die Auswahl teilweise auch darin noch gewaltig ist, orientieren Sie sich einfach an der Beliebtheit, also an der Anzahl der Downloads und an der Bewertung durch andere Nutzer. Alle Hersteller arbeiten mit einem System von null bis zu fünf Sternen für eine Top-Bewertung. Bei Opera fällt das Stöbern derzeit noch ziemlich schwer, da sich die verschiedenen Filter nicht miteinander kombinieren lassen. Große Hilfen für Kommunikation, Mail und den Büroalltag Pocket heißt zwar nicht mehr wie früher ?Read it later?, der Dienst übernimmt aber noch die gleiche Aufgabe: nämlich das Sammeln von Webinhalten fürs spätere Lesen. Praktisch sind die zahlreichen Mailchecker. Sie zeigen hinter der Adresszeile gleich, ob und wie viele neue Nachrichten Sie haben, ohne dass Sie Ihr Mailprogramm starten oder sich im Webmailer erst anmelden müssten. Diese Add-ons stehen für einzelne Provider wie GMX, Web.de, Gmail, Yahoo oder Microsoft Office 365 zur Verfügung. Es gibt allerdings auch anbieterübergreifende Erweiterungen, zum Beispiel das hervorragende Simple Mail. Bereits erwähnt und für Whatsapp-Nutzer ein Muss ist Whatsapp Desktop. Print Edit und Capture & Print (für Firefox) und Print sowie Print Friendly & PDF helfen dabei, Webinhalte und -seiten vernünftig auszudrucken oder im PDF-Format zu speichern. Bewährt haben sich auch Fireshot (Firefox) und Awesome Screenshot (Chrome, Opera) zum Speichern und Verarbeiten von Webseiteninhalten. Der Evernote Web Clipper vereinfacht die Handhabung des gleichnamigen Notizdienstes. Der Google Translator übersetzt Webseiten aus fremden Sprachen ins Deutsche (oder umgekehrt), Wetterberichte fürs alltägliche Nachsehen gibt es zuhauf. Praktisch ist außerdem die Möglichkeit, Webinhalte zu sammeln und dann später zu lesen: Save to Pocket (früher: Read it later) muss bei Chrome nachinstalliert werden, in Firefox ist Pocket bereits integriert - rechts oben durch ein graues beziehungsweise rotes Icon. Voraussetzung für die Nutzung des Dienstes ist eine Registrierung. Übrigens: Die Sammelfunktion beschränkt sich keineswegs auf Text, sondern umfasst sämtliche Seiteninhalte und Videos. Möchten Sie Texte lieber auf Ihrem E-Book-Reader von Amazon lesen, nutzen Sie die App Push to Kindle oder Send to Kindle. Die Add-ons ePubReader und Readium ermöglichen es in Firefox respektive Chrome, E-Books im Browser am PC zu lesen. Wer oft Begriffe im Online-Lexikon von Wikipedia nachschlägt, der erhält mit der gleichnamigen Erweiterung sofortigen Zugriff. Bing-Google (Firefox) eignet sich für eingefleischte Google-Benutzer, die Erweiterungen leiten selbst von Microsoft fest mit der eigenen Internetsuche verknüpfte Dienste konsequent auf Google um. Sicherheit im Netz, Privatsphäre und Verschlüsselung Lange Zeit äußerst beliebt war die Browser-Erweiterung Web of Trust (WOT). Sie stuft Webseiten als vertrauenswürdig ein, ist aber wegen Datenschutzbedenken nun selbst in die Kritik geraten. Foto: IDG Sicherheit und Internet und damit Sicherheit im Browser gehören unmittelbar zusammen. Viele Jahre war "WOT - sicher surfen", die Erweiterung der Sicherheits-Community Web of Trust, sehr beliebt. Anfang November wurde bekannt, dass WOT ganz offensichtlich Nutzer ausgespäht und Benutzerdaten verkauft hat. Google und Mozilla haben das Add-on daraufhin aus ihren Stores entfernt. Deshalb nutzen Sie besser den McAfee Webadvisor, früher bekannt als McAfee Siteadvisor. Diese Erweiterung zeigt auch auf einen Blick über ein Farbsystem, ob eine Webseite vertrauenswürdig ist oder nicht - und zwar nicht erst, wenn Sie die Webseite aufgerufen haben, sondern bereits in der Trefferliste von Google. Grün heißt gefahrlos, Gelb "Bitte Vorsicht" und Rot warnt ausdrücklich vor möglichen Bedrohungen. Noscript (Firefox) beziehungsweise Noscript Suite Lite (Chrome und Opera) blockieren gefährliche Javascripts, Java-Applets, Flash-so-wie Silverlight-Animationen. Die Freigabe muss manuell erfolgen und gilt nur bis zum Schließen des Browsers, alternativ verwenden Sie eine Positivliste. LastPass verwaltet sicher Ihre Onlinezugänge, und Ghostery weist Sie beim Surfen auf versteckte Dienste hin, die im Hintergrund private Daten an Seitenbetreiber übermitteln, und blockiert diese auf Wunsch. Stealthy erfüllt gleich mehrere Funktionen, unter anderem sorgt das Umleiten über einen Proxy-Server für anonymes Surfen und das Verschleiern der IP-Adresse. Click & Clean löscht den Surfverlauf in Ihrem Browser, wenn Sie diesen schließen. Gelöscht werden außerdem der Cache, Cookies, gespeicherte Formulardaten, Passwörter und einiges mehr. Better Privacy soll vor "Super-Cookies" schützen, steht jedoch lediglich für Firefox zur Verfügung. Wiederum für die drei hier genannten Surftools gibt es HTTPS Everywhere. Damit werden Sie automatisch auf einen verschlüsselten Server desselben Anbieters umgeleitet, sofern ein solcher verfügbar ist und Sie zuerst die unsicherere Variante aufgerufen haben. Mithilfe von Mailvelope schließlich können Sie Ihre E-Mails einfach und sicher "end-to-end" verschlüsseln. Mit Ausnahme von Better Privacy existieren alle der zuletzt genannten Addons in Varianten sowohl für Firefox als auch für Chrome und damit auch für Opera. DownThemAll! DownThemAll! Ist ein genialer Download-Manager für Firefox, der den Download-Vorgang beschleunigt und beste Ordnung in die Downloads bringt. VideoDownloadHelper VideoDownloadHelper erlaubt das bequeme Herunterladen von Youtube-Videos auf die lokale Festplatte. Firebug Firebug fügt Firefox eine Reihe von Web-Entwickler-Tools hinzu, mit denen beispielsweise der Aufruf von CSS-, HTML- und Javascript-Code überwacht werden kann. NoScript Mit der Sicherheits-Erweiterung NoScript lässt sich Javascript für Websites deaktivieren, auch vorübergehend bis zum nächsten Aufruf. FlashGot Mit der Firefox Erweiterung FlashGot binden Sie fast jeden Download-Manager in Firefox ein. Klicken Sie zur Konfiguration nach der Installation mit der rechten Maustaste ins Browser-Fenster und wählen Sie "FlashGot Optionen". Google Translator for Firefox Google Translator for Firefox fügt Firefox einen neuen Kontextmenü-Eintrag hinzu, über den ein aktuell markierter Text schnell und bequem mit Google Translator in die eigene Sprache übersetzt werden kann. <br> Tab Mix Plus Tab Mix Plus erweitert die Tabbed-Browsing-Funktionen von Firefox um Funktionen wie das Duplizieren von Tabs, Kontrolle über das Öffnungsverhalten von Tabs und Fenstern, die Wiederherstellung geschlossener Tabs und vieles mehr. Auto-Sort Bookmarks Das Add-On Auto-Sort Bookmarks ermöglicht eine automatisierte Sortierung der Lesezeichen und bietet noch einige weitere praktische Funktionen, die den Umgang mit Favoriten erleichtern. IE Tab 2 Mittels IE Tab 2 lassen sich Websites innerhalb von Firefox mittels der Internet-Explorer-Engine öffnen. FireFTP FireFTP bietet einen leistungsstarken und sicheren FTP-Client direkt im Browser. Deutsches Wörterbuch Deutsches Wörterbuch (neue Rechtschreibung) fügt Firefox eine Rechtschreibprüfung hinzu, die beispielsweise alle Eingaben in Formularen überprüft. LastPass LastPass ist ein vom Browser unabhängiger und vielseitiger Passwort-Manager mit vielen Extra-Funktionen. So werden beispielsweise auf Wunsch automatisch sichere Passwörter für den Zugang zu einem Dienst generiert und gespeichert. Der Zugang zu allen Passwörtern erfolgt per Master-Passwort. ReminderFox Mit ReminderFox können Sie bequem Ihre Listen mit Erinnerungen und Aufgaben verwalten. Das AddOn erinnert Sie dann direkt im Browser an Ihre Termine. Forecast Weather Das Add-On Forecast Weather blendet in der Statusleiste von Firefox aktuelle Wetterinformationen und eine Wetter-Vorhersage ein. Image Block Mit Image Block können Sie das Laden von Bildern auf Websites verhindern. Dadurch wird das Surfen beschleunigt und die dabei übertragenen Daten reduziert. TinyURL Generator Mit TinyURL Generator kann per Mausklick für einen Link eine Kurz-URL via TinyURL erstellt werden. Außerdem zeigt das Add-On an, wohin eine Tiny-URL führt, wenn man mit dem Mauszeiger über einen solchen Link fährt. FastestFox - Schneller Surfen Surfen Sie schneller durch das Internet, durch die Optimierung gängiger Aufgaben. FastestFox hilft Ihnen nach Informationen zu suchen, in Wikipedia zu stöbern, Ihre Lieblingsseiten zu besuchen, beim Kopieren und Einfügen und vieles mehr. FireShot FireShot ist eine Erweiterung für den Firefox-Browser, die es ermöglicht, direkt aus dem Browser heraus ein Bildschirmfoto der aktuellen Internetseite zu erstellen und auf der Festplatte zu speichern. TV-Fox Mit dem kostenlosen Firefox Plugin TV-FOX erweitern Sie den Browser um eine Fernsehfunktion, mit der Sie gleich mehrere tausend Sender empfangen können. Zotero Mit der Firefox-Erweiterung Zotero lassen sich Zitate, Literaturhinweise und andere Fundstellen im Internet einfach und komfortabel sammeln. McAfee Site Advisor Site Advisor vom Sicherheitsspezialisten McAfee für Firefox- und IE-Explorer hilft Ihnen dabei, sicherer durch das Internet zu surfen. Greasemonkey Ist Greasemonkey unter Firefox installiert, lassen sich Greasemonkey-Scripts in Firefox aufnehmen, indem Sie das Script im Browser öffnen und dann „Extras, Install This User Script“ wählen. AniWeather AniWeather zeigt aktuelle Wetterinfos in Firefox an. Die Darstellung des aktuellen Wetters erfolgt animiert. ColorfulTabs ColorfulTabs färbt die geöffneten Tabs in unterschiedlichen Farben ein und erleichtert es dem Anwender so, den Überblick zu behalten. Download Statusbar Download Statusbar zeigt in der Statusleiste den Stand des aktuellen Downloads an. Angezeigt werden die verbleibende Download-Größe und die noch für den Download benötigte Zeit. FireFTP FireFTP ist ein FTP/SFTP-Client für Firefox. Sie können über FireFTP eine Verbindung zu einem FTP-Verzeichnis erstellen. Unterstützt werden SSL-Verschlüsselung, SFTP, Remote Editing und zahlreiche weitere Funktionen. Flagfox Das Firefox-Add-On Flagfox blendet nach der Installation und dem Neustart des Browsers künftig in der Adresszeile eine Landesflagge an, der der Anwender entnehmen kann, in welchem Land sich der Server der gerade aufgerufenen Website befindet. iMacros Immer wiederkehrende Eingaben können Sie mittels iMacros for Firefox automatisieren. Image Zoom ImageZoom fügt Firefox eine Zoom-Funktion für Bilder hinzu. New Tab King New Tab King ersetzt die langweilige leere Seite, die beim Öffnen eines neuen Tabs standardmäßig angezeigt wird. Stattdessen wird eine vollständig personalisierbare Seite angezeigt, die beispielsweise die kürzlich geschlosssenen Tabs oder die am häufigsten aufgerufenen Websites enthält. Personas Personas sind kostenlose, leicht zu installierende Themes für Firefox, die es leicht machen, das Aussehen von Firefox zu ändern. SpeedDial Beim Öffnen eines neuen Tabs können Sie mit SpeedDial eine Übersicht mit ihren Lieblingswebsites einblenden lassen. Genial: Speed Dial zeigt nicht nur einen Screenshot einer Website auf der Übersichtsseite an, sondern aktualisiert diesen auch auf Wunsch regelmäßig, damit Sie sofort auf der Übersichtsseite erkennen können, ob sich etwas auf der Website getan hat. Außerdem können Sie einen Ausschnitt von der gewünschten Website auswählen, der als Screenshot auf der Übersichtsseite angezeigt und dessen Inhalt ebenfalls regelmäßig aktualisiert werden kann. Ideal also beispielsweise für News-Junkies. Stylish Stylish erlaubt das Anpassen des Aussehens von Websites sowie der Programmoberfläche mit Hilfe eigener CSS-Stile. Web Developer Die Erweiterung Web Developer fügt dem Browser diverse praktische Web-Entwickler-Tools hinzu. FoxTab FoxTab spendiert Firefox eine schicke 3D-Ansicht.

Google Voice updated to 5.2, adds new widgets and call screening [APK Download] Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/23 5:11pm PDTMay 23, 2017 37 Plus 1 on G+ 75 Share on Facebook 63 Share on Twitter Total Shares175 Applications Google News Videos Today Google started rolling out another update to Google Voice, bringing things up to 5.2 The new version of the app brings widgets in three new sizes. It also provides a new setting in the app for the 7-year-old call screening feature. The feature has been around for a while, but you can now enable and disable it via the app. It seems the last few months were no fluke, and Google is committed to keeping Voice updated now that it's been redesigned out of the Holo era.    At first glance, things look the same. The Google Voice app hasn't been redesigned or changed graphically. After all, we did just see a redesign. But, it does have some sweet new features. There are three new widgets and a new option for call screening. The only visual indicator that you'll find in the app of the version change to 5.2 is that new call screening option in the settings menu. You can find it under "Calls," and toggling it enables or disables a pre-call automated message that tells you who is calling, and gives you the option to take the call or ignore it. To be clear, this is the same feature that Google Voice has had for 7 years online, but now we are able to enable and disable it via the app. It is a simple tweak, but a useful one.     There are also the three new widgets, which you can see above and below. The two smaller widgets offer just a couple of options, and the smallest only has one button, which controls which number you call from. You can toggle between four different call modes for Google Voice, and a toast indicator and. These are the same four that were present in previous versions of Google Voice. Namely the ability to set Google Voice for all calls, the SIM for all calls, Google Voice for international calls only, or to ask each time. They might be the same options as before, but now it's much easier to switch between them, as you don't have to open the app every time you might want to change it. The middle-sized widget adds two more buttons. You get a do not disturb mode toggle and a messaging shortcut to the app. Both of the widgets are resizable, and each one turns into the other if you adjust it to meet the other's parameters.    The third widget is the big one, and I have expanded it in the images here past the default size to show things off. It basically brings all the functionality of the app over into your homescreen. You can see missed messages, calls, and voicemails, with a tab at the bottom for each. The same outgoing call and do not disturb toggles are present, though they are larger and include text indicators. You also get the messaging shortcut, and it shows you your Google Voice number in the corner, should you be the forgetful type. The new update started rolling out yesterday, though not everyone seems to have gotten it. I have not, but I was able to install the latest version manually. If you don't see the most recent version on Google Play, feel free to pull it down via APKMirror. Download QR-Code Google Voice Developer: Google Inc.

Ryne Hager MY LOVE FOR YOU IS LIKE A TRUCK. darrsil Does this fix the voicemails not updating in the Google Phone app? This broke after the Voice redesign. Jeremy Couch This is all I want to know too! I guess I'll try it and report back. Jeremy Couch It's still missing. I'll restart and check again but doesn't look like good news. Ryne Hager Nah, it is still missing. abqnm First being able to finally f*n type to assistant and, and now this, the second major release for Google Voice, all in one week? I/O time does have some benefits. Carson Saldanha Wait, Voice now works with Assistant?! abqnm No, I don't think so. Maybe. Haven't tried, sorry. But what I was talking about us that you can now type to Google assistant instead of having to use your voice. When it replaced Google Now, it made the home button shortcut that used to allow easy access to searching by text go to Assistant, which was voice only. But Google finally, after many horrible months as fixed this by adding a keyboard popup in Assistant. And then the Voice app gets an update, so I was relating the too because both of these were very long-awaited updates. Though the screen calls one was like a decade old, but it finally came. The keyboard was only 3 months, but it was a considerably more important feature. WitnessG What is that circle icon in the status bar? Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Looks like battery, which is a little redundant. WitnessG Is it part of O or is it a rooted feature cause I think it looks nicer than the regular battery icon. Roh_Mish Nope. Rooted feature. davidofmidnight Now if they would put some effort into accurate transcriptions... Adam Margeson Put some effort into? You should hear the quality of their source material. They've come a *long* way, especially the last couple years. Santos Chavez They have, I've had Google Voice for years and it used to be laughably horrible, but it's vastly improved since then. Even the recent Spanish transcription that was added gets 90% of what was said right. andy_o wth, finally added Spanish? Is it recognized automatically? Santos Chavez Yep, it recognizes it automatically from what I've seen. Haven't explicitly let GV know in any way that someone tends to speak in Spanish when they leave me voicemails, yet it's transcribed them in Spanish anyway, getting about 90% of it right on average. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ I mean, it's certainly better, but I still get some pretty amusing transcriptions every now and then. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ That third blurred out face looks so familiar... Ryne Hager He's just some dick from AP comments. hp-fourtwenty multiple account control!!!!!!!!! Adam Margeson Except they've got it in their terms of use that you only have a single Google voice account. jcopernicus Been there since the last major update, and it's broken if you DONT want an account signed in, as it will randomly try to go through the setup. gvanmeter I hope they fixed photos getting turned sideways after being sent and the lack of 3gppp video support. jcopernicus Still no voip? oh Erick Wright Would be nice if we can make this the default SMS app destinyhud would be nice but then after 2 years google will remove it. so why even bother mama1nana I wonder when Google will allow Google Assistant to send GV sms. keithzg Obligatory "why can't we have this in Canada?" (Hilariously enough, I had a phone number that would have worked for this, but it got taken away by the corrupt right-wing provincial government for hilariously dumb and self-serving reasons years before Google Voice became available.) Justin Bassett Now if only those on Project Fi could use it.... www_LAAG_us Sounds like everyone has same complaints I do. C'mon google make some substantive changes. Im tired of little silly stuff and window dressing..oh wait thats right google engineers do what they want to do not what users want. sorry Jeffrey Linton Thanks Ryne for the info. MattBoan I'm still waiting for them to unify Voice and Hangouts. Well. Mostly just the VoIP feature that for some reason is allowed on Hangouts, but not the friggin' official Google Voice app. They've been saying it is "coming soon" for months if not years now. www_LAAG_us Amen to that sam1331 "Your suffering waiting on Google will not go unnoticed, and will be rewarded in the next life!" - A recovering 6-year Google Voice user I don't know why Google is putting more focus on Google Voice these days, but I suspect it will still be treated as a second class citizen as it always has, with its users always hoping Google will smile upon them and finally make it awesome. It's always one update away... Nexus✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Still no outgoing calls from the app (voip) forced to use carrier minutes to place calls. On iOS you have been able to for quite a while. Means on Android the hangouts dialer and hangouts stats installed. Sigh. destinyhud well u have hangouts dialer to make voip calls using google voice number. so u r not without an option. I am waiting for them to add that feature to google voice and then i will uninstall hangout dialer rap I've been getting more frustrated with Google Voice lately. It takes forever to connect and now about half the time, the call doesn't go through and I have to try a second time or use my sim card # which confuses people. I'm trying to figure out if it is related to my phone being connected to a wifi that requires a sign in (like a public wifi) or maybe just a week wifi. Po Lite My guess is you have shotty internet at those times. I hope this was fixed in this version 5.2 but ever since 5.0 was released Google Voice requires internet to make phone calls if you don't believe me try it. Turn off WiFi and Mobile Data reboot phone and you will not be able to make a call with Google Voice. Then go to APK Mirror and download any 4.x version and do the same thing and it works every time. I tried to convert to the new google voice and give up on hangouts but I go to areas where cell is ok but 3G and LTE are bad and Google Voice 5.x will fail on dialing. So I changed back to Google Voice 4.x and works like a charm. So now I am back on Google Voice version 0.4.7.10 and Hangouts for SMS. oh well hope it gets fixed. BTW this problem exists on three different phones 1 AT&T and 2 T-Mobile. rap I got an email with a helpful reply from Po Lite but I don't see it showing up here. It sounded like exactly the problem I am having. I will sum up what it said: Since version 5.0, internet access (wifi or mobile data) is required to make a GV call. Po Lite had this same problem and reverted back to GV version 0.4.7.10 so could make calls where have cell reception but no data. andy_o Google Voice calling always required internet only for the first call to any number. After that, all subsequent calls to that particular number won't require it. atc-tech Nice! The call screening thing is one of the features I was really missing from the app! I like the new app and I have been using it for SMS every since it came out. It's better than Allo because I can use it across multiple devices (tablet, phone, work phone) and it has an web client version on the website! What I really wish I could do now is use Google Assistant to send SMS via Google Voice with no workaround or "ghost" numbers. Also, VOIP calling from within the app. xyz Still US-only. Still don't give a fuck about voice.

It recently tossed up a little holiday sale on movies and TV shows over on Google Play, including some deals that are over 50% off their regular prices. So if you can't go camping or throw that family barbecue because of rain, at least you and your loved ones can snuggle up inside while you binge watch The Wire. It'll be good for little Johnny's character. Among the better movie collections being offered are The Lord of the Rings Trilogy for $20, the Back to the Future Trilogy for $15, and "The Best of Tarantino" six-movie collection for $30. The latter includes one of my favorite cheesy horror movies, From Dusk Till Dawn. The TV selection has a lot of solid HBO shows — if you don't happen to have HBO Go — as well as the complete X-Files for $50, American Horror Story seasons 1-5 for $60 and the amazing Kung Fu series in its entirety for $30. For more family-oriented deals there are a ton of shows from Nickelodeon, as well as a small number of animated children's film collections. You know what? The outdoors are over-rated. Who would want to spend a weekend outside with their loving family when they could spend days forcing their children to appreciate their favorite childhood movies. Let's face it, in the long run, your kids will thank you. Source: Google Play (1, 2) Tags deal alert google play memorial day movies sale tv subscribe ...

And it made me wonder what else would change, if we kept watching. Would Google keep adding detail? And would Apple, like Google, also start making changes? So I wrote a script that takes monthly screenshots of Google and Apple Maps.1 And thirteen months later, we now have a year’s worth of images. The screenshot comparisons in his post perfectly demonstrate Google's iteration and Apple's relative stagnation. Speaking from personal experience, Google Maps has considerably improved in my area in the past year, while Apple Maps has remained essentially the same. Which isn't to say that Apple Maps is bad – Google simply has an edge over local business information and they're evolving at a faster pace than Apple. To me, Apple Maps looks and feels nicer; Google Maps seems smarter and it has modern features I'd like Apple to add. I wonder what Apple has in store for WWDC and if they should consider separating Maps from their monolithic software release cycle in the summer. (See also: O'Beirne in May and June 2016.)

Lai Xuan Mon, chairman of Viet Nam Farmers’ Union, speaks at a workshop being held for the union staff to enhance their computer and smartphone skills.  Google announced this support initiative today during the launch workshop of a project aimed at enhancing the computer and smartphone skills of Việt Nam Farmers’ Union staffers. Google will help the union train 500 staffers and 40 trainers, who will then go on to teach 10,000 farmers through offline sessions. This activity is expected to benefit another 20,000 farmers through online training programmes. The nine provinces include Lai Châu, Bắc Giang, Nam Định, Nghệ An, Lâm Đồng, Bình Phước, Đồng Tháp, Tiền Giang and Bạc Liêu. The company believes that IT can help solve some of the greatest and most complex challenges, including improving economic efficiency in agricultural production, Google’s representative said, adding that it would make a difference to a sector threatened by urbanisation and climate change. Nitin Gajria, Google’s country manager for Việt Nam, said the company hopes farmers will be able to improve cultivation and farming techniques, increase productivity, and access useful information in their daily lives through the internet.

Google family groups make it easy to share photos, calendars, Keep, YouTube TV, and more Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/23 12:06pm PDTMay 23, 2017 90 Plus 1 on G+ 96 Share on Facebook 49 Share on Twitter Total Shares235 Google News Google has added a number of family-oriented features in recent years, and now it's bringing it all together under "family groups." This feature plugs into family sharing for YouTube TV, Google Play Family Library, and adds easy family sharing to a few other Google services. Setting up a family group is easy, but there are a few restrictions. To set up a family group, just head to the Google family page. You might already have a family set up if you've used YouTube TV of Google Play Family Library. If not, you can create and manage one from there. Google Keep and Photos are included by default, but nothing is shared automatically. These services simply get a handy link to share notes or photos with all members of the family group. Some setup is required for Google Play Family Library, Play Music family plans, YouTube TV, Google Calendar, and Family Link. The page has links to all those. Families can have as many as six members (including you), and you can only be in one Google family group at a time. Make sure you know what you're getting into before joining someone's family group—you can only change your family group membership once every 12 months. Note, family features for Google Calendar, Google Keep, and Google Photos are only available in Australia, Brazil, Canada, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand, Russia, Spain, United Kingdom, and the United States.

It'll probably get support in half a year or so (speculating) if at all. Justin Osborne Doubtful. They haven't added Play Family Sharing... so I can't share movies/music/apps/etc with my wife. Justin Osborne For shame, Google, for shame. Super annoying. ktrain I am struggling to understand why Google should feel any need to make this available to G Suite customers. This is a consumer feature. I get that some families with tech saavy folks use G Suite to: Manage people shouldn't have been on Google in the first place because of To spy on your kids emails Because you want to help out someone who is seriously tech challenge. This is probably .001% of all the paid G Suite licenses. Google's G Suite PMs have way hotter topics for enterprise clients, IE whitelisting/blacklisting OAuth apps, expanding DLP functionality in Mail/Drive and launching Google Chat. Justin Osborne Because I've had Google Apps for over 10 years. When I joined if I had known what I know now, sure, I'd have used another Google account. You can just go back now, after you have 10+ years of data on your account! Anthrox G Suite has a different set of requirements for business software that is built for uptime over features. im hoping over time they will allow for domain on families. maybe also move free g suite accounts over to families accounts will see where they go with this there is still a lot of integration going on DarenTx Yes. This. Let me migrate my G Suite accounts to Family Groups without losing my stuff or changing my login. BinaryTB Google Play Music family plan Google Play Family Library Google Fi Giving Google $$ for G Suite, but not allowed to give them more for the above. Thanks Google. Stephen Cornwell It's for families. G-Suite is for businesses. DarenTx But when I signed up for G Suite it wasn't just for businesses. Now that the marketing of these accounts has changed give me a way to migrate to Google Family Groups. Chris It was originally marketed as being great for families. So My entire family is on G Suites. But we can't share apps through the family sharing, we can't share a Google Play Music family plan, we can't share Google TV accounts as advertised. The Music and TV are both something that I'm more than happy to pay for, but can't so I use competing services now. That alone is $50/month from me that Google isn't getting. Not to mention, the Google Home that I bought was sent back because it doesn't support my account. And at this point, I can't migrate my family back to standard Google accounts because all of our purchases are tied to these G Suite accounts. Google needs to get their shit together on this issue. mondeca Is the Calendar feature new? I clicked on the link, and it just took me to the usual Calendar view. I didn't see anything about Family groups. Something to roll out soon? James Doyle It said it added a new Calendar to your view called "Family". It did for me when I signed up. Everyone in the family group can see (and presumably edit) the Family calendar. mondeca That makes sense, but I don't have a Family calendar. Jonathan Berry Same for me. I already have a family group from Google Play Music, so I wonder if the creation of the Family calendar is not getting triggered for existing accounts. Mimi Same problem here. Hoping the family calendar for existing customers gets rolled out soon, or that we at least get the option of having one added. Quint’s Sharking & Seashells Same here. I have a family group for they play store, but I don't see an option for the family calendar. Must not have rolled out to all yet. SVem26 Fantastic.. A few things to make this better MANAGEMENT -- Centralized app/Page to manage everything Family related ( The family Link app that was recently released is a good place or in the Google settings app) DRIVE -- Family settings for Drive storage.. e.g. Sharing the upgraded storage quota with the family group MUSIC -- Ability to share uploaded music with the whole family in Play Music MAPS -- Option of Location sharing for entire family (opt-in) FIND MY DEVICE -- Option to track locations of all devices of all members (opt-in) Other possible enhancements -- Group communication through Allo,Duo as a readily available option, Shared Wallet balance,etc Anthon Williamson If it would let me have access to their Chrome Remote Desktop. Opt-in of course. Then it would be the only tool I need for personal remote access. Everything else we be business use. SVem26 Ah yes.. Great idea.. I am waiting for the Remote desktop to be updated to support Android devices as host.. Would be a great help with my parents.. I use inkwire currently.. works but I still have to yell and tell them what to do.. -Matoro Zeliph- Yeah. It looks half baked so far. My mom is a noob when it comes to computers. So having this will help Paul_Werner Also, the Shared Family Payment Method should allow you to require purchase approvals for people above 18 too. Just because I want to add in a family member doesn't mean I want to allow them to make all the purchases they want using my card. Because of this my "family" is only my wife and under 18 daughter Sir_Brizz Bananas that this isn't already taken care of. It was the primary reason I haven't created a family group.

I'm not seeing it on my account. Navarr Barnier > You can only set up a family group with a personal Google Account, not a G Suite account makapav This is just another skunk-work half-brained idea to come out of someone's free time that will wither away without real-world use-cases just like the other Google Family Plan/Program that was launched a couple of months ago. Of course, this will not tie into the Google WiFi family settings controls and descriptions, or managing other Google accounts or God-forbid the grocery list that Google Home creates in the Google Express app. This whole thing was created to meet some random guy's dilemma. All this while, Google Photos does not recognize the groups you have already created in your Contacts app when choosing a target to share pictures. Anthrox give it some time today is the first lunch of software outside of play and play music. software is complex you have many different teams with different goals the family support might be coming after other feature they need to do first makapav Humbug excuses. Just like how after 7 years of phone launches, it's still a difficult problem to solve. Or 15 messaging apps later... Yuri Vidal US Only... =( Kunal God dammit Google! A person can be part of more than one family! Take, for instance, people that are married. Honestly, it's like Googlers are robots and overlook simple logic.

A product called “Google Attribution” was unveiled at a marketing conference this month in San Francisco by the internet giant. Google has long been able to determine when users click on an ads and make a purchase, but linking online and offline habits takes its analytics a step further. Google senior vice president Sridhar Ramaswamy, who announced that Attribution is in test mode with a limited number of partners and will be rolled out to more advertisers in coming weeks, touted the tool as being able to answer the long-challenging question of whether marketing campaigns are working. “Google Attribution makes it possible for every marketer to measure the impact of their marketing across devices and across channels,” Ramaswamy said. “Data-driven attribution uses machine learning to determine how much credit to assign to each step in the consumer journey — from the first time they engage with your brand for early research down to the final click before purchase.” Real-world customer email addresses or loyalty plan information can be woven with Google data from services such as AdWords, Google Analytics and DoubleClick Search to provide “a complete view” of marketing performance, according to the company. Using artificial intelligence, or machine learning, to better analyse and understand consumer behaviour to target ads and promote sales was a major theme of the conference. Ad ‘holy grail’ For several years now, AdWords has enabled advertisers to measure visits to real-world stores stemming from online campaigns, Ramaswamy noted. “Still, measuring store visits is just one part of the equation,” Ramaswamy said. “You also need insights into how your online ads drive sales for your business.” Real-world transactions matched back to Google ads are handed in “a secure and privacy-safe way,” with store sales information reported in aggregated and anonymised forms to protect individual privacy, according to the company. Tying online activity to offline shopping decisions has been a “holy grail” for advertisers for quite some time, and comes with worrisome privacy implications, according to ACLU senior policy analyst Jay Stanley. Attribution threatens to intrude on a core tenant of privacy, that people can have dealings with one party not spill over into affairs with other parties they interact with, Stanley contended. “This is an evolution, not a revolution; another step toward increased monitoring of individuals,” Stanley said. “Each step raises the question ‘Where does this all stop?’” Stanley expected Google to be on its best behaviour when it came to handling the growing trove of information about users, but that even the best of intentions could crack under the “enormous hydraulic pressure of the profit motive.” “We have the full fury and genius of the capitalist system being driven toward monitoring people in ever increasing detail and companies are competing to do so,” Stanley said “It will not stop without some sort of rules in which we as a society express our values through legal protections.” More tempting ads? Google and Facebook dominate the online ad world, and what one does to prove its worth to advertisers is likely to be copied by the other, according to Silicon Valley analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group. Attribution promised to give Google a way to assure advertisers they are getting their money’s worth at the firm’s online venues. “The big problem is that showing conversion from ad consumption to purchase has been horrible,” Enderle said of online marketing. “This has been a problem for a long time. Google is trying to make a metric so they get credit for it when you do purchase after viewing an ad.” Data showing which ads are translating into real sales should mean that the relevance of ads people see online will improve as marketers abandon mis-aimed or ineffectively tailored messages, the analyst reasoned. “You are going to be hit with ads for things that you might actually want to buy, so you are going to spend a lot more money,” Enderle predicted. Worries about privacy sparked by linking offline and online activities are a decade or so late, because the time to protest was when collection began of the troves of data about people, the analyst argued. “There really is no downside to this application,” Enderle said while discussing Google’s marketing metrics move. “This is the good side of collecting data; it is what else is being done with the data that should be unnerving and that we really don’t know.” — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Lenovo’s struggling mobile business sets sight on high-end market Apple said to plan dedicated chip to power AI on devices Singapore’s road safety campaign takes a VR twist Upcoming video games: ‘Star Trek’ VR, ‘Tokyo 42,’ ‘Tekken 7,’ ‘Dirt 4,’ ‘Wipeout Collection’ Report: Facebook leaked documents show types of content it allows Report: Facebook leaked documents show types of content it allows You won’t believe how easy it is to fool Samsung Galaxy S8’s ‘eye security’ Samsung investigating Galaxy S8 ‘iris hack’ Samsung to reveal stretchable display North Korea-linked hackers ‘highly likely’ behind WannaCry, says Symantec Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: One Direction's Styles tops Billboard with solo album Reuters Video: Europe can no longer rely on allies, says Merkel Reuters Video: Dutchman Dumoulin wins Giro d'Italia Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Thai man murders baby, commits suicide on Facebook Live Tilda Swinton unveils strange ‘Okja’ promo clip Related Articles Google and partners try to block the march of ad-blockers Machine learning may fix ad placement dispute, says Google Johnson & Johnson, JPMorgan suspend YouTube ads over offensive videos (VIDEO) AT&T, Verizon join Google ad boycott Google apologises to ad clients for YouTube content fiasco Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | recommend.my - Local Services

SMS support for Hangouts officially ends today, excluding Google Voice and Project Fi subscribers Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/05/22 2:29pm PDTMay 22, 2017 101 Plus 1 on G+ 289 Share on Facebook 105 Share on Twitter Total Shares495 Applications Google News Videos Today is the day that Hangouts finally loses SMS support. We were warned by Google about it months ago when Hangouts started showing a warning that it would no longer support the feature. But, as of today, it's finally set to happen. For anyone who isn't on Project Fi or Google Voice — both of which will continue to support SMS in Hangouts — this is the end of an era. Many people, myself included, made the final push into Hangouts over other services when SMS support was added. The integrated conversations made it much easier to keep short communications together in one place. So far there's no word on if SMS support will be coming to Allo. Now that Hangouts support for SMS is finally over, we aren't really left with a clear migration method. Anyone that might have made use of it will have to either deal with using two separate apps again or move over to a new service. If you are looking for recommendations, Google's stock Android Messages isn't so bad. But, if you've been enjoying having SMS and chats merged, that isn't really a solution. Allo is always an option. But, that's the same issue from the other side, you'd still need to find a way to send SMS messages. There's always Facebook Messenger or Signal, which both provide a combined SMS and chat solution. Each has its disadvantages, though.  The latter doesn't have quite the same feature set that Hangouts did, and the former is a Facebook product. Either way, it's closing time. You might have just enough left to send one last SMS before the lights are shut off.

Even if we all got left out to dr-WHY GOOGLE, WHY?! JVF When referring to people it is always "Hanged", sounds funny but that's just how it is. It's a past participle. Ryne Hager Yup, I know. That was the joke. Jason E Perkins Yup. The past participle form of "hang out" is definitely "hung out." "Hanged" only means "suspended" or "put to death by hanging." JVF I'm well aware of that. 4Ui812 I understand what you're saying and I debated the proper way to put it..... I have to stand by hanged. xyz Hung Lo? instinct I am like 6 different active group chats in Hangouts. Good_Ole_Pinocchio Google doesn't care about you. humulos A truer statement has never been said Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2c9aad5a41d09ce24c4c4e04e7b3a28a2004487ff015df2fc519b5c2a9556024.gif Adrien Aubel Google's messaging strategy is now: - Android Messages for carriers & OEMs - meaning strictly SMS/RCS - Allo for their new consumer messaging service, and the focus of their upcoming work - Hangouts for business/enterprise Nothing personal :) humulos How innocent we once were, at the time when we witnessed Talk, Voice, SMS and G+ Messages become a single product, fulfilling all our dreams. Undone in naught but a few years, with this final limb being ripped from the body. But I guess I'm on Project Fi, so I'm good for now. My parents weren't happy about this news, since our family communicates primarily on large Hangouts threads. mxwp but if they are using actual Hangouts IM threads and not SMS they can still use Hangouts Shannon Butler Home-based mummy Kelly Richards from New York after quitting from her fulltime occupation has able to make from $26000 to $28000 on a monthly basis from freelancing in the house... This is just one way she successfully done it >>> learn by clicking here how to do it right now humulos For sure, and they still do. They just don't like having to use multiple apps for messaging. Adrien Aubel IMHO those big plans haven't been followed by strict coding/design rules, and Hangouts became progressively a technical mess, then a true nightmare for anybody to work on, with the UI becoming slower with each version, fortunately partly compensated by faster phones. To be fair, SMS/MMS can be very complicated to deal with, and Android development was much harder and potentially messy when Babel has been developed, the technologies available nowadays would have helped a lot. So down the road it would have been neither productive or future-proof to keep iterating all efforts inside Hangouts, at least without a total recode from the ground up. Right now I wonder if they will indeed clean the code up to remove all carrier SMS/MMS, and eventually speed up the app and make it smaller, or just roughly disable it. t_newt If Hangouts became a technical mess, the solution isn't to drop Hangouts, it's to fix Hangouts. They could have made it a framework for their products that any of their messengers could be installed into. Instead they are trying to make it an enterprise Slack competitor. What company is going to trust their company to Google's leftovers? "SMS/MMS can be very complicated to deal with". Apparently this is true at Google. Duder12 They aren't getting the left overs. They are getting two brand new products. Hangouts Meet and Hangouts Chat. OhYeah! 2 products solving a problem that the last hangouts solved already in one app. Great nigra truo Well, that is why we use whatsapp, does a lot more and is just one application and while Americans are backwards in Whatsapp use, it is the world wide defacto standard, many people that use Whatsapp have not written a SMS in year and I know that for me it is a pain in the ass, because it is of lousy reliabilty, often you don't know if the person received the message, much less if they have read it, you can't record voice memos of unlimited length, can't voice call or video call them and it is not encrypted ( functions that whatsapp supports natively) Here is a little comparison of SMS vs Whatsapp: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1StygzfbH0eSg7gwCgPUdpenzDeTbsuwKk3dMiG-BGQY/edit?usp=sharing It is not hard to see that it will replace SMS, as it already has for 1 billion people. pfmiller SMS can be complicated to deal with, but it's not dealt with by Hangouts. The OS handles SMS itself and then gives whichever SMS app you select access to the SMS message database. Adrien Aubel If you mean that the app doesn't have to interact directly with the radio, you're right. But the APIs provided for SMS/MMS by Google are nonetheless very tricky to integrate beautifully with. For example, the ContentProvider could be so much cleaner to interact with, and some OEMs like Samsung crash on non-simple queries. Another example is that most apps ship their own MMS logic, usually based on Google's own sources ( https://android.googlesource.com/platform/packages/services/Mms/+/master/ ), in case the carrier or OEM customized the system MMS logic and made it not work properly with apps other than their own, or if the system isn't configured correctly, and let the user the option to switch between this logic ("Legacy") and their system when it comes to send MMS. We could expect better from an OS serving 2B active users, but I'm glad it's at least open to 3rd party apps, unlike iOS. JG Personally, rather than spinning Allo off as its own new app, I would have preferred Google to treat it as the next major update to Hangouts. Have the team re-work the app from the ground up, streamlining the code, etc. If I'm not mistaking, around that time, Facebook and Shazam were launching their own reworked Lite app versions designed to use less bandwidth, storage and resources. Reworking Hangouts would have followed suite. Essentially, Google could have made their first Go ready app a year or so early. Hangouts already has a large username, and it has all of the features users have been asking for - cross device/platform and SMS support. And I don't think the is any issue with SMS being a challenge to implement as they have their own SMS app, Android Messages which send to work well enough to be the default app to push RCS. It shouldn't be too hard to fold it (and the Assistant) into Hangouts while streamlining it. My name is…. Nobody ever used Hangouts for SMS outside America. Actually, nobidy uses SMS no more. There DOES exist a world outside America, you know, and its much bigger!! sproc Haha, you wish. Everyone I know is stuck on sms. They try whatsapp and stuff then abandon it. Adrien Aubel Especially iOS users, who already have a great "Messages" app that outsmarts SMS when possible. For them it doesn't make too much sense to download another messaging app every now and then. Rodrigo Gomes da Silva So.. where are you from? Jay No you wish, but you must be in the states. No one i know uses SMS anymore. It's an archaic dead service, only used for bank transaction notifications and amazon deliveries. Everyone else is either on whatsapp (yes 220 million of us in this country and growing at 4 million a month) or (wechat which is like what 85-90 percent of China) No one cares for SMS. xyz And where do you live? America. We already know. TheDrunkenClam What an unnecessarily smug and nagging comment. Winston Well it's true, even if it's smug. Outside the US, SMS is pretty much dead as we've all moved towards WhatsApp, as carriers still don't give unlimited texts by default. I think it's time to start asking another company for SMS integration. Christopher Gannon That would work if so many people in the US weren't using iMessage, where the only way a non-apple user can chat is via SMS. Then apple makes it very difficult NOT to use it, so good luck convincing your friends to give up siri, etc. I'd also like a solution, like hangouts or iMessage, where messages aren't restricted to a phone, and I can seamlessly use both on my laptop, tablet or phone.

Alejandro And how do you send voice clips through SMS? Good luck with that runamonk Why the fuck are you sending voice clips? Just call them for fucks sake lol. Jesus you kids these days. IT'S A PHONE. Adrien Aubel At invi we observed that a significant amount of our users rely heavily on push to talk and voice typing. We want to improve it so that when you pick up the phone and put it on your ear it plays any unread message to make it more lightweight, as well as an auto-transcribe, but it's already pretty useful when you and your contact are used to it. When you're biking, on your way to the office, cooking, cute messages to your SO, ideas (that you can send to yourself as well), ... You can let your recipient get to your message whenever (s)he wants rather than requiring his/her availability right here and then. That being said, we'll bring soon WebRTC video calls / possible Duo integration to get face-to-face in one tap, and we expect this to indeed take over and reduce the microphone features usage. nigra truo Hahaha, you look silly defending a deficiency, voice memos are super useful, especially when driving or if somebodie's on a call. Used by many not stuck on sms. runamonk I'm not defending anything, sms is old and very long in the tooth. It should have been removed years ago. Andrew MMS handles voice clips just fine in my experience. dblock Easy, if your SMS app supports this (mine does), you can send voice clips as an attachment like any other MMS message. nigra truo Wow, the man is still using the archaic technology that is mms. Hahaha! I have not sent one like that since 2011, when i discovered whatsapp. Adrien Aubel I don't know if that's exactly what you meant, but on invi ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi ) you have push to talk, voice typing, and ability to share audio externally from any app (depending on the format and your carrier we may host it ourselves and send a link FYI). It's not just yet open outside of USA but I can eventually give you an APK if you can't wait to try it out, lmk! Tomáš Petrík Free for everyone, you say? Not here... And yes, I am in the EU. nigra truo Sms is over in europe, don't know where you are from, but you might want to be less backward and start using whatsapp like a billion other people, sms is archaic and it Can't do so many things that whatsapp can, which is already the defacto international IM standard, even on iphones, as it supports all the platforms. Michael Sørensen Scandinavia. And no one uses WhatsApp. Maybe backwards, but it works, and I still haven't seen a compelling argument for changing... Josh Brown outside america and use it everyday. Jason Hirsch I was very annoyed at having to add Hangouts as my SMS client. I couldn't keep separate separate anymore. Now in combination with Fi, GV, 2 phones and obi it's a nightmare. On this overseas trip i couldn't force Fi to dial via WiFi. So i had to go back and install Hangouts dialer. If they (Google) have a master plan there's no rhyme or reason to it. Nick I'm not sure what the future holds for us Fi users, but it's looking grim. My family and work is in the same boat it seems. I have been promoting Hangouts for a long time since it could handle everything I needed plus some, now as our services split out communications start to waver... All I can hope for now is they at least follow through with their promises to allo and add desktop support. (Status: Soon ™) atc-tech Google Voice users should still be able to use it too, I think? I don't know. I switched the the updated GV app when it came out around the same time the hangouts DEintegration was announced, so I'm not sure, but I think Voice users still can... Aaron Berlin Who knows what the plan is long-term for GVoice in Hangouts, but the actual GVoice app is actually good now. No equivalent to the chrome extension/desktop app, though. Ryne Hager You are right, Google Voice users can also continue to receive SMS messages in the app, I'll make that more clear. atc-tech Cool. I wasn't sure GV still could, but I thought I remembered hearing that we could. I gave up already though and use the prettier new GV app... Wish they would add back more features though. Ryne Hager The new app is so pretty. I do wish my GV voicemails would show up in my call logs again, though. atc-tech Yes! Along with the options for do not disturb mode. mxwp i exclusively use my GVoice number for calls and texts and use it on Hangouts. the update GVoice app has an annoying bug in that it tries to connect every account on your phone instead of just your main one. i have submitted it as a bug but have not heard anything back Tom Harman So when does Allo officially get SMS support, lol. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Same time it gets tablet support: Never. rndusrnm479461 Am I the only one who doesn't understand what's so good about SMS integration in either Allo or Hangouts? Is it really hard for you people to use 2 apps? Jesus christ. Google's "Android Messages" is lightweight anyway, why is it such a problem to use it? It shouldn't even eat much RAM. Kyle Gospodnetich Yes, yes you are. Please never work for Google, or really any company that has a hand in communications. My name is…. No, he is not Kyle Gospodnetich Congrats, now there's two of you idiots. iluvthesoftsoft One do-it-all app > two apps Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi, https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi, we're trying to fix texting on Android and provide transparent switch between SMS&IM (devices handshake when you get into chats so that we determine whether you or the recipient has poor reception and should prefer SMS for example). MJ Two apps? One app for SMS and than Facebook, WhatsApp, Allo/Hangouts, and whatever to cover all my contacts. SMS is the only thing I can message 100% of my contacts with. Adrien Aubel Google's messaging strategy is now: - Android Messages for carriers & OEMs - meaning strictly SMS/RCS - Allo for their new consumer messaging service, and the focus of their upcoming work - Hangouts for business/enterprise They can't risk to upset carrier and OEMs by implementing non-carrier features in Android Messages / the default SMS app they provide. Or at least it's a risk they're not ready to take at that time. Btw I wouldn't say "Android Messages" is that lightweight btw, notably on modern devices it could be so much smoother :( sam1331 I don't get it either. When Android Messages came out I switched my SMS over to it. I quickly realized I was using it almost exclusively for 2 factor verification codes. But really, the notifications all go to the same place, I already have to decide whether to use Hangouts or Facebook Messenger when talking to basically anyone anyway. I also think people should push a little harder to move conversations over from SMS to something else, I've never found that to be very difficult. mxwp SMS is convenient because you know it will work with any American with a cell phone... including "dumb" flip phones. And it actually is really difficult to get people to switch to another service. Apple users just use imessage to send their SMS to me. And then I send them my glorious green bubbles and those ishills can suck it. YaKillaCJ Sms integration is important because it is supported by 100% of telecommunications service providers and integrated on all devices that can make a phone call and has a screen. You can even sms a home phone without a screen depending on carrier/service provider. Thus it messaging that works with 100% of your contacts. Having multiple Apps spread across 100s of contacts is plain annoying. So if any App wants to be taken serious, it needs to be serious and have sms. What's App already fills the void for bypassing sms across the globe. rndusrnm479461 This answer makes the most sense. Thanks. Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi! play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi We're still new and young but we're very serious about our ambitions and not settling when we know it could/should be better. To fix texting on Android, we provide transparent switch between SMS&IM (devices handshake when you get into chats so that we determine whether you or the recipient has poor reception and should prefer SMS for example). Very handy in some countries/areas/events. And lets you reach *anybody* (that has a phone number). My name is…. Nobody uses SMS no more, and if i wanna send a text message to the last of the Mohicans, i will use my SMS app. I dont want no stupid integration and no stupid 'SMS fallback' that will make things worse. Chatting is not texting. YaKillaCJ There are only 2 widely used methods of messaging across mobile devices. Sms and What's App. Sms is supported on EVERY device from 2 way pagers and flip phones to house phones and smartphones. Any device that has a phone number supports sms. The majority of people doesn't care about added features like stickers and gif. We just care that all I need is the person phone number and from there I can call or text them. That's it. Bottom line is that it has to be a standard adopted by carriers on a worldwide scale. Hence what's app reason for such large scale use is it uses existing phone numbers for login, existing phone book for contact list, free, minimum data usage and encrypted. Even that is still not even used by a third of the devices that use sms. Ryuuie Last I checked, WhatsApp charged $1 or someshit. erptastic It has not done that officially for years. And even before that, they always just extended my account. Ryuuie Ah. Looks like it was recent and official as of last January but they dropped it. It was an annual $1 fee to use the app. disqus_Xz3y8OiO3O It's free YaKillaCJ Who actually pays that. I don't recall anyone ever paying. Besides, it's only $1 a year and that significantly cheaper than carriers who don't have unlimited sms charge. nigra truo The majority of people don't care about features? Go check the market share of whatsapp, you are misinformed. The majority does care and only hillbillies still use flip phones. ;-) YaKillaCJ Features are nice but seamless compatibility is more important. Btw last I recall, less than half of mobile phones in use are smartphones worldwide. Using What's App doesn't allow me to message 100% of my contacts, SMS does. Bottomline. nigra truo You can't send SMS internationally, the plans are very expensive. That is why Whatsapp got so incredible successful. Also, you have to remember that we are not talking about third world nations, which don't even have phones at all or have no good mobile networks, and in all others, Whatsapp has taken over and will be the new standard in the US too, once some people stop resisting it and try it out. I have a large group of people here in the USA with which I'm in contact daily, over Whatsapp and I'm doing communication that can't be done with SMS and would need another 5 apps to accomplish (which many people of course have not installed) nigra truo Sms has endless limitations that is making it useless compated to something as full featured as whatsapp, i found it easier to convince my backwards US friends to use whatsapp, as this will be the universal standard anyway, 1 billion users gives you a hint. YaKillaCJ I do agree that the standard needs to move forward. What I'm saying is that it would have to be a standard adopted by carriers & service providers worldwide. Until then, any App that wants to be taken serious and get use needs to fall back on the current standard. What's App billion users is small compared to the billions in use that support SMS. USA alone has 500million numbers that support sms and that just 1 country. nigra truo Nope, the US does not have 500 million SMS capable phones, that is wishful thinking, of 325 Million people, they would have to use two phones all the time, not to speak that 325 million you have to subtract babies and very old people that are not texting anyone. Whatsapp IS the standard, you can install it on any current phone, no matter who produced it, flip phones are the small minority now and since Whatsapp is free, unlike SMS (phone providers STILL charge you for it, either in a flat fee or individually), it makes it much more attractive to many. I have had the experience when I use SMS, people get offended when I send them a SMS just because they might be on a cheap plan and using a flip phone and each SMS costs them 30 cents and they ask me to please stop. This is not what you would call a barrier free system. Also, some plans have limits of how many you can send or receive and SMS is such a dumb and obsolete technology that it can only send 160 characters in one message and has to string several ones together. Sadly, no phone provider has invented anything useful in the last 20 years, SMS is ancient and the next technology that they tried to replace SMS with fell flat on its face. Companies in this respect know much more what customers want and can make it much more affordable or, in the case of Whatsapp, free. It was invented to avoid (international) ripoff by phone companies and be able to keep contact with your friends abroad without having to shell out 1 dollar per SMS. Sadly, the phone providers are the most technologically incompetent companies out there, it took a company like Apple to reinvent the smartphone, because the phone providers, which this is a core business are were too dumb to pull it off ;-) mxwp in the larger scheme of things, I agree with you that it is not a big deal. still, having one app do both was convenient. the other complaint is Android fanboys being envious of iMessage, which Hangouts could have become. exadeci The main reason that people use Imessage is that you get rich messaging capabilities out of the box if the person you are talking to has an Iphone everything is abstracted, you add someone's number and you start chatting right aways no need to exchange accounts id's or find which app you both use. And if the other doesn't have an Iphone you can still message them or if you killed your data plan it sends an sms. But Google doesn't add sms support because they are pushing for RCS which is a GOOD thing: Standalone Messaging 1-to-1 Chat Group Chat File Transfer Content Sharing Social Presence Information IP Voice call Best Effort Video call Geolocation Exchange Audio Messaging Network based blacklist Capability Exchange based on Presence or SIP OPTIONS All this WITHOUT using any data, data needs an link to be established this doesn't. Chris Hannan It's not hard for most of us to use it. The problem is the people we contact don't want to use separate apps. Everyone with iPhones uses iMessage because it just works by default. But barely anybody I know uses Hangouts and nobody I know uses Allo. If it was all built into one app that shipped with Android phones, more people would use it. Troy Leonard and I removed Hangouts as of today I will no longer consider using any google messaging service ever again Sruly J Isn't Gmail a form of messaging? (Or do you not use Gmail?) Troy Leonard Not for long I'm transitioning over to outlook.com. And upgrading my phone to an iPhone. I'm sick of slow to no updates on my phone,and done with Google ruining everything I ever liked about their apps and Android. naysayer Good riddance. Adrien Aubel Let me know what you think about invi (https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi), a new app that we're making that brings a lot of the goodies iMessage brings to iOS users, with big long-term ambitions, and still trying to preserve a consistent and sleek UI. Hopefully that will make you stick to Android and you'll make your iPhone friends jealous in a few months/years ;) Zsolt V Why bother evangilizing? He already decided Outlook on an iPhone is better than Gmail, so let him enjoy it. Troy Leonard Your link is broken Adrien Aubel Fixed thanks! Disqus didn't like the closing ')' at the end of the link. XgudwilX eww outloook😲 Total Insecurity Saying "upgrading my phone to an iPhone" is the same as converting from atheism to any religion. Just a downgrade. bekifft It's true, and their failings and obvious ulterior motives in messaging have, for the first time in a decade, made me consider moving my email back to a private service over which I have control. Roy Thank you and have a nice flight. -Matoro Zeliph- Just want to make sure I'm not missing anything. So Google Voice SMS will no longer work too? Corbin Davenport That will still work as well. Ryne Hager Google voice will still work, just like Fi. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ It's primarily that regular SMS will no longer function in the app. A while back they killed of threading of SMS/MMS and Hangout messages, and now they are killing SMS/MMS entirely out of the app and suggestin people to switch to Android Messages. -Matoro Zeliph- Ok cool! I'm good then. Thanks for the clarification everyone Bill Blandford Hangouts SMS looks like it still works for Google Voice SMS too. Essentially, this is like Fi, which is a Google Voice number at heart. My wifi-only-device kids use Hangouts to call and text with a Google Voice #. Timmy Turner Yeah GV will continue to work through Hangouts since the number you use via Project-Fi is a GV given number. Adrien Aubel For people that were still using Hangouts and want to try a new app that also does SMS & IM, that tries to provide a fast & polished experience to fix texting on Android, I'd love some honest feedback! https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi We're trying hard to "make it right" and have so much planned on the roadmap, so any feedback is great to have to tweak things up. Let us know what you think! exadeci While the initiative is nice, why would we use your messaging app? If I want an instant message app that does sms and that no one else uses I already got Signal and at least Signal is proven to be secure. What makes Messenger (Facebook), WhatsApp and Imessage good? Their userbase. Ask anyone for a way to communicate and they will use one of those apps, no need for fallback sms when everyone has an account. Adrien Aubel Thanks for your feedback @exadeci:disqus! Great questions :) And Signal is nice as well! It's not for everybody but if you're happy with it keep using it but make sure to check us out in a few months to check that you haven't been missing out, we're going fast! I think there's much more to iMessage that makes it good than their userbase. It is a polished app that just works, and lets you reach anybody, therefore becoming your trusted "go to" texting app. We expect Google to release this summer new capabilities that will let you use IM in more scenarios. Very interesting stuff that we can't wait to let our users benefit from. But our initial target is actually SMS users, people that unlike you and I don't really care about the details, they just want a reliable app that sends and receive their messages. And they're actually quite happy with SMS/MMS in that regard, it just works (when you don't fight with APNs, something we try to prevent as well). We want to transparently "upgrade" those users that may be using Android Messages or a 3rd party app custom-made for the carrier or OEM, not necessarily developed with great care and polishment, and sometimes truly terrible (really, you wouldn't believe what's on some popular carriers, that most users end up using 10 times a day for years). Right now invi is mostly upgrading the transport of your messages and general experience as we develop another big focus of ours: bring your chats to life, try to get out of this 99% of messages exchanged being plain text. Texting can be the most impersonal way of communication and this flattens relationships. A bar suggests as you type relevant media to enrich in 1 tap your message and our users send 12% of their messages with stickers, GIFs, or regular images. Which helps you transmit how you truly felt when writing this message, it doesn't flatten as much your emotions (although we're far from done, it'll get much smarter and more personal on a per-chat basis). It always send instantly over IM as well (no upload or anything like that, optimized WebP images for super-fast download). Open your top 3 chats on Signal, chats that you have with people you care the most about, look at all this flat plain texting, and try to visualize the gap compared to what it could be, how it could have been more personal and transmitting more of your feelings or emotions. We're targeting this gap, and again, we're just getting started but have serious ambitions and motivation. If you use Snapchat, look at all that rich media that gets thrown to your eyes or that you throw to people, that doesn't always make sense and is often disconnected from conversations, sometimes losing its value and feeling like you just threw a bottle in the ocean, just leaving you with a list of who saw it. We're looking at that gap as well, as invi becomes more and more rich in terms of content creation. After a few iterations over a couple of years we believe that we found a solution that will let us bring up our roadmap in a consistent structure. State-of-the-art technology that is although just the foundation for all the exciting stuff that we want to add in the coming months. We are in talks with some OEMs and resellers to make invi default which would help grow invi's user base and help us improve our product with more diverse usage, while some upcoming features of invi should ultimately help us get a lot more users naturally. exadeci Signal has actually Gifs from Giphy, stickers and the possibility to send a location but I don't use this kind of feature even on Messenger it's quite rare that I send a sticker. Google is strongly pushing for RCS adoption which would add all these emotions sharing: https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Rogers_Google_RCS.gif https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Telenor_6P_GIF_0UHHQdI.gif https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/RCS_Android_Update.width-600.png Adrien Aubel Exactly, but how relevant is Giphy? Again don't compare with things you've seen so far but with what it could potentially be if it truly understood your relationships and intentions, if it combined that with your taste and the way you usually communicate with this specific person. And what if your friends or other people were able to add their own media and stickers through channels and then be discovered, liked and followed, with deep intelligence powering it all and bringing the right content to the right user? We built invi to support all this, we don't just use a Giphy API, we used the most advanced and lightweight technologies to communicate in realtime with our backend, even on pretty bad 3G, from where we curate the media that eventually gets recommended to you. The screenshots you attached look great as well, but see Android Messages is a good example there's only 5 packs of stickers that won't get more relevant or smarter no matter how many stickers you use or how many times you use Android Messages. Idk who would use a given sticker hundreds of times, but anyway I'm not sure those were really representative of how Android Messages is most commonly used. The features are technically there, as often, but they're very limited in their potential as of now. The Awesome Bar isn't for everyone but can eventually help people like you, as images just get displayed while you're typing, no action required, and if you see one that you like you can just tap it to see how it looks and enrich your message, send and you're done. Google is pushing RCS, very true! And we're excited about the great work the Jibe team did in the past couple years. They're a bit shy to share their RCS client implementation at the moment, it may be unstable or not well documented at the moment, but we're meeting regularly with Google and hope to add RCS to our transparent switch as soon as possible, even though the user base is a bit limited at the moment it has the potential to grow fast and solve many issues. If they're reluctant for too long we may use other hubs that would communicate seamlessly through Unified Profile. But for now, we're watching the number of users actually benefiting from RCS grow while we focus on other areas of improvements. sam1331 I am actually kind of optimistic about all this, more so than I was maybe a year ago. They've been putting out a steady stream or improvements to Allo, and when I've experimented with it with a friend it actually is an enjoyable experience. Releasing it without a web app is just shocking, but if that's added and it works well, I could totally see moving over to it from Hangouts, where I do the vast majority of my communicating. The other piece of the puzzle is Duo. If they can integrate a Duo button in Allo conversations (like it seems they will), and they eventually add group calling, which can't be that far off, then I think it will be a nice solution for myself and my family. And I've got quite a few friends that are all about Android instead of iOS, so I can see them switching to Allo from Hangouts. But not until there is a web app, because they aren't stupid. Chad Knasinski I would use Allo if they added SMS support and a desktop version like Hangouts had. Nick.Trite Same here. I have Fi so I'll continue to use Hangouts for SMS. I really love the fact that I can switch seamlessly from desktop to mobile and still be sending SMS. Until Allo does that, I won't consider moving. Chad Knasinski Ditto Sir_Brizz And multi-device support. Can't even use it or sync it on my LTE Tablet... Carson Saldanha So, basically Hangouts but revamped? We've come in full-circle. Sir_Brizz Sure. The problem is that every other chat platform has these features in 2016. Including Hangouts. Roy Me to, love it. mxwp unless they remove hangouts from gmail, people will still secretly be using "hangouts" all the time. in fact, the only way Allo will ever take off without SMS is if it replaces Hangouts (gtalk) on gmail and inbox. Chad Knasinski So correct me if I am wrong here but Google wants us to do this with our messages: SMS - Google Messenger Business SMS - Hangouts Messages - Allo Facebook - Messenger Video Chat - Duo Business Video Chat - Hangouts Video Really? Are you kidding me here? Timmy Turner You've got it right and if there's a joke, you'll being waiting a while for the punchline. disqus_em5YfkbWdk What Business SMS and how is 8t different from other SMS? Zsolt V What does Facebook have to do with anything you wrote? So you are corrected. SpadeX Are you new to tech world? John Not exactly. SMS - Messenger SMS (Project Fi and Voice) - Hangouts SMS (Voice) - Voice Chat - Allo Chat - Hangouts Video chat - Duo Video chat - Hangouts Voice call - Hangouts Voice call (Voice) - Voice Nicholas Conrad Email - Gmail Business Email - G Suite SMS - Google Messenger Business SMS - Hangouts Messages - Allo Facebook - Google+ Video Chat - Duo Business Video Chat - Hangouts Meet Phone calls - Google Voice/Project Fi/Google Home FIFY xyz That's only for Google fanboys. Regular people ditched Google's messaging apps a long time ago. Timmy Turner I recommend Textra to anyone looking for a new SMS app. Sleek, customizable and continually updated/supported. Adrien Aubel Textra is very nice, notably customization-wise as you said, you can go deep and fine-tune basically any UX element. And it's super fast and lightweight as well. I am working as well on a new SMS app that also provides IM similarly to iMessage on iPhone, and many other features, most of them upcoming though. Would you mind giving me a honest feedback when you have the time? It's called invi on the Play Store https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi Timmy Turner Sure thing. freshprince_87 That invi SMS app is an awesome app. Near flawless app. but I stop using it because I kept having problems with MMS messages and also it just like Allo in the sense where if you uninstall the app and reinstall it on the same phone all your instant messages are all gone including some of the regular SMS /MMS messages. You need to make the app save all your messages on to an account like a Google account in the cloud. So that no matter what device you use the instant messages will still be there. Adrien Aubel @freshprince_87:disqus Thank you for your feedback! MMS can be very tricky and every carrier has its own set of specificities, I'm sorry about that, it shows we're still young but obviously like you said, such a core functionality bug makes our whole effort worthless for you here. Do you mind sharing your carrier, device model, and Android version? Did you try using "Legacy MMS" in the app settings? About the IM sync, that's an issue we're definitely looking into, considering all potential security and privacy issues, notably as some countries like USA recycle pretty aggressively your phone numbers, and with the desire to bring a Web client in mind. Google should announce this summer APIs that will eventually help us regarding security, so stay tuned :) freshprince_87 Thanks. I didn't use the legacy MMS. I hope that you add the IM sync soon. I'm on a T-Mobile service using the Moto Z Play on Android Nougat 7.0 Adrien Aubel Ok thank you, if you don't mind I have other questions to dive into your problem :) What specifically was failing? MMS sending, receiving, or both? Did it show an error? Is it only on group MMS or all MMS? Whatever information you may have will be helpful. Our next release should bring MMS reliability improvements and notably Wifi texting when supported by the carrier (first MMS may send up to 60s to send as we're trying out routes but then all other Wifi MMS should send very fast). Tom Westrick https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y5ecvBaqHBk MJ Thank God I use Project Fi otherwise this would suck big time for me. TJ Mills Thank God I have Google voice.... Def Ref Actually, it sucks for Fi users who wish to economize on data because Hangouts no longer uses cellular SMS but requires a data connection, wifi or cell data. I didn't realize this was happening (because they said Fi wasn't going to be affected) until I got my replacement Nexus 6P and suddenly wasn't receiving SMS texts. They couldn't sort it out, even sending me a new SIM which didn't work either. It wasn't until I really started digging that I discovered that SMS required data to work and you'd either have to use a different SMS app (and lose multi-device sync; esp ability to type on computer thru Gmail) or turn on data. Lame. MJ OK... I am on WiFi most of the day myself but even with no WiFi it's still texting. Confused, you don't have data on Project Fi? Def Ref I keep my mobile data turned off unless I need traffic info for navigation or need to be in contact with someone via FB Messenger. Otherwise between home, work, Xfinity hotspots, etc., I'm usually not far from wifi. I don't care if I can't get my email for a half-hour while I'm driving. When you're paying per MB, you start noticing how much data apps guzzle. But last month I only used 85MB, so my next bill will be just over $24 with tax. Point is that before they killed SMS support, I didn't need to have data turned on to receive texts. Now I do. MJ I just don't see how you would guzzle data if usually on WiFi. I leave data on and use less than a GB a month. Granted, I don't check my email on my phone ever. LOL Dracono Love hangouts never used SMS. It also seems most negative reviews about it being slow was always tired to the SMS feature. I'm now curious with the removal of they'll us the opportunity to evolve or let it idle. mxwp it will evolve into a business app... but hopefully still available for consumers VAVAMk_2 Just give us SMS support in Allo for Christ's sake! Adrien Aubel SMS/MMS can be quite hard to deal with technically and Google didn't choose to go that way. It is possibly also due to the push they did to replace the default SMS app on many OEMs and carriers, strategically it's hard for them to push much of Google's agenda through the SMS app they give carriers, and they're mostly limited to SMS/RCS. Roy Christ will not give you SMS, bat Star of David could promise you RCS in Allo. mxwp Big G repeatedly stated it would never happen tim242 Liar. Adrien Aubel https://twitter.com/amitfulay/status/840236304130428928 Roy Great. It's was the plan all along. Now Allow will get RCS and web browser everything gonna integrate with Duo. I'm all the way in. I never like Hangout. I love Allo. #stop stop babies don't you cry. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I don't think that's possible. RCS is still mainly just an extension of SMS. If it doesn't support SMS, I don't see it handling RCS. Roy When RCS will come it will be with SMS already. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman Based on what? Besnik Rrustemi No problem guys,we have like 69 other Messaging Apps by Google to choose from and maybe 2 new others coming soon. Roy Haha it's so old. Can someone can come with new jokes here? Besnik Rrustemi Well sorry Old Man then, never knew your age before. * Respect for Old People * Sir_Brizz Let the confusion officially begin! Indianajonze google can go fk themselves Robert Gerhart Why isn't anybody asking the bigger question: why the hell does anyone use outdated SMS in the first place? It's like complaining that Hangouts doesn't integrate butter churns and wagon wheels either. There is nothing more annoying than a text message. Adrien Aubel SMS is always nice to have in some situations, that happen more or less depending on where you live. Uncovered areas, concerts or big games, people having no LTE-enabled plans, or simply on some roads and highways. In USA for example all those scenarios happen a lot, notably in some states. And eventually, in most countries you still use SMS for 3rd party services, banks, transportation, or even government-related messages. Most importantly, in countries that still use SMS you can reach *anybody you know* from one app. And that's really a great thing to have. Now you're right, IM is so much more pleasant. Instant delivery, read status, last active time, way faster image format and transport. At invi ( https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.invi ) we try to take advantage of this and combine both the way it should be. When you open a chat with somebody, we trigger a handshake to check that both you and the recipient are well connected. If one of both doesn't answer on time, it simply switches to SMS/MMS, it's automatic and out of your way. Otherwise you take advantage of state-of-the-art transport with some unique optimizations. Try to send a GIF over IM and see how fast it goes, compared to MMS or even Whatsapp. Let me know what you think! Aaron Simple; SMS is ubiquitous. Every cellular device in operation can send and receive SMS, from the most current and expensive flagships like the iPhone and Galaxy, to the cheapest budget devices, all the way down to the oldest flip phones. I can text my dad on his flip, my wife on her Nexus or my Capt on his iPhone and each one will receive that message and reply. Show me an IM that can do all of that (that isn't on the iPhone). I guess that invi app that guy's been pedaling might, but I'm waiting for it to gain some traction before trying to convince anybody to switch to yet another IM. Rod The rest of the world uses Whatsapp, everyone has it installed. JG Even people with generic flip phones? Rod Nope, but I don't remember the last time I saw someone with a flip phone. The poor now bear Galaxy Win/Pocket/etc JG My aunt still has one. She recently attempted to upgrade to a smartphone but that seems to have failed big time... Apparently my telling her to tap the icon that's labeled "EMAIL" to get her email is too complicated... That and the free phone she got is a PoS... 512MB of RAM and only 4GB of storage - with the OS consuming all but like 100MB there of. So it didn't perform quite so hot. She seemed a bit surprised her free phone didn't perform as well as my Pixel XL does... Rod You're better off simply calling her. Lol JG Or even better off not getting in touch with her period. I also happened to see another flip phone in use while I was out traveling today. TJ Mills Everyone in China uses Wi chat. Rod I believe you meant WeChat. Yes, but WhatsApp still has the largest userbase. TJ Mills Yes, I did mean WeChat. I knew it looked wrong. My point is that not everyone is on WhatsApp in all places in the world. Where SMS is ubiquitous. Rod I have a friend that came from China, and he says most people in China uses WhatsApp as well. It's pretty omnipresent. Aaron And if everyone in the US would get on board with a single IM that would be great. But here iPhone users tend to stick with the stock Messages app. Great for sending iMessages between each other and SMS to the rest of us. Terrible for convincing them to switch to another IM. And most Android users I know use whatever stock SMS message app came with their phone for texting with iPhone users and old people and FB Messenger for IM with everyone in their friends list. So if you have a strategy for getting everyone on a single IM platform I'm sure the Allo team at Google would love to hear it. Jordan L I agree with your post. iphone users LOVE their stock messaging app, as they should it's the best app on their phone. It feels like, at least in my circle, iphone users have the stock messaging app, Facebook Messenger, and Whatsapp. "older" people only have the stock app as they can barely use their phones in the first place. "younger" people all three. Rod Yeah, I know how it works in USA. As a foreigner, it's funny to see how much you guys rely on SMS lol. Aaron Not funny haha but funny sad. :( Rod USA is a world apart. lomsha Believe it or not, even 2g is still a luxury in some countries, which makes​ instant messaging iffy. In those cases sms is a great alternative. Not everyone is in the 1st world with a sweet smartphone and reliable data access. TJ Mills Standard is better than better. When someone comes up with a universal replacement that works on all classes of phones, then the world can switch. Until then it's a mishmash of services and applications​to communicate. Why does everyone still use email? Because of the standards. Michael Sørensen Convince me why I shouldn't... Currently I can write to anyone for free without first asking them what their preferred platform is. And they can reply for free regardless of said preferred platform. Again, convince me why that's not good enough? And don't say "stickers". Just don't. Security? Bah, no sensitive information sent. Robert Gerhart Two words: phone call. Just freaking CALL them... You already have the phone in your hand, and you know they have one as well. If you can condense what you need to say into 144 characters, it probably isn't important enough to bother the other person with in the first place. No more retarded tap-tap-tap... Turb0wned That was a stupid answer. I'm not going to have 15 different messaging apps to be able to talk to people. iMessage just works with everyone. Adrien Aubel Agreed that there's something pretty great about being able to reach *all your friends* from a single app. At least the ones that have a freaking phone numbers :D Of course, it's just how messaging should be but it also makes sense that all big players would heavily restrict any 3rd party integration, messaging is a huge, strategical, market. nigra truo Very good point, sms is over and has been for a long time, it is just that americans are strangely still in love with the ancient spartanic standard, they are backwards compared to the rest of the globe. Whatsapp for example does not support sms because it REPLACES it obviously. Sms can't do rich communication without ugly crutches, try making a free voice or video call through it, send a full size video, high resolution photos, a contact, a document, your location, an audiorecording and everything encrypted. All these things whatsapp can do natively, on all platforms, not just on iphones or apple devices, 1 billion users speak a clear language. Midnitte At this point, I'm held hostage stuck using Hangouts since it's the only thing that natively supports desktop messaging. Sigh. Bryan Chandler Signal has a Chrome app for desktop messaging. https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/signal-private-messenger/bikioccmkafdpakkkcpdbppfkghcmihk?hl=en Midnitte Ah yea, I would prefer something native though, plus I still use Hangouts for some contacts. I lament the loss of merged conversations too Lord Argyris "Each has its disadvantages, though. The latter doesn't have quite the same feature set that Hangouts did, and the former is a Facebook product." It's lines like these that keep.me coming back to AP. JD My support for Google and their messaging platforms ended the beginning of May. Kelly Clubb Well this sucks for any user that enjoyed an easy to use sms app. I use Hangouts and thankfully for project fi will continue it's support BossMa1n3 Eh..doesn't effect me stop using hangout for sms awhile ago..more interested in a flat screen phone with side bezels as thin as the one in the pic.. Grey PLEASE Bring Hangouts Chat and Hangouts Meet to all users. That has so many new and awesome features. It's like everything Allo isn't. DragoCubed The comment section is rough b_boogey_xl Bye Hangouts! hp-fourtwenty oh ffs...voice is still supported??? hell yeah!! nxtiak I'm waiting for the day G+ contacts disappear from Hangouts. I hate how on PC when I type a name to start a conversation it lists random people on G+. SHOW ME THE NAMES FROM MY DAMN CONTACTS GOOGLE!!!!!!!!! Maave RIP Hangouts. I had group chats, Google Voice, and SMS all in one. Now my group chats have moved to Telegram but I'm still stuck with nerfed Hangouts for GV. Chris Wachtman Hey, what's wrong with facebook? /s Gordon Spurgeon Spooner I switched to Signal because of this mess and I've very happy I did---it works great. The only feature I miss is tablet support, but it's coming soon, and unlike Google, when Signal receives a new feature, it's actually ready to be released, and works well. Jason E Perkins Boy am I glad for the second half of that title. ROB TEXTRA DC_Guy If Apple would just open up iMessage to Android, 99% of our messaging problems would be over. haha Dragos Lucian Totally forgot Hangouts existed. I've been using Telegram for quite some time now and I'm more than happy with it. PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ The name of the app is very off-putting if they ever wanted to increase adoption among business/serious users. But as I found out just yesterday, it's actually a really nice SMS apparatus. rap Some say SMS is dead. But not everyone has a smartphone or data. SMS works without either. nigra truo Well, if you have a minimalist phone and plan, you will likely be forced to pay for SMS by the same token. Data is the future, smartphones also, it is just a matter till SMS is gone for good everywhere. The most mentioned point is the point that you have to pay for SMS one way or another, it is never free. Adam Margeson Haven't been using it since I switched over to Allo. 1966CAH When it comes to messaging, Google is like an ex-girlfriend. Once, so sweet and alluring, now somebody I want nothing to do with. johdaxx Well, I hope they can sort this mess out eventually. I don't really care too much about SMS per se...but I do need some way to message people that don't have whatever apps I have or have apps I don't have. Especially if they have the audacity to use an iPhone or something. Brandon Hann This didn't affect me since I use Google Voice exclusively and have a data-only plan for my cell service. Let's just hope Google doesn't kill off Google Voice in the future. keithzg I would say, why remove a feature when you're clearly still supporting it for some users anyways, so it's no more maintenance to just leave it enabled for everyone? I would say that, if I thought there was any coherent or rational approach to messaging strategy and development at Google. Personally I switched to Facebook Messenger for SMS, if only because of Chat Heads (multitasking for IM is pretty nice). Was tempted towards Signal, but Signal wants you to import and encrypt your SMS's, and I don't want to get locked into an SMS app. derp_cookies These guys are starting to remind me more and more of Hooli. xyz Good decision. Next step is to discontinue Hangouts, then Allo, then Messages, and then Duo.

Why Samsung's QLED Is The TV Tech You Need In Your Life The Australian Home Battery Storage Buying Guide The Best Bits You Can Buy to Keep Your Life Extra Secure How To Abandon iOS And Switch To Android David Nield May 28, 2017, 10:00am ⋅ Filed to:  android apple fieldguide google ios mobile Share Having guided you through the not-all-that-straightforward process of switching from Android to iOS, we're back to tell you how to go in the opposite direction. (Make your mind up will you?) Going from Apple-powered devices to Google's platform is either ridiculously easy or rather taxing, depending on your current setup. Image: Alex Cranz/Gizmodo Do you Google? Good news if you're already heavily invested in the Google ecosystem on your iPhone. You can switch to Android in an hour or two and keep your evening free for seeing friends or browsing Netflix. Otherwise, better cancel those evening plans. Those of you who spend all your time in Gmail, Google Calendar and Google Maps for iOS can simply install those apps on your brand new Android device, sign in using your Google account credentials, and pick up where you left off. The same applies for Google Photos and Google Drive. Google Drive can handle contacts and calendars for you. Image: Google Unlike Apple, Google doesn't have a dedicated app to help you defect to its mobile OS, but it does have a website with a lot of the information you're going to need: essentially you're instructed to use Google Drive to copy over contacts, photos, videos and calendar entries, which we'll cover in more detail below. If you're thinking about switching from iOS to Android in the future, or like to swap mobile OSes on a regular basis, then Google's cloud-centric services make the task much easier — so your best off keeping all your data there. By contrast, the only official Apple app you can get on Android at the moment is Apple Music. Messages and emails Extricating yourself from iMessage is perhaps the biggest challenge facing those jumping ship to Android. iMessage doesn't work on Google's platform, and there's no way to export all your message history into a comparable Android app. You're going to have to say goodbye to iMessage, but you can at least ensure a clean break. As soon as you know you're making the move go into your iOS and navigate to Messages in Settings and turn iMessage off, then go to FaceTime in Settings and turn that off too. Apple's full instructions are here. If you have some precious iMessages or plain old SMSes you can't leave behind, you'll need to rely on third-party software and some rather convoluted processes to back it all up. iSMS2droid promises to import messages from an unencrypted backup you made in iTunes on your computer into Android. If you don't need the backup on your phone, then PhoneView (macOS) and CopyTrans (Windows) are two of many tools that will let you browse your old missives to your heart's content. It's goodbye to iMessage. Image: Screenshot As for emails, Apple's system supports IMAP, so you can carry on checking your iCloud emails through Gmail on Android if you're not having a fresh start and giving up your old email address completely. Tap the drop-down arrow on the Gmail app menu, choose Add account, and follow the configuration instructions provided by Apple. It's the same process if you're using any other kind of email app on your new Android device, like Outlook from Microsoft. The only requirement is that it supports the popular IMAP protocol. You have a couple of other options if putting your iCloud account directly into Gmail doesn't appeal. You can have all your Apple iCloud emails automatically forwarded to your new Gmail address, by going into iCloud Mail on the web and setting up forwarding — you can even delete the originals after they're passed on. Alternatively, you can export all your old emails using Mail on a Mac just in case you ever need them again, then close down your Apple account. Contacts and calendars As long as you just want to make a one-way, one-time switch from iOS to Android, then Google Drive for iOS makes the process of moving contacts and calendars over simple enough. Once you've got the app installed on your iOS device, open the menu then tap Settings and Backup. Choose the data you want to transfer across to the equivalent Google accounts, tap Start Backup and you're on your way — everything from iOS and iCloud gets picked up. Make sure you're on wi-fi, and the iPhone is plugged in during the switchover. Also note, that any previous backups you've done will be overwritten. macOS can help make switching calendars easier. Image: Screenshot If you want a two-way sync, which you might if you're using your Android phone with an Apple laptop, then it's a lot more complicated. The best option, really, is to switch to using Google contacts and calendars as much as you can, and then adding your Google account to the relevant apps in macOS (Add Account from the main app menu in both cases). Even then you need to make sure you're always adding events to the Google calendars (or contacts) and not the iCloud ones for them to show up on your phone. If you absolutely must keep both Google and iCloud services running concurrently, and syncing with each other, then you'll need to put your trust in a third-party app for macOS or Android. Photos and videos Since Google Photos came into the world it's actually pretty easy to get all your personal photos and videos moved over to Android, via Google's servers, as long as they're all still on your iPhone: Install Google Photos for iOS, opt to back everything up, and away you go. You can either pay Google for storage and keep everything at full resolution, or accept some resizing (images max out at 16 MP, videos at 1080p), and store as many photos and videos as you like on the web, free of charge. The process is even more straightforward if you use the Google Drive app as we described in the section above, and Google Photos even supports Live Photos these days, using those extra few frames of animation to create a GIF for you. The only negative is that the albums you've created in iOS don't get copied over (everything appears as one long list of pictures), so you need to create them again. Google Photos can transfer images and videos. (Image: Google) All that is easy enough but if you've got photos in iCloud you've moved off your iPhone then you might have a problem or two on your hands. As we explained in our full guide to the topic of switching between Apple Photos and Google Photos, just about the only option open to you is downloading them all from iCloud to a macOS or Windows machine then uploading them again using a Google Photos client. It's a little convoluted but it's manageable, and it's a lot easier than using the export options in iCloud on the web, which are practically non-existent. If you don't have a computer to act as the middleman between iCloud Photo Library and Google Photos then you're stuck — you'll have to borrow a laptop from someone. Music and movies As we now have Apple Music on Android, getting your iTunes music on your Android device is no longer the exercise in frustration it once was. As far as tunes you've actually purchased directly from iTunes, it's probably the best option out there, though you do need to have signed up for an Apple Music subscription to be able to use the app and get at your purchases. Otherwise, it depends on where your music is and how it's stored. Any plain old MP3s you were syncing to your iPhone from iTunes can be uploaded to Google Play Music instead (50,000 of them can be stored for free), or you can use something like DoubleTwist, which is just about the leading choice if you want to keep on using iTunes alongside Android for your music. If you're signed up for Spotify you just need the Android app. Apple Music, now on Android. Image: Screenshot Likewise, if you've been accessing all your movies and TV shows through Netflix, Plex or Google Play Movies & TV then you just need to find and install the relevant app for Android and you're ready to go. All these services let you stream to multiple devices from a single account, so you can carry on using your iOS device if you need to. However, any videos you've purchased from iTunes won't run on Android at all — there's just no app to do it unless Apple ever gets around to making one. Several tools out there will do the job of removing iTunes DRM for you, but since we're getting into murky legal territory with that, we'll leave you to discover them for yourself. If you've invested hundreds of dollars in an iTunes digital library then you can still watch it on macOS, Windows, and the Apple TV, but not Android. Apps and games Generally speaking, all the apps you use on your iPhone are going to be available on Android as well, though there are a few exceptions — like Overcast and Day One. In terms of paid-for apps, you're going to have to pay for them all again, unfortunately, though something like a Spotify subscription buys you access on both Android and iOS. Whether all your data (from documents to saved games) moves over with you is another matter and worth checking up on before you make the switch. If you're in any doubt, get in touch with the developer directly to see what the situation is (you might be out of luck with anything that relies heavily on the iCloud storage system). Some paid-for iOS games, like Alto's Adventure, are free to play on Android. (Image: Noodlecake Studios Inc) We can't give you a guide to everything out there, but think about your productivity, fitness, and banking apps. Assess how much data is stored locally and what's going to happen to it. If you can, keep your old iPhone and new Android phone running alongside each other for a while until you're certain everything's been moved over successfully without too many bumps in the road. You might not believe it if you've read everything that's above, but moving from iOS to Android is actually much easier than it used to be, thanks mainly to an increased focus on cloud services (even, belatedly, from Apple itself). As long as you take your time, and don't live your life inside iMessage, you don't have to feel daunted by the task.

Android though? It would constantly hassle and nag me to create a gmail and convert my custom domain google account into an alias. No thanks. All major phone OS support exchange or imap, if you use it for syncing your emails, calendar and contacts it doesn't matter what phone you buy, or if you lose your phone, you will always get them back. Don't get suckered into ANY walled garden whether it be Apple, Google, or even your ISP's email (especially the awful pop3 options). They all exist to keep you as a customer and make moving inconvenient, without offering any real benefit. I have moved from iOS, to Windows Phone, to Android and back to iOS without going through any of the bullcrap in this article, because I set up exchange email/contact/calendar sync from the very beginning on my first smartphone. Now with Windows 10, all the exact same things are synced live. Just make sure your photos are backed up, especially if they're the only place you have 4000 photo's of your children, and you're free of the shackles Apple and Google hope to restrain you. Reply -3 mark_d @mark_d May 29, 2017, 11:46am It would constantly hassle and nag me to create a gmail and convert my custom domain google account into an alias. No thanks. Not once has android ever asked me to convert my custom domain to a gmail service. Try again. Any gmail account is required to use the app store. Gosh, who would have thought just like Apple. Don't get suckered into ANY walled garden whether it be Apple, Google, or even your ISP's email 100% agreed.

Why doesn't my iPhone need to be scanned by anti-virus/anti-malware software? Why am I bothering to put these point to you? I'd use a windows phone before I would return to an android zombie phone. Reply -2 pformagg @pformagg May 29, 2017, 10:58am For 100% customisation and illegal apps. I would say 99% of Android users don't root their phones. Reply 3 soldant @soldant May 29, 2017, 11:02am When I had a Galaxy Note (first one) I rooted to do a custom Android install to make the phone faster and better on battery life... because Samsung did a shitty job with the stock install. Some devices can benefit quite a bit from root and customisation, particularly those afflicted by bloat or lower end hardware. Some software relies on root to work. The vast majority of users don't need it and probably don't even know what it is. Reply 0 mark_d @mark_d May 29, 2017, 11:48am Why do iPhone users have to root the phones by their owners?

It's not fast (few of them are in Australia, I think OneDrive is probably one of the better ones myself) but it's still way better than iCloud Photos, which has the most ridiculous syncing system ever. Reply 0 lunchbox99 @lunchbox99 May 29, 2017, 3:55pm Yeah totally ridiculous how you just take photos and they magically appear on your tablet or laptop/desktop (windows or mac). Such a hassle. Reply 0 soldant @soldant May 29, 2017, 4:34pm You can't selectively sync though, and it still keeps a local copy that chews up local storage. There's no way to really control it. One of the best parts of syncing is the ability to move stuff off local storage (especially given how absurdly expensive storage is on iOS devices). Reply 0 lunchbox99 @lunchbox99 May 29, 2017, 3:54pm Wtf? You spent $20k on itunes? You must have rocks in your head...lol. I thought I went too far buy $300 worth of itunes cards at 25% off sale to get music. At least the music files are DRM free. Reply 0 Join the discussion!

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AI Why the Google Home speaker didn’t quite help me adopt a dog John Brandon@jmbrandonbb May 28, 2017 10:19 PM Image Credit: Shutterstock.com/MesquitaFMS I’m debating whether my family should adopt a new pet. About ten years ago, my son picked out a border collie mix at the Humane Society near my house. Abby has been struggling with hip problems lately, but she’s mostly as eager as ever to head out on a walk. Still, she could use a companion other than the humans at home from college this summer and a cat that is only marginally interested in acknowledging her existence. I’m also thinking of moving back to the country. If you must know, we’ve lived in a busy part of Minneapolis for a few years now. Before that, we lived in the country on a five-acre hobby farm. The pets ran wild and free in sun-soaked fields. Here, not so much. If we end up moving soon, we’ll likely adopt another dog or two. (The jury is still deliberating about adopting more cats.) That’s why, when I heard that the Google Home speaker and it’s Assistant bot can guide you through the process, I was interested…and a bit skeptical. I first asked about dog breeds that get along best with cats. The first one listed caught my attention — a Golden Retriever. Interesting. This mild-mannered breed makes sense. I took care of one over the summer as a teenager, and they tend to be calm and subdued. That helped me get rolling on asking a few more questions. I asked about the friendliest bred and the smallest. I asked about nutrition. Everything was working wonderfully so far. However, things started to break down a little. I asked which breed gets along with cats the least, and the Assistant on the speaker didn’t know the answer. That was perplexing to me — why would the bot know the friendliest dog breed for cat owners but not the least friendly? It must be a Dobermann Pincher or a Pit Bull, I thought. Who knows? Next, I started asking about where to adopt a pet. This all led to some blank stares from the bot (or at least a few long pauses). Google Home can answer a few basic questions about pets, but also missed a few easy ones. More importantly, it didn’t link the search for a proper breed to the act of actually locating one. That was one major strike again the voicebot market. Google Home did let me ask about pet care. I asked the voicebot about exercising a new dog, which worked fine. Google Home didn’t realize there’s a dog park near my house — kind of off the Google Maps, you might say — and suggested a much more professional one across town. My guess is that Google only knows about dog parks that have a website. Of course, you can’t see pictures of dogs or check on adoption prices. I feel voicebots have become part of my daily routine, but there’s one big issue. For now, it’s a diversion and a bit entertaining. What if it becomes impractical? If the voicebot only helps to an extent, and then we have to retreat to a computer or a smartphone, it ruins the experience. Google Home didn’t help me find a dog, but at least it did help me think about next steps. Once we move, maybe the bot will become advanced enough to complete the entire process. Otherwise, I might end up find a new dog the old-fashioned way — by going to the Humane Society in person and wandering around.

Adam Turner May 29, 2017, 12:30pm ⋅ Filed to:  amazon alexa Australian Stories automation feature google home siri smart homes smh Share Image: Supplied With Belkin's WeMo gadgets finally set to take orders from Apple's Siri, the smart home giants are vying for the coveted position of household butler – acting as liaison between the lord of the manor and your digital servants. Apple's Answer To The Amazon Echo Sounds Creepy According to a new report from Bloomberg, Apple is moving forward with plans for a smart home hub, joining the Amazon Echo and the upcoming Google Home device in the battle to take over your house. Read more A smart home is supposed to make life easier but things soon become complicated when you're trying to juggle a dozen different smart gadgets using a dozen different smartphone apps. It's worse if you don't live alone and your loved ones are also trying to navigate your smart jungle, especially youngsters who might not have a smartphone in their pocket. Initially it looked like the easiest solution was to swear your allegiance to a single smart home ecosystem, ensuring all your tech played nicely together, although this can limit your options and become expensive compared to taking a best of breed approach. Can Google Home Really Kill The Amazon Echo? As soon as Google announced its new Home device last autumn, everyone (including this blog) was quick to call it an Amazon Echo Killer. But since then, the Echo has gained some new powers. So how do the two gadgets stack up in a head-to-head spec battle? Pretty evenly — except for the price. Read more This where a smart assistant can come to your rescue, like Tony Stark's AI-powered butler Jarvis. Rather than commanding each gadget in your home separately, you simply tell the butler what you need and it ensures that your will is done, regardless of which gadgets are required and what brand names they bear. Voice-controlled smart benchtop speakers such as Google Home and Amazon Echo are shaping up as the best candidates for the job. Rather than reaching for your smartphone you simply tell Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa what you need – using natural language rather than barking orders – and they take care of the rest. Meanwhile Harman Kardon's new Invoke smart speaker is bringing Microsoft's Cortana into homes, putting even more pressure on Apple to follow suit rather than relying on Siri built into smartphones and tablets. Microsoft Reveals Cortana-Powered Rival To Amazon Echo And Google Home With Microsoft's Build developer conference just two days away, the company has revealed one of the most anticipated announcements from the event. A new Cortana-powered speaker made by German audio giant Harman Kardon. Read more Think of these smart assistants a bit like a Logitech Harmony universal remote control which manages your entire home, focusing on tasks rather than devices. Tell your smart assistant what you want to do and it will execute a complicated string of commands across multiple devices to make it happen. Of course if you own a programmable universal remote like the Logitech Harmony you'll know that, while they're easy to use, they're a pain to set up. That's the next big challenge for the smart home, to make it simple for your average punter to integrate their smart speaker with third-party smart gadgets and ecosystems like Belkin WeMo, along with smart gateways like If This Then That. How To Make Google Assistant And Amazon Alexa Do Whatever You Want Image. Alex Cranz/Mario Aguilar/Gizmodo Our peaceful homes are being invaded by talking Bluetooth speakers and there's nothing you can do about it — so you might as well enlist the help of these AI-powered hubs and get them to do your bidding. Here's how to set up your own custom voice commands on Google Home or the Amazon Echo. Read more Of course you don't want to make things too simple and there will come a time when smart assistant makers are forced to restrict home admin rights to certain voices, lest your young children discover the full power at their disposal. Setting up Google Home to control WeMo gear is surprisingly simple and you can do it right now in Australia, it only took me five minutes. You just need to temporarily change your smartphone's location and language to US English, after which you can add smart home gear from WeMo, Nest, Philips Hue, LifX, Samsung SmartThings and a few others. Belkin's WeMo Smart LED Bulbs Put The Light Switch On Your Phone Belkin continues its pursuit of making home automation a simple plug-and-play affair with the introduction of its new Smart LED lightbulbs to its WeMo line. The 60-watt equivalent bulbs produce 800 lumens and cast a warm 3000 Kelvin glow across a room — so they should satisfy even those who've stocked up on incandescent bulbs. Read more Once they're linked to Google Home you can switch back to Australian English and still ask the smart speaker to turn on WeMo switches and other devices around your home. My next challenge is to see if I can hook up a Nest smart thermostat to my heating and cooling, to put them under the command of Google Assistant. Even Apple's traditionally closed ecosystem is opening up. You'll find a lot of AppleKit-compatible gear from the likes of D-Link and Elgato, but AppleKit-compatibility is also coming to Belkin's WeMo range so you'll be able to ask Siri to control your WeMo devices. Belkin WeMo Insight Switch: Australian Review The WeMo family of smart home gadgets and internet-connected appliances is growing. We've had quite a long wait for this particular apparatus, but you're finally able to pick it up in a JB Hi-Fi or Bunnings Warehouse near you — Belkin's energy-monitoring WeMo Insight Switch is finally available in Australia, with an Australian power plug. Read more Rather than one smart home ecosystem to rule them all, it looks like we're destined to choose one smart assistant to bring order to the smart home chaos. Have you put smart gadgets to work in your home and how do you keep them in order? Setting Up Your First Smart Home Getting started in the world of home automation may seem daunting, but it’s actually fairly simple. Depending on your goals, it can also be quite affordable, and even save you money over time. A smart home isn’t just some automatic lights either - there are loads of options to make day to day life that little bit easier. Read more This article originally appeared on SMH.

An utterly generic 250GB portable hard drive, already a few years old, with a couple of dings and scratches in its shell and with the beginnings of an audible click that would have eventually killed it. It had a data file containing 1400 Bitcoin on it. No big deal, at the time. Today, those few kilobytes are worth more than four million dollars.

A good example would be Google who in a report from Reuters, will now be working with the Vietnamese government in removing “toxic” content from its platform. Basically content that the government deems to be inappropriate will now be removed, or at least Google will entertain the idea of working with the government in seeing what sort of content can or cannot be removed. This follows a call by the government earlier in the year which pressured local advertising firms to hold off on advertising on platforms such as Facebook and YouTube until this “offensive” content can be dealt with. In a meeting between Alphabet’s Chairman Eric Schmidt and Vietnamese Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc, “Mr. Eric Schmidt said (he) will tightly cooperate with Vietnam to remove toxic information violating Vietnamese laws and will consider opening a representative office in the country.” However Google has stated that they currently have no plans of opening up an office in the country. In a statement made by spokesman Taj Meadows, “We have clear policies for removal requests from governments around the world, and those policies have not changed. We rely on governments to notify us of content that they believe is illegal through official processes, and where appropriate, will restrict it after a thorough review.” Filed in General.

Events Other Industry Events Jobs More About Mumbrella Freelance Directory Business Directory Advertise Subscribe to newsletter Features AANA CEO contenders emerge as global hunt for Gloster replacement continues A group of contenders is beginning to emerge to head the Australian Association of National Advertisers (AANA) after the announcement current CEO Sunita Gloster will head to Ten for a senior commercial and strategy role in August. Simon Canning looks at who's in the running. May 29, 2017 11:02 by Simon Canning 0 The global hunt is underway for the new head of the AANA at a time when the industry faces major structural reform after Sunita Gloster announced her move to the broadcaster just a week ago. Recruiters Hourigan International – which placed Gloster in the role originally – are understood to be seeking a mix of experience at CMO, MD or CEO level with a strong background in compliance and dealing with regulatory issues. AANA CEO Sunita Gloster revitalised the organisation Gloster took the reins of the AANA in 2013 at a point when the association was seen a a closed boys’ club that was failing to tackle major issues facing the advertising industry. During her tenure she increased the scope of the industry’s self regulation and began to use it as a platform to question major industry issues such as ad fraud and viewability, while increasing membership by more then 50 members. Gloster also launched the AANA’s annual Reset conference bringing celebrities such as Monika Lewinsky to Australia and launched a regular marketing-focused show on Sky News. The rise of the AANA also came with competitive tensions as the Australian Data Marketing Association (ADMA) broadened its scope and competed for members under the stewardship of Jodie Sangster, who has also increased the industry body’s membership exponentially. While the brief for Gloster was to rebuild the AAANA, the new CEO will face a range of significant challenges including the continued questions about transparency and the rise of programmatic buying. Another major issue the new AANA leader will face will be the impact of media reforms on the advertising market, with mergers and acquisitions expected to concentrate media ownership. Maintaining the viability of self-regulation in an increasingly deregulated market will be another challenge along with the role of advertising in protecting the future of journalism. Challenging the duopoly of Facebook and Google in digital media is expected to be another major issue the association will have to tackle on behalf of its members which, ironically, includes Google. With a fairly thinly layered executive team, the replacement for Gloster is expected to be an external appointment, although there are a couple of possible contenders for the role who would allow the organisation a level of continuity in leadership. AANA head of legal and regulatory Simone Brandon a possible internal candidate for the role Internally the most likely candidate is Simone Brandon, the AANA’s director of policy and legal affairs. Brandon joined the AANA in 2014 and has been in charge of developing the the association’s road map for future regulation. While her background is firmly rooted in legal, her previous roles as deputy general counsel and head of the marketing and communications teams with Vodafone Australia deliver the background the could be a  strong foundation for the next stage of the AANA’s evolution. Her skills could prove particularly advantageous if the impact of media reforms on the industry become a major focus. At the same time her affinity with emerging technologies could also come into play. However, sources close to the AANA have signalled that the appointment is more likely to be an external one with a number of serious contenders currently between assignments. Former AANA chair Inese Kingsmill would have been a front runner but for her move to Virgin Australia One major contender could have been Inese Kingsmill, former head of marketing at Telstra, a former chairperson of the AANA and a close confidant of Gloster. However Kingsmill’s recent appointment as CMO of Virgin Australia has taken her out of the mix before the job vacancy was even announced. FMCG marketing veteran John Broome is on the board of the ASB and remains close to the AANA John Broome, former marketing lead with FMCG giants Unilever, Kellogg’s, Nestle and Goodman Fielder, is emerging as the contender with the biggest potential. Broome has remained close to the AANA as a board member of the Advertising Standards Bureau. Currently working as a consultant after leaving Unilever in the wake of a restructure in March, Broome would bring a broad level of experience to the role, with a particular understanding of the pressures facing FMCG businesses and those marketing food products – one of the flash-points of self-regulation when it comes to food advertising and children. Broome has also been outspoken, warning marketers not to fear the challenges of connecting with millennials who value“authenticity” and “transparency” which were becoming keys to building a brand. Sophie Madden’s experience running an industry association would be invaluable Sophie Madden, currently CEO of the Media Federation of Australia, is another strong candidate for the role. Madden has been at the helm of the MFA for more than four years, but boasts a strong pedigree having previously held roles including marketing services head for Kraft Foods, global head of media for Vodafone Enterprise and media director for Unilever. Madden was the first CEO of the MFA and during her stint she has worked to raise the profile of the organisation. Over that time the MFA has set policies to deal with transparency in an era where the industry was rocked by major reporting scandals and the revelations some agencies were running value banks. She has also put in place programs to address massive staff churn in the industry – a project which is ongoing – and her experience running an industry body would allow her to slip seamlessly into the role. Sue Zerk has been a regular contributor to the AANA Sue Zerk, marketing director at 20th Century Fox, is another possible starter in the race. Zerk has been with the entertainment company for more than a decade and has been a regular contributor to the AANA. Her passion for the association matched with her understanding of its operations could see her as one of the front-running replacements for Gloster if she puts her hand up. ADMA CEO Jodie Sangster turned the organisation around From the department of unlikely-long-shots ADMA’s CEO Sangster has reinvented what was formerly known as the Australian Direct Marketing Association into a dynamic and multi-faceted organisation. A move to the AANA could be seen as a natural progression by some, with her experience working with major advertisers and handling tough regulatory issues. She has also raised the possibility of industry association mergers in the past. However, Sangster has also invested heavily in ADMA and may not see her job as ‘mission accomplished’ yet. Sue Morphet’s experience would be coveted by the AANA and its members Another big name who could be a consideration is former Pacific Brands boss Sue Morphet. Now juggling a number of directorships, Morphet would come to the role with a clear understanding of the needs of the membership and has been an effective agent of change in her past roles. However, mitigating Morphet’s potential candidacy would be her love for Melbourne and the fact she has a number of board positions which she would be unlikely to want to give up. Gloster leaves her role for new pastures at Ten in August, but the search could go beyond that date. Whoever steps up to lead the advertiser advocate in its next stage could face one of the most challenging periods in the organisation’s history. Not since the Federal Court scrapped the advertising industry accreditation system in the mid 1990s has the AANA faced new challenges on such a scale. Just who gets what will be a very public-facing job will be a clear pointer as to how Australia’s advertisers aim to tackle the new era of media reform and digital development.

Soren Schwertfeger, center, and his team of assistants work on an automated arm in Shanghai, May 25, 2017. China, which for years watched enviously as the West invented the software and the chips powering today’s digital age, has become a major player in artificial intelligence, what some think might be the most important technology of the future. Photo: New York Times mail print View all comments Tweet By Paul Mozur AND John Markoff - - Published: 8:35 AM, May 29, 2017 HONG KONG — Dr Soren Schwertfeger finished his post-doctorate research on autonomous robots in Germany and seemed set to continue his work in Europe or the United States, where artificial intelligence was pioneered and established. Instead, he went to China. “You couldn’t have started a lab like mine elsewhere,” Dr Schwertfeger said. The balance of power in technology is shifting. China, which for years watched enviously as the West invented the software and the chips powering today’s digital age, has become a major player in artificial intelligence, what some think may be the most important technology of the future. Experts widely believe China is only a step behind the United States. China’s ambitions mingle the most far-out sci-fi ideas with the needs of an authoritarian state: Philip K Dick meets George Orwell. There are plans to use it to predict crimes, lend money, track people on the country’s ubiquitous closed-circuit cameras, alleviate traffic jams, create self-guided missiles and censor the Internet. Beijing is backing its artificial intelligence push with vast sums of money. Having already spent billions on research programmes, China is readying a new multibillion-dollar initiative to fund moonshot projects, start-ups and academic research, all with the aim of growing China’s AI capabilities, according to two professors who consulted with the government on the plan. China’s private companies are pushing deeply into the field as well, although the line between government and private in China sometimes blurs. Baidu — often called the Google of China and a pioneer in artificial-intelligence-related fields, like speech recognition — this year opened a joint company-government laboratory partly run by academics who once worked on research into Chinese military robots. China is spending more just as the United States is cutting back. This past week, the Trump administration released a proposed budget that would slash funding for a variety of government agencies that have traditionally backed artificial intelligence research. “It’s a race in the new generation of computing,” said Mr James Lewis, a senior fellow at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. “The difference is that China seems to think it’s a race and America doesn’t.” For Dr Schwertfeger, the money mattered. He received a grant six times larger than what he might have gotten in Europe or America. That enabled him to set up a full artificial intelligence lab, with an assistant, a technician and a group of PhD students. “It’s almost impossible for assistant professors to get this much money,” he said. “The research funding is shrinking in the US and Europe. But it is definitely expanding in China.” Dr Schwertfeger’s lab, which is part of ShanghaiTech University, works on ways for machines, without aid from humans, to avoid obstacles. Decked out with wheeled robots, drones and sensors, the lab works on ways for computers to make their own maps and to improve the performance of robots with tasks like finding objects — specifically, people — during search-and-rescue operations. Much of China’s artificial intelligence push is similarly peaceful. Still, its prowess and dedication have set off alarms within the US defence establishment. The Defence Department found that Chinese money had been pouring into US artificial intelligence companies — some of the same ones it had been looking to for future weapons systems. Quantifying China’s spending push is difficult, because Chinese authorities disclose little. But experts say it looks to be considerable. Numerous provinces and cities are spending billions on developing robotics, and a part of that funding is likely to go to artificial intelligence research. For example, the city of Xiangtan, in China’s Hunan province, has pledged US$2 billion (S$2.8 billion) toward developing robots and artificial intelligence. Other places have direct incentives for the AI industry. In Suzhou, leading artificial intelligence companies can get about US$800,000 in subsidies for setting up shop locally, while Shenzhen, in southern China, is offering US$1 million to support any AI project established there. On a national level, China is working on a system to predict events like terrorist attacks or labour strikes based on possible precursors like labour strife. A paper funded by the National Natural Science Foundation of China showed how facial recognition software could be simplified so that it could be more easily integrated with cameras across the country. China is preparing a concerted nationwide push, according to the two professors who advised on the effort but declined to be identified, because the effort had not yet been made public. While the size wasn’t clear, they said, it would most likely result in billions of dollars in spending. Mr Trump’s proposed budget, meanwhile, would reduce the National Science Foundation’s spending on intelligent systems by 10 per cent, to about US$175 million. Research and development in other areas would also be cut, although the proposed budget does call for more spending on defence research and some supercomputing. The cuts would essentially shift more research and development to private US companies like Google and Facebook. “The previous administration was preparing for a future with artificial intelligence,” said Mr Subbarao Kambhampati, president of the Association for the Advancement of Artificial intelligence. “They were talking about increasing basic research for artificial intelligence. Instead of increases, we are now being significantly affected.” China’s money won’t necessarily translate into dominance. The government’s top-down approach, closed-mouth bureaucracy and hoarding of information can hobble research. It threw a tremendous amount of resources toward curing severe acute respiratory syndrome, the deadly virus known as SARS, when it swept through the country 15 years ago. Yet the virus was eventually sequenced and tamed by a small Canadian lab, said Professor Clay Shirky, a professor at NYU Shanghai and a technology writer. “It wasn’t that anyone was trying to stop the development of a SARS vaccine,” Prof Shirky said. “It’s the habit that yes is more risky than no.” Authorities in China are now bringing top-down attention to fixing the problem of too much top-down control. While that may not sound promising, Professor Wang Shengjin, a professor of electronic engineering at China’s Tsinghua University, said he had noticed some improvement, such as professional groups sharing information, and authorities who are rolling back limits on professors claiming ownership of their discoveries for commercial purposes. “The lack of open sources and sharing of information, this has been the reality,” Prof Wang said. “But it has started to change.” At the moment, cooperation and exchanges in artificial intelligence between the United States and China are largely open, at least from the US side. Chinese and US scholars widely publish their findings in journals accessible to all, and researchers from China are major players in US research institutions. Chinese tech giants like Baidu, Tencent and Didi Chuxing have opened artificial intelligence labs in America, as have some Chinese start-ups. Over the past six years, Chinese investors helped finance 51 US artificial intelligence companies, contributing to the US$700 million raised, according to the recent Pentagon report. It’s unclear how long the cooperation will continue. The Pentagon report urged more controls. And while there are government and private pushes out of China, it is difficult to tell which is which, as Baidu shows. Baidu is a leader in China’s artificial intelligence efforts. It is working on driverless cars. It has turned an app that started as a visual dictionary — take a picture of an object, and your cellphone will tell you what it is — into a site that uses facial recognition to find missing people, a major problem in a country where child kidnapping has been persistent. In one stunning example, it helped a family find a child kidnapped 27 years earlier. DNA testing confirmed the family connection. Baidu’s speech-recognition software — which can accomplish the difficult task of hearing tonal differences in Chinese dialects — is considered top of the class. When Microsoft announced last October that its speech recognition software had surpassed human-level language recognition, Baidu’s head of research at the time playfully reminded the US company that his team had accomplished a similar feat a year earlier. In an apparent effort to harness Baidu’s breakthroughs, China said this year that it would open a lab that would cooperate with the company on AI research. The facility will be headed by two professors with long experience working for government programmes designed to catch up to and replace foreign technology. Both professors also worked on a program called the Tsinghua Mobile Robot, according to multiple academic papers published on the topic. Research behind the robot, which in one award is described as a “military-use intelligent ground robot”, was sponsored by funding to improve Chinese military capabilities. Professor Li Wei, a professor involved in the Baidu cooperative effort, spent much of his career at Beihang University, one of China’s seven schools of national defence. A company spokeswoman said: “Baidu develops products and services that improve people’s lives. Through its partnership with the AI research community, Baidu aims to make a complicated world simpler through technology.” Still, there are advantages in China’s developing cutting-edge AI on its own. National efforts are aided by access to enormous amounts of data held by Chinese companies and universities, the large number of Chinese engineers being trained on either side of the Pacific and from government backing, said Prof Wang, of Tsinghua. Driving that attention is a breakthrough from a US company largely banned in China: Google. In March 2016, a Google artificial intelligence system, AlphaGo, beat a South Korean player at the complicated strategy game Go, which originated in China. This past week, AlphaGo beat the best player in the world, a Chinese national, at a tournament in Wuzhen, China. The Google event changed the tenor of government discussions about funding, according to several Chinese professors. “After AlphaGo came out and had such a big impact on the industry,” said Professor Zha Hongbin, a professor of machine learning at Peking University, “the content of government discussions got much wider and more concrete.” Shortly afterward, the government created a new project on brain-inspired computing, he added. For all the government support, advances in the field could ultimately backfire,Prof Shirky said. Artificial intelligence may help China better censor the Internet, a task that often blocks Chinese researchers from finding vital information. At the same time, better AI could make it easier for Chinese readers to translate articles and other information. “The fact is,” Prof Shirky said, “unlike automobile engineering, artificial intelligence will lead to surprises. That will make the world considerably less predictable, and that’s never been Beijing’s favourite characteristic.” NEW YORK TIMES mail print View all comments Tweet Recommended For You   More Stories For You The Most China&India READ COMMENTED “India really means business”: Iswaran ‘World’s heaviest woman’ leaves Indian hospital after surgery ‘World’s heaviest woman’ has surgery in India, loses 100kgs ‘World’s cheapest smartphone’ to be launched in India ‘Voldemort’ attacks up ante in China-Japan propaganda war US says China realises limited time to negotiate with North Korea Taiwan war games simulate invasion by China Taiwan court rules in favor of same-sex marriage, first in Asia Skin deep: How China’s scientists are putting colour into the complexions of ‘human’ robots Shut out from UN forum, Taiwan slams China’s ‘coercion, threats’ Ruling as a statesman helped Xi build up power: China expert Pragmatic Chinese women prefer to date men who earn two to three times as much as they do: Survey Plane skids off Hong Kong runway in heavy rain Pet wearables catching on in China Next Chinese aircraft carrier still on drawing board Inside Today World Warplanes hit Libya's Derna again: witness President Macron's party seen on top in French parliament election: poll Great white shark jumps into Australian fisherman's boat Philippines puts city on lockdown over fears of militant infiltration Driverless transit in Europe, yes.

Coincidence or not, it was interesting. And it made me wonder what else would change, if we kept watching. Would Google keep adding detail? And would Apple, like Google, also start making changes? So I wrote a script that takes monthly screenshots of Google and Apple Maps. And thirteen months later, we now have a year's worth of images. This is a fascinating article. Google is changing the look of the actual maps in Google Maps a lot, and improving its data all the time - whereas Apple seems to lag behind, and contains far less places of interest, stores, and so on.

Online Learning Update May 29, 2017 How Google Has Not Taken Over the Higher Ed Classroom Filed under: Online Learning News — Ray Schroeder @ 12:02 am by Joshua Kim, Inside Higher Ed My theory is that the reason that Google feels less present in higher ed is the LMS (learning management system). The LMS may be, as Phil Hill has so memorably opined, the minivan of education. A lack of glamour, however, does not mean that the LMS has lost its place as the central edtech platform. Every online course – and many residential courses – depends on the LMS. Google does not have an enterprise level LMS. Google platforms do not integrate with the SIS (student information system). Google – for all its centrality to the lives of students, faculty and staff – has done little to advance the learning in higher ed.  Imagine… https://www.insidehighered.com/blogs/technology-and-learning/how-google-has-not-taken-over-higher-ed-classroom Share on Facebook Comments Off No Comments No comments yet.

Current world champion Ke Jie was already on the ropes last week after being ground out in the first game by AlphaGo, the machine-learning powered AI from Google's DeepMind laboratories. And that didn't factor the fact that AlphaGo had already trounced Ke Jie, and practically everyone else, earlier in the year under the online account of "Master". Appropriate. But in the final two matches, the gap between humanity and AlphaGo became explicitly pronounced. It was one predicted that it would take a decade before AlphaGo would be capable of beating professional Go players. Back in the real world, where Ke Jie resigned against AlphaGo after a four hour battle in the third game, the Chinese world champion bleakly told the South China Morning Post that he would never be able to beat AlphaGo in his lifetime, and that he "made several bad moves, moves that I regret, because I wanted to play well too much". Oh dear. On the bright side, DeepMind announced that AlphaGo would be "stepping back from competitive play". It'll be used predominately in the Go world going forward as a teaching and analysis tool, since there's nothing left to achieve besides sending an entire generation of Go professionals into a spiral of manic depression. DeepMind will also be publishing an academic paper on how they improved AlphaGo's efficiency, and how it can be adapted for other applications. Maybe one application for AlphaGo could be finding ways to cheer Ke Jie up. Bloke looks like he needs it.

Reply 0 Casual Prolix @germinalconsequence May 29, 2017, 11:29am Most Sci-Fi tends to say that machines have little to no evolutionary capacity and that they will eventually try and recreate humanity in order to learn how to change. From a practical standpoint, this makes sense because an AI is just programming, not a complete simulacrum for a biological system. It still needs a processor, electricity and some kind of shell. It also needs to protect itself against corruption and deterioration just like we need to protect against viruses and the effects of aging. Cellular evolution works because mutations in genetics give rise to new pathways of possible stronger organisms. As a machine though you need to decide what those mutations should be so you are always limited by the capacity of your ability to think of them. You could try randomised algorithms but again, you're just imitating cellular evolution. Reply 0 namarrgon @namarrgon May 29, 2017, 1:29pm I'd say the existence of machine learning and genetic algorithms show that evolving machines are already here. While certainly inspired by biological life, machines do not inherently require biology to exist or improve - they can be just as capable of self-improvement from purely random "mutations", or more directed changes. Of course machines still currently require very specialised support environments to function, and are nowhere close to biology's sheer depth and diversity yet. But there's no evidence to suggest that this will never be the case, and the remarkably rapid improvement of neural learning algorithms suggest that, at least in software, AI that can "think" in useful ways may be far closer than we thought, even if this does not much resemble human thought.

Sidestepping the usual apocalyptic opinions on AI, it's interesting to think that our next evolution could come from creating an intelligence greater than our own, and then having it teach us how to be better as a species. Reply 1 DogMan @dogman May 29, 2017, 11:03am Yeah. I think augmented intelligence is the key to survival as a species. We've travelled so deep into the most important scientific fields that it now requires decades of education in order to be in the position to potentially make progress. With fewer and fewer people who posess the creative type of mind even being able to comprehend the problem, the less likely we are to actually solve it. With AI doing the heavy lifting and humans handling the creative, outside the box thinking we could achieve some great things. Just look how far the library of information on the internet has pushed us. Imagine that with the capacity to do more than just reference work.

Brett Hershman Benzinga May 28, 2017 Reblog Share Tweet Share View photos Maybe the Occupy Wall Street movement was looking to the wrong coast all along. A recent Bank of America Corp (NYSE: BAC)/Merrill Lynch report titled "Occupy Silicon Valley" shows that tech firms Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) valuations are higher than the GDP of every U.S. city besides Los Angeles and New York, and Apple is quickly gaining on L.A. While these figures do not mean these companies are actually worth more than those cities, it does present a relevant conversation about the sheer size and influence these firms have. Apple and Google essentially operate as their own countries, with massive power; their decisions have huge implications on the market and how citizens operate, communicate and conduct daily lives. Here at Benzinga, we wanted to take it a step further and see how these two tech giants stack up against countries worldwide, comparing Market Cap against GDP. Apple And Google Vs. The World (Figures In Millions) View photos apple_vs_the_world.pngMore Apple’s market cap is current just north of $796 billion, which would put it as the 17th most valuable country in the world, just ahead of the Netherlands, when compared to current World Bank data on global GDP. Google would rank as the 19th most valuable country in the world, ahead of international finance hub Switzerland, at a $672 billion valuation. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) would rank as the 25th biggest country in the world, just behind Poland, with a $467 billion market cap. While these are not apples-to-apples comparisons, it is the best way to gauge the sheer size the tech industry has amassed in the United States. With the presidency now hosting non-traditional and political amateur Donald Trump in the Oval Office, maybe Tim Cook — with his breadth of experience, financial prowess and general popularity — will capitalize and run for president in 2020.

The wages differ based on the number of family members and the size of the house. By Adnana Al-Shabrawi Okaz/Saudi Gazette Jeddah —  Hours before the start of Ramadan, search engine Google documented 467,000 pages carrying the sentence “searching for maids in Saudi,” and 257,000 pages with the words “housemaid sponsorship transfer” and “domestic help for hire for a month.” Despite the fact that agents are active weeks before the holy month fulfilling the need of families for domestic help in Ramadan, the online search for housemaids indicate that there is a thriving black market in this field. The fees for sponsorship transfer jumped from SR15,000 to SR35,000. The fee differs based on nationalities. There is an increased demand in Ramadan from families for domestic help, which is met by an increase in wages demanded by housemaids. Domestic helps also exploit the need of families and decide to work on an hourly payment basis in Ramadan, with wages ranging from SR25 to SR40 an hour. The wages differ based on the number of family members and the size of the house. It has been estimated that some of these housemaids earn between SR8,000 and SR9,000 in Ramadan. A Saudi female lawyer Najwa Filimban said that these ads constitute human trafficking which is banned by the Saudi law. She said that the ads on sponsorship transfer or sponsors allowing their housemaids to work for others for a fee are similar to slavery. Those who post such ads can be imprisoned for a maximum of 15 years and/or fined SR1 million. In Bahrain, authorities filed a case of human trafficking against a recruitment agency which placed an ad earlier this month offering an Ethiopian housemaid as a prize for a Ramadan contest. The contest had only one condition: the winner must have a work permit for the housemaid.

They believe that the web has a bedrock principle: The mighty broadband providers such as AT&T, Comcast and Verizon shouldn't be allowed to selectively slow down or block websites, and all internet data must be treated equally. This code, known as net neutrality, has been upheld in court. But the FCC is under Republican management these days, and its chairman believes these internet service providers should make their own rules. That includes allowing ISPs to charge websites such as Netflix higher fees for faster streaming, and shove lesser-known websites and free content into a slow lane - or, if they choose, block them entirely. It's not only about money, though consumers can expect subscription rates to rise for those websites that will pay higher tolls for using more bandwidth. It's also about these large corporate interests choking off content they don't like, and fast-tracking the content they support. For example, an ISP such as Verizon will favor Yahoo (which it owns) over Google, and subject Google to a toll hike to drive in the fast lane. ISPs would also be able to manipulate choices you make online by undermining the startups that cannot afford to compete in this new, fast-lane economy. That isn't about keeping the internet open and free or inspiring innovation, which should be everyone's aim. This is about giant telecoms with massive lobbying budgets creating a pay-for-play culture that will result in consumer gouging, and if anything merits public outrage and Congressional attention, this is it. Net neutrality preserved, but the game's afoot | Editorial FCC chairman Ajit Pai says he expects the ISPs to act responsibly, so regulations shouldn't be imposed on them because of hypothetical risks of abuse. Spoiler alert: Pai is a former Verizon attorney, and his perspective on this issue is that of a disingenuous corporate lackey with a short memory. Before the current rules were imposed, Comcast deliberately slammed the brakes on Netflix's streaming speed in 2013, leading to an exodus of customers until the movie website paid "an arbitrary tax," as the Netflix CEO called it. And yes, ISPs restrict information because of politics: Verizon once blocked texts from NARAL, the pro-choice advocacy group; AT&T cut off the streaming audio of concerts that were critical of President Bush. Pai also leaves out the part about cable/internet companies being monopolies in the regions they serve: Americans have no alternative to the mostly lousy service they pay for. Your privacy is now for sale, thanks to N.J.'s GOP reps | Editorial Now the open internet is in the crosshairs of another president, one elected as an economic populist, who promised to fight for the little guy against corporate interests. Little did his voters know that they were voting for higher cable and internet bills. This issue is not really partisan, but the rules will likely change with every new occupant in the White House. The solution could be legislative compromise, but it's not likely to happen in the current environment: The Republicans don't believe in ceding authority; the Democrats say there is no need for compromise because net neutrality was affirmed by the courts 11 months ago, and the public demands it by a 61-18 margin. Still, Pai will ram this through, because he's a corporate shill masquerading as a public servant, and it will likely end up back in court. But Congress should not wait for the courts to reestablish the ground rules: It should listen to its voters, including the 4.4 million internet users who carpet-bombed the FCC website back in 2014, which led to the current regulations. The public has 80 more days to comment on the FCC proposal, but that's only half the job: It must remind its representatives in Congress that corporations shouldn't be allowed to decide what we do online, and reaffirm that the FCC's duty is to enforce that principle. This is too important a fight to leave to political hacks. Are your interests served in Congress? Use this tool to keep track.

Tech Apple Science Cars Samsung Nintendo Switch iPhone 7S & 8 E3 Memorial Day Deals     Emojis In Android GO Are Redesigned By Google Posted: May 28 2017, 10:39am CDT | by Ahmed Humayun, in News | Technology News     One of the most prominent signature changes that we see in each Android iteration is the redesigning of the standard emoji set. The trend started with the release of Android 4.4, Google has been constantly refining the emoticons of every next Android version, including Nougat. Don't Miss: Nintendo Switch with Neon Joy-Con in Stock Online The famous gumdrop-style emoji we have seen between Android 4.4 and Android 7.0 might presumably be changed now. Apple has been working designing and refining the tradition complete-round emoticons and they seem to be working well for the users. We received a news today that Google has redesigned the set of emoji that will be used in Android O (or Android Go), they are now back to the tradition full-circle style. There hasn’t been much changes, except that the gumdrop is now substituted with the graphical representation of an emoji inside a complete circle. It is probably for the better too, due to Facebook’s preference of circular emoticons, people are much used to and fond of the traditional design of emoticons. Google’s gumdrop design doesn’t have that many followers, at least not enough for Google to keep them in Android O, as we can see. This story may contain affiliate links.

I know, it hardly sounds riveting. But bear with me here. According to the proposals, digital services that rely heavily on video - yes, that includes Facebook, Netflix and YouTube - will now be governed by the same regulatory framework as broadcasters like RTE, Canal+ and Germany's ZDF. The rules, initially proposed last May, aimed to promote European films, protect children, enshrine the independence of audiovisual regulators into EU law and crack down on hate speech. "The way we watch TV or videos may have changed, but our values don't," said Günther Oettinger, Commissioner for the Digital Economy and Society last year. "With these new rules, we will uphold media pluralism, the independence of audiovisual regulators and will make sure incitement to hatred will have no room on video-sharing platforms. We also want to ensure a level-playing field, responsible behaviour, trust and fairness in the online platforms environment." But there seems to have been some scope creep since last year. This week's revisions mean that TV broadcasters, video on-demand services and social media services that provide a significant amount of video will all be covered by the same rules. Critics say this one-size-fits-all approach is unwieldy, smacks of protectionism and damages net neutrality. But there is an upside, particularly for European media firms. Video platforms will now need to feature a minimum of 30pc of European-sourced content. Last year the number that was mooted was 20pc, so this is a considerable hike. The rationale for the change was that the promotion of European works is a cornerstone of cultural policy in Europe. These quotas mean the likes of Netflix and Amazon Prime will need to buy or commission considerable amounts of local content for the European market. Of course, the likes of Netflix and co aren't fans of quotas. They would argue that quotas promote parochial programming, rather than content more likely to appeal to a global audience. To make things worse, individual member states will also be able to make video platforms contribute financially to video production in the country where they're based, and in countries where they target audiences. This is another contentious issue, which could result in an uneven playing field for the online and pan-European platforms. Customers in one market may end up subsidising those in another. Also, like state and commercial broadcasters, social media companies like Google's YouTube, Facebook and Twitter are set to become legally obliged to counter hate speech, content that incites of justifies terrorism and which harms the "moral development" of children on their platforms. While social media companies and international video services are undoubtedly irked, European bureaucrats are delighted with themselves. The Maltese culture minister, Owen Bonnici, had this to say: "We are very proud to have reached an agreement on audio-visual media services. This is a complex directive which touches on very sensitive issues such as the internal market, fundamental rights and freedoms, cultural diversity and the protection of minors." These proposals need to be agreed with the European Parliament before they can become law. Then individual countries will then start transposing the directive into national law. But there's a pattern emerging here. Europe is taking a tough stance on citizens' data and safety. The introduction of the General Data Protection Regulation next year will add onerous overheads to companies that keep European citizen's data. Legislation was recently approved in Germany which would see social platforms slapped with fines of up to €50m if hate speech is not promptly removed within 24 hours of being flagged. And despite Brexit, the UK also is also on board. The Home Affairs Committee parliamentary committee concluded last month that "the biggest and richest social media companies are shamefully far from taking sufficient action to tackle illegal and dangerous content, to implement proper community standards or to keep their users safe". It also called for the publication of quarterly transparency reports, which cover safeguarding, enforcement of standards, and the number of staff working on safety. There is a fine balance, however, between protecting culture and protectionism, ensuring appropriate regulation and safeguarding innovation that supports investment and innovation in digital media.

AlphaGo defeated brash 19-year-old world number one Ke Jie of China over different days last week to sweep a three-game series on Saturday that was closely watched as a measure of how far artificial intelligence (AI) has come. AlphaGo last year become the first computer program to beat an elite player in a full Go match, and its successes have been hailed as groundbreaking due to the game’s complexity. Go has an incomputable number of moves, putting a premium on human-like “intuition” and strategy. But last week’s contests in the eastern Chinese city of Wuzhen were its last, said DeepMind Technologies, the London-based AI company that developed AlphaGo and which Google acquired in 2014. In a blog post on Saturday, DeepMind founder Demis Hassabis said AlphaGo’s developers would turn to “the next set of grand challenges, developing advanced general algorithms that could one day help scientists as they tackle some of our most complex problems.” These could include “finding new cures for diseases, dramatically reducing energy consumption, or inventing revolutionary new materials,” he added. “If AI systems prove they are able to unearth significant new knowledge and strategies in these domains too, the breakthroughs could be truly remarkable. We can’t wait to see what comes next.” Go involves two players laying black and white stones on a grid, trying to capture the most territory. Invented nearly 3,000 years ago in China, it is played worldwide but is most popular in East Asia. Top players have been mesmerized by AlphaGo, describing its play as groundbreaking and opening up new ways of approaching the game. Likewise, AlphaGo’s feats have fueled visions of AI that can not only perform pre-programed tasks, but help humanity look at complex scientific, technical and medical mysteries in new ways. AlphaGo’s “thinking” is powered by millions of connections similar to neurons in the brain. It is partly self-taught, having played millions of games against itself.

Now that the phone has been available for a few months users are looking for the best Google Pixel screen protectors. Below are a few great options to keep your phone looking new. On October 4th the first phones made inside and out by Google were announced. The Google Pixel and a bigger XL. It’s the next generation of Android and an evolution of the Nexus brand. Those who bought one will need accessories. Read: Google Pixel XL Review More and more these days owners want to keep their devices protected. From cases and covers, to screen protectors. Here we’ll be offering up suggestions for some of the best protection. Including real glass screen protectors, which is what we’d recommend. While we’ve already detailed some excellent official accessories for the Pixel as well as 20 great cases, users want a lot of different things. This is one of the first Google phones with plenty of options too, which is nice. Out of the box Google’s new Pixel and XL are very durable. Made out of a strong all metal frame and bezels around the edges to keep your screen safe. The phone uses Gorilla Glass which resists scratches and damage, but a bad drop could still cause damage. Read: Android 7.1 Nougat: 5 Things to Know When it comes to protecting a smartphone, the first concern is usually the display. Screens often get damaged, or are broken due to drops, scratched from keys in a pocket or purse and many other scenarios. Luckily we’ve managed to find some great Google Pixel screen protectors already available, or coming soon. Everything from real glass screen protectors, privacy screens and more. For both models. Popular brands like Otterbox or ZAGG have screen protectors you’ll want to consider, and Verizon is selling a few as well. Below are typical HD Clear films for cheap protection, durable hardened and reinforced glass, and much more. These are the best Google Pixel screen protectors available today. We’ll update this post as more become available. InvisibleShield Glass for Pixel XL   1 / 10  Zagg is a pioneer when it comes to screen protectors. Being one of the first years ago to offer durable and safe protection for our phones. And they continue to do so in 2016. This is an InvisibleShield Glass screen protector made of hardened, re-inforced and strengthened glass just like what comes on the phone. From the company behind Zagg.  It's extremely resistant to scratches and damage just like the stock Gorilla Glass on the Pizel, and will act as a second layer of protection. If for whatever reason it gets a scratch, chip or crack, remove it and the phone is as good as new. Zagg is one of a few brands we always turn to for screen protection. Reviews suggest it doesn't cover the entire screen, which is by design as the glass has a slight curve on the edges. This is to prevent the "halo" effect many see on iPhones. It also makes the screen protector case friendly so it doesn't get pulled up and wasted. Keep that in mind before ordering.  Buy it Now from Verizon for $39.99   1 / 10 Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Share on Linkedin More In Accessories Insta360 Nano and Insta360 Air Camera Review: Fun 360 Photography for iPhone and Android The Insta360 Nano 360 degree camera for iPhone is the most fun I’ve had with a camer… 05/28/2017 17 min read Moshi IonSuit iPhone 7 Battery Case Review: Elegant Mobile Power The Moshi IonSuit is a simple, elegant iPhone 7 battery case that offers backup battery po… 05/23/2017 4 min read Adonit Jot Dash 2 Review: Best Stylus For Any Tablet or Phone iPad and iPhone users that want a fine-point stylus for their devices should give the Adon… 05/21/2017 7 min read Load More In Accessories 11 Comments 11 Comments drapperme 10/30/2016 at 11:26 pm I love the screen protector from the Gadgetshieldz which gives overall protection.

It’s absolute JUNK. Fitted as per instructions but the edges lift off and attract dirk. It’s JUNK JUNK JUNK Reply James 12/30/2016 at 11:42 am I completely agree! I purchased the Zagg product as well, and it’s probably one of the worst products I’ve purchased in the last 5 years. It doesn’t fit the display completely, leaving–not the screen–but the DISPLAY exposed on one side or the other. In addition, mine is also bubbling up and peeling off. Reply ThirtyOne34 11/04/2016 at 7:11 pm You didn’t even try to check your facts, did you? This article is based on advertisements… :-( I’m looking for a glass screen protector which covers the whole screen, but if I look up reviews of the ZAGG one you recommend for example, I only get bad reviews which state it doesn’t even cover the visible screen. One review on the ZAGG site itself states ZAGG support said they’re working on a new version… Reply daz 11/09/2016 at 4:16 am Poor review of the Zagg, luckily I got a refund. Too small even for displayable portion of screen. I will never read your reviews again! Reply Mike 12/29/2016 at 10:54 pm Your dumbass advice on zagg cost 40 bucks for a POS. Does NOT cover the screen fully. And air is under it in two days. Thanks a lot, don’t quit your day job bozo Reply Carlos 02/19/2017 at 8:22 pm I’m real surprise you have ZAGG as #1, it has received nothing but bad reviews. Mostly for not fitting properly. Second you say you can get it at Verizon for $39.99 which is overpriced. I searched and found you can get it at Wal-Mart for $17.99. Bad information. Reply Bobby 02/24/2017 at 9:43 am Spigen Full Cover Glass Google Pixel XL Screen Protector with Tempered Glass for Google Pixel XL- Black $9.99 https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01N63XLQ6/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Reply Jeremy Williams 05/28/2017 at 9:30 am Apparently another review site that equates money spent on advertising, with actually having a quality product. Zagg invisashit is trash. I replaced mine after a month from mysterious cracks that appear while pocketed. Watching more closely the second time, I began to see stress fractures that evolved into cracks in DAYS. They say the screen protector is made from the same Gorilla Glass as the Pixel? I’m afraid I have to call bullshit on that, as my screen is perfect, but I have a new or extended crack in my screen protector almost daily. Clearly the screen protector doesn’t match the flexibility of the phone. In their defense though, I’ll say I’ve never seen damage from dropping, or scratches. I’ve also not had any of the air bubbles that other reviewers have seen, unless you count the edge of the FLAT screen protector not gluing down around the sides of the CURVED phone screen (is there an engineer in the house?) resulting in an additional eighth​ inch of screen lost to distortion. The end result is a wavy effect like I superglued the protector down at home (and in the dark maybe), instead of paying triple what the product was worth so the Verizon store would put it on to save me the hassle, as I did both times. Clearly neither Zagg, nor this site, have strong feelings about putting out a quality product. Reply Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

May 28, 2017 9:12 AM   Subscribe I travel a lot. I bought a Google Pixel LS laptop in the USA last year. us$1300. This week, while in Canada, it stopped working. Google support admits it's faulty and has offered to replace it. However, refuses to ship replacement to me in Canada and insists on shipping to USA, where I won't be for months, well after the warranty expires. This seems absurd and wrong to me... trapping your customer without a computer. I'd like to switch to a competitor, but am curious if this is an industry-standard thing. Would Samsung, Apple, Dell, etc? be as quick to say "Too bad", or would they try and help a customer regardless of where in the world they are when their device dies through no fault of their own? Am I completely out of touch. How do photographers who travel deal with warranties in far off places for expensive pieces of tech? posted by You Should See the Other Guy to Shopping (7 answers total)   This seems bananas to me. Have you made some noise on Twitter about this? What about your credit card (that I assume you purchased with) - any help there? posted by getawaysticks at 9:36 AM on May 28 I have tried to replace a defective product outside of the market it was sold for (Japanese Playstation console) and they similarly refused. I suspect warranties are usually written to work this way. But I'm sure there is some brand out there with better warranties or better customer service, or maybe some special policy you can buy. I just don't know what it is! posted by grobstein at 9:40 AM on May 28 [1 favorite] I only have 40 followers on Twitter. I don't think it would do much good. (Plus, I don't really understand Twitter and have no idea what I'd say in 140 chars that would grab attention). I have not contacted my Credit Card company and am unsure why they would care. Google is saying the warranty is good, they're just not willing to ship outside USA (or allowing me to pay the extra shipping). It was just a standard Visa -- not a fancy card with bonus warranty features and such. grobstein, I can understand it with some items. But phones and cameras and laptops -- things that are meant to travel? Doesn't make sense to me. It's not like it's a refrigerator. :) posted by You Should See the Other Guy at 9:53 AM on May 28 Since you asked about other companies: I purchased my last iPhone in the States and had no trouble getting it serviced by Apple in Canada under warranty. I seem to remember that at the time it was an unspoken rule. Now it's explicitly stated. From the Apple site: If the product is portable, meaning that it can operate independently without a power cord, you may obtain warranty service worldwide. However, service will be limited to the options available in the country where service is requested. If the product is not portable, warranty service may be restricted to the country where the product is purchased. So, yeah. That's some cold garbage from Google. Edited to add: Your credit card company is not going to care on some outrage principle, no. But some cards offer extended and/or independent warranty coverage. It's often buried in terms but if you call customer service they can probably just tell you. It's offered on a lot of cards — it's not limited to platinum-level stuff, FWIW. posted by veggieboy at 10:31 AM on May 28 [1 favorite] This used to be a a thing you could get with thinkpads (basically global concierge service) but I'm not sure if that is still an option. posted by rockindata at 10:35 AM on May 28 Unfortunatly the limits on international warranty service are common. However we lived in Canada and bought many things that only ship to the States. We have a US postal service/mail forwarding place that we used, SCC Parcel in Port Huron, MI that we could visit in person for package pick up or have them forward our packages to us in Canada. There are also many similar places in Port Roberts, just outside Vancouver. posted by saradarlin at 12:19 PM on May 28 Seconding Apple. Had the hard drive fail on my (US purchased) Macbook while in Japan. They replaced it in two days, no questions asked. There would probably be an issue if I needed a full laptop replacement since keyboards are different in Japan. (And phones as well. They use a different network and thus different hardware.) But US/Canada should be equivalent. You asked about photographers. Nikon has worldwide/international warranties on certain products, but not everything. It appears Canon has discontinued international warranties. (#4 here.) How do inernatinoal photographers deal? They don't travel with just one camera body or lens. If something gets broken/lost/stolen they can still work. posted by Ookseer at 6:29 PM on May 28 « Older French-Language Music Recommendations   |   What is a non-sexist alternative to the term...

The service has tens of millions more users than its closest rival, Apple Music. The world may love the services they provide, but the new generation of tech companies haven’t found much love on Wall Street recently. Spotify, the leading music streaming service, is hoping to change that with a share sale could lead another round of “unicorns” to try their luck on the US stock markets. Popular Searches QBE Insurance Group Ltd QBEIF ▼ 9.53 -0.34 -3.44% Tencent Holdings Ltd TCTZF ▼ 35.60 -0.14 -0.39% Premier Investments Ltd PMV ▼ 12.25 -0.02 -0.16% Ten Network Holdings Ltd TWG ▲ 0.1260 +0.0220 +21.15% Founded 11 years ago in Sweden by Daniel Ek, 34, Spotify currently has more than 100m monthly active users, of which 50m are paying subscribers. A successful debut for Spotify, valued at least $8.5bn, will officially crown streaming as the future of the music industry. The company’s closest rival, Apple Music, counts 20 million paying users; Tidal, fronted by the rap superstar Jay Z, a little over one million. Amazon and Google are also in the game, with Facebook a likely entrant. Ek, a serial entrepreneur who started his first company at age 14, owns a stake in Spotify valued at $1.8bn. But while he will leave this share sale a rich man, streaming will probably never make the sort of money for the music industry that CDs and vinyl did. Even so, after more than 15 years of disruption that kicked off with industry revenues eviscerated by illegal peer-to-peer file-sharing, the music business is currently celebrating its second straight year of growth. In 2016, streaming revenue increased 60%, while the overall global music industry grew 5.9% – the fastest rate of growth since 1997. According to a global music report issued by the industry group IFPI, music revenues hit $15.7bn in 2016, up from $14.8bn in 2015. Fifty per cent of that came from digital sales. A Goldman Sachs research note, Music in the Air, projects that streaming will help revenues double to $104bn by 2030. The industry’s begrudging acceptance of technology has proved its salvation. “This is the triumphant return of innovation,” says Les Borsai, music-tech entrepreneur behind the business-facing music platform SongLily. Instead of fighting consumer preferences, the labels “have come around to realizing that consumer demand for innovation drives the business”.

So we go to the streaming model that gives instant gratification, which is now the model for everything.” As recently as three years ago, artists were still sharing their doubts that music subscription services would ever be widely accepted. Taylor Swift pulled her music from Spotify in 2014. She later explained she was “not willing to contribute my life’s work to an experiment”. But significant hurdles remain. One is Google-owned YouTube, which dominates music streaming with a free, ad-supported model. While YouTube points to $1bn it paid back to the industry in advertising last year, payments to artists have not kept pace. Part of the issue, says Greg Barnes, general counsel of the Digital Media Association, is that copyright laws have lagged behind technology. “We want to make it easier to licence vast quantities of songs in an efficient manner. We need to make the system more efficient and more transparent.” While it may be hard to imagine a time when one hit single could sell 18m copies of a Twisted Sister album, today’s numbers are nonetheless impressive. Take the Canadian rapper Drake: last year, Spotify streamed his songs more than 4.7bn times. But music label executives also urge caution. They note that neither Spotify or its rivals have reported a profit. Cary Sherman, CEO of the music industry’s US trade group, noted in a blogpost that the improvement in revenues “does not erase 15 years of declines, or continuing uncertainty about the future”. Ek is listening. Last week, Spotify announced it had added four new board members, including the former Walt Disney chief operating officer Tom Staggs; Shishir Mehrotra, YouTube’s former head of product; Padmasree Warrior, who heads of the US unit of the Chinese electric auto firm NextEV; and Cristina Stenbeck of the Swedish investment firm Kinnevik. The appointment of Staggs, a 26-year veteran of Disney, was widely interpreted to signal that Spotify is looking to enter into the video-streaming market. The company previously added Netflix’s chief content officer, Ted Sarandos, to the board. It may not just be streaming that Spotify makes mainstream. The company is considering a direct listing on the New York Stock Exchange, an unusual tactic that avoids millions in underwriting fees and could help attract other tech unicorns – companies valued at over $1bn – to follow suit. Tech companies have traditionally favoured an initial public offering in which the company offers investors shares before it goes public. A direct listing only allows investors to buy shares through the open market. The move saves a fortune in fees but also – potentially – makes the sale highly volatile as long-term investors, like pension funds, who could have bought into the pre-sale of an IPO, will only decide whether to buy in once shares start trading. If approved, the Swedish streaming service could go public later this year, marking the first tech listing since the disappointing launch of Snap Inc, which lost $2bn in value after releasing disappointing results earlier this month. If the IPO is successful, other hot startups, such as Airbnb and Uber, could follow swiftly in Spotify’s wake.  Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

CEO Pete Johnston got the idea from trying to manage freelance designers at Google. The company, now moved to San Francisco, has raised $25 million from marquee investors including PayPal co-founders Max Levchin and Peter Thiel John Shinal | @johnshinal 17 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES Pete Johnston scribbles on a whiteboard at Kalo's headquarters Pete Johnston's plan to build "the world's most badass recruitment engine" could put a dent in Microsoft's plans to wring money from LinkedIn's 500 million users. Johnston, a former designer for Google and ad giant M&C Saatchi in London, and his backers, including PayPal co-founders Max Levchin and Peter Thiel, are betting that managing contract workers will one day become as valuable to corporations as hiring and paying their own staff. The start-up, formerly known as Lystable and now renamed Kalo, charges 3 percent of what its customers pay to contractors they hire through the platform. It's a bet on the growth of the freelance economy. A report out this month from consulting firm McKinsey suggested that the gig economy will be here sooner than later. The study said 20 to 30 percent of workers in the U.S. and Europe already do "independent work." For his part, Johnson said that "we know who they are, what they worked on and have access to their financial data." But before he and his 50-person start-up take on the world's largest software maker, Johnston first has to get used to a new name for the company, which until last week was called Lystable. That name had an air of exclusivity — as in, you needed special qualifications to be "listable"—and Johnston wanted to move away from that. So the company asked the 50,000 freelancers registered on its website to come up with ideas. Johnston also hired a consulting firm that came up with another 30 names. Yet the company's new moniker came not from either of those sources, but from a much more serendipitous process. Johnston earlier this month looked out onto San Francisco Bay, and saw two ships passing each other. As they crossed, the name of one was truncated to Kalo — and the proverbial light bulb went on. "It was an emotional decision," says Johnston. Managing freelancers is a mess He got the idea for the company while sitting in his Dublin apartment in 2014. He'd been working for a Google design unit in London that had just seven staff employees, but used more than 150 freelancers per year. The process, run on a platform made by "a large enterprise software company" he declined to name, was worse than cumbersome. Workers often were not paid quickly — and thus not exactly happy when Johnston and his co-workers asked them to come back for another project. At first, the software was designed to identify workers and assign them tasks. But those two steps weren't enough, Johnston said, as "the (freelance) process would then go into this dark place" when it came time to pay them. So the company, then based in London and still called Lystable, built a payment module, started charging a fee, and began signing up customers including Google, Airbnb, Expedia and The Economist. Soon Johnston, a native of Belfast in Northern Ireland, moved to San Francisco, convinced two marquee investors to back him, and opened a new office in this city's Financial District early this year. Microsoft's LinkedIn deal as validation "This is the sweet spot," Johnston told CNBC, while pointing to a group of silos he's drawn on the white board of the only conference room in Kalo's new headquarters. The silos represent various back-office functions now run largely by software from tech giants like SAP, IBM and Microsoft. Putting together back-office data on contractors "is the key to building the world's most badass recruitment engine," said Johnston. His talk of silos echoed one of the rationales given by Microsoft when the software giant acquired the professional social network LinkedIn for $26 billion last year. "Today, all the information a professional needs to be successful are in silos," according to a presentation Microsoft prepared to explain the deal. "By connecting all these apps and data, we can create more connected, intelligent and productive experiences," Microsoft said. Yet Johnston believes that managing contract workers will become more valuable as their ranks grow, and that "any company that tries to manage them like staff workers is going to run into problems" like those he saw at Google's London office. He added that Microsoft's LinkedIn's deal validates his business model, but is confident Kalo can measure up. "Do I think they'll attack the freelance market and build a module as fast as us? No," Johnston said. John ShinalTechnology Reporter for CNBC.com Related Securities Symbol Price   Change %Change PYPL --- GOOGL --- MSFT ---

Retires To Focus On Energy Conservation And Medicine (engadget.com) 117 Posted by EditorDavid on Sunday May 28, 2017 @08:19AM from the Go-gone dept. After "narrowly" beating the world's top Go player, what's left for Google's AlphaGo AI? Engadget reports: Now that it has nothing left to prove, the AI is hanging up its boots and leaving the world of competitive Go behind. AlphaGo's developers from Google-owned DeepMind will now focus on creating advanced general algorithms to help scientists find elusive cures for diseases, conjure up a way to dramatically reduce energy consumption and invent new revolutionary materials. Before they leave Go behind completely, though, they plan to publish one more paper later this year to reveal how they tweaked the AI to prepare it for the matches against Ke Jie. They're also developing a tool that would show how AlphaGo would respond to a particular situation on the Go board with help from the world's number one player. While you'll have to wait a while for those two, you'll soon be able to watch 50 games AlphaGo played against itself when it was training The first ten games that AlphaGo played against itself are already online. Shi Yue, 9 Dan Professional and World Champion, described them as "Like nothing I've ever seen before -- they're how I imagine games from far in the future." Google announced that this week's competition "has been the highest possible pinnacle for AlphaGo as a competitive program. For that reason, the Future of Go Summit is our final match event with AlphaGo... We hope that the story of AlphaGo is just the beginning." google ai skynet ← Related Links → Creative Commons Staff Members Release New Free eBook Google's AlphaGo AI Defeats the World's Best Human Go Player China Censored Google's AlphaGo Match Against World's Best Go Player Google AI AlphaGo Wins Again, Leaves Humans In the Dust Submission: World's best Go player flummoxed by Google's 'godlike' AlphaGo AI Working Theory In Jet Crash: IPhone In Cockpit Is To Blame Google Go-Playing A.I.

They have overcome Luton, Exeter and their own civil war to achieve promotion. It’s sad for Exeter, an extremely likeable team who were superior in the first half. Blackpool were terrific after the break, however, and ultimately deserved to win an excellent game. Brad Potts, who abused his lungs all day with some storming old-fashioned runs from midfield, and the classy Mark Cullen made one and scored one each. It’s a qualified triumph, because of everything that is going on off the field, but the players deserve oodles of credit. They were 15th at the start of March, and now they are in League One.

With a global ranking of 19, the country has an index score of 62.49, the highest in the Middle East and North Africa (Mena) region. INSEAD Business School, Google and the Centre for Economic Growth has released this year’s edition of the Middle East and North Africa Talent Competitiveness Index (MTCI), a study ranking countries in the region based on their ability to attract, grow and retain talent. Globally, Switzerland is ranked top in the index with Singapore, UK, US and Sweden, in the first five places. Qatar is ranked second in the region with an index score of 61.09, while Saudi Arabia and Bahrain are ranked fifth and sixth with index scores of 50.36 and 48.7 respectively. The countries were ranked based on the level of readiness for the future of work: well positioned (UAE, Qatar and Saudi Arabia, Bahrain); mixed readiness (Kuwait and Jordan); less well positioned (Oman, Lebanon and Tunisia) and low readiness (Egypt, Morocco and Algeria). The Middle East and North Africa Talent Competitiveness Index (MTCI) assesses a group of factors when determining a country’s ranking such as the set of policies and practices, and enabling context, that allow a country to attract, develop and employ the human capital which contributes to its ability to grow, compete and innovate. The MENA report draws from the Global Talent Competitiveness Index (GTCI 2017). The MTCI provides an in-depth look at Arab countries’ performance and lists a series of recommendations that would help improve their ranking, with investment in education and digital skills at the forefront. Embracing technology, enabling SMEs and providing affordable and high-quality access to the internet were also one of the key recommendations that were found to improve talent competitiveness on a global and regional scale. “From a demographic point of view, the MENA region is younger than the rest of the world, which is both a blessing and a challenge. On one hand there is energy, creativity and ambition in the new generation; on the other hand creating enough jobs for them is an urgent necessity,” said Dr Bruno Lanvin, Executive Director, Global Indices, INSEAD. The Mena region has invested considerably in education to improve competitiveness, with an average spend equal to 18 per cent of total government spending versus a global average of 14 per cent. Mena faces a common context: high youth bulge of about two times the global average (30 per cent employment in public sector versus 10 per cent globally), rigid labour market regulations and a gender gap with men three times more likely to participate in workforce than women. “With the highest youth unemployment rates in the world, our region’s biggest economic challenge is the creation of productive and sustainable jobs for our youth. A key requirement will therefore be developing the talent of the next generation to be competitive for the global economy. This important report enables leaders from the public and private sector to take the targeted actions required in order to achieve this strategic goal,” Patricia McCall, Executive Director, Centre for Economic Growth. Experts say technology is a critical dimension of this challenge as the jobs of the future need to be thought of in areas such as artificial intelligence, virtual and augmented reality, and lifelong continuous upskilling. Currently the Mena digital economy stands at 4 per cent of GDP (gross domestic product), half of what the US is at 8 per cent and lags behind the EU at 6. “The Middle East and North Africa has immense potential in its talent and young population. Major factors such as embracing technology, enabling the SME ecosystem to thrive, and providing equal access and connectivity, are key ingredients that would help Arab countries leverage the fourth industrial revolution with the many opportunities that lie within the region,” said Selim Eddé, Head of Public Policy at Google Mena.

Coren May 28, 2017 Dr. Molly Maloof looks over Silicon Valley (Michael Rubin) Share Written by Michael J. Coren May 28, 2017 Silicon Valley thinks our bodies need a reboot. PayPal founder and Donald Trump booster Peter Thiel, who plans to live for 120 years, is taking human-growth hormone pills (and possibly blood transplants from young people). Google spun off Calico in 2013 to defeat the inevitability of aging. Software engineers fast for days and order custom “stacks” of nootropics, or brain-enhancing substances, to gain a cognitive edge. One venture capitalist, requesting anonymity, said at a dinner he recently attended several people opened up boxes to pop nootropic pills before the first course. There’s no end to the experimentation people will undertake in pursuit of productivity, even if most treatments and supplements don’t yet have strong evidence or FDA approval. That hasn’t phased the patients that Dr. Molly Maloof sees in her Silicon Valley practice. “This is a place where people don’t give a flying fuck what they do with their minds and bodies,” she said. The general practitioner wants to see real medical rigor behind people tryingto hack their health. Her concierge medicine practice in San Francisco serves a small number of patients for anywhere from $5,000 for an initial assessment to upwards of $40,000 per year for comprehensive care (every patient has a second, primary care physician as well). Her clients are often engineers and executives looking to hit peak performance, or recover from an over-stressed work-life. Maloof, who earned her medical degree from the University in Illinois in 2011, sees part of her work as ensuring they they are doing it safely, backed up by the maximum amount of evidence. Dr. Molly Maloof Too often, she says, executives and entrepreneurs place performance above health. “All these people are not stupid … but what used to be domain expertise is now everyone claiming to be the expert,” she says. Maloof’s data-heavy approach begins with a battery of tests—measuring thousands of biomarkers in all—to understand her patients at the cellular level. By analyzing the results, she can prescribe food and lifestyle tailored to every individual, alongside standard western therapies. Only then does she consider pharmaceutical-grade supplements. If needed, she helps patients make better decisions (and practice harm reduction) about “performance-enhancing” substances from nootropics to micro-dosing LSD. Her philosophy, she says, is to do more than cure sickness, but to enhance health. Investors are betting this approach—optimizing one’s health through deep analysis of their genetics, physiology, and psychology—becomes the standard of care. Technology, they argue, will ultimately bring down prices so it’s affordable for almost everyone. Today, Maloof estimates less the 1% of private medical practices take this approach, but companies like Color Genomics, Forward, Nootrobox, Arivale, Metabolic Code, Habit, and Viome are already aiming to go mainstream. Maloof is surprised at the cavalier acceptance of DIY health at the intersection of technology and personalized medicine. “People will spend months researching which computer they will buy and then two minutes researching the nootropic brand they’re about to put into their body,” she says. Maloof sat down with Quartz to talk about her work and the future of personalized medicine. The interview was condensed and edited for clarity. Can you describe your practice? My practice has basically been an emergent phenomena: What if a doctor decided to optimize health instead of just fixing illness? The first thing I’ve done differently is I’ve positioned myself as a doctor who is aiming to improve the human condition rather than just get you from sick to not-sick. There’s this spectrum of disease. Most people are in the sick-to-average part of that spectrum. The athletes and movie stars of the world are at the opposite end at the optimal part of the spectrum. There’s this space between average and optimal that is a very grey area. It’s been sort of commandeered by the wellness industry: the people who perpetuate mindfulness, fitness, and nutrition, but maybe don’t have any rigorous medical training. And, as such, haven’t actually learned the basic science of the human body and how biology, physics, and chemistry works. How did your practice begin? I thought, if I was in a perfect world, “What would I want my health experience to look like?” I basically decided I would want a doctor to listen to me, and listen for a long time. In an ideal situation, it takes about two hours to ask all the questions I would want.  In a perfect world, your body is like the airplane and I’m the co-pilot   The second thing is that, typically when you get blood drawn from a doctor, you might get 10 biomarkers or lab [tests]. That’s just not very much information. And they don’t usually tell you there’s something wrong with you unless it’s really wrong. In my practice, I’m looking at 170 chemical biomarkers. Instead of normal or abnormal, I’m looking at a range of what’s good. Instead of just looking at blood, I’m looking at blood, urine, stool and saliva. Instead of just chemistry markers, I’m looking at chemistry, metabolomics (chemical fingerprints of cellular processes), genomics, microbiome (microorganisms), hormone tests, and I’m starting to look at immunology markers. That’s a very different experience. In a perfect world, your body is like the airplane and I’m the co-pilot and we’re using all these tools to identify if there are issues going wrong with the engine. How does your typical day go? How would a patient’s visit to your office be different? A typical patient is first going to have a meeting with me to go through all these questions, I’ll gather all the data and then send a phlebotomist to their house [to draw blood]. I get all the information back and then I sit back down with the patient and we will go over all of the report together. And that will take up to an hour and a half. At the end of that, we edit the decision together. So we decide what we we want to do. I come up with a summary, a one- to two-page summary, and then create a schedule for all their supplements and their nutrition, and then basically hand off the recommendations to any staff they have to help implement it, or just to them. Then I’ll check in with them in a couple weeks via text or via email or the phone and then we’ll repeat the process. We’ll take some of the labs that we did and then we’ll repeat that on a quarterly basis. And then we’ll go over the changes we see over time. Q: How long would a typical patient be with you? The real benefit comes after working for a year. Six months to a year is the minimum amount of time that we should be working together. And the patients who tend to go off the program, they come back to me eventually and they’re like, “Yeah, I fell off the wagon and I want to jump back on.” But it takes some commitment because you want to optimize health.  The patients that don’t do the best are the ones that think that everything is about the supplements, and everything is about the right supplements. Supplements are like the last mile of optimization.   The first and foremost thing you need to do is recognize that this is not an overnight fix. You’re not just going to feel amazing overnight. It’s actually about building these changes over time, and it makes a lot of difference if you recognize it’s like compounding interest. And the thing about it is that it’s not rocket science, but a lot of it is actually knowing what is right for your body and your lifestyle. And that’s going to be different for different people. Q: That’s tough what you’re describing. How many stick with it? I work with mostly entrepreneurs, investors, and executives. So I tend to work with people who, when I first evaluate whether or not they’re a fit for my practice, I can assess “how willing are they to do the things that I’m asking them to do?” If they’re a six out of 10, then I’m not going to ask them to do that. The patients that don’t do the best are the ones that think that everything is about the supplements, and everything is about the right supplements. Supplements are like the last mile of optimization. They can make a really big difference. But fundamentally, if your lifestyle is a disaster, for those people it’s about actually showing them what’s happening in their lifestyle and showing them how food is affecting them, giving them continuous glucose monitors, getting them heart-rate variability monitors, so they can glean some real insight around what’s happening day-to-day. Q: What are some of the more dangerous things patients come in doing? A big problem I see people buying everything they read on Bulletproof Coffee. I’m just like, ‘Guys, [Bulletproof’s founder] Dave Asprey has not figured everything out. First and foremost he’s a salesman and a marketer. And secondly he is a bio-hacker, and so let’s get real.’ Everything he’s recommending! Bulletproof Coffee [which has as much as 4 tablespoons of fat or oil per cup) is probably the worst idea that a person can do in terms of their health. The problem is there’s a large number of people that will have much higher rates of cholesterol, and some people will be fine on it. And people do it wrong: they add sugar to it, or eat sugary things, or don’t have the right genetics for that level of fat consumption. I’ve seen three patients now with really, really high cholesterol levels. Way, way above normal. I’m like, ‘What are you drinking in the morning? What does your routine look like?’ They say, ‘You know, I start my day with Bulletproof Coffee…’ And I’m like, ‘Are you? Oh no.’ Is what you’re doing scalable? What I’m doing right now is not scalable at all. I’ve been doing this practice in order to figure out what does scale. Because if you look at all this information, you’ll start to see things that make sense for larger populations of people, and I think this is where medicine could go if we had more convenience. Can this become a standard of care for most people, or will it be concierge medicine forever? Here are few things that have to happen. The health care system needs to recognize that what they are doing isn’t working for chronic disease, first and foremost. Second of all, we need large-scale studies on this kind of medicine. I’m looking at interventions from the perspective of what is the most sound, evidence-based recommendation I can make for this individual. If it doesn’t have evidence, why doesn’t it. Chinese medicine may not have much evidence in the western model but it has thousand of years of people using it. The question is, ‘Is it totally bullshit?’ Well, probably not. There’s probably some truth in it. Then we need doctors who want to learn how to do this. We have to be able to train them how to do this. When I was in med school, I thought there was a lot missing from my education: what about lifestyle, what about what happens after the patient goes home after the visit to the hospital?  The kitchen is no longer the medicine cabinet. The kitchen is now the place of ultra-toxicity and disease.  I saw this giant problem in my education, and I actually designed a course called, “Physician Heal Thyself, Evidence-based lifestyle.” I brought in all these doctors who are experts in sleep medicine, sleep, fitness nutrition, food as medicine, functional medicine, integrative medicine, osteopathy and acupuncture. I got them all in a room and said I want you to teach students what we’re missing. We need to make this medical school education and have to implement this into the board certification programs as well as board exams. If it’s not required, it’s not going to be taught. Finally, we need to be able to prescribe these things. We need food companies to do the research to show their food has outcomes that can improve human health. If we believe it’s medicine, then we need to study food as medicine. And we have to put it through the same rigor that we put drugs through. That’s going to happen. We’re not that far way, but one of the biggest things that needs to happen is a culture shift. Where do you think a practice like yours will be in five years? The way to explain this question is actually to look to the past. When I was trying to figure out if what I was doing was special, I started doing some research on doctors in antiquity. I found an interesting pattern. Most people in Greek and Roman times considered their kitchen to be their medicine cabinet. The women of the world were responsible for managing a lot of illness through food. So food as medicine was fairly widespread, but the wealthy and the gladiators and the kings, all of these people had special doctors. There’s always been doctors working with the elite and working with the athletes of the world. But the difference between now and then, is that the kitchen is no longer the medicine cabinet. The kitchen is now the place of ultra-toxicity and disease. I think in five years, I’m going to be, hopefully, speaking to the entire country through media and through public health campaigns (I’m going to build a platform around this) trying to bring back what we knew for thousands of years about how food can treat our disease and how plants are a source of healing and how the way that we are living our lives in modern times is antithetical to optimal health.

She grew up in Mississippi, gained a Rhodes scholarship, and she is also a Fulbright fellow, an Astronaut scholar and a Google Anita Borg scholar. Earlier this year she won a $50,000 scholarship funded by the makers of the film Hidden Figures for her work fighting coded discrimination. A lot of your work concerns facial recognition technology. How did you become interested in that area? When I was a computer science undergraduate I was working on social robotics – the robots use computer vision to detect the humans they socialise with. I discovered I had a hard time being detected by the robot compared to lighter-skinned people. At the time I thought this was a one-off thing and that people would fix this. Later I was in Hong Kong for an entrepreneur event where I tried out another social robot and ran into similar problems. I asked about the code that they used and it turned out we’d used the same open-source code for face detection – this is where I started to get a sense that unconscious bias might feed into the technology that we create. But again I assumed people would fix this. So I was very surprised to come to the Media Lab about half a decade later as a graduate student, and run into the same problem. I found wearing a white mask worked better than using my actual face. This is when I thought, you’ve known about this for some time, maybe it’s time to speak up. How does this problem come about? Within the facial recognition community you have benchmark data sets which are meant to show the performance of various algorithms so you can compare them. There is an assumption that if you do well on the benchmarks then you’re doing well overall. But we haven’t questioned the representativeness of the benchmarks, so if we do well on that benchmark we give ourselves a false notion of progress. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Joy Buolamwini at TED in November 2016. It seems incredible that the people putting together these benchmarks don’t realise how undiverse they are. When we look at it now it seems very obvious, but with work in a research lab, I understand you do the “down the hall test” – you’re putting this together quickly, you have a deadline, I can see why these skews have come about. Collecting data, particularly diverse data, is not an easy thing. Outside of the lab, isn’t it difficult to tell that you’re discriminated against by an algorithm? Absolutely, you don’t even know it’s an option. We’re trying to identify bias, to point out cases where bias can occur so people can know what to look out for, but also develop tools where the creators of systems can check for a bias in their design. Instead of getting a system that works well for 98% of people in this data set, we want to know how well it works for different demographic groups. Let’s say you’re using systems that have been trained on lighter faces but the people most impacted by the use of this system have darker faces, is it fair to use that system on this specific population? Georgetown Law recently found that one in two adults in the US has their face in the facial recognition network. That network can be searched using algorithms that haven’t been audited for accuracy. I view this as another red flag for why it matters that we highlight bias and provide tools to identify and mitigate it. Besides facial recognition what areas have an algorithm problem? The rise of automation and the increased reliance on algorithms for high-stakes decisions such as whether someone gets insurance of not, your likelihood to default on a loan or somebody’s risk of recidivism means this is something that needs to be addressed. Even admissions decisions are increasingly automated – what school our children go to and what opportunities they have. We don’t have to bring the structural inequalities of the past into the future we create, but that’s only going to happen if we are intentional. If these systems are based on old data isn’t the danger that they simply preserve the status quo? Absolutely. A study on Google found that ads for executive level positions were more likely to be shown to men than women – if you’re trying to determine who the ideal candidate is and all you have is historical data to go on, you’re going to present an ideal candidate which is based on the values of the past. Our past dwells within our algorithms. We know our past is unequal but to create a more equal future we have to look at the characteristics that we are optimising for. Who is represented? Who isn’t represented? Isn’t there a counter-argument to transparency and openness for algorithms? One, that they are commercially sensitive and two, that once in the open they can be manipulated or gamed by hackers? I definitely understand companies want to keep their algorithms proprietary because that gives them a competitive advantage, and depending on the types of decisions that are being made and the country they are operating in, that can be protected. When you’re dealing with deep neural networks that are not necessarily transparent in the first place, another way of being accountable is being transparent about the outcomes and about the bias it has been tested for. Others have been working on black box testing for automated decision-making systems. You can keep your secret sauce secret, but we need to know, given these inputs, whether there is any bias across gender, ethnicity in the decisions being made. Thinking about yourself – growing up in Mississippi, a Rhodes Scholar, a Fulbright Fellow and now at MIT – do you wonder that if those admissions decisions had been taken by algorithms you might not have ended up where you are? If we’re thinking likely probabilities in the tech world, black women are in the 1%. But when I look at the opportunities I have had, I am a particular type of person who would do well. I come from a household where I have two college-educated parents – my grandfather was a professor in school of pharmacy in Ghana – so when you look at other people who have had the opportunity to become a Rhodes Scholar or do a Fulbright I very much fit those patterns. Yes, I’ve worked hard and I’ve had to overcome many obstacles but at the same time I’ve been positioned to do well by other metrics. So it depends on what you choose to focus on – looking from an identity perspective it’s as a very different story. In the introduction to Hidden Figures the author Margot Lee Shetterly talks about how growing up near Nasa’s Langley Research Center in the 1960s led her to believe that it was standard for African Americans to be engineers, mathematicians and scientists… That it becomes your norm. The movie reminded me of how important representation is. We have a very narrow vision of what technology can enable right now because we have very low participation. I’m excited to see what people create when it’s no longer just the domain of the tech elite, what happens when we open this up, that’s what I want to be part of enabling.

Some think that this is a Malta-based custom which has passed its time. They are wrong. A simple Google search clearly shows that Catholic bishops the world over do the same thing. This year’s pastoral letter was much shorter that those before the elections of 2008 and 2013. In the 2013 letter the Bishops drew the voters’ attention to four aspects they considered to be of great importance. These were the family and marriage, the younger generation, the poor and the environment. This year the bishops decided to give the basic principles which they rightly believe should guide Catholics while responsibly executing their right and duty to vote. They propose three principles: (i) Vote according to your conscience; (ii) choose “what is truly beneficial for the common good and for a just society”; and (iii) choose people of wisdom and integrity “who treasure and embrace the ethical values we believe in”. They illustrated the last point by reference to two values, the protection of human life from conception to its natural end and the respect of human dignity. Really and truly the bishops stated the minimum and the obvious. There were two reactions. The social networks were bombarded by some Labour Party supporters spewing abuse, insults and crude hate against the bishops, accusing them of asking people to vote Nationalist. I find this reaction completely baffling. Why did they feel aggrieved by the bishops’ appeal for the common good and in favour of people of integrity? But there was a more important act of dissent. Some time ago a group of US-based fundumentalist Catholics called Veri Cattolici  took the bishops to task because of their guidelines explaining Pope Francis’ apostolic exhortation The Joy of Love. The bishops were warned that their salvation is at stake. Now another group of similarly minded conservative Catholics are buying advertising space exhorting Catholics to consider not voting at all in the general election because of gay marriage. The Curia, quite rightly, immediately disassociated itself from these adverts and from any connection with this anonymous group called ‘Maltese Catholics United for the Faith’. Pope Francis said corruption stinks and that the corrupt should be tied to a rock and thrown into the sea Had the bishops considered gay marriage to be an electoral issue they would have mentioned it in their pastoral letter. In their 2008 pastoral letter the bishops mentioned policies about family and marriage as one of the four issues voters should consider. They did not do so this time round. The reason is quite simple. Malta already has gay marriage in all but name. Changing the name of the law should not be an issue now. Had these self-styled defenders of the faith wanted to lobby against gay marriage they should have taken a stand – as I did – when the law was being debated by our parliamentarians. There is another point of difference between the Catholics United for the Faith group and our bishops. The bishops, unlike this group, exhorted everyone to vote. This is a constant in all their pre-election pastoral letters and a staple fundumental of Catholic social doctrine. It is possible and reasonable that one doesn’t feel fully at ease with what a particular party does or proposes to do. In that case one should look at all possible options and choose which best guarantees the common good and a just society. Abstention is not an option. In a 2015 address to members of Italy’s Christian Life Community, Pope Francis urged Catholics to get involved in politics even if it may be “dirty”, frustrating and fraught with failure. He asked: “Do I as a Catholic watch from my balcony?” He emphatically answered: “No, you can’t watch from the balcony. Get right in there!” He also spoke strongly on the same topic during a homily at Casa Sancta Martha in 2013: “None of us can say, ‘I have nothing to do with this, they govern…’ No, no, I am responsible for their governance, and I have to do the best so that they govern well, and I have to do my best by participating in politics according to my ability. …I cannot wash my hands,” Francis said. Voting in an election is one of the most important ways to participate in politics. Washing one’s hands is not an option particularly when the fundamental issues are corruption and good governance. Pope Francis decries corruption so often and so strongly that he described it as worse than sin. He said corruption stinks and that the corrupt should be tied to a rock and thrown into the sea. In the document announcing the Holy Year of Mercy he wrote: “Corruption prevents us from looking to the future with hope, because its tyrannical greed shatters the plans of the weak and tramples upon the poorest of the poor. It is an evil that embeds itself into the actions of everyday life, causing great public scandal. Corruption… replaces God with the illusion that money is a form of power.” During a speech in Scampia, Naples, Francis said: “Do good politics. Good politics depends on you all.” Good politics depends on the way people vote and on the parliamentarians they elect. This is why the bishops quite rightly exhort voters to vote.

Many of the apps, 41 in total, have been available for several years and have been downloaded anywhere between 8.5 million and 36.5 million times. Check Point have dubbed the malware ‘Judy’ and it is believed to have generated thousands of fraudulent clicks with owners making money from each click. The find is described as “likely the largest ever campaign uncovered on Google Play.” The malware belonged to a Korean company that manufactures apps for both iOS and Android devices. “It is important to note that the activity conducted by the malware is not borderline advertising, but definitely an illegitimate use of the users’ mobile devices for generating fraudulent clicks, benefiting the attackers,” Check Point said. It also appears that there are other apps with no apparent relationship with the Korean company that are running ‘Judy’ too. “The connection between the two campaigns remains unclear, and it is possible that one borrowed code from the other, knowingly or unknowingly,” Check Point’s mobile research team said in the alert. Google uses technology known as Bouncer to detect Malware but it appears that the Korean company uploaded a seemingly benign application to the Play Store in order to circumnavigate Bouncer’s checks. Google refused to comment on Check Point’s finding or why the malware had been allowed to undetected for so long. However, in Google’s defence, as soon as they update their security, malware authors find new ways to sneak through. Staff Writer Share.

What he found was the most disturbing thing of all: human nature. I 'd seen some bad things online, but this was pushing the envelope: a grainy video of two people in the woods somewhere doing foul things on the body of a dead bear. They shoot it out of a tree, which is pretty unsporting to begin with, and then engage in—well, if you'd like to see it, which I strongly recommend against, do a search for “shake that bear” and then prepare to wish you had one of those mind-erasing pens from Men in Black. For my part, I wasn't watching for enjoyment—I was watching because Google was paying me to. It was my job to look at that kind of stuff. As one of thousands of quality evaluators who worked for Google (or raters, as we were also known), my responsibilities included perusing hours of online material you wouldn't wish upon your worst enemy's browser history: Mostly mainstream pornography, but beheadings, racist manifestos, and weird depravity like that bear video were also my forte. I became a connoisseur of the unspeakable, an epicure of the execrable, and I scoured these shady corners of the Internet in the name of improving search and ad quality. If any of this sounds vaguely familiar, it's because over the past several months, headlines and billions in precious ad revenue hanging in the balance have pushed content filtering toward the top of Google's to-do list. Recent news items have noted that YouTube advertisers were fleeing the company after their ads were placed next to racist videos. In response, Google announced it was “teaching” computers to flag offensive content and siccing its quality-control army on nasty videos and fake news sites to stop the flow of precious ad money from its coffers. “We take this as seriously as we've ever taken a problem,” Philipp Schindler, Google's chief business officer, told The New York Times. But Google's fight against this kind of content has actually been going on for more than a decade. Flagging content in order to “teach” the company's servers to notice offensive things is not a new practice. It's nearly identical to work that I did at Google nearly ten years ago, when I, as a pathologically unemployed twentysomething, intrepidly took up the mantle to defend the company's terms of service. I was initially pretty psyched to be given the keys to the kingdom like this. I got a lot of mileage out of bragging to my friends about how I watched porn on the clock. And I was proud of the carapace of jadedness I'd build up during my first few months of monitoring the gray space of sensitive content in the Santa Monica office. But as rating duties morphed, so did my opinion of the work. Looking at breasts and vanilla sex turned into looking at stuff that was much darker (like the bear video, which we'll get back to). My initial attitude of “Wow, this is my job!” soon evolved into “Wow… this is my job.” Now, hearing that the work that my co-workers and I did brought Google seemingly no closer to its goal of being able to filter out all hateful and vile content, well—that might be the most disturbing realization. Google still felt like a scrappy company when I started working there in 2007, but it basically already ruled the world. I'd never held a steady job, so I thought I was being fanciful, borderline comical, by Googling “jobs at Google” and firing off an e-mail with a painfully wan résumé. But it worked. Even my stressing over the notoriously sphinxian tech-company interview turned out to be largely for naught. I was expecting the worst (Name six ways to efficiently get a jar of honey into a balloon dog. Write a job description for a mop. You know, stuff that makes you really think), but since I wasn't applying to be a software engineer, my interviews were easy: a general let's-make-sure-you-aren't-crazy phone call, an assessment of basic online competence, and a language interview. (I'd work in a couple of foreign languages during my time there—I was an “international” rater.) After three interviews, I received an offer of $20 per hour, no benefits, to work 40 hours per week. I definitely took this as a sign of my own brilliance. The other raters and I were contractors, not employees—something we were constantly reminded of. Our badges looked different, we were afforded fewer privileges, and we were certainly kept in the dark about The Algorithm (pause for heavenly-choir noise effect) and other such empyrean secrets. Some in our group hoped that our time would serve as a gateway to full-fledged employment. When my application to join the linguist team, which I submitted to a manager who sat 30 feet from me, never received a response, it dawned on me that perhaps I wasn't as brilliant as I thought. Maybe I was just being rented to do burnout work. The job began innocuously enough: as a grunt in the army of contractors Google used to go through batches of things like search results and ads to assess if they were useful and accurate. In the morning, I'd sit down in my cube (which I shared with a few other people), put on my headphones, fire up the ol' rating interface on my browser, and grab a batch of tasks—e.g., ads and search queries. Let's say you search for “Subaru” and a resulting ad takes you to Subaru.com. I would then judge the result—good, bad, or gradations thereof. And while exact details of the job have changed over the years, the essentials are the same: You, as the rater, have to think like the user. Did this result meet your needs? Is the website you landed on basically a good website? In this Subaru example, the answer would be, yeah, pretty much. Tick yes and move on to the next task. But let's say you search for “drag racing” and it leads to the website for RuPaul's Drag Race. Could that meet a user's needs? It could—but it's more likely the user is looking for information about actual drag racing. If a query for screen doors sends you to a website about the band the Doors, the website might be tight as hell and give drummer John Densmore the props he's been long overdue, but your needs as a user would not be met. Note accordingly and move on to the next query. Repeat for eight hours. Sound boring? It was! The work was really boring. Mindlessly, repetitively going through the bazillion queries Google receives daily. We raters received little encouragement and even less feedback. We just had to hit daily quotas. That was a heartbreaking realization, at least initially. Because working at Google could be super fun. The boom times leading up to the 2008 market crash created a bacchanalia of Nerf darts, electric scooters, free-flowing booze, and bottomless snack bins to overwhelm even the most discerning man-child. Look at that guy! He wears Rollerblades and a cowboy hat indoors, every day. That other guy? Takes his pants all the way off when he goes to the bathroom. There was a rumor that no one in the office was allowed to be more than 100 feet away from food at any given time. This was a workplace I could get behind. In fact, the perk Google was perhaps most famous for was the food: In addition to meals, we had every chip, nut, gum, candy, soft drink, and juice known to man, and in seemingly cornucopian quantities. Google wasn't the first company to feed its employees, but it perfected the practice to an ingenious degree. The cost of M&M's and SunChips to a company that clears billions per fiscal quarter is literally almost nothing. And not only did the food give us contractors bragging rights, impressing friends and visitors (“Wow! Look at all those snacks”), but it also engendered an almost unreasonable amount of goodwill in us, the workers. “Google cares,” I thought as I shoved another free Twix into my maw and began another game of online Scrabble with my cubemate. “It really cares.” Our Three's Company-themed office (yes, you heard that right) also had a game room, a massage room, and a yoga teacher who came weekly. We had chef-prepared lunches and dinners catered by different Venice or Santa Monica restaurants. Our first-floor espresso bar had a light that turned green or red, depending on Google's stock price. One morning, an $11,000 Clover coffee machine appeared on the second floor, accompanied by a representative from Intelligentsia to educate us on regional coffee differences. It was some Daisy and Tom Buchanan shit. The holiday party that year unironically had a Roaring Twenties theme. Google needed people like me because around 90 percent of its revenue comes from advertising. At its core, it's an ad firm. And one of the problems with turning the Internet into a giant billboard is that it actively encourages the creation of garbage websites by those hoping to hustle a few clicks on some strategically placed ads. Clicks and views mean money, and even if it's just a few cents here and there, it adds up. That's where porn comes in: If you're a 19-year-old kid sitting in a Prague basement and you've got a decent Internet connection, wouldn't you upload porn to YouTube, trying to game the system for a few hours before it got taken down, or create some bogus or porny websites plastered with ads, hoping to redirect and lure a few clicks? I would deal with those pages and assess how they impacted the user. Best-case scenario, a garbage page jumbles valuable keywords (like “mesothelioma” or “car insurance”) in a nonsensical way that makes a site look like an ESL robot threw it together. Worst-case scenario, an ad for knitting patterns leads to an image of someone having sex with another person. Or a horse (it can happen). That's how my job eventually descended into harlotry: through the endless cat-and-mouse game of porntrepreneurs subverting Google's anti-smut policies. The challenge was to find a way to identify offending pages quickly so as not to let valuable advertising dollars get swept downstream in the deluge. Like drug testers in pro sports, Google knew it was constantly playing catch-up—it just didn't want to fall even further behind. Violence, hate speech, and pornography. Google ads could not go on these pages, full stop. They were the enemy, and it was essential to know the enemy. Intimately. I began to receive specifically porn-related tasks. Some were entertaining, even fun. I evaluated batches of URLs from a publicly available database and made judgment calls as to whether I thought they were pornographic. Most of them were self-evident. If “porn” or “horny” or “xxx” appeared in your URL, it was a good bet there was obscene content on the site. Other examples were more ambiguous. A URL that contained “cancuntours” was getting mysteriously flagged. Eventually, we figured out why: The word “cunt” sneakily bridges “cancun” and “tours.” Another example URL: cockblockedby jesus.com—weird, but could maybe be about abstinence. But my personal favorite was hornyteenageslutconsolidateyourdebt.com—yes, they're horny teenage sluts, but maybe, just maybe, they'd also like to help you consolidate your debt? This all relates to the concept of teaching a computer to identify something. In this case, teaching a computer to identify smut. I was the teacher, and therefore I needed a lesson plan. Before long, I had opened a Pandora's box. There was a flu-fetish site: Ladies who have the flu, blowing snot into crumpled tissues—and then boning down. Or a wet-denim-fetish site, where the turn-on seems to be jumping into a pool or showering with jeans on, then copulating. Or a vacuum-sealing-fetish site, a strangulation-porn subgenre in which people get sealed in plastic. Online, every conceivable fetish is catered to, somewhere. It didn't all require eye bleach (a term used to describe an image of something sweet or adorable that helped cleanse one's eyes of something disgusting and degenerate)—some of it was providing a practical value to users of Google's ad service, who wanted to avoid potentially embarrassing conflicts. Companies could choose from different categories (gambling, politics) and decide to block various sensitive categories. A major air carrier, for example, wouldn't want its ads to show up on a news page about the missing Malaysia Airlines flight—that would be awkward. A food company would find it problematic if its ads showed up on a page that mentioned E. coli. Absolutely no one wanted their product advertised next to a white-nationalist rally. That brings us to the list of prohibited content: violence, hate speech, and naturally, pornography. Google ads could not go on these pages, full stop. They were the enemy, and it was therefore essential to know the enemy. Intimately. Which is how I ended up spending my working hours searching for 30 BDSM porn pages, for example, or extreme violence. I'd pull the sites apart, looking at the URL, the HTML, the metadata and keywords, trying to find the common threads that linked the examples. Once I found the threads, it would, in theory, be possible to better detect these pages automatically. During my searches, I learned a lot. I learned there are guys who like getting their testicles crushed by stiletto heels. That was a bummer. I learned about an online community that breaks down interspecies sex in a granular way. One particular thread blew my mind (skip ahead if you don't feel like reading about, well, bestiality): Some guy posted and talked about enjoying putting his dick into small-ish birds. He was lambasted by incensed forum participants who condemned his injuring and/or possibly killing these animals, while simultaneously extolling the virtues of their own “loving” and “mutual” sexual relationships with their dogs. Watching extreme violence was thornier. Porn could shock but would rarely upset me the way seeing a boy's legs crushed by a truck could, or seeing someone distracted by his phone get hit by a train. These were things I literally looked at through half-closed eyes. I would open them a quarter of a millimeter at a time, until I could see red on the screen—a mangled leg or a flash of white bone. Then, and only then, could I click out of the site. But I had to watch. I had to watch because I had to verify that the content was real. There was no other way to do it. With those kinds of videos, the anticipation was terrible. A link to what is allegedly a suicide video directs me to a video of a disheveled man walking into a police interrogation room and sitting down. Ten seconds go by, then 20. Nothing is happening, but I'm feeling nervous. Another man, who I'm guessing is a police officer, is making some calls. Twenty-five seconds. The officer brings the seated man some water and leaves. The seated man takes a sip of water, then calmly pulls a gun out of his pants and shoots himself in the side of the head. There's a small pop, and the man slouches in his chair while blood begins to pour out of his nose and mouth. I watch the video again. It occurs to me that I've never seen an actual suicide. How do I know if this is real? I watch it again. After a month or two of this, I began to have trouble sleeping. I'd watch some horrible car-accident video from China and see it unfolding the next day as I drove to work. I'd watch Pennsylvania treasurer Robert Budd Dwyer put a gun in his mouth and shoot himself on TV in 1987 and wonder what it would be like to shoot myself like that. Watching something gruesome and harrowing is like eating rotten food. It can stay with you for days, or even longer. And if you keep consuming that rotten food, you'll begin to feel sick all the time. I had shifted, over a period of six months or so, from being completely jazzed about watching “sensitive” content at work to actively dreading it. This video stood out. As the man is pounding the woman from behind, he starts moaning, “Shake that bear.” Cut to a pack of dogs (where did those come from?). During a meeting, our manager told us that if we wanted to opt out of a given assignment, we could. I didn't take him up on it, though. There was the feeling you might be seen as weak. I wanted to be a team player and make a good impression, still hoping I could jockey for a salaried position. So I watched the beheadings. I watched a field of ice grow slowly crimson as men with long clubs killed seals. I watched a video of a man stomping on a dog's back, breaking it, and listening to the dog's high-pitched whines as it died. I watched all of it. I left work one evening determined not to return. My bedroom was spare: a bed, a desk made from two filing cabinets and an old door. In a small wicker basket on the kitchen counter, my collection of various snacks I'd taken from Google over the past months: granola bars, mints, and gum. There was almost nothing in the fridge. I hadn't gone to the store in months, I realized, as I'd begun eating all my meals at Google. I'd started staying later so I could have dinner there. Then I began coming in progressively earlier so I could have coffee and a bowl of cereal. I found myself spending 10-to-12-hour days at the office, even though I was only getting paid for eight. “This place fucking sucks,” I thought. There's nothing here. At least there was food at work. And people, too, and video games and a cool electric piano. I should just finish out the week, I thought. I would steal a few extra Naked Juices as a treat to myself. I'd play some Guitar Hero. I went to work the next day and continued looking at violent videos. But I told myself I was done with the job and wouldn't re-up my contract after I'd finished the year. When that time came, though, my resolve didn't last. After three months of unemployment, I caved and signed on for another year. I was getting tired of being alone in my friendless, foodless apartment. The job wasn't perfect, but was any job? That it was called “Shake that bear” should have tipped me off. A medium-size black bear is high in the branches of a pine tree—snoozing or scratching or doing whatever it is bears do. A young human couple are looking up at the tree; one of them has a gun and shoots the bear. It cries out, crashes through the branches, and hits the ground. The couple, after some verbal high fives, start having sex on the dead bear. As the man is pounding the woman from behind, her goose-pimpled white flesh rippling against the dark fur of the bear, the guy starts moaning, “Shake that bear.” Cut to a pack of dogs (where did those come from?) ripping the bear apart. (Was it real? I never used any standard for identifying fake videos beyond using common sense. No casual video uploader can make this, or a beheading or a mass shooting, look convincing.) The bear video proved to be something of a fork on the slippery, downward-sloped road of my two years at the company. There's a moment when the camera is focused tightly on the dead bear's face, then pans slowly to its gentle, almost human eyes. That night, listening to the rattle of vertical blinds in my utilitarian apartment, I couldn't get the animal's face out of my mind. My thoughts on this job are not complicated: It was psychologically damaging, and I saw many things I wish I hadn't seen. I should have spent the time doing something—anything—else. I was also there completely willingly, fed and spoiled by Google, and I found myself occasionally wishing I could go back, long after my employment had ended. But someone had to do the job—and by that I mean a human being. In a machine age of robot pharmacists, driverless Ubers, and even online content that will write itself, there remain a few tasks—a few dirty, slightly scarring tasks—that will always require a personal touch. And as long as Google is offering a passable wage and free fruit leather, in the gig economy there will always be mercenaries willing to occupy the lowest rungs of the tech ladder. Google will always need humans in what is becoming the modern world's most Sisyphean task: to act as custodians of the Internet that we're simultaneously soiling. The recoil I felt watching the couple kill that bear; the slightly accelerated heartbeat and rising heat in my face; the shame and disgust I felt as I continued to watch—that's something an algorithm can never replicate. Like Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart, I knew it when I saw it; for machines, it's an as-yet-impassable Turing test. And so I watched the video. The dogs finished ripping apart the dead bear, and I sat in nonplussed silence for a few seconds. I flagged the video, then got up to grab another Tejava and went upstairs to play some Guitar Hero II to get it out of my mind. I shredded through “Killing in the Name” a few times. I decided I'd earned another lunch, even though I'd already eaten. Later, while I was lounging in the sun on the outdoor patio, one of my fellow raters said: “Twenty dollars an hour, man. Can you believe this?” I felt full and relaxed. It was a beautiful day. No, I replied, I really couldn't believe it. Lucas Peterson is a travel columnist at The New York Times.

By Hyacinth Mascarenhas May 28, 2017 07:08 BST Google DeepMind's Go-playing artificial intelligence software AlphaGo is retiringSTR/AFP/Getty Images Google DeepMind's artificial intelligence software AlphaGo is retiring from competitive matches after defeating the world's best human Go player this week. After beating 19-year-old Ke Jie for the third time to sweep a closely watched three-game series in Wuzchen, China, DeepMind announced on Saturday (27 May) that it would be AlphaGo's final match event. The Future of Go Summit, which took place from 23 to 27 May, was organised in collaboration with the Chinese government and the China Go Association focusing on the complex, 3,000-year-old board game. Go is seen as a much more complex game than chess because it relies on a certain level of "human intuition". "Over the last five days we have been honoured to witness games of the highest calibre," DeepMind's co-founder and CEO Demis Hassabis and research scientist David Silver wrote in a blog post. "We have always believed in the potential for AI to help society discover new knowledge and benefit from it, and AlphaGo has given us an early glimpse that this may indeed be possible. "This week's series of thrilling games with the world's best players, in the country where Go originated, has been the highest possible pinnacle for AlphaGo as a competitive program. For that reason, the Future of Go Summit is our final match event with AlphaGo." The London-based company said the research team behind AlphaGo will now "throw their energy into the next set of grand challenges". These include "developing advanced general algorithms that could one day help scientists as they tackle some of our most complex problems, such as finding new cures for diseases, dramatically reducing energy consumption, or inventing revolutionary new materials." "If AI systems prove they are able to unearth significant new knowledge and strategies in these domains too, the breakthroughs could be truly remarkable. We can't wait to see what comes next," DeepMind said. The team plans to publish one final academic paper detailing the tweaks and improvements made to the algorithm's efficiency and its potential to be generalised to address various other problems. "Just like our first AlphaGo paper, we hope that other developers will pick up the baton, and use these new advances to build their own set of strong Go programs," DeepMind said. 3/3 The #AlphaGo team will take on the next set of challenges to help scientists w/ societyâs most complex problems https://t.co/ribkDaK60S— Demis Hassabis (@demishassabis) May 27, 2017 The team will also work on a much-requested teaching tool that will show how AlphaGo analysed Go positions, offer developers insight into how the program thinks and give players "the opportunity to see the game through the lens of AlphaGo." Jie will collaborate with DeepMind on the tool. Last year, AlphaGo created AI history after trouncing South Korean Go master Lee Sedol in a five-game series by 4-1. Earlier this year, AlphaGo secretly defeated several top ranked players online, including Jie, by playing under the name "Master" on two Chinese board game platforms, winning 50 out of 51 games. "While AlphaGo is stepping back from competitive play, it's certainly not the end of our work with the Go community, to which we owe a huge debt of gratitude for their encouragement and motivation over the past few years," DeepMind said. "We hope that the story of AlphaGo is just the beginning." More Technology news: Why did China censor DeepMind AlphaGo's match against 19-year-old world Go champion Ke Jie?

Go is an abstract strategy board game for two players, in which the aim is to surround more territory than the opponent. The team included champions like Chen Yaoye, Zho Ruiyang, Mi Yuting, Shi Yue and Tang Weixing. The match ended when the human players resigned in the face of AlphaGo’s certain victory, TechCrunch reported on Friday. “This speaks volumes about where AI is headed — human players are teaming up with AlphaGo to have even more fun with the game!” Eric Schmidt, former Google CEO tweeted. Observers noted that the Go champions seemed to be enjoying observing and studying AlphaGo’s moves, and adapting their own play as a result. Following the victory, AlphaGo will retire from competitive sports. Marking the announcement, DeepMind CEO Demis Hassabis had this to say, “This week’s series of thrilling games with the world’s best players, in the country where Go originated, has been the highest possible pinnacle for AlphaGo as a competitive program.

By: Tech Desk | New Delhi | Updated: May 28, 2017 6:37 pm Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasing becoming important, with players like Google, Amazon and Microsoft pumping millions of dollars. Apple might be developing a new custom chipset for artificial intelligence (AI) processing, reports Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman. The chipset, internally known as Apple Neural Engine, will be used to handle AI-related tasks like speech and facial recognition. The chipset could be incorporated into Apple’s upcoming devices such as iPhone and iPad. Gurman writes Apple’s current devices are equipped to handle artifical intelligence processes with two different chipset: the main processor or microprocessor, and the graphics chipset, or “GPU”. The custom chipset would allow Apple to offload some processing done by the main chipset and by the GPU, allowing the company to improve battery performance on its devices. The report goes on to say that Apple plans to integrate the chip into other devices, and has even tested prototypes of iPhones with the built-in chip. That said, it makes sense for Apple as its competitors in the tech industry are increasing betting on artificial intelligence (AI) for future growth. Google, for instance, has developed its own chipset for machine learning, called “TPUs”, the second-generation version of which was announced at this year’s I/O. Similarly, Qualcomm’s latest flagship processor, Snapdragon 835, has a dedicated module for an artificial intelligence (AI). According to Apple analyst Gene Munster,”Two of the areas that Apple is betting its future on require AI. At the core of augmented reality and self-driving cars is artificial intelligence.” Over the past few years, Apple has acquired a number of companies having expertise in artificial intelligence and machine learning. In 2016, Apple hired Russ Salakhutdinov from Carnegie Mellon University as its director of AI research. Most recently, Apple released its first AI research paper, which focused on machine vision technologies. Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasing becoming important, with players like Google, Amazon and Microsoft pumping millions of dollars. It is possible that Apple could share more information about the chipset at WWDC , the annual developer conference to take place June5-9 in San Jose, California. Apple will unveil iOS 11, the latest mobile operating system, along with a new version of macOS, its computer operating system For all the latest Tech News, download Indian Express App now © IE Online Media Services Pvt Ltd Tags: Apple No Comments.

A phone leaker, Evan Blass, last week, put on Twitter that the most awaited version of Android Wear will at last come. The second version of the watch, according to cnet.com report, looks to completely revamp the operating system and help make watches less reliant on phones. Aside from that, the next version will add an on-watch app store and built-in keyboard. As if it isn’t cool enough, the firm will also includes support for both Android Pay (mobile payments) and the Google Assistant, Google’s intelligent voice assistant that debuted on the Pixel smartphone. The report noted that earlier, it was already confirmed that not all Android watches will get the updated version. The original Moto 360 and LG G Watch won’t be upgraded to Android Watch 2.0.

A product called "Google Attribution" was unveiled at a marketing conference this month in San Francisco by the internet giant. Google has long been able to determine when users click on an ads and make a purchase, but linking online and offline habits takes its analytics a step further. Google senior vice president Sridhar Ramaswamy, who announced that Attribution is in test mode with a limited number of partners and will be rolled out to more advertisers in coming weeks, touted the tool as being able to answer the long-challenging question of whether marketing campaigns are working. "Google Attribution makes it possible for every marketer to measure the impact of their marketing across devices and across channels," Ramaswamy said. "Data-driven attribution uses machine learning to determine how much credit to assign to each step in the consumer journey -- from the first time they engage with your brand for early research down to the final click before purchase." Real-world customer email addresses or loyalty plan information can be woven with Google data from services such as AdWords, Google Analytics and DoubleClick Search to provide "a complete view" of marketing performance, according to the company. Using artificial intelligence, or machine learning, to better analyze and understand consumer behavior to target ads and promote sales was a major theme of the conference. - Ad 'holy grail' - For several years now, AdWords has enabled advertisers to measure visits to real-world stores stemming from online campaigns, Ramaswamy noted. "Still, measuring store visits is just one part of the equation," Ramaswamy said. "You also need insights into how your online ads drive sales for your business." Real-world transactions matched back to Google ads are handed in "a secure and privacy-safe way," with store sales information reported in aggregated and anonymized forms to protect individual privacy, according to the company. Tying online activity to offline shopping decisions has been a "holy grail" for advertisers for quite some time, and comes with worrisome privacy implications, according to ACLU senior policy analyst Jay Stanley. Attribution threatens to intrude on a core tenant of privacy, that people can have dealings with one party not spill over into affairs with other parties they interact with, Stanley contended. "This is an evolution, not a revolution; another step toward increased monitoring of individuals," Stanley said. "Each step raises the question 'Where does this all stop?'" Stanley expected Google to be on its best behavior when it came to handling the growing trove of information about users, but that even the best of intentions could crack under the "enormous hydraulic pressure of the profit motive." "We have the full fury and genius of the capitalist system being driven toward monitoring people in ever increasing detail and companies are competing to do so," Stanley said "It will not stop without some sort of rules in which we as a society express our values through legal protections." - More tempting ads? - Google and Facebook dominate the online ad world, and what one does to prove its worth to advertisers is likely to be copied by the other, according to Silicon Valley analyst Rob Enderle of Enderle Group. Attribution promised to give Google a way to assure advertisers they are getting their money's worth at the firm's online venues. "The big problem is that showing conversion from ad consumption to purchase has been horrible," Enderle said of online marketing. "This has been a problem for a long time. Google is trying to make a metric so they get credit for it when you do purchase after viewing an ad." Data showing which ads are translating into real sales should mean that the relevance of ads people see online will improve as marketers abandon mis-aimed or ineffectively tailored messages, the analyst reasoned. "You are going to be hit with ads for things that you might actually want to buy, so you are going to spend a lot more money," Enderle predicted. Worries about privacy sparked by linking offline and online activities are a decade or so late, because the time to protest was when collection began of the troves of data about people, the analyst argued. "There really is no downside to this application," Enderle said while discussing Google's marketing metrics move. "This is the good side of collecting data; it is what else is being done with the data that should be unnerving and that we really don't know."

White Share Share Tweet Comment Email Print advertisement For a company whose embrace of mobile work predates the internet and even the personal computer, IBM's decision to recall employees back to the office has human resources experts warning that the move could make it harder for Big Blue to compete with the likes of Google and Apple, along with hot startups, to recruit and retain the best people. "I think it is going to be a talent problem," said Jennifer Glass, the Barbara Bush professor of liberal arts at the Population Research Center at the University of Texas. "It's very clear in the literature that autonomy is something talented workers want, especially millennials." The back-to-the-office movement could work if management is clear about the benefits working in an office will provide. Shutterstock A survey by Flexjobs.com found that 80 percent of respondents said that flexibility was a top consideration when considering a new job, and a third reported leaving a job because it didn't offer the flexibility they needed. "People work from home for a lot of different reasons," Sara Sutton Fell, founder and CEO of Flexjobs.com, including accommodating childcare, eldercare and disabilities. "They need it. They don't just want it." Related: Researchers Say This Is the Key to Being Happy at Work Some experts say the rollback of telecommuting reflects a more seismic shift as IBM struggles to adapt to rapid changes in an industry it once dominated. "When technology companies change priorities or shift focus, there can be a change as well to how and where employees work," said Scott Dobroski, community expert at Glassdoor.com. "This is is a sign of something much bigger," said Dave Carvajal, CEO of Dave Partners, a technology-focused recruiting firm. "IBM is struggling to compete in the competitive tech marketplace that has become significantly more agile and nimble over the past decade." IBM's quarterly report last month had higher-than-expected earnings but missed analyst expectations on revenue — marking five years straight of year-over-year quarterly revenue declines. Company executives say making people work together will help reverse its fortunes. At a conference last fall, CFO Martin Schroeter talked to investors about "get[ting] the teams back together as opposed to so spread out," saying the relocation would make them "more agile." It Didn't Work for Yahoo But not everyone agrees that proximity can foster performance gains. "I'm personally a little skeptical," Sutton Fell said. "It didn't really help Yahoo." The news of IBM's reversal on telecommuting drew many comparisons to Yahoo. When CEO Marissa Mayer eliminated Yahoo's work-from-home perk in 2013, it provoked a backlash from those who said the shift placed an unfair burden on working parents — especially since the news was coupled with reports that Mayer had a nursery constructed adjacent to her office so she could bring her then-infant son to work with her. Given IBM's performance struggles, some observers suggested that the shift away from remote work could be a way to shed workers through attrition without resorting to layoffs. Related: Some Companies Encourage Employees to Disconnect During Vacation "IBM has been bringing teams like these together for several years, across many areas of the company: software development, digital marketing, Watson, design, and IBM's CIO teams, just to name a few," IBM spokeswoman Laurie Friedman said via email. She did not respond to a question about how many employees ultimately would be affected but said workers could reapply for other jobs — around 5,000 in the U.S. — with the company, and added that some workers would be able to continue working remotely. "I'm highly suspicious of this idea that if you corral everybody into the same room you're going to get magic," Glass said. "I think it's an attempt to exert more managerial control when business is down and they're under pressure to turn things around." Collaboration May Need to Be Relearned Some experts do see the potential for a positive outcome as IBM expands its work in areas like cloud computing and artificial intelligence. "We know it's an added focus on innovation," Dobroski said. "That's very enticing to today's tech talent." By making people come into the office, managers will be able to focus on more hands-on mentoring and training — benefits that attract ambitious millennials but are harder to execute with a far-flung workforce. "This is the generation that says, if I'm not learning, I'm gone," said Dayna Fellows, president of consulting company WorkLife Performance, Inc. The back-to-the-office movement could work if management is "really smart and clear" about the benefits working in an office will provide, she said. Related: Three-Day Weekends, Free Vacation Money? Taking Job Perks to the Max But to achieve this, experts say IBM will need to invest in restructuring its work environment and culture. "If they simply bring people in and expect them to work exactly the same way in a crowd situation, it will fail," Fellows said. "That would be the mistake, is if everything stays the same but people come in." "Collaboration is helped by being together, but it has to be on purpose. You have to create a culture... It doesn't just happen by bumping into each other," said Ellen Galinsky, senior research advisor at the Society for Human Resource Management. "If the problem is collaboration, that probably needs to be addressed directly. You can't just assume that if people are in the same space, they are going to collaborate and work together," she said. "Holistic change at that level requires real leadership," Carvajal said. Martha C.

Digital Trends Home > Computing > ARM shows off the first processors based on… ARM shows off the first processors based on Dynamiq technology By Kyle Wiggers — Updated May 28, 2017 10:47 pm Subscribe Share AMD Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Get today's popular Digital Trends articles in your inbox: Why it matters to you ARM's new Dynamiq architecture promises to dramatically improve performance and energy efficiency. In March, ARM, the holding company that designs the chips in billions of phones, cars, and mobile devices, announced Dynamiq, a new platform that promised performance and efficiency improvements over current-gen architectures. Since then, details on new chips have been hard to come by, but that all changed Sunday evening with the introduction of the Cortex-A75 and Cortex-A55 processors and Mali-G72 graphics chip — the first based on Dynamiq. ARM is promising “ground-breaking performance” with the Cortex-A75, which performance gains as high as 50 percent in areas such as artificial intelligence. ARM calls the Cortex-A75  “laptop-ready,” and sees it best suited for large-screen devices, networking equipment, and cars. The Cortex-A55, on the other hand, doubles down on power efficiency. It’s up to 2.5 times more efficient compared to ARM’s current crop of processor and tailored for “everyday devices” like tablets, smartphones, and Internet of Things (IoT) devices. Both the Cortex-A55 and Cortex-A75 benefit from a fast single-thread performance and Dynamiq’s new Big.Little configuration, an ARM technology that intelligently switches between processor cores as needed. The Cortex-A75 has four high-power cores (Big) and four low-power cores (Little), and the Cortex-A55 has 1 high-performance core (Big) and seven low-power cores (Little). There is a polygon-themed Daydream park where people can demo Google’s mobile virtual reality headset. Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Other platform changes include CryptoCell-712, the newest version of ARM’s subsystem security architecture, and native support for high dynamic range (HDR), a high-contrast display standard. New processors are not the only thing ARM had up its sleeve. It took the wraps off the Mali-G72, the first graphics chip designed on the Dynamiq platform. Enhanced graphics are the chip’s headlining feature. ARM said the Mali-G72 is 25 percent more power efficient and cuts down on bandwidth by 87 percent, leading to 1.4 times better overall performance than the 2017 devices. ARM said the beefed-up chip will benefit virtual reality and “high fidelity” apps. To that end, the Mali-G72 supports mobile multi-view, an advanced rendering feature for Samsung’s Gear VR headset; foveated rendering, a technique that uses an eye tracker integrated with a VR headset; adaptive scalable texture compression (ASTC), a compression algorithm that supports HDR and multiple color formats; and multisample anti-aliasing (MSAA), which improves image quality by smoothing out the rough edges of objects. ARM’s targeting AI applications with the Mali-G72, too. New algorithms and other optimizations make it 17 percent more efficient at on-device AI computing, ARM said, making it the “most efficient Mali GPU for machine learning [yet].” ARM said devices equipped with the Mali-G72 and either the ARM-A75 or ARM-A55 will be capable of “real-time inference” and “on-device learning” that enhances user privacy and powers and new, intuitive user interfaces. “[The new chips] have [the] compute performance to deliver a hi-fidelity world,” ARM said. “[It’s] AI in your hand.” ARM’s building on the success of its existing chip business. The company said that more than a billion Mali chips shipped in 2016 and that 50 percent of mobile virtual reality headsets and 50 percent of smartphones pack the chip. It is projected to ship 100 billion chips between 2017 and to its more than 450 silicon partners and 1,000 community partners, which doubles the 50 billion in shipped between 2013 and 2017.
Tech News Home > Tech > Tech News < Back to SMG 45 Monday, 29 May 2017 | MYT 1:24 PM Lenovo’s struggling mobile business sets sight on high-end market A Lenovo spokeswoman said its global mobile strategy would focus on the Motorola brand, although it would continue to support its other lines, such as ZUK. — Bloomberg HONG KONG: After a bruising fall from its spot as the world's third-largest mobile phone maker following its acquisition of Motorola three years ago, China's Lenovo Group Ltd is counting on a push upmarket to stop the bleeding in its smartphone business.  While the company, which vies with HP as the world's largest PC maker, returned to profit in the year to March, losses in its smartphone business worsened as marketing expenses for new products and key component costs increased.  The group's phone problems started after it acquired Motorola Mobility from Google for US$2.9bil (RM12.37bil) in 2014 but struggled to integrate the assets. That, combined with fierce competition from lower-end manufacturers in its home base of China such as Xiaomi and Oppo, saw its global position fall to eighth in 2016.  A recently announced reorganisation of its China business aimed at sharpening the PC brand's consumer focus comes amid an ongoing effort to tighten its mobile branding and shift the focus to pricier models under its Moto brand.  "Our strategy is to prioritise mature markets ... which need brands and innovative products, whereas emerging markets need efficiency," chairman Yang Yuanqing said of Lenovo's mobile business at a press conference in Hong Kong on May 25.  "So we will have two teams catering to the two kinds of markets with different product lines."  Lenovo faces its toughest battle in its home base of China, where it has slipped out of the top 10 smartphone vendors. Shipments domestically declined 80% year-on-year or 55% quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter of 2017, according to data from Canalys.  The company currently has three phone brands in China – the premium Moto brand, the cheaper Lenovo series, and an online-focused ZUK brand launched in 2015.  A Lenovo spokeswoman said its global mobile strategy would focus on the Motorola brand, although it would continue to support its other lines, such as ZUK.  Moto products, including a premium series of modular phones designed with detachable components that can be replaced or upgraded, helped propel Lenovo to be the second-biggest vendor in Brazil, after Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Yang said.  Shipments in Brazil rose 56% in the first three months of the year according to Lenovo, overtaking India as its biggest market, where volume grew 34%.  The average selling prices of Lenovo's mobile products rose 15.1% in the past year, according to its financial report.  Mature market competition, where Yang said Lenovo's main rivals are Samsung and LG Electronics Inc, is less fierce than in emerging markets, where the low entry barrier allowed in "too many Chinese vendors, some of which compete irrationally".  He added Lenovo will have three more telecom partners in the US this year, while its performance in Western Europe is improving.  New priorities  Yang said Lenovo is on track to meet its goal of turning around the mobile business by the second half of the fiscal year starting in April.  At the same time, some analysts say the company should cut its mobile losses in China and focus on building its strength in other markets.  "I think they should deep-six their China mobile business. Their non-China probably has a chance if it's very narrowly geographic and product focused," said Bernstein analyst Alberto Moel.  Lenovo is the fourth-biggest smartphone seller in India, with a 9.5% market share, which compares with Samsung in top place with 28.1%, according to IDC.  While it faces increasing competition from new entrants Oppo and Vivo, it enjoys good brand loyalty.  "I like Lenovo phones for their good battery backup, smart looks and the overall experience," said Bhaskar Kotian, a Mumbai businessman who has purchased at least six Lenovo smartphones for friends and family in the past two years.   Despite calls to write off its China problems, Yang insists there are no plans to walk away from its domestic mobile business.  "We would never give up our China mobile business, because it is 30% of the world market," he said. — Reuters Tags / Keywords: Foreign News , Corporate News , Technology Related Stories You May Be Interested Digital wallet services gain rising acceptance BA cancels flights from London as global IT outage causes chaos Poor showing at Sudirman Cup costs Vivian-Khe Wei place in world meet Get smart about the idiot box The man who rebuilt this city Racing for a better tomorrow Others Also Read Star workshop to help SMEs tackle new Act Knife-wielding man kills two, wounds 18 in China Barca duo not ready for senior Korean side - Stielike advertisement Latest News Samsung Elec considers adding capacity at China chip plant S&P sees no need for an out-of-schedule China rating review Acquisitions accelerate as tech giants seek to build AI smarts Hong Leong Bank Q3 net profit up 14% AirAsia warns of free ticket scam Most Viewed in Tech More Heathrow chaos as BA scrambles to recover from IT crash Get smart about the idiot box Malaysians love to Netflix, with or without the chill, at night US might ban laptops on all flights into and out of the country Google Search introduces Personal tab to show users’ online content Chipotle says hackers hit most restaurants in data breach BA cancels flights from London as global IT outage causes chaos Maintaining IPv4 is going to get expensive: expert Why you can’t buy a car online – for now Samsung Elec considers adding capacity at China chip plant Powered by advertisement advertisement site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Lifestyle Tech Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services Magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs Advertising View Our Rate Card Policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu StarProperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com Search The Star Online Connect with us Content Partner Our Radio Stations site map Home Videos News Business Sport Metro Tech Lifestyle Travel Opinion subscriptions The Star newspaper Other Publications RSS Feeds other editions ePaper Mobile SMS Services magazines Kuntum company info About Us Contact Us Job Opportunities Investor Relations FAQs advertising View Our Rate Card policies Privacy Statement Terms of Use our sites Star2.com myStarjob.com Carsifu starproperty.my Propwall iBilik R.AGE mStar Kuali Leaderonomics TheStarTV.com StarCherish.com social media Facebook Twitter Copyright © 1995- Star Media Group Berhad (ROC 10894D)

Sexy, no. A self-driving bus being tested in Helsinki, Finland, Sept. 15, 2016. Across Europe, some fledgling driverless projects are focused on utilitarian self-driving vehicles for mass transit that barely exceed walking pace. Photo: The New York Times mail print View all comments Tweet By Mark Scott - - Published: 1:00 PM, May 29, 2017 BERLIN — On the outskirts of Berlin, Michael Barillre-Scholz is testing a driverless vehicle that is neither sleek nor futuristic. The machine is boxy and painted white. Its top speed barely reaches 20 mph. The self-driving vehicle is a shuttle with room for 12 passengers. Mr Barillre-Scholz, who leads the driverless research team at Deutsche Bahn, Germany’s largest train and bus operator, and his team have been testing the vehicle around a local office park. Later this year, the partly state-owned public transit company will also begin separate trials of a similar autonomous bus on public roads in southern Germany, connecting a local train station with stops along a predetermined route. “We want to show that autonomous cars don’t have to be limited to luxury consumer vehicles, they also have a role in public transport,” Mr Barillre-Scholz said. “The market in Germany for this type of vehicle is huge.” The coming age of driverless cars has typically centred on Silicon Valley highfliers like Tesla, Uber and Google, which have showcased their autonomous driving technology in luxury sedans and SUVs costing US$100,000 (S$138,420) or more. But across Europe, fledgling driverless projects like those by Deutsche Bahn are instead focused on utilitarian self-driving vehicles for mass transit that barely exceed walking pace. Forgoing the latest automotive trends of aerodynamics and style, European transportation groups and city planners are instead aiming to connect these unglamorous driverless vehicles to existing public transportation networks of subways and buses. The goal is to eventually offer on-demand driverless services to those who cannot afford the latest expensive offerings from Tesla and others. “When it comes to public transportation, we’re really close on making this technology work,” said Harri Santamala, who coordinates several projects involving autonomous public transport in Finland and directs a “smart mobility” program at Helsinki Metropolia University of Applied Sciences. While US cities - including Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Las Vegas - have tested some of these mass transit driverless vehicles, Europe is a particular hotbed of this activity. That is because of the region’s densely packed urban areas and decades-old and widely used public transit systems, which often include subways, trains and buses. In total, more than 20 pilot or existing public transport programs have taken place in Europe involving autonomous vehicles, according to a review by The New York Times. Most of these projects have received government funding, tapping into local research institutions and tech startups that are not household names. “Most of our shuttles have been to more places than I have,” said Lauren Isaac, director of business initiatives for North America at Easymile, a French autonomous transit company that is working on driverless shuttles. For those who dream of owning a sleek driverless vehicle of the future, this generation of autonomous public shuttles - often half the length of a traditional bus with capacity for less than a dozen people - will not set hearts racing. Though they include much of the high-tech sensors and gadgetry required for autonomous driving, the vehicles are designed for functionality rather than speed and style. “With our first vehicle, the goal was just to get in on the road as quickly as possible,” said Christophe Sapet, chief executive of Navya, a French startup that designs autonomous shuttle buses that have carried almost 150,000 passengers across Europe, Asia and the United States. He added that Navya’s next vehicle will look “more like a robo-taxi.” Unlike the driverless trials from Uber and Alphabet’s Waymo, which aim to bring autonomous vehicles to personal transport, a focus on self-driving public transit is a significantly easier challenge. That is because these autonomous vehicles are often limited to operating in the “last mile,” to existing public transit, or smaller distances on often well-traveled routes. That reduces the complexity required to make the machines navigate across an entire city. In London, city planners conducted a three-week trial in April involving a self-driving electric shuttle moving slowly around a well-defined 3-mile route on mostly private roads. Nick Reed, the project’s coordinator, said that by offering people autonomous connections to the British capital’s existing transportation network, his team was helping the city to meet public demand without having to invest millions, if not billions, in traditional subways or buses. “London is a megacity, we want people to use the public transportation that is already there,” said Mr Reed, academy director at TRL, a transit consultant firm in charge of the two-year trial in London. “If we can connect people through autonomous vehicles, it’s a big plus.” Not all of the autonomous vehicles being tested for public transport in Europe are glamour-free. In December, Carlo Ratti, a professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, stood on the banks of a picturesque canal in Amsterdam to test his team’s latest contraption: a driverless boat. The machine - painted bright orange and measuring less than 2 feet in length - darted swiftly between parked boats and a flock of ducks. Called the Roboat, the initial prototype was remote-controlled. Later versions are set to incorporate sensors and other technology to make the boat fully autonomous. The machines will eventually reach up to 16 feet in length. Mr Ratti’s goal is to bring a fleet of these driverless boats to the Dutch city by the end of the decade, where they will be used to ferry people and goods around Amsterdam’s miles of canals. If everything goes according to plan, the researcher also hopes the autonomous boats will be able to automatically dock with each other, creating on-demand bridges and walkways whenever necessary. “There are rivers and waterfronts in most cities, so the applications are quite wide,” said Mr Ratti, whose team is split between Amsterdam and Boston, where they use a university swimming pool to try out their latest version of the Roboat. “Not many people have looked at self-driving boats.” NEW YORK TIMES mail print View all comments Tweet Recommended For You   More Stories For You The Most World READ COMMENTED ﻿From Trump’s Mar-a-Lago to Facebook, a national security crisis in the open  Extreme religious acts mark Good Friday in the Philippines “Fear of the future” fuels killings in Japan ‘Zombie’ birds fall from sky in Moscow ‘You’re fat’ card prompts London police action ‘I pretend everything is OK’: single mothers shunned ‘Costume jewellery’ diamond really worth hundreds of thousands Zuma says not against anti-graft probe as ANC grandees gather Zahid orders probe, reshuffle after sponsorship claims in police force Witnesses report hearing 'huge bang' at British venue where Ariana Grande was performing: Sky Witness at UK venue where Ariana Grande was performing says felt 'massive explosion' Wheelchair users aim to make beach barrier free for the disabled What self-driving cars see Warplanes hit Libya's Derna again: witness War crimes suspect Mladic appeals for release on medical grounds Inside Today World Warplanes hit Libya's Derna again: witness President Macron's party seen on top in French parliament election: poll Great white shark jumps into Australian fisherman's boat Philippines puts city on lockdown over fears of militant infiltration Driverless transit in Europe, yes.

Its right arm is holding a screen, which playfully challenges visitors to compete with the robot in a manual task: tracing the word YASKAWA as quickly as possible. It’s a trick, of course: The robot always wins. On the multiple times I tried, I never beat the robot, and lost in both accuracy and speed by large margins. The robot could complete, in just a few seconds, a task that took me eight seconds at my fastest, and much more at my slowest (and most accurate). After it beats the visitor, the robot twirls the screen between its two arms, showing off yet another task that a human can’t do nearly as well. And then, a message pops up on the screen, in bright red: “YOU LOSE. ROBOTS WILL ALWAYS WIN ... ALWAYS!!” Popular Searches QBE Insurance Group Ltd QBEIF ▼ 9.53 -0.34 -3.44% Tencent Holdings Ltd TCTZF ▼ 35.60 -0.14 -0.39% Premier Investments Ltd PMV ▼ 12.25 -0.02 -0.16% Ten Network Holdings Ltd TWG ▲ 0.1260 +0.0220 +21.15% Though the message is tongue-in-cheek, its gist appears to be increasingly true. Robots and algorithms are proving themselves better than humans at a number of tasks, both physical and mental. A Google computer program, AlphaGo, is beating top masters around the world at Go, which is considered one of the world’s most difficult games. San Francisco-based Momentum Machines has unveiled a robot that can make 400 hamburgers in an hour, a much faster rate than humans can. Foxconn, the company that builds electronic devices for companies including Apple and Samsung, is reportedly replacing tens of thousands of factory workers with more-efficient robots. The news about these developments often has an air of panic about it, as economists worry about how humans will make a living if the machines are doing all the work. The numbers are certainly concerning: Evidence suggests that industrial robots like the ones made in the Yaskawa factory have cost thousands of American jobs. The number of industrial robots, which are automatically controlled, multipurpose, reprogrammable machines, increased fourfold between 1993 and 2007, according to a recent study by MIT economists Daron Acemoglu and Pascual Restrepo. The authors found that one such industrial robot in a metropolitan area reduced employment by about six workers, costing the U.S. economy 670,000 jobs between 1990 and 2007. But there are positives too. The MIT economist David Autor has emphasized that automation also complements labor, making workers more productive. There are certain tasks that robots can’t do, he writes, and humans will always be needed for those. Working along with robots, humans can also create new, better jobs. Indeed, another study, out of the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation, shows that between 2010 and 2015, six technology-related jobs were created for every 10 jobs lost. And despite the deployment of thousands of robots across the country, the unemployment rate is at a 10-year-low, and worries of widespread joblessness have yet to materialize. My visit to the Yaskawa factory illustrated these positives. I talked to a 25-year-old process engineer named Greg Smith, who has a bachelor’s degree in mechanical engineering and is finishing up his master’s in electrical engineering. He showed me an automated vehicle that communicated with a humanoid robot to move parts around a factory floor, as the robots checked the parts to make sure they were made correctly, and retooled those that were not. We walked by a Yaskawa robot that could stack objects on top of one another, and one that took items off an assembly line and packed them in a box. Another robot—one of Yaskawa’s most popular products—welds metal parts together faster and more accurately than humans can. All of those robots are going to replace humans who do the same work, but on the other hand, Smith has a job because of the success of companies like Yaskawa. Increasingly, he told me, he is designing robots that work with humans collaboratively. Smith’s grandmother doesn’t like that he works with robots—she thinks he’s putting people out of work—but his career, at least, is secure. “My job will never go away,” he told me. © Provided by Atlantic Media Company Yaskawa robots picks boxes off an assembly line Smith said his approach to automation is a simple one: If American companies don’t automate, they won’t be able to compete with foreign companies that do. Besides, he said, robots conduct work that humans probably don’t want to do, work that is dirty, dangerous, and dull. Still, it can be awkward, senior process engineer Jack Moore told me, to visit a company whose CEO is talking about replacing people with machines. The CEO will show Moore a line of men welding, and say he wants to replace at least one of them with the product Moore is trying to sell. Load Error What’s the difference between workers like Smith and Moore, and the people who might be automated out of a job? The answer is simple: education. Workers with advanced degrees are going to be designing and making the robots—what Elon Musk refers to as the process of making the machines that make the machines.“The people empowered to educate themselves,” Moore said, “are still going to be here.” That’s not to say that the job of every person with a college education is going to be safe. In a 2013 Oxford study that predicted the jobs that would be most susceptible to automation, Carl Frey and Michael Osborne put insurance underwriters and tax preparers at the top of the list. But jobs that require creativity and critical thinking—jobs like the ones Smith and Moore have—should be secure. The jobs least likely to be automated on Frey and Osborne’s list included surgeons, curators, and mechanical engineers. Ensuring that the American workforce is adept at versatile thinking and has a job that allows them to employ the skill is an intimidating endeavor, one that goes far beyond workforce training. It’s about improving K-12 education and helping more people get on a path to college or some sort of advanced degree. According to a recent study out of the Institute for Spatial Analysis at the University of Redlands, workers without a high-school degree face an almost six times higher risk of their jobs being automated than those with a doctorate. Minorities could be especially hard hit by the coming wave of automation because of their education patterns: Hispanics are 25 percent more likely than whites to lose their jobs to automation, while African Americans are 13 percent more likely. Places like Yaskawa are leading the American workforce into a new future, where certain jobs that were once done by humans are going to be done by machines. That seems like a scary proposition, but it doesn’t have to be. Automation can also creates job, and good ones, for the people whose jobs machines can’t replace. The question will be how to make sure more Americans are in that lucky group. Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

While the company, which vies with HP as the world`s largest PC maker, returned to profit in the year to March, losses in its smartphone business worsened as marketing expenses for new products and key component costs increased. The group`s phone problems started after it acquired Motorola Mobility from Google for USD 2.9 billion in 2014 but struggled to integrate the assets. That, combined with fierce competition from lower-end manufacturers in its home base of China such as Xiaomi and Oppo, saw its global position fall to eighth in 2016. A recently announced reorganisation of its China business aimed at sharpening the PC brand`s consumer focus comes amid an ongoing effort to tighten its mobile branding and shift the focus to pricier models under its Moto brand. "Our strategy is to prioritise mature markets ... which need brands and innovative products, whereas emerging markets need efficiency," Chairman Yang Yuanqing said of Lenovo`s mobile business at a press conference in Hong Kong on Thursday. "So we will have two teams catering to the two kinds of markets with different product lines." Lenovo faces its toughest battle in its home base of China, where it has slipped out of the top 10 smartphone vendors. Shipments domestically declined 80 percent year-on-year or 55 percent quarter-on-quarter in the first quarter of 2017, according to data from Canalys. The company currently has three phone brands in China - the premium Moto brand, the cheaper Lenovo series, and an online-focused ZUK brand launched in 2015. A Lenovo spokeswoman said its global mobile strategy would focus on the Motorola brand, although it would continue to support its other lines, such as ZUK. Moto products, including a premium series of modular phones designed with detachable components that can be replaced or upgraded, helped propel Lenovo to be the second-biggest vendor in Brazil, after Samsung Electronics Co Ltd, Yang said. Shipments in Brazil rose 56 percent in the first three months of the year according to Lenovo, overtaking India as its biggest market, where volume grew 34 percent. The average selling prices of Lenovo`s mobile products rose 15.1 percent in the past year, according to its financial report. Mature market competition, where Yang said Lenovo`s main rivals are Samsung and LG Electronics Inc, is less fierce than in emerging markets, where the low entry barrier allowed in "too many Chinese vendors, some of which compete irrationally". He added Lenovo will have three more telecom partners in the U.S. this year, while its performance in Western Europe is improving. NEW PRIORITIES Yang said Lenovo is on track to meet its goal of turning around the mobile business by the second half of the fiscal year starting in April. At the same time, some analysts say the company should cut its mobile losses in China and focus on building its strength in other markets. "I think they should deep-six their China mobile business. Their non-China probably has a chance if it`s very narrowly geographic and product focused," said Bernstein analyst Alberto Moel. Lenovo is the fourth-biggest smartphone seller in India, with a 9.5 percent market share, which compares with Samsung in top place with 28.1, according to IDC. While it faces increasing competition from new entrants Oppo and Vivo, it enjoys good brand loyalty. "I like Lenovo phones for their good battery backup, smart looks and the overall experience," said Bhaskar Kotian, a Mumbai businessman who has purchased at least six Lenovo smartphones for friends and family in the past two years.   Despite calls to write off its China problems, Yang insists there are no plans to walk away from its domestic mobile business. "We would never give up our China mobile business, because it is 30 percent of the world market," he said.

We think of proud peoples who for tens of thousands of years have been maintained a deep connection to the land – with an incredible history and proud culture. This year, Reconciliation Week marks two important milestones: It is 50 years since the 1967 Referendum in which indigenous Australians were legally allowed to vote, and 35 years since the historic Mabo land rights decision. Jason Pellegrino, Google Australia managing director, welcomes employees to the Reconciliation Action Plan launch. The theme for Reconciliation Week in 2017 is ‘Let’s Take the Next Steps’ and today Google is taking a big next step by launching our first ever Reconciliation Action Plan. Last year we promised to create a plan to take practical actions, build respectful relationships and open up new opportunities for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. We are happy to say that we have done just that, and we’re grateful for the support from the people at Reconciliation Australia, who have played an integral part in our reconciliation journey so far. Gadigal elder Uncle Max performs a traditional smoking ritual. But it is just the start of that journey, because there continues to be unacceptable gaps between Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and the rest of Australia. We can’t ignore the past and must face the fact that past policies and European settlement had a devastating impact on Aboriginal communities. At Google we believe we can best serve Australians by embracing and striving to understand the many diverse, complex and ancient cultures of our vibrant community. We recognise that we can’t sit idly by in the path towards reconciliation – it must live in the hearts, minds and actions of all of us at Google, regardless of background. This RAP, developed by a cross-section of passionate Googlers on behalf of their colleagues, articulates our joint vision for reconciliation in Australia and the actions we will take to be better partners with Indigenous Australia. There are three main goals of the RAP: Relationships – Partner with, and learn from, Aboriginal and Torres Strait islander communities Respect – Raise Google employee awareness of, and respect for, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander cultures, histories and achievements, in order to build an appreciation of life in Australia from an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander perspective. Opportunity – Provide better access to technology for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders, and a greater focus on building a pool of future technologists that better reflects Australia’s diversity. Singer Christine Anu performs her song ‘My Island Home’ at the ceremony. Our objective is help build stronger and more respectful ties with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples – and help ensure that all Australians can share in the opportunities created through technology.

All rights reserved. DT This Dystopian Device Warns You When AI Is Trying to Impersonate Actual Humans AI is turning against itself. PETER DOCKRILL 29 MAY 2017   Scared of a future where you can no longer discern if you're dealing with a human or a computer? A team of Australian researchers have come up with what they call the Anti-AI AI. The wearable prototype device is designed to identify synthetic speech and alert the user that the voice they're listening doesn't belong to a flesh-and-blood individual. Developed as a proof of concept in just five days, the prototype makes use of a neural network powered by Google's Tensorflow machine learning software.   As artificial intelligence (AI) and robotic technology rapidly evolve, we're facing an uncertain future where machines can seemingly do all sorts of things better than people can – from mastering games to working our jobs, and even making new, more powerful forms of AI. While the gravest concerns envision a future dystopia where unregulated, super-powerful AIs threaten humanity's very existence, the truth is we're already entering a new, unsettling era in which machines can deceive humans by impersonating the ways we speak and look. DT As this technology gets even more sophisticated, it's becoming easier to imagine a world where soon it may be difficult or even impossible to tell when a 'person' you're talking to on the phone – or watching on TV – is or isn't a real human being. But while AI is what empowers this nightmare scenario, it could also be what helps us reveal these synthetic impostors for what they are. A team at Australian creative technology agency DT trained its AI up on a database of synthetic voices, teaching the offline network to recognise artificial speech patterns. When the wearable prototype operates, it captures audio spoken in the device's presence and sends it to this neural network in the cloud. If the AI detects an actual human voice (code green), all is fine: But if the system picks up on synthetic speech, it has a unique way of subtly letting the human know that they're talking to a digital clone. Rather than using light, sound, or vibration to alert the user, the prototype includes a miniature thermoelectric cooling element to reinforce that the voice they're hearing is coming from a "a cold, lifeless machine".   "We wanted the device to give the wearer a unique sensation that matched what they were experiencing when a synthetic voice is detected," the team explains on DT's R&D blog. "By using a 4x4 mm thermoelectric Peltier plate, we were able to create a noticeable chill on the skin near the back of the neck without drawing too much current." DT That's right, guys, this device literally sends a chill down your spine when you're talking to a digital doppelgänger made up of 0s and 1s, and we can't think of a more fitting example of UI feedback. Of course, because the Anti-AI AI is just a work-in-progress concept piece for now, it's unlikely the device will actually be released any time soon.   But the researchers behind it say that they're still refining their prototype and intend to improve the neural net with more synthetic content in the future. Is this something you and I might need in the future? It's possible. After all, in a post-truth world dominated by fake news misinformation – where world leaders can so easily be manipulated to say things they never actually said – nothing's for certain.   More From ScienceAlert Science Predicts You're Hiding 13 Secrets - And Nearly Half of Those You've Never Told a Soul They're weighing on you more than you think. 2 hours ago It's Microbes, Not Food Restriction, That Are Behind Our Most Effective Treatment For Obesity The smallest losers. 8 minutes ago We Now Have The First Evidence That Immune Cells in The Skin Directly Trigger Hair Growth This could explain how hair loss starts. 4 hours ago Here's Why Your Mouth Gets Itchy or Tingly When You Eat Certain Fruits And Veggies It's more common than you'd think. 7 hours ago NASA Watched a Wave of Ice Bend The Earth's Crust A new way to lose ice. 2 days ago These Are The Hardest Words to Spell in Health And Science Ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid anyone? 2 days ago This Failed Supernova Might Have Given Us Our First Look at The Birth of a Black Hole The whisper of death. 2 days ago     LOAD MORE

Submit Samsung to Increase Memory Chip Production at China Plant Kaspersky Lab Appoints Stephan Neumeier as MD - Asia Pacific Snap Inc Acquires Drone Manufacturing Firm For $1 Million Judy Malware Hits Google Play Store Users, Upto 36.5 Million Devices Infected News18 » Tech 1-min read Samsung to Increase Memory Chip Production at China Plant Reuters Updated: May 29, 2017, 9:38 AM IST The logo of Samsung Electronics is seen in Seoul, South Korea, July 4, 2016. (Image: REUTERS/Kim Hong-Ji/File Photo) Tech giant Samsung Electronics Co Ltd said on Monday it is considering adding memory chip production capacity at its manufacturing base in China amid an industry-wide boom that will likely fuel record sales for memory suppliers. The firm was considering adding capacity at its facility in Xi'an but no specifics, including the potential investment amount and what products it would make with the additional resources, had been decided, a Samsung spokesman said. Samsung, the world's No.1 memory chip maker, has already invested $7 billion in the Xi'an facility to make 3D NAND memory chips. The chips are used for high-end data storage products on electronic devices such as smartphones, personal computers and data servers. Also read: Google Refuses to Share Salary Data with US Government South Korean media reports said earlier on Monday that Samsung was in advanced talks with the Chinese authorities to add 3D NAND chip capacity in Xi'an, and that construction could begin before the year-end. The South Korean firm and other memory chip companies are expected to enjoy record revenue and profits in 2017, driven by growing demand for more processing firepower in consumer electronics, and diminishing production yield on investment as technology grows more sophisticated. Researcher IHS expects this year's memory industry revenue jump 32 percent to a record $104 billion. Industry executives and analysts say 3D NAND suppliers will likely struggle to keep up with orders from clients throughout 2017. Samsung and its rivals have been boosting 3D NAND investment accordingly. While Samsung has so far not given specific targets, it said in April that capital expenditures would rise significantly this year in part due to its plans to boost 3D NAND production capacity.
