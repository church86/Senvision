Related 'Google Pixel XL' review: A fresh take on Android 'OnePlus 3' review: Value-for-price flagship device with a fingerprint scanner This year, we’ve seen camera phones improve a great deal, thanks to larger sensors with larger pixels, wider apertures, dual lens systems, hybrid autofocus and even detachable camera mods. Karan Bajaj & Hitesh Raj Bhagat rank the top camera phones to help you choose the best one: Samsung Galaxy S7/S7 Edge While it’s hard to pick an absolute winner when you’re comparing these flagships, the Galaxy S7 has a lot going for it because of the reduced prices. You can snag a new S7 for about `43,000 at the time of writing which is great value for the kind of performance it delivers. The S7 camera is so good that the company left it as is, even in the ill-fated Note 7, which was supposed to be this year’s flagship. The f1.7 aperture combined with Samsung’s dual pixel autofocus delivers fantastic results irrespective of the scenario and lighting conditions. Moreover, the camera UI is loaded with tweaks and shooting modes. The f1.7 aperture combined with Samsung’s dual pixel autofocus in the Galaxy S7 delivers fantastic results. (Image: AFP) Apple iPhone 7 Plus/Google Pixel/Pixel XL We could not decide on a winner between these two phones for the second position. The iPhone 7 Plus is certainly one of the best in every aspect and has the best implementation of a dual lens system we have seen so far (that Portrait mode with super-shallow depth of field will blow you away every time). The issue is Apple still does not offer as much control over the camera as compared to Android. Google’s Pixel delivers fantastic details, the fastest autofocus around (beating even the mighty iPhone 7 Plus), super-stable 4K video and amazing low light capability thanks to some software magic. However, the pixel loses a point because it skips OIS — this is a vital spec in flagships now. The super-stable 4K video and amazing low light capability of the Google Pixel are a dream come true for any photographer. (Image: Reuters) LG G5/HTC 10/ Apple iPhone 7 The LG and HTC cameras deliver great results on their own, but in comparison to the phones on the top, they lose out. Both LG and HTC suffer from more visible noise when compared to our first and second position winners. Moreover, the dynamic range, colours and details in low light images are the common areas where both these phones loose out in comparison. The iPhone 7 has OIS compared to its predecessor and works as a great all-rounder phone like the LG and HTC. However, in a head-to-head comparison the Samsung, iPhone 7 Plus and Pixel, these phones feel lacking in results. OnePlus 3/Moto Z Both these phones tied for the fourth position for all-round performance. Both deliver fantastic images in day light but lost the top three ranks due to performance in low light. OnePlus 3 proved it mettle with great results in auto HDR mode and fantastic image stabilization (optical + electronic). Moto Z delivered better results with its f1.8 lens in low light compared to OnePlus but still was not up to the mark in comparison to the winners. What sets it apart is the option of the Hasselblad MotoMod. Using this snap on Moto Mod tuned by Hasselblad (a `20k option), you get a 10x optical zoom, support for RAW image capture and a xenon flash. Moto Z delivers great results with its f1.8 lens in low light. (Image: ​ www.motorola.in) Sony Xperia XZ/ Honor 8 The XZ has a 5-axis stabilization system for video recording and the phone manages to deliver top-notch stabilized 4k video. Its focusing system is fantastic with the combination of phase detection, contrast detection and laser autofocus. However, still photos are where it skips a beat — the lack of OIS leads to poor performance in low light images. The Honor 8 stands neck and neck with the Xperia XZ with its dual lens camera. While the shallow depth of field is not as good as the iPhone 7 plus, the Honor 8 captures good details. Low light images are great when viewed on the phone – look closely and you can see a lot of noise in darker areas. One letdown on Honor 8 is the lack of 4k video recording. Special Mentions Asus Zenfone 3 — Asus has focused a lot on camera quality with the Zenfone 3 range. It takes sharp images with minimal noise and has a great OIS system. The only reason it did not make it to the top 5 was that its performance indoors and in low light is lacking in comparison. Xiaomi Mi5 — Mi5 was amongst the best camera phones when it launched earlier this year. The 16MP camera combined with 4-axis OIS delivers good results in daylight but it’s not an all-rounder. In direct comparison, it fails to match up to the image quality delivered by our top 5 ranked phones. Nubia Z11 Mini — Nubia is still a less known brand when it comes to India (especially after separation from ZTE). However, the recently launched Z11 Mini’s camera shocked us with excellent dynamic range, natural colours and fast performance. If it included OIS and 4k video recording capability, it could have been in the top 5. Want stories like this in your inbox? Sign up for the weekly ET Panache newsletter.

Traditionally, businesses have different sales channels that include distributors, wholesalers, retailers, and more. But now these transactions are online, which means the strategy needs to change as well. Placement is important on the internet. When everything is available it’s hard to find what you need, and this is a problem your customers will encounter. One way to better situate yourself is through the use of search engine optimization, a strategic way into gaining and acquiring organic online visitors. To understand SEO one needs to understand a search engine. Search engines like Google and Bing have crawler bots that track websites and index them. Their own proprietary software, Google’s Hummingbird for example, algorithmically ranks each website periodically. To be placed on top of search engine results for key phrases that are important for your business, for example “Mechanic Repair near me,” these bots must read a clean website that is fine tuned. This is down through the use of meta tags and some coding on HTML (to non-coders, don’t be afraid; as a finance major, I was able to complete an SEO internship this past summer and learn the fundamentals). 95% of people that search something on a search engine don’t look past the front page, and of those people, most look at the top few results. If your organization is the first result it will have about 2000% more views than if you were on the second page. SEO isn’t just for Google, it’s for all search engines and for e-commerce as well. The same tactics are being applied to Amazon and eBay for sellers to get their product in competitive market spaces to the top of the results page. The state of digital marketing is changing, and if history has taught us anything about technology, then we know the change will continue to. Google’s algorithm, Hummingbird, was changed from its predecessor Panda and is now more focused on content. This is motivating organizations to keep updated blogs on their websites, as well as have more content-rich information for users. This is not just in search engines, but in the SaaS industry as well with unicorns like HubSpot that coined the term “Inbound Marketing.” This is the promotion of a company through social media such as blogs, podcasts, newsletters, and more to acquire a larger portion of the purchase funnel. Correctly budgeting online advertisements seems to be a hassle when there are so many options. When conflicted with this problem, my head was spinning between choosing ads on Google, Bing, Yahoo, Facebook, YouTube, LinkedIn, StumbleUpon, and more. Ultimately it depends on your goal and your organization. If you are trying to reach a college demographic with a startup idea, StumbleUpon and social media such as Twitter may be better options. If you are in a very specialized sector, LinkedIn and Google may prove successful, although expensive. LinkedIn, for example, has a $2 minimum bid for CPC, which is extremely high. StumbleUpon may land your website or shop 1,000 visitors, although with a high bounce rate. To learn more it is important to comprehend the basics of SEO, HTML, marketing analytics, Adwords, and more. LinkedIn Learning, YouTube, and CodeAcademy are all great resources to get started.

Sharon Nelles told a federal judge in San Francisco on Thursday that more than 370,000 people have registered on the settlement website and nearly 200,000 have submitted claims. The deal covers about 475,000 Volkswagens and Audis that the company acknowledged last year were programmed to cheat on emissions tests. It allows owners to sell their vehicles back to Volkswagen or get them fixed and gives them an additional $5,100 to $10,000 each. A fix has yet to be finalized. Europe Google answers antitrust claims To many Europeans, Google represents Silicon Valley’s perceived stranglehold on the digital world. But on Thursday, the Mountain View company tried to portray itself as a stalwart of online competition as it responded to European antitrust charges that it had restricted consumers’ choices and hamstrung its competitors. The back-and-forth between Google and Margrethe Vestager, Europe’s top antitrust official, highlights the increasing stakes in three competition cases against the search giant, the earliest of which dates to 2010. The standoff is likely to define Europe’s often weary relationship with U.S. technology companies like Amazon, Apple and Facebook for years to come. Google responded on Thursday to two European antitrust charges, saying that its services helped consumers, advertisers and even some competitors find the digital information they seek online. The company said that the strength in Europe of other American technology companies, like Amazon, showed that Google had not restricted the local digital market. The rebuttals relate to years-old accusations that Google unfairly diverted traffic from competitors to favor its own comparison-shopping site, and that the company abused its dominant market position when offering some search products on other companies’ websites. “We can’t agree with a case that lacks evidence and would limit our ability to serve our users,” Kent Walker, Google’s general counsel, wrote in a blog post on Thursday. Dining EatWith gets more money San Francisco’s EatWith, a startup that arranges “social dining” for travelers — meals prepared and served in private homes — said it has raised an undisclosed financing round led by travel giant TripAdvisor with participation from Greylock Partners. TripAdvisor will add EatWith meals, called “Dine with a Local Chef,” to its restaurant pages, allowing users to click through to book the meals through EatWith. The meals will have reviews and photos, similar to the user-generated content offered for other restaurants. EatWith said it has 650 hosts in 200 cities worldwide, including 30 in the Bay Area, and has helped 80,000 diners book its intimate meals. TripAdvisor owns FlipKey, which allows travelers to book stays in private homes, similar to Airbnb. The EatWith deal shows it making new moves into the so-called sharing economy. “EatWith is a truly innovative service that helps travelers dine like a local, and we’re excited to help support their efforts through an investment that will also help us expand our leadership position in the restaurant category,” said Bertrand Jelensperger, global head of TripAdvisor restaurants and LaFourchette CEO. “Breaking bread with someone in their own kitchen is such a powerful way to learn about a culture and make new friends that we’ve decided to integrate EatWith into our TripAdvisor Restaurants pages. Now our users will be able to book EatWith experiences in cities around the world.” Earnings Starbucks tops estimates Starbucks reported a 23 percent increase in its fourth-quarter profit Thursday, thanks to rising sales at its coffee shops, along with an extra week in the period. The results beat Wall Street expectations, and Starbucks also raised its dividend. The Seattle company said fourth-quarter sales rose 5 percent at established stores in the Americas, which includes the U.S., its biggest market. CEO Howard Schultz reiterated on Thursday the importance of the company’s expansion in China, saying it will help growth for “decades to come.” The Chinese stores are the company’s most “efficient and profitable,” Schultz said in a conference call with investors. Starbucks has announced plans to more than double its number of stores in China to 5,000 by 2021.

In anticipation of the movie studio’s upcoming Harry Potter spinoff, Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them, Google has integrated “spells” into its eponymous Google Now assistant on smartphones running its Android mobile operating system. The search giant has made channeling your inner wizard exceedingly easy. Say “OK Google” followed by the “spell” of your choice: Uttering “Lumos” turns on your smartphones flashlight, while shouting “Silencio” switches off your handset’s ringer and notifications. “Now anyone can try their hand at magic,” Google said in a blog post. Related: J.K. Rowling to pen more magical adventures for ‘Fantastic Beasts’ sequel That’s not the only bit of the wizarding world that’s invading the Muggle world’s mobile realm. Google Street View, Google’s service that delivers panoramic views from the curbside of the world’s major thoroughfares, now provides a glimpse into fictional 1926 New York City — including storied sights like the Magical Congress of the USA (MACUSA), Steen National Bank, the underground speakeasy The Blind Pig, and “magical” apartments. Google’s new mobile messaging platform, Allo, will soon gain a new Fantastic Beasts-inspired sticker pack. And YouTube creators at Google’s newly opened YouTube Space in London have begun releasing “content inspired by the wizarding world.” The new Google Now commands and Allo stickers will launch in the coming days on supported smartphones and tablets, and the Street View’s locations are live on Android and iOS devices, as well as the web. Related: New trailer for ‘Fantastic Beasts’ introduces you to the wizarding world of America The integrations are a part of Warner Brother’s broader Fantastic Beasts digital push. Earlier this year, Google built a virtual reality experience for Daydream View, its VR platform for mobile phones, that transported headset wearers to a magical room full of challenging puzzles, frightening creatures, and all manner of wizarding artifacts. In Google Maps, the firm launched Magical Maps, a navigable collection of “magical” New York City locations replete with music, animations, and Easter eggs. And within its search function, Google rolled out contextual Fantastic Beasts promotions: If you search for showtimes in Google, you’ll be shown exclusive content from the upcoming film. Google is not the only one spreading the word. Amazon has partnered with Warner Bros. to integrate “casting” into the internet retail giant’s search bar: Type one of five “spells” and you’ll see a magical effect cover the screen before it navigates to a Fantastical Beasts promotional page. Twitter, meanwhile, has rolled out 12 limited-edition emojis and video clips that can be unlocked by typing in hashtags based on the film’s characters. And Facebook has launched a movie-themed Facebook Live profile frame. “When we had Harry Potter, none of this technology existed,” Blair Rich, president of worldwide marketing for Warner Bros., told Fast Company. “So to be able to creatively interpret this world through technology and allow people this very unusual kind of interaction with it, is really a marketing plus.” The film hits theaters November 18.

Follow TechnoBuffalo A new Google Play Store update is on the horizon. Google is constantly working to improve the experience for Android users who use the Google Play Store to purchase apps. Just last week, for example, Google announced that it’s making changes to help prevent fraudulent apps and reviews. More is coming. Reuters said on Thursday that Google is working on a big revamp to the Google Play Store that will further improve the end-user experience. It may even be able to better predict the content you’re looking for, thanks to its focus to improve “recommendations with artificial intelligence,” Reuters explained. We already see a bit of this, where Google recommends apps based on your purchase and download history, but it stands to be improved. A big Google Play Store update or a gradual one? Reuters said Google is also working to improve the payment systems. It’s not immediately clear what the news outlet meant by that it only said it’s “expanding support for various payment platforms.” Will third party platforms like PayPal or Venmo be supported? We’re not sure. It also isn’t clear if this is going to be one big update to the Google Play Store, or a gradual one. My bet is on the latter, with app suggestions improving as Google reworks its algorithms and boosts its artificial intelligence.

Google Sites will be available to Rapid Release track customers on November 9, while the Scheduled Release will launch two weeks later. Rapid Release customers will receive new features as soon as they are released to the public, while scheduled release customers receive new features one week later, in order to prepare users for changes. Google sent out an email this week detailing the changes, warning users to be prepared as the changes might mean organisations must make changes to ensure the new Google Sites works correctly. The company says that the old version of Sites, now named 'Classic Sites', will still exist as the new version is rolled out and more capabilities are added. "Classic Sites and the sites created with it will continue to follow the Sites-specific settings in the Google Admin console at Apps > G Suite > Sites." Next year Google will start to push the rollout more extensively, providing and recommending users migrate their sites to the new Sites platform. In 2018, Google will start shutting down Classic Sites and will provide a timeline and instructions to ensure migration to the new Sites is successful. No specific date has been chosen. Users will be notified one year in advance of the shutdown. Google says that the new Sites option will be on by default when the rollout happens. Users wanting to create or edit sites in the new Sites will not be able to do so unless Sites and Google Drive are turned on. Users can also turn off the new Sites option by doing the following: In the Admin console, go to Apps > G Suite > Sites > New Sites and select Users at my domain cannot create and edit sites. Turn off Sites entirely. Turn off Drive entirely. Google says organisations using EAP that don't have classic Sites enabled must turn it on if they want to use the new Sites. Privacy and Site sharing options can also be managed in the Admin console. "New Sites will follow the Drive sharing settings in the Admin console (located at Apps > G Suite > Drive). It will not follow the classic Sites sharing settings (located at Apps > G Suite > Sites). If you allow users to publish Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides files on the web, they’ll also be able to publish sites created in new Sites on the web. If necessary, please make any changes to your Drive sharing settings prior to the new Sites release on November 9," Google states.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us More smartphones officially getting the Pixel Launcher By John Hoff - November 3, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter It seems that Google is getting a little generous with the Pixel Launcher – the launcher that came out with the new Google Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones. The company has apparently made the launcher available to a few more devices, and this time officially, because one can always sideload the APK file at the users own risk. Apparently, a number of devices running CyanogenMod 13 and CyanogenMod 14 software can access the app via the Play Store. Users have confirmed – and these are users running CM13 and CM14 on their devices – that they have been able to see, access, and download the Pixel Launcher from the Google Play Store. This would somehow show that devices running Android 5.0 Lollipop up to 6.0 Marshmallow are allowed to run the Pixel Launcher app. But there’s a snag. Once you try with other devices running vanilla Android 6.0 or better (that is, not running CyanogenMod software), the Pixel Launcher app is not available. It could be that Google is stopping Nexus-branded devices like the Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X – both of which started with Android 6.0 out of the box – from having the Pixel Launcher. So as of time of writing, we can confirm that only users running CM13, CM14, and of course the newfangled Pixel devices can have official access to the Pixel Launcher app via the Play Store. For everyone else, you can always download the APK installer via APK Mirror and sideload at your own risk.

The school, like most of its ZP peers, caters to students from extremely poor families and whose parents are either illiterate or have just primary education. But inside the walls of Tarodi ZP school, a digital revolution is brewing in form of the Google Future Classroom initiative. Launched by chief minister Devendra Fadnavis on August 15, the Future Classroom project is finally taking shape. With 40 Chromebooks (mini laptops made by Google) at its disposal along with a 6-in-1 digital projector and a dedicated classroom, students of this school are witnessing a whole new world unfold. Dipendra Lokhande, district education officer (primary), said, “When kids are learning to read and write the traditional way, the Future Classroom is ushering them into the digital world. Classroom assignments are being typed directly into Chromebooks and stored on cloud servers. At such a young age, they are learning how to operate in a paperless environment and use technology to enhance knowledge.” Currently only students from Std VI-VIII (the highest level for this school) are being taught to work in the new environment which, with passing years, will be extended to everyone. A representative of private company maintaining the hardware has been stationed at the school for this academic year to train teachers in handling the set-up. By the next academic year, the school could be on autopilot. Every student and teacher of the school will be getting a special login ID and passwords created by Google with access to cloud servers. For these kids whose parents do not have the financial wherewithal to enrol in a private school, the Future Classroom initiative has come as a boon. Surekha Shete, headmistress of the school, said, “It is surprising how fast these kids are learning to operate laptops, surf the Internet and even learn nuances of preparing a school project through information gathered online. You have to take into perspective the financial and social background and then see the level of learning they have achieved.” With the project just getting started, Shete believes the effects would be visible only by next academic year. While many ZP schools have turned ‘digital’ with help from NGOs, Lokhande said this one was special. “It’s like a full package. With access to Google’s latest technology along with the infrastructure being provided and maintained by the private company, students can accelerate the learning process. Living and interacting in a digital world is the future and that’s what these kids are being taught,” said Lokhande. A second Google Future Classroom is being planned near Mumbai. What’s a digital classroom No specific definition but any classroom that uses a digital board to impart learning can be said to be a digital classroom What’s special about the Google Future Classroom at Tarodi ZP school Apart from the digital board set-up, which is not much different from its peers, students of this school are getting access to 40 Chromebooks and special login and passwords created by Google. These login IDs and passwords give access to cloud servers where students can save their assignments Who is running the project? The project is run by a private company and the Tarodi ZP school is a pilot project, started on state government’s insistence How is the learning imparted to students Similar to other digital school set-ups, students are taught class specific topics as per the state board curriculum.

And the Google Home is something I’ve been anticipating for what feels like years. When the Amazon Echo first launched, my initial thought was that it would be a great idea to marry similar hardware with the — at the time — far greater intelligence of Google Voice Search. And now that day has come. In terms of sheer intelligence for things like facts and local information, as well as general accuracy when trying to pick up your voice, I’ve long felt that Google’s voice assistant — even before it was officially called Assistant — had a leg up on the competition. Not that Alexa and Siri are bad (all three are reaching feature parity at this point, really), but Google’s Assistant — for me, at least — has always been a winner because I’m a heavy user of Google’s services, and they tie in directly with what used to be Google Now. The strengths of Google Assistant shine even brighter with Home, and its potential is even more exciting. Rather than being constrained to your phone, Google Home puts Google Assistant — albeit in slightly different form — within talking distance from pretty much anywhere in your home. I hope you’re ready to get used to talking to your devices, because there’s not really any other way of interacting with this standalone speaker and voice assistant from Google… It’s almost always accurate On that note, one of the first things that struck me about Google Home is its far-field voice recognition. I’m someone that’s mostly new to these voice-activated speakers — as in, I don’t have an Amazon Echo that I use on a daily basis — so realizing just how good these devices can be at listening for your voice commands took me aback. Like many of you, most of my perspective and experience with interacting with these assistants is via a smartphone, so I wasn’t expecting how different things are with Home. If you live in a small one bedroom apartment (which I do), Google Home will be able to hear you from pretty much any corner of your living space talking at a normal indoor volume. I expected that I would have to at least be in the same room as the Home, but in my relatively small apartment (I keep the Google Home in the kitchen at the moment), I can be in the living room, twenty feet away, facing the opposite wall, and talk at a volume as if I’m talking to someone sitting right next to me — and the Home will hear me perfectly 9 out of 10 times (or better). It’s amazing, and I’m just continually stunned by how sensitive and accurate this thing is with just its two tiny speaker holes. Not only does it hear me almost every time, but even in the most difficult situations, it’s often accurate in determining what I’m saying. I’m just continually stunned by how sensitive and accurate this thing is. Here’s one example: I just happen to keep the Google Home on top of my microwave, and I was in the kitchen with the dishwasher running (right below the microwave), the water running in the sink, and the microwave itself also running. That’s a lot of noise for my little kitchen — enough for me to be able to barely understand the person standing next to while cooking. But Google Home is seemingly a super human, because when I had my hands dirty with cookie dough and I needed to set a timer, it was able to hear me over all of this noise on the first try as if it were a human. Seriously, I think it can hear me better in the kitchen than my wife can. There is one case where I’ve found that the range of it being able to pick up your voice decreases, however, and that’s when you’re using the Home to play music. If it’s already playing your music (especially at the higher volumes), it has a hard time hearing the “OK Google” command sometimes — or it’s at least not as good as usual. That’s to be expected because the thing is producing its own interference. It can still hear most of the time, but definitely not at normal volume from a room away. You have to yell a bit. That said, once it does pick up the “OK Google,” it realizes you want to talk to it and temporarily turns down the volume to listen to you. Not fully-featured, but with some unique features But when it does hear you (which is most of the time), what can the Home do for you? As you would expect, it can do just about everything that Google Assistant can do. It can set timers in the kitchen (as mentioned), it can tell you the weather, it can tell you about local businesses, it can play games with you, it can tell you facts about sports and celebrities, and it can give you estimates for how long it’ll take you to get to work among other things. But for now at least, Google Assistant running on Google Home can do a bit more than Assistant can do on the Pixel. Out of the box, Google Home comes with support for three different smart home platforms: Nest, Philips Hue, and SmartThings. Since I don’t have any of these products, I can’t really tell you much about how well they work. But if you do have some of these products, you should be able to set your Nest thermostat’s temperature, dim or brighten your Philips Hue lights, and ask it things like “Are the lights on in the Kitchen?” We’ll be testing these features out soon, but for now, know this: Google Home may not have as many third-party tie-ins as Amazon’s Echo, but Google is actively working to change that. One Google Home-exclusive feature (for now) that I was able to test out was integration with Chromecast. This feature is pretty half-baked for the moment (it can’t do things like play Netflix or Hulu shows quite yet), but it can do the most basic of actions. You can, for example, tell your Google Home to play the latest 9to5Google video from YouTube on your Chromecast. (“Ok, Google, play the latest video from Philip DeFranco in the living room.”) You can tell it to pause the media you tell it to play, and you can tell it to stop playing entirely. Another service that works in this context is whichever music streaming service you decide to set up when you first set up the device. I went with Spotify of course (because Spotify is the best), which means I can play Spotify on my Google Home directly (it is a pretty nice speaker, after all). Or I can tell it to cast whatever music I’d like to a Chromecast, Chromecast Ultra, or Chromecast Audio. My living room Chromecast is called “living room,” so I can simply tell Google Home to “play some Michael Jackson in the living room.” It knows that I prefer Spotify, and it opens up the Spotify app on my living room Chromecast and plays some music. It’s magic. I can’t speak for the other services like Google Play Music and Pandora, but I can say that my experience with Spotify was better than I expected. You can tell Google Home to play a specific song by a specific artist, a specific album, or even a custom playlist, and you can additionally specify where in the house you want to play it using the names of your Chromecasts. I was impressed overall, because — like with other voice commands — the Google Home correctly interpreted what I wanted almost every time. As for speaker quality, I’ll say it’s just okay. It’s not as good as many standalone Bluetooth speakers (like the JBL Charge 2, for example), but it’s good enough to fill a room. There were some exceptions to the rule, however. When I tried asking it to play “the latest 9to5Google videos on my living room Chromecast,” it simply searched YouTube for “9to5” and played whatever was the top result. Sometimes it just isn’t smart enough to get to the right destination even if it hears your directions perfectly. But as the Home keeps reminding me, it’s “still learning.” Demoed at Google’s October 4th event last month, Google Home also comes with an exclusive voice-enabled “My Day” feature, which basically puts together a collection of personalized info from your Google Calendar, the local weather, your work commute, and reminders, to play a quick summary of what to expect for the day. You simply say “tell me about my day,” and you get this quick rundown of information along with a news summary. All of this is customizable, so you can choose your news sources, tell it where your work office is located, and choose between fahrenight and celsius for weather reports. Honestly, I’m not sure how much I’m going to use this feature. I’m going to try to give it a week of asking for it every day, and we’ll see if I keep doing it after that. Based on my first few days, I don’t think the “My Day” feature is going to see much use from me. (Perhaps this might be due to the fact that I don’t have a commute, and the weather is oftentimes irrelevant to my day.) The hardware is great I said that voice is pretty much the only way to interact with Home, but that’s not entirely true. The top of the device is a touch panel that lets you do things like change the volume, tell the Home to shut up if it starts rambling on, and manually activate listening if you need to. The most useful of these is definitely the tap-to-shut-up feature, and I’m really glad Google added it. I have My Day set up to play my News, and it’s nice to be able to just give the Home a poke to tell it that I’m all caught up and I don’t need to hear anything more about this election. You can also turn the speaker on and off entirely with a button on the back. The rest of the hardware is just really pleasing to use and look at. You can tell that it’s built really well, it has a nice weight to it, and the touch sensitive top panel is just a great experience for changing the volume. Of course you can say “OK, Google, change the volume to [any number between 1 and 10]”, but — assuming you don’t have grime on your hands from working in the kitchen — it’s nice to just be able to change the volume with a quick swipe. I haven’t had a reason to turn off the microphone yet, but it’s also nice way to just basically put the device in “off” mode without having to unplug it. It’s a solid start I’m still getting used to using this speaker in my daily life, but all things considered, I’m happy. I think that for $129, the functionality it offers is enough to convince me to buy one — and if not, having a voice activated assistant in your home is still useful enough I think for it to be worth to at least pitch $50 for the Echo Dot. Google Home has more than the Echo Dot in the form of a pretty decent speaker that plays not just by voice command, but is also another Chromecast device in your home. Maybe you would want to have a Chromecast enabled speaker in your bathroom that can read you your daily updates while taking a shower. That would be a great use case here. And while I don’t have more than one unit to test it out, Google also touts with the Home that it’s smart enough that you can have multiple in your house and only the one closest to you will respond. The device handles this seamlessly with phones (if you phone hears you at the same time, it simply tells you that it’s going to answer you on “another device” — the Home), so I have no reason to think that having multiple Homes won’t work similarly as well. Now, if only Google could somehow find a way to distinguish between my own voice and the voices of those saying “OK Google” in the countless number of Google Pixel ads that the Mountain View company is airing… But I think the thing that makes the Google Home a buy for me most is that it has a lot of potential. Amazon’s Echo has a couple of years head start, but in that time it has picked up third-party support for wemo, Samsung SmartThigns, Philips Hue, tp-link devices, Nest, Ecobee, and plenty of services like iHeartRadio, tunein, Pandora, Spotify, Amazon Music, StubHub, Huffington Post, Automatic, Fidelity, and even Campbell’s Kitchen. As of today, the Google Home pretty much just has a few music services, Uber support, NPR news, and a few of those internet of things platforms. So right now, the Echo clearly wins in that area (sheer capability), but I think that we’ll see that change over the next year. It’s basically the opposite of using Siri on an Apple Watch. Google Home, much like the Pixel, is just a starting point. It’s a foundation for Google to keeping mining your speech and interactions to help build its artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies (however controversial that may be), which will in turn improve Google Assistant and these consumer devices in the long run. It’s not fully capable yet, but it does exactly as advertised or better. I was pleasantly surprised with just how reliable it is. It’s basically the opposite of using Siri on an Apple Watch. And if voice assistants are ever going to be a ubiquitous part of our lives, we need to be able to interact with them like humans. As far as I can tell, this is about as close as you can get to that in this price range, and it’s only going to get better. Where to buy one In the United States, you can buy the Google Home at Best Buy or Walmart, or you can get one directly from Google. It’s going to run you $129 no matter where you buy it. If you have some extra cash on hand, however, you can pick up some additional shells for the bottom of the speaker to give it a unique look. We took a look at two of these in the above unboxing video.

Pictured is the Google Pixel C tablet.  ( Google Play Store ) Advertisement A slew of tablets are available in the market with various spec configurations. However, some tablets attract more customers than others. Here are some of the best Android tablets of 2016. Google Pixel C The Pixel C was unveiled near the end of September 2015 and released in early December. The tablet sports a 10.2-inch screen with a display resolution of 2,560 × 1,800 pixels.

Jessica Shipley-Watson of Durham shows Diane Wilson damage to her property. WTVD By Diane Wilson Saturday, November 05, 2016 DURHAM (WTVD) -- The new technology of high-speed internet is here in the Triangle. Google Fiber and AT&T have been busy laying fiber optic lines across the area. While many have enjoyed the faster internet downloads, it's not a welcome sight for everyone. Hundreds of homeowners have filed complaints about the damage crews left behind while installing the lines.

Jessica Shipley-Watson of Durham had sewage backing up into her home for days before it was discovered her sewer line was hit by a sub-contractor for Google Fiber. Jessica Shipley-Watson of Durham talks with Diane Wilson. In July, a subcontractor was laying Google Fiber optic lines in Jessica's neighborhood. While placing the lines in her yard, the crew accidentally hit her sewage line. Jessica says her house smelled horrible as raw sewage was coming up into her home. She said, "It was traumatic. I had a doctor appointment and my children, and toilet water everywhere. I couldn't do the laundry and we couldn't take baths." Jessica said crews with the City of Durham and Google Fiber, along with the subcontractor who laid the lines, all came out to see what happened. "They bored right through the plumbing," Jessica said. "I mean there was no doubt about it being from that happening." The sewage line was eventually repaired and Jessica's family was able to return to taking baths and doing the laundry. But she was left with the $500 plumbing bill and her driveway torn up - which will cost more than $1,200 to fix. "No one is willing to take responsibility for all of it, and I don't want to be out," she said. After months of going back and forth with the city and Google Fiber, Jessica reached out to me. She wanted someone to pay her plumbing bill and for her driveway to be repaired. She says she was told, "Sorry not our problem, you're on your own." She got me involved and I reached out to the City of Durham and Google Fiber. "You came here on a Thursday, by Monday morning I had a phone call. He said we'll handle it, I'm going to take care of it," she said. Risk Management with the City of Durham reimbursed Jessica for her plumbing bill and also paid for her driveway to be repaired. "It's too bad you had to do all of that and basically to get them to do what is right," she said. A representative with the City of Durham said they will be working with the contractor and subcontractor, most likely their insurers, to be reimbursed for the repair bill. Jessica is happy her driveway is finally repaired, but her complaint is not unique. I have heard from dozens of other unhappy homeowners who said their property was also damaged. Other Complaints: Raleigh homeowner Dave Grupy had to deal with not only losing his power twice, but an unsightly trench in his yard and a cut irrigation line. Grupy explained that to fix the problem, "They just laid some sod on top of everything, kind of looked like a patchwork quilt." CLICK HERE TO READ MORE In August, a neighborhood in northwest Raleigh was overcome with the smell of gas after workers cut into a gas line. Homeowner Jennifer Soloway said, "That says that they're not paying attention to what they're doing." John Palmiter of Raleigh was not happy to find that AT&T contractors dug multiple holes in his front yard. A Governors Club resident in Chapel Hill was also unhappy after crews with AT&T cut into a line in his irrigation system. The City of Raleigh: Raleigh has had AT&T and Google laying fiber optic lines for quite some time. AT&T has been working in Raleigh for almost two years, and Google started their project late last fall. However, a rep with the City of Raleigh said they did not keep a running count of complaints until March 2016. Right-of-Way Manager Noah Otto said the city receives 10-15 complaints per week. Since March, they have received over 300 complaints. The city has three inspectors who are going around to check permitted sites as work permits expire, he added. The City of Durham: According to Marvin Williams, Director of Public Works, the city permitted Google to work on 280 miles and AT&T to work on 632 miles. So far, Durham has received 439 complaints for AT&T and 76 complaints for Google. The city's consulting firm explained, "Google tries to handle their own customer care and AT&T does not, thus the difference in numbers." The representative added the city does have an agreement with contractors about timeliness of property being restored to its original condition. Town of Chapel Hill: Chapel Hill has both AT&T and Google Fiber as well, and according to Barry McLamb, Emergency Management Coordinator, the town has received more than 90 complaints since the project started. A representative says complaints including asphalt damage are tracked until they have been resolved. There are 40 asphalt damage complaints for AT&T and 20 for Google; 40 of the 60 asphalt damages had been resolved as of October 3. According to McLamb, the town mediates disputes to check that reasonable outcomes are reached. He said the town does not typically get involved unless a complaint is not being handled or the resolution is not reasonable. Town of Cary: On top of AT&T and Google fiber, Cary also tracks complaints with Time Warner Cable. Public Information Director Susan Moran said the town has not seen any extreme cases, but the town has still received many complaints from residents since construction began. The town has 648 documented fiber complaints, which averages out to about 11 incidents per week. According to Moran, the town communicates regularly with each company to ensure that complaints are being handled and has received good responses. CLICK HERE FOR MORE GOOGLE FIBER RESPONDS: No one from Google Fiber would talk to us on camera but provided me with this statement: "Google Fiber is building one of the biggest and most complex infrastructure projects in Triangle history. We want to be good neighbors, so we're doing everything we can to prevent unnecessary disruptions and resolve issues quickly. We take all construction-related incidents very seriously, and we apologize for any inconvenience this has caused." A representative added they have a team dedicated to speaking with customers who have any questions or concerns about construction. Residents can call the team 24/7 at (877)-454-6959. AT&T RESPONDS: No one from AT&T would talk to us either on camera, but Josh Gelinas with AT&T provided me with this statement: "With the launch of our 100% fiber network to over 150,000 locations in the Raleigh-Durham area, AT&T has positioned Raleigh-Durham as a gigabit city by bringing customers our fastest internet speeds. AT&T has dozens of supervisors and inspectors in the field to ensure our contractors are performing to our standard. We work closely with city officials to ensure our work is done in a timely and orderly fashion. Our contractors are trained to obtain proper permitting, closely follow local construction codes, and abide by rules governing rights-of-way and property easements. We place door hangers at each residence and place signage within subdivisions to identify what's taking place and how to reach us in the event of an issue. We track damages and other issues and review performance with our contractors performing the work. As we identify poor performers, we cull those out. AT&T's goal is to minimize impact on residents before, during and after construction and to keep them informed through a variety of means throughout the network expansion process. Whether large or small, these damages impact the public and that is not lost on AT&T. Damage can occur for a number of reasons, from contractor error to locations not being accurate. Before we begin a project, we talk with locating firms to provide them with some high-level visibility into where we anticipate completing work on a regular basis. Furthermore, as a part of the large project locate process, we typically provide 30-60 days' notice versus the minimum 10 days. We are constantly collecting data and reviewing our processes to evaluate our efforts. We make changes as needed to ensure improvements in the process, for AT&T and our utility partners. We work with excavators, other utility owners, locaters, and state and local municipalities to identify best practices and to better train our own forces, that of our contractors, and their sub-contractors." Tips: Here are your rights when it comes to utility easements. You should first receive an informational door hanger in advance of the work. Then, different color markings will be sprayed on the ground several weeks before construction. The markings show the contractors where the existing underground utility lines are laid. If you have an irrigation system or dog fence, you should mark it so crews don't damage it. Companies can place the cables along the water, sewer and electrical lines, in most cases, the right of way includes the area from the curb towards your home for about 11 feet. If the crew has to venture further than the easement allows, companies should get permission from property owners before working on private property. Counties are not involved in the project, so you should check with your town or city for what to do. Most municipalities have information about it on their website.

Under the leadership of Sameer Samat, who rejoined Google earlier this year after a spell as president of wearable tech firm Jawbone, the company is sharpening Google Play store recommendations with artificial intelligence and expanding support for various payment platforms, among other initiatives. Google’s efforts in some way mirror those of archrival Apple Inc, which revamped its App Store this year with quicker review times for new apps and an increase in the cut of revenue that goes to developers. Both companies face a chorus of complaints from developers who say they are struggling to stand out in a jam-packed field. Many smartphone users, meanwhile, appear to have become tired of downloading apps altogether, especially as messaging services like Snapchat perform more of the functions that required a separate app. Games remain a focus of the Google Play store, and Nintendo Co Ltd is building a version of its popular Super Mario Run game for Android, said Mr Samat, who leads product management for the Google Play store. The store is also expanding to new platforms, including wearable devices, virtual reality headsets and Google’s Chromebook laptops. “What we are excited about is giving developers that single entry point for more and more of the computing ecosystem,” said Samat. Google has eased the once-complicated process of developing apps for the Play store, said James Knight, a former Google employee who launched Pembroke, a consultancy that helps developers convert Apple-compatible iOS apps to the Android operating system. “The App Store has historically been a little more straightforward, and Android has been a bit more like the Wild West,” he said. Mirroring the larger smartphone market, the Play store sees far more activity by virtue of its placement on the wide range of devices running the Android OS — but Apple claims more of the profits.

 Should you buy Google Home or the Amazon Echo? Steve Kovach Nov. 3, 2016, 5:20 PM 15,902 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google Home. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider After years of hype from the tech industry, we finally have a smart home product that actually makes sense. WiFi speakers like Amazon's Echo and the new Google Home are brand-new types of computers, letting you do many of the same tasks you're used to on a smartphone with just your voice. Both the Echo and Google Home are excellent products. But you can only pick one. So, which should you choose? Let's break it down. Audio quality The most disappointing thing about Google Home's hardware is the sound quality. It tends to be high-pitched, which is annoying if you want to listen to anything with some bass. The Echo has much better sound, including rich bass. Neither speaker sounds amazing though. Luckily, both have options that let you connect them wirelessly to standard stereo systems. For Home, you can use the $35 Chromecast Audio. For Echo, you can use the $50 Echo Dot. Winner: Amazon Echo The Echo Dot. Steve Kovach/Business Insider Accuracy Both speakers have incredible voice recognition. It even works when music is playing or you're standing across the room. Winner: Tie Design This one is subjective, but I think Google Home looks better than the Echo. Yes, Home looks kind of like an Air Wick, but it's also more compact and has a more thoughtful design. The smaller size means it's easier to display, and the sloped top is a nice touch. Google could've just made a generic-looking canister, but Home has its own unique look that'll match your home's decor better. Plus, you can customize the design by swapping out the bottom speaker grill with different colors. The Echo, on the other hand, isn't much to look at. It's just a plain black or white cylinder that gives off a cold, industrial vibe. The lights on top of the Echo are a nice touch, but other than that, it's not nearly as inviting as Home. Winner: Google Home Third-party apps and services Both speakers can do a lot of great stuff out of the box, but things get even better when developers get to add their own apps and services.  So far, there are limited options on Google Home. You can sync it with popular music services like Spotify or Pandora. There's also Uber integration. But you won't find much more than that until more developers are able to build on Google Home. Echo had over a year's head start on Google Home, and it has hundreds of "skills" from third parties ranging from Capital One to Domino's Pizza. It's definitely the stronger of the two ecosystems. Winner: Amazon Echo Both speakers let you call an Uber. Dave Smith/Tech Insider Intelligence This is the most important category, and the one that really differentiates the two devices. While both Google Home and Amazon Echo have plenty of smarts, Google has the advantage here because it's able to tap into the search giant's trove of knowledge and stitch together the various Google services you use like Gmail and Google calendar. All that is thanks to the company's new digital helper, Google Assistant, which is only a few weeks old and already much more impressive than Amazon's Alexa or Apple's Siri. Echo can sync with your Google calendar and some other services, but it's simply not as refined as Google Assistant. And in the future, I'm more confident in Google's ability to make Assistant/Home smarter, faster than Amazon can make Alexa/Echo. Winner: Google Home Google Assistant is the best digital helper. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider Google Home has a slight edge While both devices are essentially on par with each other, I think Google Home has a slight edge because of Google Assistant. You want these devices to be as smart as possible, and Google has always had the advantage when it comes to AI and machine learning. Plus, at $129, Google Home is $50 cheaper than the Amazon Echo. If you want to buy a connected speaker, check out Google Home first. If you already have an Echo, keep it Just because I think Google Home is better doesn't mean you should abandon your Echo if you already own one. It's still an incredible device. In fact, I plan on keeping my Echo instead of replacing it with a Google Home. It's that good.

November 3, 2016 4:05 PM Filed Under: amazon, Echo, Google, Home (Photo by Spencer Platt/Getty Images) This Friday Google plans to release its newest creation the Google Home.  The device comes in competition to Amazon’s Echo.  But with a few years of people already using Echo does Google stand a chance to make any headway? One thing that may help persuade people interested in a device like this to buy from Google is the price tag alone.  With a starting price of $129 in opposition of Echo’s $179.99 price, people may be more inclined to choose the Google device.  However Echo still has a better answer to question ratio than several of Googles other devices including this one. It will stand closely as tall as the Echo in a cylindrical shape, and comes with a touch surface and hidden LED lights that will light up when using voice commands similar to Echo. The Google Home is able to answer more detailed questions, and recognize foreign languages as well as coming equipped with a music tuner.  However Google Home for now can only be paired to one person in the household and will not recognize commands from other people.  Also it is still unable to find specific songs from a movie like Echo can, and will instead pull up a Spotify play list. For now Echo can still reign supreme, but with time, Amazon may end up with some genuine competition. Comments Leave a Reply Cancel reply Enter your comment here...

USA TODAY You can remove the Google Home base to dress it up in different colors (Photo: Google) It was the question on everyone’s minds Wednesday night – particularly if you weren’t parked in front of a TV. Who won the World Series? Reviews are pouring in for Google Home, the search giant's answer to the Amazon Echo smart speaker which goes on sale Friday. While there is a lot to like in the $129 device, many critics, including USA TODAY's own Ed Baig, noted that there's still plenty of room for improvement. USA TODAY Google Home review: In catch-up to Echo, but with promise Both devices are good at handling a variety of tasks including playing music, controlling Philips Hue lights and calling for Uber rides. Google even has some other cool tricks including beaming videos onto your Chromecast. Interestingly though, it is in search where Amazon right now has an edge. When I asked both devices this morning "who won the World Series?", Alexa gave me the correct answer ("the Chicago Cubs won the 2016 World Series four games to three") while Google started listing off recent scores from the past three games, directing me to ask for "a particular team" for more information. Even Siri got the answer right, telling me the "Cubs won the World Series 4-3. They won the last game 8 to 7." A Siri query asking, "Who won the World Series?"  (Photo: Eli Blumenthal, USA TODAY) It wasn't just the final result that flummoxed Google's smart assistant. As Ed noted in his review, when he asked Alexa and Google “what’s happening in the World Series?” when Game 7 between the Cubs and Indians entered extra innings Wednesday night, Alexa responded by starting an NPR flash briefing, while Google Home came back with the frustrating “I don’t know how to help with that yet.” When he asked “What’s the score of the Cubs game?” Echo correctly informed him that it was 6-6 at the time, and Google Home instead gave the results from Game 6. That said, we're still in the early days for smart digital assistants. But if you plan on getting one this holiday season, don't be surprised if not all your questions are answered.

Google Home is essentially the company’s answer to Amazon’s Echo, and the two devices share a lot of similar features. I’ve had a chance to play with a review unit of Google Home for a few days now, and compare it directly to an Amazon Echo speaker. Ten things stood out during those tests: Google Home has bumping sound. Google Home sounds acceptable for the price; don’t expect high-end stereo sound from a $129 speaker. Compared to the Echo, the sound is a bit less well-defined, and at times a bit distorted, especially when the device speaks to you. However, the bass is remarkable for such a small package. In a way, the Echo is the speaker you’d want to listen to “Prairie Home Companion” to when working in your kitchen. Google Home is for cranking up that club hit while doing the dishes. The microphones are remarkable. Amazon has made a big deal about the seven microphones integrated into its Echo speaker. Google Home just has two such microphones, but seems to perform just as good in most situations. In fact, in some cases, Google Home was even better at picking up commands uttered from places without direct line of sight. Only when playing loud music, the Echo performed notably better than Google’s counterpart. Related How Google Plans to Take Down Amazon’s Echo (EXCLUSIVE) Google Home looks neat. One of the downsides of Amazon’s Echo is that it isn’t exactly a beautiful piece of hardware. With its black cylindrical body, the Echo could easily double as a high-tech explosive device in an episode of “Homeland.” Google Home on the other hand is smaller, a bit chubby, and much more pleasant to look at. In fact, you can even swap out the speaker grill to add some color and match your interior design. It’s great for music. Sound quality issues notwithstanding, Google Home is great for listening to music, especially if you have a subscription to one of the supported music services (right now, those include Spotify, Google Play Music, YouTube Music and Pandora). The ability to ask for any song or album without having to dive into an app is great. Being able to at any point ask for the name of a song is pretty neat as well. Then again, the Echo does both just as well. Google Home loves house parties. Music listening with Google Home gets even better if you also have Chromecast Audio streaming adapters connected to other speakers or stereo systems around your home. Just ask for a song to play on all of them — and you’ll have an instant house party. The Echo doesn’t support anything like it just yet. Chromecast integration lives and dies with YouTube. Google Home also integrates with the company’s Chromecast video streaming adapter, making it possible to tell the device to “play the ‘Daily Show’ on TV.” This works well if you know what you want to watch, but the functionality really lives and dies with YouTube’s search capabilities. I once asked Google Home to play “the news” on TV, and it proceeded to play a video from a right-wing conspiracy program that included anything but real news. In another instance, I wanted to cheer up my kids with a “cute guinea pigs” video. Google Home proceeded to show a video of guinea pigs mating. Okay, Google, I guess it’s time we have that talk. Related Amazon Drops Price of Echo Dot, Starts Selling It to Everyone Google knows a lot. Google Home is also great at querying Google about basic factoids. Forgot how many votes there are in the electoral college, how long you can store raw beef in the fridge, or how many calories your Halloween candy has? Google Home has the answer, while Amazon’s Alexa smart assistant frequently has to pass. “Okay Google” only triggers one answer. One of the issues I was worried about when setting up Google Home was that it uses the same so-called hot word as Google on my phone and desktop. “Okay Google” wakes up any of those devices to listen for voice input, which is why I feared that all of them would try to answer my question at the same time. However, my phone actually knows when Google Home is listening in as well, and simply informs me with an on-screen message that another device is answering. Third-party services support yet to come. Over time, Google wants to add support for a number of third-party services to Google Home, which could, for example, make it possible to tell the device to play your favorite Netflix show on TV. Right now, very few third-party services actually work with the device. In addition to Spotify, Pandora and TuneIn, there is really only support for Uber, making it possible to call a car with your voice. Google services are still limited. Even support for Google’s own services is still very spotty. Google Home can tell you about things on your calendar, but not add items to it yet. It can add things to your shopping list, and tell you about traffic to any destination, thanks to a tie-in with Google Maps. But it can’t read you your new emails yet, and also doesn’t support text messaging. Still, it seems like Google has big plans for the device. One example: Asked where my phone was, Google Home told me that device location was “not yet supported.” So should you buy Google Home? If you already own a Chromecast or Chromecast audio adapter, the answer clearly is yes. Similarly, actively using Google services likely makes Google Home a much better match than Amazon’s Echo. The flip side of this is that Google already knows a lot about its users, and some may feel uneasy about the idea of offering up even more personal information with a voice assisted device like Google Home. If you want the search giant’s smarts at your disposal with a simple “okay Google” voice command, you really do need to be okay with Google.

The company said its features are not anti-competitive and reflect the way people use the web. It suggested the EU doesn't understand how online retail works. When searching on Google for products to buy, shopping results appear as sponsored links at the top of the search results page. This attracted the ire of Europe's competition commissioner in April 2015. The commissioner claimed the search results promoted Google's own services and advertisements and led to loss of business for conventional price comparison websites. Google protested, saying the EU had failed to consider the rise of online retail giants, such as Amazon. In Google's view, these websites also compete with price comparison sites. The EU made an updated claim, saying it disagreed because Amazon sometimes paid price comparison sites to be included in search results. Today, Google published a second response to the EU. It said its search ads benefit itself, its advertisers and most importantly, its users. It claimed that removing the promotions would be detrimental to all these services, again stating the EU is wrong to exclude sites such as Amazon. It categorically denied that Google Shopping is "harming competition" on the web. According to Google, the EU's revised case "doesn't fit the reality of how most people shop online." It said that online shoppers don't look for products in a search engine, click on a price comparison site and then proceed to the merchant's storefront. Instead, they access the storefront directly from a variety of routes, including search engines, specialist services, social media, online ads and price comparison sites. "While there's no indication that the Commission ever surveyed consumers, the evidence is clear: consumers can and do click anywhere and navigate to any site they choose," said Google. "All of these services — search engines, price comparison sites, merchant platforms and merchants — compete with each other in online shopping. That's why online shopping is so dynamic and has grown so much in recent years." Google has collected data that it says confirms its viewpoint. It pointed to a recent study that found many German online shoppers visit Amazon first of all. A third of consumers go to the site first. Only 14.3 percent go to Google and just 6.7 percent to price comparison sites. A similar study in the U.S. revealed a similar thing, even more heavily favouring Amazon. 55 percent started their search on the online retailer with 28 percent heading to Google. 16 percent began on the site of an individual retailer. With Google not willing to concede any ground and the EU still pushing a case it thinks benefits consumers, there doesn't appear to be any end in sight for the dispute. Google could be fined up to 10 percent of its global revenue if it is found to have breached European competition laws. It is also facing anti-trust investigations over its AdSense advertising network and Android operating system. The company said it's "confident" the cases will be decided in its favour before a court. "We’re confident these cases will ultimately be decided based on the facts and that this analysis will show our product innovations have benefited consumers and merchants, and expanded competition," said Google senior vice president Kent Walker. "The surest signs of dynamic competition in any market are low prices, abundant choices and constant innovation — and that’s a great description of shopping on the Internet today."

At a new developer event today, Google revealed it has plans to change that for Android developers so they can offer introductory rates to their subscriptions for new customers. This gives users the ability to try a service like Sling TV for a discounted rate for the first three months before returning to its normal price of $20 a month. Google says this is great for both consumers and developers because consumers will be able to try out a service at a reduced cost, while developers will no longer have to build payment infrastructure from scratch.

Read more about the stories in today's news: Microsoft Launches Teams, a Rival to Slack Collaboration Platform Microsoft Rebukes Google for Early Disclosure of Windows Bug Belkin Patches Vulnerabilities in Its WEMO IoT Devices Broadcom Spending $5.9 Billion to Buy Networking Vendor Brocade       Today's topics include Microsoft's introduction of its Teams collaboration platform, Microsoft's response to Google's public disclosure of a bug in the Windows kernel, Belkin's patch of the security flaws in its WEMO IoT devices and Broadcom's $5.9 billion deal to acquire networking vendor Brocade. Microsoft on Nov. 2 took the wraps off its new team collaboration service for Office 365 called Teams, confirming rumors that the company was preparing its own platform to rival the popular Slack platform. Rumblings of a Slack rival from Redmond, Wash., began to surface earlier this year after Microsoft had reportedly considered buying the cloud-based messaging and collaboration company for as much as $8 billion. In September, details of a Skype Teams app with Slack-like functionality emerged. Microsoft rebuked Google for releasing details of a security flaw in the Windows kernel for which a patch is not yet available. Microsoft officials said that Google's disclosure potentially endangers customers and that they believe in coordinated vulnerability disclosures. In an Oct. 31 blog post, Neel Mehta and Billy Leonard, security researchers with Google's Threat Analysis Group, said a local privilege escalation bug exists in the Windows kernel. Attackers can take advantage of the flaw to escape a security sandbox, the researchers warned. The vulnerability is especially serious because attackers are already exploiting it in the wild, the two Google researchers said. However, in a statement emailed to eWEEK, Microsoft challenged Google's description of the issue. "We disagree with Google's characterization of a local elevation of privilege as 'critical' and 'particularly serious,'" the statement said. Belkin's WEMO internet of things devices, widely deployed in homes around the world, until this week were at risk from a pair of zero-day vulnerabilities. The vulnerabilities, which security firm Invincea reported, are set to be detailed in a Black Hat Europe session on Nov. 4 titled, "Breaking BHAD: Abusing Belkin Home Automation Devices." The WEMO devices include functionality that enables users to set up rules for when devices should turn on or off, Scott Tenaglia, internet of things researcher for Invincea Labs, explained. The WEMO mobile app includes a user interface that enables users to easily create rules, which are all stored internally in the app, inside of a SQLite database, which is commonly used on embedded devices as it has a small resource footprint. Chip maker Broadcom is bulking up its capabilities in networking and storage with the $5.9 billion acquisition of networking equipment maker Brocade in a deal that comes two days after speculation about a possible acquisition first surfaced. Executives for both companies announced the deal Nov. 2, saying that bringing Brocade into the fold will give Broadcom a broader portfolio of products that it can offer system makers. Broadcom is particularly focused on Brocade's products in the area of Fibre Channel storage-area network switching. The company plans to sell Brocade's IP networking business, which includes wireless and campus networking, data center switching and routing and network software offerings. The acquisition, which has been approved by Brocade's board of directors and Broadcom's executive committee, is expected to close in the middle of next year.       Submit a Comment Loading Comments...   Manage your Newsletters: Login   Register My Newsletters eWeek Editor's Pick News & Views Cloud Computing Mobile and Wireless Update Best of eWeek eWeek Sunday Brunch eCareers Smart Moves Enterprise Applications Topic Center Update Enterprise IT Advantage eWeek Whitepaper Spotlight eWeek Labs eWeek Enterprise Update eWeek Storage Report Industry Center Update : Finance Industry Center Update : Government Industry Center Update : Health Care Infrastructure Topic Center Update Linux & Open Source Topic Center Update Mid-Market Solutions Securing the Enterprise VoIP Topic Center Update What's Hot Now eWeekend         News and Reviews Slideshows IBM Aims Watson at Embodied Cognition Microsoft Advances 'Any Developer, Any App, Any Platform' Strategy Google Will Tag Frequent Violators of Its Site Safety Standards Intel Lights Up the Sky With New Shooting Star Drone Old School Polling Methods Hid Trump's Popularity With Voters 10 Reasons Not to Buy the Apple MacBo...

It has been repurposed as an online payment system, competing with the likes of PayPal. And now Google has released a web app so that you will be able to easily send and receive money from your friends, family members, colleagues, or clients, and all you need is a browser and a connected debit card. Google Wallet originally was a physical card that you could use for various online and offline transactions, but eventually they changed tactics and earlier this year, they officially killed off the debit card. Now, with the launch of the Google Wallet web app, you can easily receive money from other people and all you need is a browser and a debit card that is associated with your Google account. You can still use the Google Wallet app to transfer and receive money on your mobile device of course, but having a web app can make it easier for those who don’t have mobile devices at the moment to still be able to do transactions. And of course, if you have a supported device and a supported bank or financial institution, then you can use Android Pay for your brick and mortar, and now even online, payments. The Google Wallet web app is now available for you to use to receive money from your contacts. Let’s see whether this will still be relevant a few months from now since Android Pay is also going into online payments already.

The Google Pixel XL is one of the best phones you can get +11,777 Quentyn Kennemer Nov 3rd, 2016 Anyone who has read our Googe Pixel and Pixel XL review and seen our latest list of the best Android smartphones knows how highly we think of them, but what good is it to be the best for those who need supreme battery life? Well, thankfully, it’s pretty damn staunch in that category (and is one of the biggest reasons why we do consider it the best). The Google Pixel phones — the XL model, more so — have a level of power efficiency that’s not matched by many in the Android world to date. While phones across the board are getting more and more efficient with each and every release, it’s clear that Google’s no-nonsense approach to hardware and their ability to tune the Pixel’s software to be the best it possibly can translates to impressive results. The 2,700mAh battery inside the regular-sized Pixel model falls just shy of the new 3,000mAh standard we’re seeing, and yet it can still last about as long as those devices. Of course, the 3,450 pack in the Pixel XL — made possible by its 5.5-inch form factor — takes things to the very next level. Obviously, exact battery performance is going to differ from person to person as we all use our phones differently, but there’s one thing we an say with absolute confidence: if you want a phone sure to last all day and maybe more without having to make concessions (ugly battery packs, buying unknown phones from unknown companies, or completely neutering your phone just to make it to lunch time), the Google Pixel and Pixel XL should be at the top of your list of considerations.

Microsoft and Google provide stiff competition in the cloud, but no one is closing the AWS gap. By Conner Forrest | November 3, 2016, 11:34 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: CNET There are clear signs that Microsoft Azure is making gains against Amazon Web Services (AWS). But, based on recent data from Synergy Research, it's not nearly enough. As reported by Liam Tung for ZDNet, AWS has double the market share of its next three largest competitors combined. While that isn't as dramatic as AWS formerly boasting 10X the utilized capacity of its largest 14 competitors, it's still a sign that that, in the public cloud, winner takes most. Really, really big Synergy Research Group's study comes on the heels of Amazon announcing $3.2 billion in AWS revenue, generating $861 million in operating income. AWS competitors don't even bother to break out profitability for their public cloud offerings, likely because there isn't much to speak of. SEE Amazon still crushing cloud competition, says Gartner Magic Quadrant for IaaS Microsoft's cloud business grew by 116% year over year, while Alphabet announced that its Google Cloud business generated "the highest percentage growth of all its product lines," albeit on a relatively modest base. Both are impressive, earning cloud pundit Bernard Golden's estimation that both follow AWS as part of a cloud trinity with such commanding leads that "it's impossible for anyone to catch them." And yet, one cloud stands out, and that's AWS, with double the revenue of its next three largest competitors: Who can catch up? At this point, it's worth asking, who can catch AWS? Of Microsoft and Google, Microsoft has made the most headway and seems likely to continue. But, if we ask that same question of who can catch the big three cloud providers, the answer seems to be a resounding "No one." Must-Read Cloud Why there's no compelling use case for hybrid cloud Pokemon Go: How the cloud saved the smash hit game from collapse Switching clouds: What Spotify learned when it swapped AWS for Google's cloud Tech Pro Research: Cloud computing policy Not IBM. Not Oracle. Not any combination of also-rans. The reason, according to Golden, is innovation. AWS certainly touts this as the reason it leads. According to Amazon CFO Brian Olsafsky on the company's earnings call, "[Customers tell us our] functionality and pace of innovation is greater than our competition. We have added more new significant features and services this year already than we had all of last year when we added 722." Just one indication of this innovation, at AWS and its top competitors, is the onslaught of new, increasingly popular databases, as measured by DB-Engines. Whether open source or not, these cloud giants keep opening up amazingly rich code, with Google perhaps besting them all. Take a look at the next tier of cloud providers and you'll struggle to find much innovation that they can afford to open source. No wonder Golden can credibly claim, "most of the innovation in the industry resides with the big cloud providers. Companies that don't want to be left on the dust-heap of history need access to that innovation and will embrace it despite putative lock-in concerns." AWS leads that pack, but the top-three (AWS, Microsoft, and Google) seem to have established a joint dominance that gives customers choice and incredible wells of innovation to draw from.

With subscriptions being the fastest growing business model on Play, Google hopes that this will help developers attract more customers. Google notes that consumer spending in subscription apps has increased 10x over the past three years. Specifically, developers can create an introductory price for new subscribers for a set period of time. For example, a subscription could be offered for a $1 per month for the first three months. Afterwards, the normal subscription price could automatically kick in. Subscription promos join free trials and local/custom pricing, along with other Play Store tools announced this year. Back at I/O, app pre-registration was announced, as was the Early Access open beta program to get feedback from early adopters before launch. Pre-registering provides a notification when an app is available and has helped drive more than 30 million installs so far. The feature is still limited to major developers, mainly games, at this time. Meanwhile, titles featured in Early Access have been downloaded over 4 million times — a drastic increase from the 1 million stat shared in September. The last new year feature allows developer to better identify users who have requested refunds to better manage their economies. This program is currently in early beta with interested developers able to sign up.

It also serves as a decent speaker that can fill a room with sound, and the possibilities for the device’s future are exciting as more third-parties build experiences that integrate with the Assistant. The hardware is pretty sleek and simple, with only one button, a capacitive touch-sensitive top, far-field microphones, and interchangeable bottoms. It’s a nice looking device overall, sitting in between the Amazon Echo and the Echo Dot in size. And in price, at $129, it’s right between those two devices as well.

Google Home: 10 tips and tricks to get started 0 Share: Smart Home by Jason Cipriani November 3, 2016 11:35 AM PDT @MrCippy Up Next Fantastic Beasts' Dan Fogler sees magic in tech Start chatting with Google Assistant Google's digital assistant has learned some new tricks and can now handle a real conversation! Here are some new commands you can start with. by Vanessa Hand Orellana 3:33 Close Drag The Google Home is one of those devices that the more you use it, the more you discover it can do. For example, did you know you can call an Uber using the Google Home? Or what about playing YouTube videos on your TV without touching a single remote or device? It's all possible, and then some. 10. Disable the microphone Enlarge Image Photo by Jason Cipriani/CNET On the backside of the Google Home, there's a button that stops the microphone from constantly listening for the wake phrase of "OK, Google." When pressed, you will hear "Microphone off" from the speaker and its indicator lights will turn orange (or maybe it's red?). Press the button again enable the microphone and use the Google Home as you normally would. Some users like to have the option of disabling the microphone when not in use, or when having a sensitive conversation near a device that's always listening. 9. Rename Google Home Enlarge Image Photo by Screenshot by Jason Cipriani/CNET In the Home app on your iOS or Android device, navigate to the settings for your Google Home device. This is done by going to the Devices > Menu > Settings. Under the Device Info section, tap on Name. Rename your Home device whatever you'd like, but keep in mind that as you add more devices to your house, you'll make to make the names easy to remember based on location. That way when you request Home to start playing music on multiple speakers, you know the name of the exact speaker you want to use and aren't left guessing. 8. Play on Chromecast from the Home Follow the same steps to change the name of your Chromecast in order to make it easier to play content on your TV. For my testing, I renamed my Chromecast to "TV." Doing so makes it simple to tell the Google Home to play a video from YouTube on my TV. (Ex. "OK, Google, play Stampylongnose on my TV.") Rename your Chromecast to something that's easy to say and remember, and interacting with it through the Google Home will be a breeze. 7. Guest Mode Enlarge Image Photo by Screenshot by Jason Cipriani/CNET The Google Home acts as a Chromecast audio device, allowing friends and family members to use it without accessing your Wi-Fi network. Enable Guest Mode by going to Home app > Devices > Menu > Guest Mode. Enable Guest Mode and then wait for a PIN code, which you will need to give to guests in order to connect to your device. 6. When all else fails, reboot Enlarge Image Photo by Screenshot by Jason Cipriani/CNET The Google Home surely isn't immune to a hiccup here and there, and with the No. 1 fix for technological glitches being to restart the device, it only makes sense for Google to include it in the Home app. Open the Home app >Devices > Menu > Reboot. 5. Set Assistant preferences Enlarge Image Photo by Screenshot by Jason Cipriani/CNET All of your interaction with the Google Home is done with Google Assistant, the company's updated personal assistant that's built into chat app Allo, Pixel phones and, now, Google Home. You'll want to tailor what information Google Assistant knows and can use to better help you with your requests. Open the Home app, slide out the menu drawer from the left side of the screen, and then tap on More settings. I suggest starting with the sections News and My Day. In News you can select various audio news updates to listen to. Use My Day to set what details are included when you prompt the Home to tell you about your day. Options include the weather, commute time, next meeting, any pending reminders, and then play newscasts. Learn more tips and tricks for Google Assistant. 4. Change the music source The Google Home currently supports Google Play Music, YouTube Red, Pandora and Spotify. To set your preferred music source, open the Music section in More settings and select a music service. If you haven't linked it to the Home yet, you'll be prompted to at that time. Bonus: When you first set up your device, you're given a complimentary six month subscription to YouTube Red (and by extension Google Play Music). 3. Call an Uber Enlarge Image Photo by Screenshot by Jason Cipriani/CNET Right now, only Uber is listed as an available third-party service in the Home app. As time goes on and more developers are able to work on adding support, the list will surely grow. Find a list of supported services by opening More settings > Services. Tap on the service you want to connect to your Google Home device, then follow the prompts. 2. Restrict inappropriate content With the Google Home making it easy for anyone to begin playing YouTube videos and music, it's likely your kids are going to have their own requests. In order to avoid any inappropriate content, open More settings and then scroll to the bottom of the page and enable YouTube Restricted mode. 1. View command history Enlarge Image Photo by Screenshot by Jason Cipriani/CNET Google saves a copy of every voice command given to the Google Home in the Google account tied to the device. You can view all of your previous commands, and remove anything you don't want stored in your account with just a few taps. Again, go to More settings and then scroll to the bottom of the page then tap on My Activity. A webpage will open, displaying the time, date and request. Tap on the play button to hear what the Google Home recorded, and if you want to remove it from your history, tap on the menu button then Delete.

Through a HTML5 bug Google’s Chrome they can freeze the computer after which the a web page is shown to the victim that tries to convince him to call a ‘helpdesk’. The ‘helpdesk’ is actually run by the scammers and is abused by them to gain access to the computer of victims and/or to make the victim pay for solving non-existing technical issues. The ‘tech support scam’, as this kind of fraud is known, can be performed in several ways. The scammers can call people at home and claim they are from e.g. Microsoft, show a popup that tries to convince the user they have technical issues and should call a number listed on the popup, or show advertisements on search engines that appear to be of the helpdesk of a computer manufacturer but actually is a phone number run by scammers. This time the criminals have found a method that abuses a known HTML5 bug in Google Chrome that consumes all memory and CPU cycles from the computer. When the bug, already known to Google since 2014,  is exploited, it makes the computer freeze. The actual code that freezes the computer consists of only 7 lines of Javascript code. When code is run and the computer is frozen, a website is shown that appears to be from Microsoft and which alerts the user that his computer is infected with a Virus.Trojan.worm! 055BCCAC9FEC. The page states that users should ‘immediatley’ [sic] call a number provided on the webpage for technical support. “Depending on your computer’s specifications you may or may not be able to launch Task Manager to kill the browser process. Otherwise your system will be brought to its knees and a hard reboot may be the only option left. Whatever you do, please do not call the phone number for support because it is not Microsoft’s but rather a group of scammers waiting to rob you of hundreds of dollars under false pretenses”, Jérôme Segura from MalwareBytes writes in a blog. Malwarebytes also reported the bug again to Google and hopes that now the bug is actively exploited by cybercriminals, it will be fixed soon.   Related Forum: Latest News Headlines Related Tags: microsoft html5 security Microsoft: 68% of consumers interacted with tech support scammers Ransomware developers open helpdesk to help with decryption and payment issues FTC starts case against fake-Microsoft employees with thousands of victims Exclusive: DVDFab CinaviaRemoval HD review coolcolors MyCE Resident Posted on: 03 Nov 16 19:24 Quote: a known HTML5 bug in Google Chrome since 2014 Most important line to know and to remove and clean all traces of Chrome.....

If nothing else, at least HTML5 bugs and JavaScript bugs are not universal like Flash Player bugs. A Flash Player bug can affect people on all browsers and platforms, whereas a Chrome JavaScript bug can only affect Chrome users, while Firefox bugs only affect Firefox users, Safari bugs only affect Safari, etc. Still, if two years is not enough for Google to fix this bug, maybe Chrome users should think twice about using Chrome. there's obviously something wrong with your development process if two years of frequent updates aren't enough to squash a two-year-old bug. 0 Agree Xercus Moderator Posted on: 10 Nov 16 10:47 ? two years is a long time to fix a bug small or big.

How To Kick the Social Media Habit YOU ARE HERE:   HOME WORLD WIDE WEB THIS STORY Support every customer. Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Samuel Gibbs. Updated November 3, 2016 11:13AM SHARE ALSO SEE Google Google Shopping European Commission Antitrust Adsense Google has responded to the European commission’s (EC) renewed statement of objections, declaring its case against Google Shopping to be “wrong on the facts, the law, and the economics” and dismissing it as just “the interests of a small number of websites”. The seven-year case revolves around the charge that the market dominance of Google within search is being used to leverage its price comparison service to the detriment of third-party sites. Within its second 100-page response to the EC, Google said that its Shopping service, which appears as a tab within search results and within adverts at the top of the page, was simply the result of its push to present users with useful information and direct answers to questions. It also said that the exclusion of retailers such as Amazon and eBay from the case was wrong, as they compete with price comparison sites also, despite paying for referral traffic. Kent Walker, Google’s senior vice president and general counsel, said: “Consumers don’t just look for products on a search engine, then click on a price comparison site, and then click again to visit merchant sites. They reach merchant websites in many different ways: via general search engines, specialist search services, merchant platforms, social-media sites, and online ads served by various companies. “And of course merchants are reaching consumers directly like never before. On the mobile web -- and more than half of Europe’s Internet traffic is mobile these days -- dedicated apps are the most common way for consumers to shop.” Adjoining the EC’s updated charges, European competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said the commission’s preliminary investigation into Google Shopping revealed that Google had “unduly favoured its own comparison shopping service in its general search result pages”, meaning that “consumers may not see the most relevant results to their search queries”. A Google spokesperson said: “We remain confident that these claims lack evidence and are wrong on the facts, the law, and the economics. The surest signs of dynamic competition in any market are low prices, abundant choices, and constant innovation -- and that’s a great description of shopping on the internet today.” Google also responded to the charges made against its advertising services, Adsense for Search, which places contextual, text-based ads near and around search results. A Google spokesperson said: “Our text ads help websites generate income and have always faced strong competition from other ad formats, so we disagree with the Commission’s assessment. Nevertheless, even before the Statement of Objections was filed, we changed practices the Commission takes issue with, so we hope to resolve this case quickly.” The EC originally filed charges in April 2015, receiving a response from Google later that year. New, reinforcing charges in the Google Shopping case were then filed by the EC in July this year, which also included charges against Adsense. Google is also facing antitrust charges against its Android mobile operating system, which runs on the majority of smartphones globally. It has until 11 November to respond in the Android case, but faces fines of up to 10% of its global turnover. © 2016 Guardian Web syndicated under contract with NewsEdge. All rights reserved.

Hands-On With the Google Home Speaker Google's new talking speaker is plenty smart—but has lots to learn By Mike Gikas November 03, 2016 Subscribe for unlimited mobile and desktop access Subscribe The Google Home speaker, Google’s answer to the Amazon Echo talking speaker, starts shipping Friday, Nov. 4, for $129 from Google's online store and from retailers including Best Buy and Walmart. Like the Amazon Echo, the Google Home speaker is less a wireless speaker than a conduit for a cloud-based virtual assistant. It can control internet-connected devices, procure Uber taxi rides and other services, and answer questions—silly or serious—to help get you through the day. It’s pretty nifty as a speaker, too, because the assistant, the same Google Assistant you'd use with Android smartphones, will begin streaming your favorite music, news reports, and traffic and weather updates from an impressive number of sources at your command. Just use the wake-up phrase “Okay, Google,” tell the device what you're looking for, and a friendly female voice will confirm your request. I received a press sample of Google Home and took it home for a trial run alongside my own Amazon Echo. It was interesting to compare their abilities to fetch music, news, weather reports, and so on. While Amazon and Google each has its own distinct content services, both support my Pandora and Spotify accounts. The Google Home and Amazon Echo also draw data from some of the same third-party sources, such as NPR and Wikipedia. Physically, it’s easy to tell the devices apart. The squat, white 6.6-inch Google Home looks like a giant air freshener while the Echo is a black, 9.3-inch cylinder. But with your eyes closed, having both devices is confusing. The omnidirectional nature of their speakers, which sounded quite similar, made it easy to forget which speaker was doing what. While testing music playback at high volumes, I found myself barking “Alexa stop!” when it was really the Google Home that needed to pipe down. And a lot of the functionality Google promised when it introduced Google Home isn't up and running yet. For instance, the plan is to let you ask Home for directions, then see them pop up on your phone by the time you get to your car. Once the Home is fully integrated into the larger Google world, the device should be able to help you juggle appointments and turn on the lights as you pull into the driveway. That's the kind of functionality that Amazon will be hard-pressed to offer.  On the other hand, the Echo and its cheaper siblings, the Amazon Tap and Dot, have far more third-party apps right now.  I had hoped to compare the Google Home to the Amazon Echo as an interface for automated lights, appliances, and entertainment equipment. But the Home's Internet of Things (IoT) repertoire does not yet include the Insteon and Logitech smart-home controllers that run my house. Right now the smart-home skills of the still-nascent Google Home are confined to Nest thermostats, Philips Hue lighting systems, and SmartThings devices. You can also summon content on Google Cast-enabled televisions. Google says that more capabilities will be added over the next few months.  But there were positive surprises as well. Here are details on how the two devices stack up. Google Home at Home Easiest setup ever. Installing wireless devices, even those with intuitive setup menus, can be a challenge—especially if the device you’re installing depends on both Bluetooth and WiFi connections. But setting Google Home was incredibly simple and quick—at least using my new Google Pixel and creaky old LG G3 smartphones. You just plug the included AC adapter into the Google Home’s base and into a wall outlet, and then launch the Google Home app, a free download from Google Play or the Apple App Store if you have an iPhone. The Home app will automatically see the Google Home speaker within about 30 seconds of it being plugged in. The app will ask you three things: Permission to sign into the Google Account you’re using on the phone; whether it can use the WiFi password stored on your phone to access your router; and confirmation of your home address as reported by the GPS location of your phone. If you simply click okay to both, Google Home will be ready for its first command in about 45 seconds. After setup, the Google Home app is used mainly for adding capabilities, changing account preferences, and getting suggestions on how to interact with Google Home. There’s a Google Store shopping cart in the Google Home app, as well. But the only option in it currently is to pre-order a Chromcast Ultra streaming dongle for $69. You can also use the app on the phone as a remote control for tasks such as pausing or skipping a song that's playing on Google Home.  It's a smarty. Start using Google Home, and it becomes clear that the Google Assistant has a slightly higher IQ points than Alexa does. For instance, the Google Assistant understands and responds appropriately to questions spoken in sloppy English, such as like "What's the calories in a bagel?" And it also seems to have a better grasp of context. For example, you can ask Google Home, “When’s the next time it’s going to rain?" And it will tell you, "In [your home town] it will rain on Thursday." That's sophisticated. Ask Alexa the same question, and you'll just get the current forecast, whether it’s for rain or shine. If you're asking for other kinds of information, the Google Assistant seems to provide more details than the relatively laconic Alexa. For instance, when I asked Alexa, “What is Consumer Reports?” it told me something like, “An American magazine founded in 1936.” the Google Assistant provides several more sentences of details. But in other ways, the two platforms are interchangeable. News updates are the same, often repetitious string of podcasts from NPR and Bloomberg that seem to drone on and on. I suspect most people will avoid asking Google Home for such reports. Like Alexa, the Google Assistant makes an effort to keep the 12-year-old in all of us amused when things are slow. There’s a trivia game that should be aced by high school graduates, and even an instrument tuner. One of the more useful apps is a language translator. For instance, you can ask the Google Assistant “How do you say good morning in German,” it will answer, “Guten Morgen” in an authentic-sounding German accent. The Google Assistant also uses authentic sound bites to tell you what a cow sounds like, but whatever you do, don’t ask it to sing you a song. Decent-sounding speaker. Our engineers will provide the definitive assessment of Google Home’s sound quality. But in my informal tests, I found the Google Home to be quite similar to the Echo’s, which our engineers found to be decent, but overall “a bit thin, grainy, metallic, and processed sounding."  I had both Google Home and Echo stream “2nd Avenue Mambo,” by the Aaron Kula & Klezmer Company Orchestra, a dynamic Cuban-style song heavy on percussion and brass. Both speakers did an acceptable job at midlevel volumes, in my opinion, but at higher volumes trumpets started sounding notably harsh and the bongos started warbling. Here's one interesting thing about the volume level on the Google Home: Just like guitarist Nigel Tufnel’s amp in the classic mockumentary “This Is Spinal Tap,” the volume level goes to 11. Where’s my music? One good thing about storing copies your music files in the cloud is that you should be able to instantly access them as soon as you log into the appropriate app on your device. I've uploaded the 10,000 or so MP3 files I have stored on my computer to both Amazon Music and Google's Play Music service. (Google Play Music lets you store up to 50,000 songs from your computer for free using its Music Manager app, while Amazon Music stores up to 250,000 songs from your personal collection,for $25 a year).  But so far Google Home is having a bit of trouble finding that music. While Pandora was fully operational as soon as I logged in, Google Home said it couldn’t find any songs in my music library. Over the course of several hours, it found about half of them, but only via playlists. For instance, if I told the Google Assistant to “play West Coast Jazz,” it found and played my West Coast Jazz playlist from Google’s cloud servers. But if I asked it to play a specific piece of music in that playlist, the Google Assistant would say “I can’t find that song or album in your library, but here’s a Google Play Radio Station you may like.” I've asked Google to check on this problem, and I'm told the company is looking into it. Hold the phone. As Consumer Reports' smartphone reporter, I often have several Android smartphones in my vicinity. And if I happen to say “Okay Google,” they all respond. But this comical annoyance is not an issue when Google Home is in the room. When Google Home is active, other Android devices stay quiet. Consequently, if you want to place a call on your Android smartphone, you’ll have to use the touchscreen because a command like, “Call Jennifer” will go unheeded. It would be nice if you could make and take phone calls through Google Home, but that feature is not available yet. We’ll have more on the Google Home in the coming weeks. 94 Number of Wireless speakers in our Ratings. Current Wireless speaker ratings Mike Gikas I'm a smartphone junkie who's always playing with the latest and greatest mobile gadgets, which helps me help you. Because like many of you, nothing pushes my buttons more than quirky smartphones, overpriced cell plans, and underwhelming wireless service. When I'm not staring at a mobile screen or twiddling with a device's settings, you'll find me quoting obscure movie dialogue and watching sci-fi movies from all eras.

Google Home: 10 tips and tricks to get started 0 Share: Smart Home by Jason Cipriani November 3, 2016 11:35 AM PDT @MrCippy Up Next Fantastic Beasts' Dan Fogler sees magic in tech Start chatting with Google Assistant Google's digital assistant has learned some new tricks and can now handle a real conversation! Here are some new commands you can start with. by Vanessa Hand Orellana 3:33 Close Drag The Google Home is one of those devices that the more you use it, the more you discover it can do. For example, did you know you can call an Uber using the Google Home? Or what about playing YouTube videos on your TV without touching a single remote or device? It's all possible, and then some. 10. Disable the microphone Enlarge Image Photo by Jason Cipriani/CNET On the backside of the Google Home, there's a button that stops the microphone from constantly listening for the wake phrase of "OK, Google." When pressed, you will hear "Microphone off" from the speaker and its indicator lights will turn orange (or maybe it's red?). Press the button again enable the microphone and use the Google Home as you normally would. Some users like to have the option of disabling the microphone when not in use, or when having a sensitive conversation near a device that's always listening. 9. Rename Google Home Enlarge Image Photo by Screenshot by Jason Cipriani/CNET In the Home app on your iOS or Android device, navigate to the settings for your Google Home device. This is done by going to the Devices > Menu > Settings. Under the Device Info section, tap on Name. Rename your Home device whatever you'd like, but keep in mind that as you add more devices to your house, you'll make to make the names easy to remember based on location. That way when you request Home to start playing music on multiple speakers, you know the name of the exact speaker you want to use and aren't left guessing. 8. Play on Chromecast from the Home Follow the same steps to change the name of your Chromecast in order to make it easier to play content on your TV. For my testing, I renamed my Chromecast to "TV." Doing so makes it simple to tell the Google Home to play a video from YouTube on my TV. (Ex. "OK, Google, play Stampylongnose on my TV.") Rename your Chromecast to something that's easy to say and remember, and interacting with it through the Google Home will be a breeze. 7. Guest Mode Enlarge Image Photo by Screenshot by Jason Cipriani/CNET The Google Home acts as a Chromecast audio device, allowing friends and family members to use it without accessing your Wi-Fi network. Enable Guest Mode by going to Home app > Devices > Menu > Guest Mode. Enable Guest Mode and then wait for a PIN code, which you will need to give to guests in order to connect to your device. 6. When all else fails, reboot Enlarge Image Photo by Screenshot by Jason Cipriani/CNET The Google Home surely isn't immune to a hiccup here and there, and with the No. 1 fix for technological glitches being to restart the device, it only makes sense for Google to include it in the Home app. Open the Home app >Devices > Menu > Reboot. 5. Set Assistant preferences Enlarge Image Photo by Screenshot by Jason Cipriani/CNET All of your interaction with the Google Home is done with Google Assistant, the company's updated personal assistant that's built into chat app Allo, Pixel phones and, now, Google Home. You'll want to tailor what information Google Assistant knows and can use to better help you with your requests. Open the Home app, slide out the menu drawer from the left side of the screen, and then tap on More settings. I suggest starting with the sections News and My Day. In News you can select various audio news updates to listen to. Use My Day to set what details are included when you prompt the Home to tell you about your day. Options include the weather, commute time, next meeting, any pending reminders, and then play newscasts. Learn more tips and tricks for Google Assistant. 4. Change the music source The Google Home currently supports Google Play Music, YouTube Red, Pandora and Spotify. To set your preferred music source, open the Music section in More settings and select a music service. If you haven't linked it to the Home yet, you'll be prompted to at that time. Bonus: When you first set up your device, you're given a complimentary six month subscription to YouTube Red (and by extension Google Play Music). 3. Call an Uber Enlarge Image Photo by Screenshot by Jason Cipriani/CNET Right now, only Uber is listed as an available third-party service in the Home app. As time goes on and more developers are able to work on adding support, the list will surely grow. Find a list of supported services by opening More settings > Services. Tap on the service you want to connect to your Google Home device, then follow the prompts. 2. Restrict inappropriate content With the Google Home making it easy for anyone to begin playing YouTube videos and music, it's likely your kids are going to have their own requests. In order to avoid any inappropriate content, open More settings and then scroll to the bottom of the page and enable YouTube Restricted mode. 1. View command history Enlarge Image Photo by Screenshot by Jason Cipriani/CNET Google saves a copy of every voice command given to the Google Home in the Google account tied to the device. You can view all of your previous commands, and remove anything you don't want stored in your account with just a few taps. Again, go to More settings and then scroll to the bottom of the page then tap on My Activity. A webpage will open, displaying the time, date and request. Tap on the play button to hear what the Google Home recorded, and if you want to remove it from your history, tap on the menu button then Delete.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search 4 things to know before you buy Google Home Chris Davies - Nov 3, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit The Google Assistant has escaped, and it’s haunting your house. No longer is it trapped in your phone or your browser: instead, the power of Google’s so-called Knowledge Graph now gets a new enclosure, the vase-esque Google Home. Like Amazon’s Echo, it reacts to voice rather than touchscreen or buttons, and like Amazon’s assistant Alexa, it promises to streamline your day and entertain your evenings with its personalized knowledge of your tastes and interests. Sounds great, right? Turns out, there are a few things you ought to bear in mind before you bring Home home. Google Home is not family-friendly – yet No, Google Assistant isn’t going to cuss out your kids or insult your grandmother’s cardigan. Artificial intelligence hasn’t quite realized how tedious its human rulers are, at least not yet. But if you’re envisaging Home as the AI butler for everyone in the house, think again. At launch, there’s only support for a single Google Account. That means, if you’ve got four people in the same house, each with their own Google credentials, only one person will be able to sign into Home. Arguably more frustrating, there are further limits on top of that: Home can only handle one of your calendars at a time, so if you have both a personal and a work schedule, it’ll keep on top of one but not both. By all intents, Google is aware of the limitation, and has suggested that a fix for it will arrive at some point in the future. Whether that will use voice recognition to figure out who is talking and which account to pull answers from remains to be seen. It’s worth noting that multi-user support is available in one area: you can have several streaming music provider accounts signed in, and Home will use all of them. Google Home might be too chatty for its own good Although being the single user signed into Home might sound like a good thing, it’s worth remembering that there’s no security on the system. In fact, the Google Assistant will happily chat with anybody who utters the “Ok Google” trigger or taps Home’s capacitive button – including answering questions about personal data from your calendar and more. If your kids pester Home with search after search for “Dora the Explorer” YouTube videos, that history is going to impact your own YouTube suggestions, since the Assistant doesn’t have an “incognito” mode. Currently, the only option is to specifically switch off access to any particular account or feature you don’t want Home to give ubiquitous access to. That’s managed through the companion app for Android and iOS, with toggles for things like Calendar, Gmail, and YouTube. It’s an all-or-nothing setting, mind: since Home doesn’t recognize “authorized” users, you either have the integration turned on or you miss out on the functionality altogether. Alexa has the edge on third-party integration Out of the box, Google Home supports a handful of smart home integrations and a couple of third-party services. For instance, you can link your Philips Hue lights with the hub and merely speak to turn them on or off, while unsurprisingly there’s compatibility with Nest’s Learning Thermostat. You can ask Nest to turn the temperature up or down to a specific temperature, or alternatively just tell Home you’re cold and have it adjust it automatically. If you’re looking for even greater flexibility, add a SmartThings hub and anything linked to that will be at the control of Home. For online services, IFTTT support allows you to trigger recipes by voice: you could have your Facebook update by spoken command, for instance, or use it to trigger connected HVAC systems other than Nest. Finally, there’s Uber integration, so you can summon a car by asking Home. MORE INFO: Amazon Echo Dot Review Unfortunately, that pretty much amounts to table-stakes, and right now Amazon is making good advantage of its lead with Echo. There are more than 3,000 different “Skills” as Amazon refers to them, ranging from the ability to search for and have read out recipes, check the status of your BMW, or see how the stock market is doing. If you want to order a pizza through your Echo, you can do that too. Google Home will get better in time It’s in Google’s best interests to make Home better sooner rather than later. After all, its business is based on knowing as much as possible about its users: the more insight the Google Assistant has into your everyday life, tastes, accounts, and habits, the more it can monetize you. That’s the trade-off you make when you agree to register a Gmail account, enable Google Now on an Android phone, or even just use search online. Assuming you’re okay with the privacy implications, that level of individual understanding could potentially make Home the queen of smart speakers. After all, Alexa might know what you buy and what music and video you consume, but Google potentially knows who you email, where you travel to, what medical paranoias you look up online at 2am, who you call and message, and more. Piece all those elements together and you have a significant understanding of a person. Or, at least, you will one day. Right now, despite being unified by the same Google Assistant, Home doesn’t really play all that well with products from the company. Sure, if you say “Ok Google” your Android phone will defer to Google Home if it’s closer, but you can’t send an email from your smartphone via Home instruction, or make calls, or many other fairly obvious integrations. Wrap Up The big question many are asking is whether they should sit out of Google’s first generation of smart speaker. Right now, there are certainly some pain-points in the experience: searches that are just plain bungled, music that won’t stream, or any of the numerous headaches around multi-account support (or, more accurately, its absence). Life on the cutting edge doesn’t always go smoothly. That said, one of the advantages of both Amazon Echo and Google Home is that the smarts are in the cloud. The physical hardware, though it may be what you think of as the assistant, is really just a totem that represents the intelligence running on some far-off servers. That intelligence can be constantly improved, tweaked, and added-to, just as Google works on improving the relevance of search results behind the scenes. NOW READ: Living with Google Home At $129, the bar to trying out life with Google Home is low. Right now, with the limited third-party support, it makes the most sense for those already well invested in Google products. As time goes on, though, and the Assistant gets smarter and more deeply connected with other services, you may well start feeling left out if you’ve not got a Home in your home.

"Coming soon, you'll be able to create an introductory price for new subscribers for a set period of time," Google's Larissa Fontaine wrote in a blog post. "For example, you can offer a subscription for $1 per month for the first three months before the normal subscription price kicks in." There are many app categories where this could make a big difference. Music and video are certainly on that list; maybe cheaper introductory pricing could boost Google's own struggling YouTube Red service, or help Spotify maintain its lead over Apple Music and other rivals. Other apps like internet TV offerings (Sling TV, PlayStation Vue) and productivity tools (Evernote) also stand to benefit if developers are willing to temporarily cut their prices in hopes that customers will stay subscribed once the normal rate kicks in — either because they forgot or, more ideally, actually find the app or service to be worth the monthly charge. "Subscriptions are the fastest growing business model on Play, with consumer spending in subscription apps increasing 10x over the last 3 years," wrote Fontaine. And with that in mind, this year both Apple and Google have adjusted the revenue-sharing terms around subscriptions to give app makers a bigger cut than before. For iOS developers, apps must maintain a customer's subscription for at least 12 months before the more favorable 85/15 split takes effect; Google Play doesn't have the same long-term subscriber requirement.

In today's e-age of social media and netizenry, it's Chat, Download, Google... Rowdies of IT City have moved with the times, and adopted trendy nicknames. "Call Chat now, ask him where he is, tell him to come to police station immediately... and remind him bring Download with him. Inspector wants to talk to them." Coded conversation? It is the language of the chor-police world, where rowdies and anti-social elements are identified by area, activity, habit, attitude or even physical characteristics. Jail lore has it that a heavy eater was nicknamed Kavala, as police had a tough time ensuring he had adequate food supply! Now, in keeping with the digital era, rowdies sport names with a social media ring; the alias is an important tag for a rowdy of any importance, given by police or associates, and an indication that he has arrived. Ramesha alias Google, a history sheeter from North Bengaluru, is popularly known as only Google among his associates: his claim to such global fame is his expertise in handling the search machine to mine information. His team members treat Ramesh with due respect, even elevating him to the status of techie, when he uses Google Maps to navigate or find a place. Santosh, a rowdy from Central Bengaluru, is known as Chat. Talking too much with friends and during police interrogation earned Santosh the nickname. Likewise, for friends and associates, Shankar is WhatsApp. Those who have no idea what WhatsApp is, but still want to use it, approach Shankar from South Bengaluru. Sitting on a katte near Gandhi Bazar, Santosh is seen giving lectures on WhatsApp during evenings. Nagaraj alias Download has his own skills. Nagaraj's associates believe there is nothing on Earth Nagaraj cannot download. "With Nagaraj's help, we were able to watch many old Kannada movies, listen to thousands and thousands of old songs," say his associates, in awe. THE GOON DICTIONARY Words rowdies often use on WhatsApp chats and Facebook * Adda: Common place * Atakaisu: Attack * Avaz haaku: Threaten * Baarsu: Beat * Bali haaku: Sacrifice/ kill * Catch hakko: Hold (him) * Doz kodu: Warn * Ettakkonduba: Bring (him) * Jamaisu: Have fun * Wantchu: Thrash * Udaisu: Bash * Matash madu: Kill Stay updated on the go with Times of India News App. Click here to download it for your device.

"The two major app cab aggregators, Uber and Ola, use Google Maps on their platforms. This is used by both drivers and riders. The movement of these cars feed the data on the road conditions. Our software adjusts the estimated journey time accordingly," explained Google Maps programme manager Sanket Gupta. As the accuracy of the data depends on the actual number of Google Maps users on the road, the 5,000-odd app-based cabs plying in Kolkata have become the biggest source of feed to process traffic information. Currently, only few other motorists in Kolkata use maps to navigate routes. But if Google Maps provide reliable heads up on how long one may get stuck in a traffic jam along with alternative route options, more people will start using maps, feels Google. For those who fear that using maps will require high mobile data costs, the Google Maps team has introduced specific download options that will provide all features sans live traffic. "The feature was introduced to plug the poor connectivity regions in India and has now been extended to other parts of the world. India is among the top five countries using offline Google Maps," said Gupta. The other features Google hopes to rope users with are information on fuel, coffee, food, medical stores, gifts and provisions en route. Public transport commuters, too, can use it to check metro and railway timings and bus and tram routes. Following the success of Durga Puja in the New Events section where 22 pandals were graphed in the map and road directions altered, the company is exploring other events and may even consider including mega political rallies in Kolkata. Keen to catch the attention of the young who may look for things beyond information, Google Maps is sprucing up its fun section with real-time 360° virtual tours of 280 monuments including 28 in Bengal, eight of which are in Kolkata.

CNET.com editor-in-chief Lindse... “CBS This Morning” had a first look at Google Home on Thursday.  The device is Google’s answer to Amazon’s Echo speakers, which hit the market two years ago. At the moment, Echo is “the undisputed king of the nascent smart home market,” according to CNET.  Google Home syncs with your personal Google account and answers your questions harnessing Google’s highly advanced search intelligence.  The product represents the continuing evolution of artificial intelligence, CNET News editor-in-chief Connie Guglielmo told “CBS This Morning.” “It’s the start of this conversation where A.I. becomes part of your life and your home,” she said. As CNET points out in its product review of Google Home: “Google, of course, already knows as much or more about you than Facebook, thanks to your web history, your Gmail metadata and tracking the GPS records on your phone. And now the tech giant is aiming to use that data to out-Alexa Amazon, making the little countertop speaker a friendly face for its search-engine-powered online brain.” Play Video CBS This Morning How virtual assistants could change home and life From Amazon Echo to Google Home, the biggest technology companies are betting big on virtual assistants powered by artificial intelligence. Googl... Google Home, which officially debuts Friday for $130, has far-field voice recognition, touch controls and hi-fi speakers, and syncs with any other Google Cast devices you might own. Designed with a discreet, modernist aesthetic, the speakers look like an air freshener or lamp. In addition to answering questions, the personal assistant device can remind you of calendar appointments or tell you when traffic is heavy before your commute. Privacy advocates take note: the device is always listening and processing speech in its environment.  The worldwide market for smart home speakers is expected to top $2 billion by 2020, which is nearly a 500 percent increase from 2015, according to Gartner research. In its review, CNET gave Google Home a 7.9 out of 10, concluding that while it “shows a ton of potential, it’s currently not as versatile or useful as Amazon’s Echo.” © 2016 CBS Interactive Inc.

Register for an Exam Today> Google Dismisses EC Shopping Charges as 'Wrong' By Samuel Gibbs PUBLISHED: NOVEMBER 03 2016 Google has responded to the European commission’s (EC) renewed statement of objections, declaring its case against Google Shopping to be “wrong on the facts, the law, and the economics” and dismissing it as just “the interests of a small number of websites”. The seven-year case revolves around the charge that the market dominance of Google within search is being used to leverage its price comparison service to the detriment of third-party sites. Within its second 100-page response to the EC, Google said that its Shopping service, which appears as a tab within search results and within adverts at the top of the page, was simply the result of its push to present users with useful information and direct answers to questions. It also said that the exclusion of retailers such as Amazon and eBay from the case was wrong, as they compete with price comparison sites also, despite paying for referral traffic. Kent Walker, Google’s senior vice president and general counsel, said: “Consumers don’t just look for products on a search engine, then click on a price comparison site, and then click again to visit merchant sites. They reach merchant websites in many different ways: via general search engines, specialist search services, merchant platforms, social-media sites, and online ads served by various companies. “And of course merchants are reaching consumers directly like never before. On the mobile web -- and more than half of Europe’s Internet traffic is mobile these days -- dedicated apps are the most common way for consumers to shop.” Adjoining the EC’s updated charges, European competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said the commission’s preliminary investigation into Google Shopping revealed that Google had “unduly favoured its own comparison shopping service in its general search result pages”, meaning that “consumers may not see the most relevant results to their search queries”. A Google spokesperson said: “We remain confident that these claims lack evidence and are wrong on the facts, the law, and the economics. The surest signs of dynamic competition in any market are low prices, abundant choices, and constant innovation -- and that’s a great description of shopping on the internet today.” Google also responded to the charges made against its advertising services, Adsense for Search, which places contextual, text-based ads near and around search results. A Google spokesperson said: “Our text ads help websites generate income and have always faced strong competition from other ad formats, so we disagree with the Commission’s assessment. Nevertheless, even before the Statement of Objections was filed, we changed practices the Commission takes issue with, so we hope to resolve this case quickly.” The EC originally filed charges in April 2015, receiving a response from Google later that year. New, reinforcing charges in the Google Shopping case were then filed by the EC in July this year, which also included charges against Adsense. Google is also facing antitrust charges against its Android mobile operating system, which runs on the majority of smartphones globally. It has until 11 November to respond in the Android case, but faces fines of up to 10% of its global turnover. © 2016 Guardian Web under contract with NewsEdge. All rights reserved.

Google’s Assistant is one of them, and it’s not even available on Google’s older Nexus handsets. Another neat trick is the Fingerprint Quick Actions paired with the fingerprint sensor on the back of the handsets. It'll be a while before you can get deep Assistant integration on your non-Pixel phone, but the Pixel's nifty fingerprint scanner tricks can now be added to other Android devices with ease. DON’T MISS: We finally figured out why Google’s Pixel looks so much like an iPhone The Pixel’s fingerprint sensor acts as a sort of touchpad. For example, you can swipe down on it and the notification shade drops down. That’s a handy trick that some people might want to use on other devices. Luckily for them, xda-developers user ztc1997 came up with an application that enables the feature on any phone. Once you install it, you’ll have to head over to Settings, scroll down to Accessibility, tap on Fingerprint Quick Actions, and then enable the feature. It’s really that easy. Once that’s done, you’ll be able to customize the kind of gestures you want to pair with the fingerprint sensor directly from the applications. There are various actions to choose from, just check the video below. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qeqbgPX5WXs The somewhat bad news is that the app isn’t officially available from the Google Play Store. We usually advise users not to download mobile apps from unofficial sources, especially on Android, where side-loading apps is possible. So proceed with caution and read more about it right here.

A revised set of the Commission's antitrust charges, released in July, accused Google of restricting shopping search advertisements from its competitors. But the European case doesn't take the entire online shopping market, including heavyweight Amazon.com, into account, said Kent Walker, Google's general counsel, in a blog post. The goal of Google's online shopping search service is to provide users with "useful information," Walker added. "If you’re looking to buy a coffee machine or a cast iron pan, we want to connect you directly to merchants who sell them, whether that’s through organic links or ads," he wrote. "Showing more useful ads benefits us, our advertisers, and most of all, you, our users." Consumers reach merchant websites in many ways, including general and specialized search services, merchant platforms, and social media, Walker said. The Commission filed its original antitrust complaint against Google in April 2015, and the company took issue with the charges then as well. In its July complaint, the Commission charged Google with favoring "its own comparison shopping service in its general search result pages," Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said then. "It means consumers may not see the most relevant results to their search queries." Google's shopping ads, targeted in the European complaints, are helpful to both its users and merchants, Walker countered. "We never compromised the quality or relevance of the information we displayed," he wrote. "On the contrary, we improved it. "That isn't 'favouring' -- that's listening to our customers." The Computer and Communications Industry Association, a trade group that counts Google as a member, echoed the company's assessment of the online shopping market.  "Consumers have never had so many ways to find, compare and buy products and services;  competition between services for the consumer’s attention has never been more robust,"  CCIA Europe Vice President James Waterworth said in a press release.

So much functionality is dependent on artificial intelligence and machine learning, the only certainty is that it’ll get smarter over time. Who knows what it’ll end up being: A jack-of-all-trades? A specialized savant? Or maybe just a creeper that records everything you say? Consider the Amazon Echo. At birth, it didn’t have the ability to order you Domino’s, play Spotify playlists, or get things from Amazon Prime. In the past year, its capabilities and intelligence have evolved significantly. That’s thanks to hundreds of “skills” created by developers with the Alexa Skills Kit, partnerships with major companies such as Uber and Sonos, and Amazon’s new Music Unlimited service, which offers deep voice-control features. At the ripe old age of two, Amazon’s Echo already has offspring in the form of the Echo Dot and Echo Tap. And now it has a neonate arch-rival in the form of Google Home. In the long term, the competition between the two platforms will be great for users of both devices: Two heavyweights in the tech world will be trying to make their voice assistants smarter, more versatile, and more useful than the other one. As of now, they’re more like twins than not: They both tell decent jokes, they both stream NPR if you ask for news, they both do IFTTT, and they spout recipes and random facts with ease. Because it’s had more time in the world, Amazon’s platform has the advantage in many key areas. But Google Home ($130) trumps the full-size Echo ($180) in a few ways too—and not just in terms of price. They’re both really good, and they’re both going to get smarter. A lot smarter. Google Home’s Big Advantages Audio quality: Up until about 75 percent of volume, Google Home sounds really, really good. The bass has surprising bump, and it doesn’t muddy up the midrange or high-end. Things start distorting at the top two volume levels, but audio quality is so impressive through most of its range that it’s really disappointing it can’t be used as a normal Bluetooth speaker (seriously, Google?). Perhaps more importantly, the Google Home Assistant’s voice sounds more natural and warm. She even says complimentary things about Alexa. Aesthetics: While the full-size Amazon Echo looks like Darth Maul’s spaghetti canister, the Home will look good—or at least inoffensive—in any home. It has an elegant vase-meets-lipstick design, and there are swappable base grilles for customizing its color and texture. The multicolored light show under the top touchpad is noice, too. Multi-room audio: Using the Home app, you set up a music service for Google Home to use. Your choices are Spotify if you have a premium account, Pandora, Google Play Music, or YouTube Music. Then you ask for a song, artist, playlist, or just “music,” and the speaker streams tunes directly over Wi-Fi. But the big advantage to having a few Google Homes in your abode compared to a multi-Echo setup is that multiple Google units sync up for home-blanketing audio. Set speakers as a group in the Home app, say “OK Google, play ‘Informer’ by Snow on Home Group,” and the song plays on all your dang speakers. By default, if you make a request to a single speaker, it only plays on that speaker unless you ask for group playback. You can also control what plays on other speakers by asking a nearby Google Home unit to play something on another speaker. It’s neat-o. Does a better job with crowd noise: In an unscientific test that annoyed my neighbors, I played loud audio of crowd noise in the same room as a Google Home speaker and an Amazon Echo Dot. Then, I tried using voice commands with both speakers. The Google Home unit didn’t have a problem picking my voice up over the din, while the Echo Dot only heard me once out of five tries. Google Home’s far-field microphone array worked more consistently for me, even though both Home and Echo had the same impressive range when I spoke without a bunch of background noise at normal volume: About 25 feet down the hall, around the corner, without line of sight. Chromecast controls: There are Alexa voice controls built into the Fire TV Stick and box remotes, but you can’t bark commands to a tabletop Echo or Dot to play things on TV. (At least not yet.) During the setup process, Google Home recognizes if you have a Chromecast or Cast-capable TV in the house, and you can play YouTube videos on TV by asking the speaker. The options are limited: A recommended YouTube playlist starts rolling if you say “Play YouTube on Chromecast”, and you can request a playlist of topical clips by saying “Play sloth videos on Chromecast”. But you have to specify the “Chromecast” each time. And you can’t search YouTube for a keyword, then pick a single video to play by voice. Google Home just serves up keyword-driven playlists. A better app: One of the drawbacks of the Echo’s more-developed skill set is that the Alexa app has to cover a lot of bases. As a result, the Alexa app can be confusing to navigate, and its dull white-on-black color scheme doesn’t help much. The Google Home app, where you can tinker with options, set your preferences, and see a feed of all your requests, is a much more lively companion. It serves up useful links for some of your voice requests, and it has a simpler, more vibrant interface. Translations: Simply put, Alexa doesn’t do translations. At least not spoken-word translations: It’ll only send a translated word or phrase to the Alexa app, but that won’t help you pronounce 鞋. Google Home gives spoken-word translations for both individual words and phrases, so you can ask it how to say “meatball” in Japanese, “I have a ballpoint pen” in German, or “déjà vu” in French. Google Home also one-ups Alexa by telling you what certain animals sound like. Alexa’s Superior Smarts Supports Bluetooth, aux-in, and aux-out: This is a pretty big one if you want to play music stored on your phone or if you’re a subscriber to Apple Music. While Google Home only does the voice-request-over-Wi-Fi thing, you can wirelessly stream tunes the old-fashioned way over Bluetooth with the Echo lineup. You can even go older-school with the 3.5mm-in port on the Echo Tap or the 3.5mm-out jack on the Echo Dot. Amazon Handles multiple accounts: Another possible dealbreaker for multi-user homes is that Google Home only supports a single account. You choose a Google account to link your Home to during the setup process, and all the Home interactions and calendar requests are associated with that account. Echo is much better for multiple users, as you can register several users in a household and switch between profiles by asking Alexa. A lot more third-party support: There’s a vast universe of Alexa skills already out there, and they’re growing by the day. You can control your home-security system with Alexa, check on your car’s vitals, and open and close your garage door. Given Google’s popularity and the appeal of the Home speaker, it’s practically a sure thing that the Home platform will get all kinds of third-party support soon. Until then, Amazon’s platform has a huge edge in interoperability. You can order things on Amazon Prime: Both Google Home and Amazon Echo will give you recipes for meatloaf and mashed potatoes, and both will convert measurements on the fly, but only one of them will place an order on Amazon Prime when you run out of Worcester sauce. Guess which one that is? Deep controls for Amazon Music Unlimited: Even though the deep contextual understanding is limited to Amazon Music Unlimited—which is a really good deal at $4 a month for Echo-only listening—Alexa is the best voice assistant by far at picking the music you want to hear. It’ll bring up a song if you only know some of the lyrics, if you request “the latest” song or album from an artist, or create an on-the-fly playlist based on boolean genre and era combinations. Amazon has essentially created a voice-only music interface from scratch, and it’s a glimpse at the future. Cheaper entry point: While the full-size Echo costs $50 more than Google Home, you can get the Alexa experience in the $50 Echo Dot and the $40 Fire TV Stick. The Echo Tap, which is the only one of these devices that runs on a rechargeable battery and is designed for portable use, costs the same as a Google Home speaker. Both Platforms Have Weaknesses Directions: While the Google Assistant does a good job at giving you turn-by-turn directions on a phone, that skill hasn’t been passed on to the Google Home version of the helper. It’ll tell you estimated commute times and nearby attractions, but it won’t tell you to take your first left, walk three blocks, and then hang a right. Of course, Alexa doesn’t do that either, but given Google’s mapping prowess, it’s a bit surprising that Home won’t tell you where to go. It also won’t send direction or map requests to your phone. Editing lists: Both Google Home and Amazon Echo let you create lists with ease and add to them over time: Google’s automatically appear in the underrated Keep list app, while your Alexa lists appear in the Alexa app. Unfortunately, the only way to edit those lists is to jump in the app and delete completed tasks manually. Asking to delete items from your list only confuses Alexa and the Assistant. Timers: Initially, it seemed Google Home addressed one of Amazon Echo’s major weaknesses in the kitchen: You can set a kitchen timer on the Echo, but you can’t assign a name like “meatloaf” or “green bean casserole” to the countdown clock to keep track of what’s done and what needs another 10 minutes or so. When you set a timer on Google Home, it asks you to name it, so you can assign “meatloaf” to your timer. However, when the timer goes off, it doesn’t repeat what you’ve named it. That smell in the air is my burnt imaginary meatloaf. And my imaginary green bean casserole is really undercooked. Go Back to Top. Skip To: Start of Article.

Simply get on the internet, go to Google, type in a question and thousands of answers will appear. Google has become so popular and trusted that the term “Google” is synonymous with any kind of online searching. The website is constantly changing and improving to become more useful for users, and it seems like there would be no reason to ever use any other search engine; however, other alternatives still exist, like Microsoft’s search engine called Bing. While Google may seem like the greatest technology to have ever existed, it is important that people still use Bing and other smaller search engines, both because some search engines are superior in certain areas, and also in order to keep the massive entity that is Google on its virtual toes. According to Net Market Share, 73 percent of all searches globally are done through Google, with Bing coming in second place at just over 9 percent. Nearly everybody in the world prefers Google, but there are still some who use Bing. While it may seem as though Google is the obvious choice when it comes to search engines, there are actually many reasons why a person might opt to use Bing over Google. One large reason is that anybody with a Windows computer begins with Microsoft Edge — which used to be called Internet Explorer — as the default web browser, and Microsoft Edge uses Bing by default. Therefore, unless a person with a Windows computer changes the computer’s default settings, he or she will likely use Bing instead of Google. Additionally, Bing does have many traits that differ from Google, some of which convince people to utilize it instead of Google. Microsoft claims the word Bing is an onomatopoeia meant to emulate the sound of an epiphany, but a running joke is that Bing stands for “Because it’s not Google.” Besides the few perks Bing has to offer over Google, perhaps the most important reason to use Bing is just that — because it’s not Google. Competition keeps Google constantly striving to improve its service, ensuring that it never ceases implementing next level innovations and impressive technologies. As Google loses users to smaller search engines like Bing, the company is encouraged to strive toward bigger and better things. Supporting smaller companies doesn’t just encourage Google to be better, it also helps the smaller companies make innovations that could change the way search engines operate forever. That being said, Microsoft is anything but a small company, which means Bing can be put in largely the same category as Google. Therefore, in order to truly encourage growth through competition, it is necessary that even smaller companies be utilized in place of both Google and Bing. Luckily, the internet is an immense place where anybody can make amazing websites, and the same holds true for search engines. For instance, the search engine Quora does more than simply provide links to websites that may contain the answers — it has an enormous community of people who each share their expertise with one another. With the personalized answers that can be provided within such a community, deep and abstract questions that would not produce results within Google can be answered. For instance, a question on Quora asks, “What is the most interesting fact that you know and I don’t, but I should?” to which have been made thousands of replies, each more interesting than the last. The greatest aspect of Quora is that it enables users to find answers to questions they didn’t even know they had. Wolfram Alpha is a different type of search engine that compiles computed facts and statistics to answer nearly any knowledge-based question. DuckDuckGo, a search engine that records no data about those who use it, is perfect for those who are made uncomfortable by how much information Google knows about its users. There are many alternatives to Google, each with its own advantages, and it is important to support these alternatives. While Google often seems like the perfect search engine, it is only that way due to the fact that it has always had competition from other search engines like Bing, forcing the company to continue releasing better and more accurate results in order to maintain its position on top. Google does not quite have a monopoly on online searches, but it is dangerously close. The only way to combat Google’s power is to seek, find and utilize other search engines that can both better serve certain functions, as well as provide useful competition for Google.

Thank you for supporting the partners who make SitePoint possible. More from this author How to Run an SEO Test in 5 Steps 7 Steps to Write Content that Converts What is SEO? Search engine optimization is the collection of strategies, tactics and techniques used to rank highly in search engine results pages (SERPs) in order to increase the amount of traffic to a website. That’s the traditional answer you’ll find in featured snippets when you Google “what is SEO?” And it’s not wrong — it’s just a little incomplete. The better, more accurate definition would be “the strategies, tactics and techniques used to rank highly in search engine results for the keywords used by your target audience in order to increase your conversions and reach.” Think of it this way: You own a pizza restaurant in your neighborhood, so you go about optimizing your site for pizza-related keywords. You do a really good job and now you rank in the top ten Google results for the keyword “pizza”. The problem is, you’re a local shop and your site isn’t optimized for local search, so people looking for recipes, or the history of pizza, or the nutritional information of pizza are finding you, but maybe not people looking to order pizza in your neighborhood. This is a disaster because your customers aren’t finding you when they are most likely to convert into a sale. Making sure the right people find you at the right time is what SEO is really all about. Do I Really Need to Do SEO? Yes. Since you’re reading about how to get started on SEO, you’ve probably already realized that you need it. But, if you’re still on the fence, here are some numbers that should convince you: 44% of online shoppers begin the process with an online search and 93% of all online experience start with search engines. 51% of traffic to business websites comes from organic search results. Paid search ads only accounted for 10% of traffic. SEO outranks PPC ads, social media marketing and email marketing when it comes to ROI. The top organic search result gets 33% of organic traffic, while only 10% of users make it past the first page of Google. So search optimization is really important in getting your audience onto your site. But there is another really important reason for you to be doing SEO: your competitors are doing it too. That means not only is our poor pizza restaurant missing out on current sales, its better-optimized competitors are forming relationships with customers, improving brand recognition and repeat sales. How Do You Do SEO? Get Your Site Indexed by Google Since the goal of SEO is to rank highly in search results, your first step is to get your site crawled and indexed by Google. Submit your site to Google via Google Search Console, which doesn’t require you to have an account. If you do have a Google Search Console account, use the Fetch as Google tool in the Crawl section. When Googlebot successfully fetches your page, click the “Submit to index” button. You can have Google index just the page you submitted by checking the box for URL, or have it index your whole site (assuming all of your pages can be reached by following your internal links), beginning with the submitted URL, by checking “URL and all linked pages”. You can submit your URL to Bing, which requires you to have a Bing Webmaster Tools account. The next best way to get your site crawled by search engines is to get links to your site in as many (reputable) places as you can. Put a link to your website in the About section of your social media pages, particularly your Twitter profile. Make sure to link your website with your Google+ profile and set up a Google My Business account to link to your website. Not only will this increase your chance of getting your site crawled, it will help your chances of appearing in the Google Answer Box and optimize your knowledge graph rich snippet. If you’ve got a YouTube account for your business, add a link to your channel’s About page and your video descriptions. The vast majority of these links will be nofollow, so they won’t actually help your ranking via improved link juice, but that’s not the point here. Crawlers still follow those link and will index the sites they land on. Finally, consider adding a blog to your site. People typically think of blogs as tools for content marketing and on page SEO, but they can also provide a steady stream of fresh content. Sites with blogs have an average of 434% more indexed pages than those without. Find a more detailed look at getting crawled and indexed by Google here. Keyword Research Despite rumors to the contrary, keywords are still very much relevant to SEO and picking the right keywords to optimize your site around is a core component of a successful SEO strategy. The process by which you find those keywords to target is called keyword research. Here are the basic steps to keyword research: First, discover how people are currently finding you via search engines using Google Search Console, and which keywords are driving your best converting users via Google Analytics. If your site is really new, or doesn’t get much organic traffic, get ideas from your products, categories or by answering the question “What is my website about?” or “What does my business do?” Find new keyword possibilities using a tool such as AdWord’s Keyword Planner from Google or Bing’s keyword research tool, among several other options. Once you have a nice, long list of keywords you want to target, narrow it down to the those that have enough search volume to make them worth the effort. Google now prevents accounts that don’t reach a certain, unspecified spend threshold, from accessing estimated search volume data, giving only a range of monthly searches. However, you can still access keyword volumes using WooRank’s SERP Checker. If you don’t have a WooRank Pro or Premium account, you can use Bing’s keyword research tool to find search volume. However, as Bing accounts for less than 10 percent of the market share of search, this data will only unlock the tip of the iceberg. Bing & Google’s keyword tools use PPC data. It won’t be 100% accurate, but it’s close enough to draw accurate conclusions. When finalizing your keyword strategy, make sure your portfolio has a nice mix of head and long tail keywords. Don’t go overboard with either type. Head keywords will bring you lots of traffic, but it won’t convert very well right away and there’s a good chance you won’t rank very well for them unless you’re a rather big and well-established website. On the other hand, too many long tail keywords can convert like crazy, but won’t bring in enough users to be viable. Learn more about forming a keyword strategy and doing keyword research here. Technical SEO Keywords are a core part of SEO, but there’s more to it than that. You also need to build your site with search engines in mind. Here are the basic technical elements your site needs to improve its search engine optimization. Robots.txt A robots.txt file is a simple text file in your website’s root directory. It tells search engine bots which pages can and cannot be crawled. It’s used mostly to keep search engines from indexing pages you don’t want to show up in search results like temporary folders or your legacy site after a redesign or migration. You can block all user-agents, none or individual bots. A very basic robots.txt file that blocks all user-agents looks like this: User-agent: *
Disallow: /
 Allowing all robots to crawl your whole site looks like this: User-agent: *
Disallow:
 You can disallow specific user-agents from accessing specific folders, subfolders or pages by including them as disallow lines under the relevant user-agent line. Some search engines will recognize the ‘allow’ parameter so you can give access to specific files in disallowed folders. Be very careful with your robots.txt file. Accidentally disallowing all bots, or certain user-agents to the entire server, is a relatively common, and easy-to-make, mistake that can cause huge headaches for SEOs. For an in-depth look at how to use robots.txt, check out our guide here. XML Sitemaps Sitemaps are xml files that include every URL on a website and give a few basic details about each page. A simple sitemap for a website with just one page could look like this: <?xml version="1.0" encoding=”UTF-8”?>
<urlset xmlns="http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9” xmlns:xhtml=”http://www.w3.org/1999/html”>
    <url>
        <loc>https://www.example.com/</loc>
        <lastmod>2016-8-01</lastmod>
        <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>
        <priority>0.9</priority>
        <xhtml:link rel="alternate” hreflang=”fr” href=”https://www.example.com/fr/”/>
   </url>
 Here’s a rundown of what that all means: <urlset> is the current protocol for opening and closing sitemaps. It tells crawlers that the sitemap is starting. <loc> indicates the URL of the page. It’s required for every page on your site, while the rest of the parameters are technically optional. Always write your URLs uniformly and use the canonical version — i.e. protocol, www resolve, etc. <lastmod> is the date your page was last updated or modified. <changefreq> tells how often you update your page, which can encourage search engines to recrawl your site when you update pages. Don’t lie though — if search engines see the value in <changefreq>doesn’t match up with actual changes, they’ll just ignore it. <priority> tells how important that URL is compared to the other URLs on the site. <xml:html> lets you list alternate versions of the URL, like if you have a multilingual or international site. Your site will work and can get indexed without a sitemap, and they’re not a ranking signal. But having a sitemap makes the whole process easier and faster. Plus, the more information you give about your pages, the more intelligently search engines can crawl your site, meaning bots are less likely to waste their crawl budget looking at unimportant pages. Sitemaps are especially important when you’re adding new pages or launching a new site that doesn’t have many links, or any links at all. For an in-depth look at XML sitemaps, check out this guide here. Canonical URLs Canonical URLs help websites to prevent issues caused by duplicate content. They tell search engines where to find the original version of content that can be found at multiple URLs, showing them which one to list in the search results, and to combining link juice at a single URL.. There are all sorts of legitimate reasons you could end up with duplicate content: content management system, e-commerce product platforms and syndicated content. Search engines will see the rel=”canonical” tag, know the content is a copy of the canonical URL, and pass on ranking information to the original page. Rel=”canonical” is implemented in the <head> of HTML pages and the HTTP header for non-HTML pages: HTML: <link rel="canonical” href=”https://www.example.com”/> HTTP: Links: <https://www.example.com>; rel="canonical” When you choose a canonical URL, pick the one that’s best optimized for users and search engines, and has content that is well optimized. Make sure you’ve set a preferred domain in Google Search Console. This works as a www resolve and Google will take this into account when it encounters links to your site out in the wild. It will pass link juice, trust and authority to your preferred domain, maybe with www, even when someone else uses a link without the www. Learn more about rel=”canonical” and dealing with duplicate content here. URLs Writing URLs for both human and search engine usability is important — both have an impact on SEO. Use URLs to create a clear hierarchy of information so users always know where they are. Always use the canonical version of your URL (www resolve, https, etc.) and include folders, subfolders and the page, in that order. URL structure is important to search engines because it helps them understand how that page relates to the rest of the site. Ideally the URL will be similar to your title tag, so it should include your keyword early on. Search engines look for keywords in URLs to determine the topic and relevance of a page. Optimizing URLs will also help your backlink profile as people are more likely to use relevant anchor text for URLs that are well-structured and include keywords. This can help you to rank for these keywords. For a detailed look at optimizing URLs, check out this guide. HTML Headers and Subheads <H1> – <H6> tags, also known as headers and subheads, denote the headlines and subheads on your page. These tags, especially the <H1> tag, are very important for SEO. Search engines use HTML headers to establish: Relevance: Search engines compare words in the header and subheaders to the keywords used in the search. So it’s really important you use keywords here. They especially rely on your <H1> tag, treating it as an on page title. Keyword Consistency: Search engines check for consistent keyword use between headers, subheads and body text on the page. Inconsistent keyword use, like using multiple unrelated keywords in subheadings, will make your page look off-topic. User Experience: Headers and subheads give your page order and structure, which is important for human readers. It’s also helpful for visually impaired readers who have to use screen readers. Search engines want to provide their users with the best pages, so having a good user experience is important for ranking. When using HTML header tags, there a couple of basic rules to follow. First, maintain the hierarchy of <H1> – <H6> tags. That means use the <H1> tag at the very beginning of the page, before any other, and then make sure more important headers have lower numbered tags. You don’t want to bury section headers in an <H6> tag. Second, only use one <H1> tag per page. Since search engines rely so heavily on keywords in the header, using more than one could make it look like you’re trying to manipulate your ranking. This is not good for SEO. (Note: You can use multiple <H1> tags as section headers if your pages uses HTML5. However, if it doesn’t or you’re not sure, stick to just one header.) And third, write your headers and subheads naturally. Search engines are pretty good at interpreting natural language, so over optimizing your HTML headers by keyword stuffing will hurt more than it helps. For more information on using HTML headers for SEO and usability, read through this guide. On Page SEO Finally, it’s time to get into how best to optimize your pages to rank for your target keywords. On page SEO is probably the most well-known part, and is usually what people are thinking about when they talk about SEO. Here are the basic components to optimize on your pages. Meta Tags There are two meta tags in the HTML head of your page that are very important for SEO: title tags and meta descriptions. Title tags technically aren’t meta tags, since they’re not optional, but they’re similar enough that they’re included in the description. Title tags, as you could probably guess, define the title of your page. They go in the <head> of the page like this: <title>This is the Page Title</title>
 Search engines use these as a clue to determine what a page is talking about. In fact, they rely on title tags maybe more than any other on page factor, so they’re really important. Optimize your title tags by: Including your keyword at the beginning. Keeping it between 50 and 60 characters, spaces included. 65 should be considered an absolute upper limit. Writing to appeal to human users. Search engines are looking for the best pages for their users, so stuffing title tags, or writing to appeal to the algorithms won’t help. Limiting your tag to one keyword, maybe two if they’re very closely related. If you’re using more than one, or including your brand/business name, use the pipe character (|) as a separator. If you rely on local search, include your location, business name and industry. Making them unique. Every title tag should be different, theoretically at least, because none of your pages are the same. Duplicate title tags are an indication of duplicate content, which will hurt your rankings. Meta descriptions are a short explanation of your page’s content. Use them to tell users what they should expect to get out of visiting your page. Search engines use this meta tag as part of a page’s search snippet – the title, URL and description that’s displayed in SERPs. When optimizing your meta descriptions be sure to: Include keywords. They won’t help you rank higher, but they will show up as bold text in your search snippet, which can help draw users’ attention to the fact that your page is relevant to their search. Make it accurate. Inaccurate descriptions will cause visitors to leave quickly without interacting with your site. This means low time on site and high bounce rate – two things that will make you look bad to Google. Use enticing language to encourage click throughs. High click through rates (CTRs) tell search engines that your page is relevant to the keyword, which will help your ranking. In your page’s code, the meta description looks like this: <meta name="description” content=”A short description of your page, 150-160 characters long, including spaces. Use this opportunity to encourage click throughs.”/>
 Page Content Your page content is the backbone of your SEO, both on page and off page (more on this later). When optimizing your page content, you need to use your keywords of course, but there’s a lot more to it than that. Keep these principles in mind when writing your page content: Keyword consistency: There’s no number of times you should use your keyword, and the idea of keyword density has gone out the window. In fact, optimizing your content like this could very well make you look bad and even incur a penalty. Instead, focus on writing about your topic naturally, and include keywords consistently at every level of content: title, <H1> tag and subheads. Using natural language, written for human consumption, will help you use your keywords and related words several times throughout your content, which is what search engines are really looking for. Quality & Unique: In our post-Panda world, you can’t get away with repeating content for SEO. Using copied, or spun, content may not cause a penalty, but you won’t rank very well and if you do it a lot it will affect your whole site. You also really need to focus on providing a high quality experience for your user, so check it over for spelling, vocabulary, grammar and punctuation before publishing. Answers: Search engines like long, in-depth, and authoritative content that answers user’s questions or solves their problems. When creating content, ask yourself what question it answers for your audience, or what problem it will help them solve. Approaching content this way can have the added benefit of getting your page into Google’s Answer Box. Get the most out of your content marketing by following our guide to creating evergreen content. Image Optimization Search engines can’t “see” images, but you can still use them to help your page rank for target keywords. This is done through the HTML alternative attribute (sometimes also called the alt tag or alt text). When you look at your page code, the alt attribute looks like this: <img src="example-image.jpg” alt=”Alt text describing the image”/>
 The alt attribute helps search engines determine if the image, as part of the page content, is relevant to a keyword. They are also used by screen readers to help the visually impaired, as well as showing up if an image fails to load. Use them to describe what’s going on in your image, being as specific as you can. There’s no real character count for alt text, but try to keep it to a half dozen words or so. Alt attributes will also help your images rank highly in image search results, which will open another channel for traffic acquisition. For a more detailed look at optimizing your images, check out our guide. Links After you’ve optimized your page and content around your target keywords, you’re ready to move on to links. Links are an important, maybe the most important, SEO signal. They essentially operate as a vote system for websites — each link is a little endorsement by someone that the linked page is valuable enough that their readers should check it out. These votes then pass on a little bit (or a lot, depending on the authority of the linking page) of value known as link juice. The more links a page has coming in, the more link juice it gets. The nice thing about link juice is that you can spread it around your site via internal linking. Put links on pages that have lots of link juice, like your homepage, and point them at your important pages, like product or category pages. For more information on how to use links to improve your search ranking, check out this guide. So what does this mean for your SEO? It means that building and maintaining a quality link profile is a major part of any search optimization campaign. There are three main components of any link building strategy: Content: Content quality is the number one factor that determines whether or not you get a link — no one is going to link to a page that their users won’t get anything out of. To maximize your chances of success, find out what your audience is already linking to and sharing. You can use Buzzsumo or Ahrefs to find opportunities to improve, expand or redesign popular content to attract links. Outreach: Despite rumors to the contrary, link building is not dead. The idea that link bait content will earn links on its own simply doesn’t reflect reality. Therefore, really hone in on the right audience to increase your chance of building quality editorial links (links that appear within the page content). Find the most popular blogs in your niche using AuthorCrawl or BlogDash, or use Majestic to find your competitor’s links to try to take them for yourself. Individuality: You might be tempted to automate your outreach, but that’s a bad idea. People can tell when they’re getting form letters, and sending out mass mailings is a good way to wind up in spam folders. Instead, write your emails manually, and include your personal details to improve credibility. You can streamline your process by creating a few outlines or templates to tailor your messaging. It also means that you’ll be conducting link audits fairly regularly. Since Google’s Penguin 4.0 was incorporated into its core algorithm, you especially need to keep on top of your link profile to make sure you’re only building quality links – Google now devalues low quality links so building these will only waste time. Google still issues manual link penalties, so if your link profile is made up of spammy links you may have some bad news coming. If you have a young site without a lot of links, you could also be at risk for negative SEO. It’s pretty rare, but it does happen. To get a detailed look at building links or conducting a link audit, read our guides here and here. Wrapping It Up As you can see, there’s a lot going on when it comes to optimizing your pages for search engines.

The case “shows that the (European) commission’s revised case still rests on a theory that just doesn’t fit the reality of how most people shop online”, Kent Walker, senior vice president and general counsel of Google, said in a blog. Google was responding to beefed up charges from July over online shopping by the European Commission, which polices EU competition policy under the leadership of the hard-charging commissioner Margrethe Vestager. As before, “we believe these claims are wrong as a matter of fact, law, and economics”, Walker said. The new charges fired off by Vestager are intended to strengthen the European case that Google abused the dominance of its search engine for online shopping. The commission accuses Google of giving its own online shopping services top priority in search results to the detriment of other price comparison services. — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Apple stock extends losses after China warning about Trump US stocks mixed as Samsung announces US$8b Harman deal Stocks, dollar push higher tracking Trump Dollar surges to 11-month high as bond rout continues Wall Street ends flat as financials' rise offsets tech drop Oil slumps as prospect of Trump victory roils global markets Popularity becomes curse for Malaysia, Indonesia currencies US stocks decline after rally as election takes centre stage Malaysia growth push stymied by banks cautious on loans BNM: Ringgit fell against most world currencies in third quarter Most Watched Now Week 'Beauty and the Beast' first full-length trailer Reuters Video: Models with Down Syndrome team up with celebrities Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Reuters Video: Duchess meets movie-star cat, animals go wild Related Articles Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2016 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Produced by NFL Films, the 9-part show will offer a “360-degree perspective of life” from the point of view from players, coaches, executives, cheerleaders and fans.” The first episode is set to debut on Thanksgiving Day on the league’s YouTube channel, but the series won’t actually be available until “later this year” on the NFL VR app for Google’s DayDream platform. The new series is the league’s efforts of diving into VR content and the NFL says it’s the first sports content for the medium. Though the announcement doesn’t say the name of the project, the league says the decision came after it “experimented” with VR technology last season. To capture the footage NFL Films is using Google’s GoPro Jump virtual reality camera.

CLOSE Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Monday, November 14, 2016 Insider K Street Lifestyle Opinion Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Home Technology Are Minorities Being Left Behind in the Google+ Migration? Policy Technology Are Minorities Being Left Behind in the Google+ Migration? By Jeneba Ghatt - 2:30pm July 18, 2011 7203 63 SHARE Facebook Twitter For all the talk about US Blacks and Hispanics being the most active users of Twitter and having a substantial membership on Facebook, it seems they may not be quickly migrating to and taking advantage of Google’s latest attempt at breaking into the social media sphere, the Google + project. It is still quite early in the Google+ roll out, but according to a recent analysis, membership on that site has grown 350% since it launched to members of the tech community on an invite-only basis on June 28.   Today, there are reports that over 10 million people have already joined Google +.   But scan the profile images of some of the 940,000 users  listed on the website Find People on Plus and you may notice the dearth of brown and black faces among users.  And even among those who managed to get an early invite, they are like many of the later adopters who do not necessarily “get” the new platform yet and have simply set up a basic profile and have not used it since.  Much of the buzz of the site had to do with the fact that so few people were allowed on in its earliest Beta testing stages. The curious all wanted a golden ticket. The site is used most actively now by the crowd of adventurous tech aficionados who are anxious to see Google finally get the social media thing right.  Google’s previous experiments with Buzz, Orkut, and Wave all failed to take off.   Google+ is slowly creating a new category of user addicts because it is cleaner, so far Ad-Free, and is touted as not being riddled with the same privacy concerns as Facebook, neither is it saddled with applications that litter users streams with gaming updates, for example.    Many Google+ users spend their time sharing ideas and tips on how to navigate the site.  They also lament how much better it is than Facebook in that it allows them more control over with whom they share information and interact, and how much easier it is to filter out those who they want to limit access to certain updates or photos. Who is on Google+ now? It still may be too soon to be taking a critical look at users of a 3-week old site, but since it launched, several articles have examined every aspect of the site including the fact that at one point, only 10% of its users were female.  Because more and more studies reveal that Hispanics and Blacks have higher than average mobile phone ownership and are accessing broadband through their mobile devices, it is not too presumptuous to think those groups would have been early adopters of Google+.  The “digital elite” , the interconnected web of popular bloggers, technical experts and early adopters to the newest technologies,  made up the earliest invitees.  This elite group is quite monolithic and for the most part includes middle to upper middle class professional whites and Asians.   In America anyway, most socialize in racially segregated circles so when Google allowed those on the site to invite their friends, it should come as no surprise then why the second wave of users mirrored the racial make up of the first wave.  Members of the black Technoratti who work with and associate with the general population of tech experts have a  healthy representation on Google+ now as well.  Perhaps, as they began to invite their circle of friends, they helped diversify the site. But beyond these audacious early users,  many are still skeptical about adopting yet another social media platform, and especially one that is not necessarily intuitive.   Google + requires people to categorize their network of family, friends, and colleagues into neat circles and enables users to participate in simultaneous video chat and explore articles categorized by interest. Google+ is not that intuitive as the tech savvy application development community may think.  It certainly is  not as turnkey as Facebook.  With Facebook, anyone can  pretty easily figure out the lay of the land within moments of signing up.  Not so much with Google +.   In response to some user confusion, there have been over two dozen articles published by leading tech publications and sites explaining how to navigate the site.  A killer competitor to Facebook  shouldn’t be so difficult to circumnavigate. And even then, many have already invested lots of  time cultivating a home on Facebook, building photo albums and “friending” long lost classmates and relatives.  It will take a lot to get many reluctant and less active  folks to adopt Google +.  So the question remains whether it will survive the initial rounds of early users, folks who are eager for its success and will more quickly appreciate its benefits. But then again, not all people “got” Twitter initially either.  Minorities slowly gravitated to it as well and have since taken over,  some reports say.   An Edison Research annual report on Twitter  showed that Blacks represented 25% of Twitter users, roughly twice their share of the population in general.  A Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project report showed slightly lower usage statistics, but still impressive, indicating usage among blacks and Hispanics proportionate to their population at 13% and 18%, respectively. Google+  shares user demographics based on region of the country, profession, and gender but not race.   When Google opens the site to all users, we may likely see more minorities migrate over but not as quickly as one would think or some would want. Social media expert Lindsay Holmes, owner of LCH Business, a branding & marketing company, says while Google+ may be a competitor to Facebook, she doesn’t think Google+ will be Twitter killer. “People who get Twitter and use it for marketing won’t abandon it that fast because they know its utility and Google+ can’t compete,” Holmes said. ” If there is anything that will slow minorities down from adopting any new technology that would be  intimidation and once they get over that initial hurdle, they will get on.” Holmes said when people are able to realize the usability of Google+, they will join more when it becomes available to more.  “We are people that need usability and understand usability,” she added. It is quite possible then that Hispanics and Blacks, as a group, may be among the last to join the site if it indeed lasts through the long haul and becomes a viable competitor to Facebook.  They may be less likely than other groups to join the bandwagon and try a new platform.  They may remain loyal users of Twitter and Facebook as Asian and Whites, and tech savvy higher income minorities join Google+. Google+, the place to go to escape the  “ghettoization” of other social media platforms In essence, if  Google+ indeed is able to court away some of Facebook’s 750 Million users and black and brown users adopt later, we may be looking at a repeat of what happened with MySpace.  According Researcher Danah Boyd, scores of more affluent and white users abandoned MySpace for Facebook partly because there was an impression that it had become too “ghetto” and used by blacks and Hispanics.     She discussed this issue back in 2007 in a controversial chapter of a forthcoming book addressing “digital” white flight, the Digital Race Anthology. In White Flight in Networked Publics?  How Race and Class Shaped American Teen Engagement with MySpace and  Facebook, the Microsoft Research and Harvard Berkman Center for Internet and Society scholar conducted ethnographic research and used anecdotal conversations with over 100 youth to conclude there was a “white flight” from MySpace because it had become too brown. Currently, Blacks and Hispanics still have a predominant presence on MySpace and are represented on that site at a disproportionate rate at 26% and 45%, respectively, when they are 12% and 16% in the population as a whole.  Some have speculated, though not gone on record saying, that Rupert Murdoch sold off MySpace, which was once valued at $12 billion for a mere $35 million because he saw no value in a tool being used primarily by minorities and poor whites.  Some critics of Murdoch say MySpace went down hill after Murdoch’s Newscorp acquired the once popular site, first used by nascent bands and performing groups to promote their albums and songs.  He failed to sufficiently invest in it to make it competitive to new sites – Facebook launched one year after MySpace- and then quickly abandoned it when its cream users stopped using it.  A more plausible explanation may be that NewsCorp simply wanted to free up some cash to acquire a majority stake in UK’s Sky Broadcasting, that MySpace was too prone to viruses, hackers and spam than Facebook or because Facebook was simply more attractive options for users.  But those who stayed, did so by choice.  As one blogger on the Project Economic Refugee pointed out, what Latinos loved about MySpace was the freedom to be creative, everything Facebook isn’t and why they did not join it when everyone else was. Facebook  is used widely by all races these days as is Twitter. But as mentioned,  recent reports indicate higher than average Twitter use among Blacks and Hispanics and data indicate this may because they are more likely using their mobile devices to access social media than whites. According to a new report by the Pew Research Center’s Internet & American LIfe Project, 44% of African Americans and Hispanics say they own a smartphone, compared to just 30% of non-Hispanic whites. Using this type of data as a guide, several bloggers and tech watchers have pondered whether Black and Hispanics use of mobile devices will enable them to leapfrog over other groups and help them bridge the digital divide. While idealistic and hopeful, that outcome would hardly be realized so long as Blacks and Hispanics are slow to navigate to new services. Are minorities positioned to be left behind? Since Google+ was rolled out, a benefit of being an early adopter is being able to access and be visible to some of the top players in the digital, programming and application world.  Those who are followed by millions on Twitter, are only being “followed” by hundreds or thousands on Google+.  When followers pose a query as a follow up to a post by a more popular user, they are more likely to get a direct answer.  There is interaction. Right now is the peak and prime time to get on, start exploring, learn from and exchange with leaders in your field you may not ordinarily have easy access to on other platforms.  Once the site is opened to millions that accessibility will dissipate most likely. Many of the current inhabitants are dreading the inevitable.  When news broke this week that Google plans to soon open up the social media tool to everyone, some Google+ users let out a collective sigh. “There goes the neighborhood,” one person commented on the stream of noted Tech writer Mike Elgan. Another added, “As soon as Google+ is open, the quality will drop.” These retorts show that Google+ perhaps , for a few, is a place to escape the not so pleasant aspects of Twitter, including users who in the past have been said to be degrading the medium by using it to create and discuss crass, misogynistic, racist and even violent trending topics.  While some users may want to be exclusionary, Google can’t afford to shun anyone if it truly plans to put a dent into Facebook’s 750 Million user database. It will have to be inclusive of broad demographics, encourage them to navigate over and make it useful and easy for them to stay and set up shop in a similar fashion as the earliest adopters. When the site is eventually opened who is to say even whether minority groups and younger users will wander over and join immediately?  It may not matter. Google+ may bolt out the starting gate, gain momentum and slowly die out just like other social media sites that have tried to rival and best Facebook.   Only time will tell.

Europe’s top antitrust official Margrethe Vestager has accused Google of unfairly promoting its shopping service and undercutting competitors by limiting their ability to place search ads on third party websites. “We will carefully consider Google’s response before taking any decision on how to proceed and cannot at this stage prejudge the final outcome of the investigation,” the European Commission said in an emailed statement. Facebook, Google, SCMP band together to spur Hong Kong’s growth in digital advertising The latest development underscores the high stakes for Google, which is facing three antitrust cases in Europe. The European Commission has also charged Google with using its popular Android mobile software to promote its own services over those of competitors. The concern for Google: It could be forced to make changes to the way it conducts its business in the European Union, from the money it makes from online search in Europe to the prominent placement of its apps on mobile devices. Google could also face fines as high as 10 per cent of its global revenue, which totaled US$75 billion last year.   Most Popular Viewed 1 Hong Kong point-and-view app that finds 'haunted flat' bargains 2 Young professor blazes trail for Hong Kong scientists in mainland China as she shines light on puzzle that eluded Einstein 3 China’s 30-year long march to its biggest ever rocket launch 4 China’s most powerful rocket lifts off from island launch centre 5 Elon Musk’s surprise unveiling of Tesla’s ‘solar roof’ Shared 1 Hong Kong point-and-view app that finds 'haunted flat' bargains 2 China’s 30-year long march to its biggest ever rocket launch 3 Young professor blazes trail for Hong Kong scientists in mainland China as she shines light on puzzle that eluded Einstein 4 China’s giant FAST radio telescope to join hunt for extraterrestrial intelligence 5 China’s most powerful rocket lifts off from island launch centre Commented 1 Doctors: the profiteering cartel poisoning Hong Kong health care 2 Why a Hong Kong taxi driver watching porn is a ride too far 3 How Hong Kong journalist berated by Jiang Zemin turned to art 4 Street artist Shepard Fairey unapologetic as he makes Hong Kong debut 5 Who was the girliest ghoul at Hong Kong’s hottest Halloween ball?

Nov, 18:26 US tech giant Google has rebuked European Commission claims that it has stifled competition on online shopping. "We believe these claims are wrong as a matter of fact, law, and economics," the US internet company's senior vice-president and general counselor, Kent Walker, said in a post published on Google's blog on Thursday (3 November).   The European Commission’s case "doesn’t fit the reality of how most people shop online," Google said (Photo: Trey Ratcliff) At the same time Google sent its response to antitrust charges issued by the commission last July.   The charges, known as statements of objection (SO), followed a first SO sent in 2015 when the commission formally opened an anti-trust case about Google's online shopping practices. The commission said that Google "systematically favour[ed] its own comparison shopping service in its general search results" at the expense of other comparison services. It also said that these comparison services and merchant platforms, such as Amazon and eBay, were two different markets, that merchants platforms were not competitors to Google and that they should not be taken into account when looking at how shopping services were displayed by Google. In his blog post, Walker argued that the commission took a "narrow definition" of the market and "failed to take into account the competitive significance of companies like Amazon and the broader dynamics of online shopping." He also argued that "the commission’s revised case still rests on a theory that just doesn’t fit the reality of how most people shop online." He wrote that "all of these services - search engines, price comparison sites, merchant platforms, and merchants - compete with each other in online shopping," and that Google was not in a position to oblige people to use its services to shop online. 'No meaningful correlation' "There is simply no meaningful correlation between the evolution of our search services and the performance of price comparison sites," he wrote, adding that "as the market changes, there are inevitably shifts among competitors." Sources close to the case said that Google's response was "very strong" and that the company was open to a compromise with the commission on a case that has been running for six years. The European Commission started to investigate on Google's practices in November 2010, and opened the formal case almost five years later. Google also sent on Thursday its response in a parallel case, over its AdSense service for advertisement, where the commission said it was protecting its dominant position in online search advertising. Google's legal chief Walker did not elaborate on this case in his blog post, but the company has been saying that text based ads were not a different market from other forms of online advertisement. In a third case opened earlier this year, the commission has accused Google of abusing its position to prevent other applications in its Android system for mobile. The company has until next week to send its response.

Home Companies Google attacks EU case that ‘doesn’t fit the reality’ Google attacks EU case that ‘doesn’t fit the reality’ Google poured scorn on European Union allegations it skewed shopping search results to favor its own services and said regulators have failed to see that the search-engine giant is competing head on with e-commerce giants Amazon.com Inc. and EBay Inc. By: Reuters | Published: November 3, 2016 10:50 PM Google said Thursday that the EU’s allegations lack evidence and would ultimately harm users in favor “of a small number of websites,” in a blog posting detailing its response to European Commission antitrust objections over its comparison-shopping and AdSense services.(Reuters) Google poured scorn on European Union allegations it skewed shopping search results to favor its own services and said regulators have failed to see that the search-engine giant is competing head on with e-commerce giants Amazon.com Inc. and EBay Inc. Google said Thursday that the EU’s allegations lack evidence and would ultimately harm users in favor “of a small number of websites,” in a blog posting detailing its response to European Commission antitrust objections over its comparison-shopping and AdSense services. “The commission’s revised case still rests on a theory that just doesn’t fit the reality of how most people shop online,” Kent Walker, Google’s senior vice president and general counsel said in the blog post. The EU’s “claims are wrong as a matter of fact, law, and economics.” Google faced four EU antitrust complaints since the Brussels-based regulator opened its first probe into the Mountain View, California-based company in November 2010. In a previous response, Google ridiculed as “peculiar and problematic” a first statement of objections over the way it displays search results. EU Evidence The commission refined its shopping case in July, saying it has “a broad range of additional evidence and data” that the Alphabet Inc. unit systematically favors its own comparison-shopping service in its search results and that smaller rivals lose traffic when they appear lower down in results. “There is simply no meaningful correlation between the evolution of our search services and the performance of price comparison sites,” Walker said in the blog. The Brussels-based commission said it received Google’s responses and will “carefully consider” them “before taking any decision on how to proceed.” Anti-Google campaigners criticized the company’s response. “When consumers look at Google ads they do not get the best, most relevant results. Instead, they get results from advertisers willing to pay Google the most money,” said Thomas Vinje, a lawyer with Clifford Chance who represents FairSearch Europe, whose members include Expedia Inc. and Nokia Oyj. No ‘New Theory’ The extra statement of objections in the shopping case “didn’t offer a new theory, but argued that because sites like Amazon sometimes pay” price comparison aggregators “for referred traffic, they can’t also be considered rivals,” said Walker. Google’s view is that Amazon only gets a small amount of its traffic from such services, “hardly enough to support the idea they don’t compete with price comparison sites,” he said. “The data show that the handful of price comparison sites who’ve filed competition complaints don’t reflect the wider marketplace,” said Walker. Over the past 10 years “a rapidly increasing amount of traffic flowed from our search pages to popular sites like Amazon and eBay as they expanded in Europe, hardly a sign of our ‘favoring’ our own ads.” AdSense Response Walker said Google also sent its response to a separate EU complaint accusing the company of obstructing competition for online ads with its AdSense for Search product, which places advertising on websites, including retailers, telecommunications operators and newspapers. Google has until Nov. 11 to respond to a third charge sheet the EU sent it in April over its Android smartphone software. The company will respond to the Android antitrust complaint “in the days to come,” said Walker. While all these cases are separate, each time they “cite just a few complaints to justify broad legal claims.” Please Wait while comments are loading...

SUBSCRIBE Expanded text ads that kick butt Wondering how to write great ads that convert in the age of expanded text ads? Columnist Mona Elesseily shares her tips and observations. Mona Elesseily on November 3, 2016 at 12:38 pm More Expanded text ads (ETAs) in AdWords are here, and we’ve had some real success with them thus far. In this article, I’ll talk about what we’ve seen in testing and what is working for us with ETAs. I’ll also cover some pointers on elements you can include to make ads more effective and compelling to online searchers. Note: Advertisers will no longer by able to create or edit standard text ads as of January 31, 2017, meaning that you should be fully transitioned to expanded text ads by then. It’s not too late, and there’s time to get things sorted. Expanded text ads — what’s been working We’ve done a fair bit of testing, and we’ve determined a few major takeaways in our initial ETA tests: 1. Longer text ads convert better We didn’t take Google’s word for it, so we’ve been testing shorter copy (using standard text ads) vs. longer copy (using the ETA format), and the longer copy has been converting better. My theory is that longer copy is causing people to actually read online ads; previously, people would briefly glance at ad headlines and URLs before clicking and going to landing pages. Our goal as advertisers is to get people to landing pages so that they can make a decision to engage further (and ultimately buy a product/service). With ETAs, we’re able to provide more information in ads, and it seems that this ad copy is factoring more into buying decisions. 2. Longer text ads = better mobile conversions One of the many ways I’ve been using ETAs is as a workaround to the poorly performing mobile-only ad format. I paused the mobile-only ads and ran with ETAs (which were appearing on mobile devices). The result? I observed these expanded text ads perform 30 percent better on mobile than standard, mobile-only text ads. 3. Wording counts We’ve found that people like to “shop” as opposed to “buy” or “get.” Though ETAs give you more characters to work with, you should still think carefully about the words you use in your ads. Other ad copy considerations Now more than ever, the elements you choose to include in ads are very important. It’s not just a matter of filling up space but trying to figure out what your customers want and finding a compelling way to tell them. It’s also important to have ads that stand out. Think carefully about the elements you’re going to include in your ads. The following factors tend to move the needle in ads, so test them out! 1. Pricing People are motivated to shop online by price. Both showrooming (browsing in store, then purchasing online at a lower price) and webrooming (researching online, then purchasing in a store) have become very popular, and each must be considered when mapping out retail strategies. Compare your pricing to that of your online and offline competitors, then write ad copy targeting price-sensitive shoppers. 2. Discounts Discounts are very popular as well. Test both percentage-off and dollar-amounts-off discounts in your ad copy to see where you get the best traction. Remember, don’t be blinded by what you think will work. Test and see. 3. Shipping offers Consider a shipping offer that is equivalent to the discount offer you’re considering. In my experience, shipping offers convert better than discount offers. Free shipping, or free shipping over X amount spent, is always compelling. Don’t raise prices to offer free shipping, as people are more price-sensitive than shipping offer-sensitive. 4. Variety of items in stock People like to select from a variety of products, so try wording like “huge selection” with more generic keywords like “dresses” or “sneakers.” If possible, you might also consider ad copy that speaks to your current inventory, like “in stock and ready to ship.” 5. Testimonials These are powerful. They can be effectively incorporated into ads with seller ratings and review extensions. (They can also be effectively incorporated on landing pages.) 6. Flexible returns The ability to return products makes companies seem trustworthy. Here are some examples: 365-day return policy Hassle-free returns “Try & buy” wording 7. Brand reputation Showing that you’ve been around for a while is powerful. You can do this with review extensions, seller ratings or wording like “in business since 1955.” 8. Loyalty program Loyalty programs are important to many, so try mentioning yours in ads where appropriate, and see what kind of traction you get. I’ve seen increases of 20 percent in ads that mention loyalty programs. Non-ad elements Ads don’t stand alone! They work in conjunction with other site and page elements. Don’t forget the following: 1. Simple site navigation Don’t underestimate the post-click experience. Why work hard to drive your traffic to a site that’s difficult to navigate? Keep it streamlined and intuitive. 2. Mobile-friendly web pages Ensure that people are able to find products/services and surf mobile pages easily. Site speed is an important ranking factor in general, and Google announced earlier this year that mobile site speed may soon impact your mobile rankings — so ensure that your mobile pages are up to snuff. A good tool to test this is the Think With Google Site Speed Tool. Below is an example from Home Depot. In the example, Home Depot’s mobile site speed is considered poor at 55/100. 3. Friends and family discount This is effective when sent by snail mail or email and amplified by paid social (or regular social) and paid search (if needed). These types of promotions tend to spread effectively by word of mouth. 4. Social media recommendations Recommendations on social media are effective. Don’t forget to build up fan base and recommendations on social to corroborate what you’re saying in other online channels (including ads). Remember: You have until January 31, 2017, to incorporate expanded text ads into your Google AdWords accounts. Good luck!

Mossberg: Google Home shows promise, but needs work The Verge 11/3/2016 Walt Mossberg © Provided by The Verge Like many tech enthusiasts, I’ve been using a $180 Amazon Echo intelligent speaker at my home for a year or more. And, while I love using it for some things — playing music and podcasts, setting timers, and re-ordering items from Amazon — I’ve come to realize that, like Apple’s Siri and all other virtual assistants, its Alexa voice-driven artificial intelligence system disappoints a lot. Quotes in the article Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 719.07 -19.94 -2.70% Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 105.71 -2.72 -2.51% Netflix Inc NFLX ▼ 113.38 -1.40 -1.22% So I was excited to test Google Home, the $129 Echo competitor that puts the search giant’s much-touted new Google Assistant intelligence technology inside a small, but powerful Echo-like speaker and microphone unit. Surely, I thought, after collecting all that info about the world (and about me) for years and years, Google would crush Amazon in the home-intelligence race. But after nearly a week of using two Google Home units in two different rooms, my conclusions are decidedly mixed. Google Home does beat Alexa and the Echo in some ways, but it’s remarkably dumb in others. It needs enough work that, if I were Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, I wouldn’t be losing any sleep about it, at least not yet. Really? It looks so good! In my opinion, and, more importantly, that of my wife (whose taste is much better than mine and whose tech addiction much less) the Google Home looks a lot better than the Echo. While the Echo is a tall black metal cylinder, Google’s contender is a smaller, more stylish, white plastic cylinder with an angled top and a mesh speaker base. You can get alternate bases in different colors. The top is touch sensitive, and has built-in lights that show when the Home is ready to accept a command. It snaps to attention when it hears the trigger phrases “OK, Google” or “Hey, Google”. (The Echo’s trigger phrase can be set to simply “Alexa”, “Echo” or “Amazon”.) You can raise or lower the volume, or pause or resume something, using voice commands. Or you can control the volume by tracing a circle on the top and play / pause by gently tapping it. I ran into some glitches with setup, which is performed using an Android or iOS app called Google Home. My first unit wouldn’t recognize my Wi-Fi network and I had to use a temporary workaround to get connected. Google said that might be because I was using an Eero router system. It says it has seen issues with Eero and is working to resolve them. The Echo just a few inches away had no problem with the Eero Wi-Fi and neither did the Google Pixel phone or iPhone I was using, also within inches of the Google Home. In the case of both Google Home units, the app reported trouble completing an initial update of the device. Google says it believes this was a bug which it will fix. It’s not OK, Google. There’s an election going on! In my tests, it was often a toss-up as to whether the Google Assistant or Alexa would do better. For instance, when I asked “who’s running for president?”, Home listed the two main third-party candidates as well as the major-party nominees; the Echo left out Gary Johnson and Jill Stein. But when I asked Google Home, in four different ways, to give me the latest election polls, it answered “Sorry, I can’t help with that yet, but my team’s helping me learn,” the device’s go-to excuse. The Echo piped right up with the latest average of polls from the respected site RealClearPolitics. Google says that, by election day next week, Home will be able to say who’s won or who’s winning for president, via a variety of queries — but that seems a tad late. Google Home knew the address of my office. The Echo told me either the address of the nearest post office, or, when I asked using the words “work address”, said it couldn’t help. But, while Google Home couldn’t give me any info about my calendar (which is kept on Google Calendar, but via a different account), the Echo knew all about it. (Google Home currently only supports a single Google account. I chose my personal account, which contains most of my search data. Google says it’s working on enabling multiple accounts.) Lincoln vs. Lipitor When I asked “where is the nearest pharmacy?” (a question suggested for reviewers by Google), Google Home was dumb. It listed three. One was the correct answer (a CVS) — but with the wrong address. A second was the clinic inside the same drugstore, which isn’t a pharmacy. The third was a nearby supermarket that lacks a pharmacy. The Echo gave me the CVS and also the nearest Walgreens, plus two smaller ones. Google Home couldn’t take a note or set a reminder, like the Echo can. Google says it’s working on adding that. On the other hand, Google Home carried on a conversation with me about Abraham Lincoln, telling me first when he was born, and then answering several other queries about him without requiring me to repeat his name. The Echo couldn’t do this. Home gave a detailed answer to the question of when Jimmy Fallon was in the cast of Saturday Night Live, while the Echo had no idea. For playing music, Google mostly did well. Home supports Spotify and Pandora, but I set it to rely on Google’s own Google Play and YouTube services. It handled even my hand-crafted playlists fine. But it occasionally stopped playing a song for a few seconds and then resumed. While the sound from Home was quite good, my wife and I preferred the Echo’s sound slightly, both for music and voices. The Echo’s speaker was crisper, the Home’s a tiny bit fuzzy, to our ears. Also, on at least one album (the “Sleepless in Seattle” soundtrack), Home repeatedly declined to play more than one song, while the Echo played them all. Like the Echo, Google Home can control some third-party smart home devices, but I couldn’t test this, as I have decided not to help bring down the internet by owning such devices. Video via voice Home is much less versatile than Echo, because it lacks the thousands of third-party apps (or “skills”) that the latter boasts. But it has its own special trick: it can, via a voice command, allow you to cast streaming videos or programs to your TV, provided you have one of Google’s Chromecast devices. For now, these videos have to come from Google’s own YouTube service, but the company says Netflix and others are coming. In my tests, I was able to get all the Saturday Night Live presidential debate parodies to play on my TV using just Google Home and a single voice command. I also used Home to cast rock star music videos, other TV clips and a random YouTube video of a person playing a guitar. About that guitar video: I saw it due to the fact that the dual long-range mics on the Home simply couldn’t grasp the name of my colleague “Lauren Goode” despite repeated attempts (you should watch her YouTube videos anyway.) So I saw other people. I had a handful of other experiences in which the Google Home mics just couldn’t figure out what I was saying. At other times they seemed overly sensitive. For instance, if you have two Home units set up, as I did, only the one closest to you is supposed to respond to your voice. I found this generally true, but on two occasions, both units responded. Overall, the mics had very good range and accuracy, even several rooms away, but not quite as good as the 7-mic array on the Amazon product. If you do spring for multiple Google Home speakers, you can set them up, via the app, to play the same music in multiple rooms. This worked fine for me. Speaking of the app, it works on both Android and iPhone, and I tested both successfully. Privacy A lot of people might be suspicious about placing a constantly-listening Google device in their homes, since the company is famous for collecting personal information. I asked Google about this, and a person who worked on Google Home swore that it only collects what you say after it hears the trigger phrases. Further, he said, the data goes into the same data store as other information Google collects about you. And, like that information, you can tweak or even delete it at myactivity.google.com. Bottom Line To paraphrase Google’s own CEO, Sundar Pichai, artificial intelligence is still in its very early days. And, in my opinion, Google Home shows that. I have no doubt it will improve. But I was surprised that Google Home arrived so rough around the edges, especially when it had an existing competitive product to learn from, and an unmatched wealth of data to draw upon. Like a dominating batter in a tight World Series game, you kind of expect Google to hit a game-winning homer. But it merely hit a double, and the contest is still very much on.

Under the leadership of Sameer Samat, who rejoined Google earlier this year after a spell as president of wearable tech firm Jawbone, the company is sharpening Google Play store recommendations with artificial intelligence and expanding support for various payment platforms, among other initiatives. Google's efforts in some way mirror those of arch-rival Apple, which revamped its App Store this year with quicker review times for new apps and an increase in the cut of revenue that goes to developers. Both companies face a chorus of complaints from developers who say they are struggling to stand out in a jam-packed field. Many smartphone users, meanwhile, appear to have tired of downloading apps altogether, especially as messaging services like Snapchat perform more of the functions that once required a separate app. Games remain a focus of the Google Play store, and Nintendo is building a version of its popular Super Mario Run game for Android, said Samat, who leads product management for the Google Play store. The store is also expanding to new platforms, including wearable devices, virtual reality headsets and Google's Chromebook laptops. “What we are excited about is giving developers that single entry point for more and more of the computing ecosystem,” said Samat. Android ‘Wild West’ Google has eased the once-complicated process of developing apps for the Play store, said James Knight, a former Google employee who launched Pembroke, a consultancy that helps developers convert Apple-compatible iOS apps to the Android operating system. “The App Store has historically been a little more straightforward, and Android has been a bit more like the Wild West,” he said. Mirroring the larger smartphone market, the Google Play store sees far more activity by virtue of its placement on the wide range of devices running the Android operating system - but Apple claims more of the profits. The Google Play store accounted for 70 percent of app downloads in the third quarter of this year, but Apple's App Store logged 65 percent of the revenue, according to App Annie, a mobile analytics firm. A big part of Google's new effort involves emerging markets, where Android is stronger relative to the iPhone. The company has steadily expanded its support of direct carrier billing, a popular payment method in emerging markets where consumers often do not have credit cards. Google now offers the payment method in 47 markets. To improve app recommendations for users, the Play store has also made extensive use of machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that gleans insights from vast troves of data. Google's Play store and machine learning teams began collaborating three years ago, and a partnership was struck last year with Google Brain, a cutting-edge research project. The jolt of artificial intelligence is welcome as developers hunt for an audience for their apps, said Greg Cohn, chief executive of Burner, which makes an app that provides temporary phone numbers. “The harsh reality is that there are a few apps that get the vast majority of people's time and attention,” he said.

Follow TechnoBuffalo We published our Google Home review earlier this morning. It sounds awesome, but I can’t buy one. It’s not that I have anything against Google’s technology, it’s that I’m already invested in the Amazon Echo. I wonder how many households this will affect. I’ve talked about this at length in posts and on the TechnoBuffalo show, but the growing ecosystems offered by manufacturers, including Apple, Google, Amazon and others, is starting to make it incredibly difficult to stick with just one. You’re better off buying an Apple TV if you also own an iPhone, for example. And an Apple Watch and HomeKit-enabled devices. You’re also probably better off with an Android TV if you use Android. And Android Wear and, now, Google Home. If you’re like me, you have an empty wallet and an assortment of gadgets around the house that makes a Jackson Pollock painting look organized. I have an iPhone, an Apple TV, an Android TV, an Android smartphone, Philips Hue connected bulbs that talk with Apple HomeKit, three Amazon Echo units that work with the light bulbs.  Sometimes I think about switching from an Apple Watch to something else but then I remember I won’t be able to control my lights from my wrist. And I need my Apple TV plugged in since that serves as the smart hub for the lights throughout my house. What a waste of money. Enter the Google Home. I’m compelled to pick one up because I think Google has the capability to execute better than Alexa over the long run. Google has more data on me than Amazon — though I’m sure I’d be surprised how much the latter knows, given my shopping habits. The problem is, I’ve already invested in three Amazon Echo units and, in some ways, have picked the Apple ecosystem over Android (for whatever reason, I still buy all of my movies on Google Play.) My Echo devices work well enough, and I can’t think of a good reason to spend $390 on three Google Home units to replace what I already own. In other words, I’d have to think about switching ecosystems that I’ve already invested in. Google Home would make the most sense with Android TV and Chromecast, and down the line, if you also own an Android smartphone. When the next generation of Android Wear watches ship, my guess is they’ll have some sort of tie-in as well. We need to make ecosystem choices, whether we want to or not It’s not that I don’t use Android. I use it on a daily basis. But choosing just iOS or Android and investing in an entire ecosystem are totally different things. I can’t use both an Apple ecosystem and a Google ecosystem in my house at the same time. And since the Echo supports HomeKit devices, I’m going to stick with that for now. I fear my decision, though. Are my Amazon Echo units going to be useless in a few years if Google pulls ahead? Is Apple going to launch its own home device and make my choices even harder? The ecosystem starts with the phone. How many people have already started to invest beyond that, and what does this mean for the future of smart products like Google Home?

But the project underscore that it’s still early in the VR game — with the league tapping the tech as a promotional fan-engagement vehicle, rather than a revenue driver. NFL Films will produce a nine-part series offering a 360-degree perspective of life in and around the NFL, covering players, coaches, executives, cheerleaders and fans. The series of 5- to 10-minute episodes, marking the first episodic VR sports program, will center on how the denizens of Football Nation prepare for game day. Related Daydream Available for Pre-Order: What We Know About Google’s Virtual Reality Headset The VR content will be free, with the first episode of the series to be available on the NFL’s YouTube channel on Thanksgiving Day (Nov. 24). Later this year, episodes will also be available via the NFL’s VR app designed for Daydream View, Google’s mobile VR headset that works with its new Pixel phones set to begin shipping Nov. 10, along with other immersive experiences. “Virtual reality is an emerging platform that enables content experiences with a truly unique vantage point that brings fans closer to the game,” said Vishal Shah, the NFL’s senior VP of digital media. “We want to get better acquainted with the technology, the platform, the content we can actually create… and how our fans are engaging in the content and viewing it.” Shah declined to say what the NFL is spending on the VR series. Google is contributing staff and equipment for the project, and is helping the NFL develop the app for the Daydream View platform. NFL Films also is working with production company Two Bit Circus VR on the series. Related NFL Goes Bigger on YouTube: League Will Stream 96 Classic Games, More Highlights NFL Films is currently in production on the series, which is being shot using Google’s Jump 360-degree camera rig system. In the first episode, viewers will spend a week with the Philadelphia Eagles’ defensive line as they prepare for an upcoming game. Subsequent episodes will tag along with the Miami Dolphins cheerleaders, go inside Green Bay’s distinctive football culture, and offer an insider’s look at the San Diego Chargers organization. The league experimented with virtual reality in 2015, and showcased some initial VR content at events including Super Bowl 50’s NFL Experience fan convention in San Francisco. The NFL launched its official YouTube channel in January 2015, and since then it’s generated more than 1 billion video views. The YouTube channel currently carries game previews, in-game highlights, post-game recaps, and news, analysis, fantasy football advice, and other short-form content from NFL Media properties. Additionally, 96 classic NFL games — three for each of the league’s 32 teams — are posted in their entirety on the NFL’s YouTube channel.

In the past, this information was largely provided by retailers, who may not always have the best quality or most complete product data. By using Manufacturer Center, brands and manufacturers directly influence how their products are represented in Google Shopping search results.   Because Edgenet is a leading Software-as-a-Service company that enables companies to better manage product data, and because it already manages one of the largest caches of product data in the world, it is perfectly situated to help global manufacturers make the most of Manufacturer Center.  Therefore, it has created a new product to facilitate this.  Called Products to Google (P2G), Edgenets new product enables manufacturers to automatically send rich product data to Manufacturer Center.   We are excited to work with Edgenet, said Brad Layous, Google Strategic Partnerships. They have an outstanding reputation for providing high quality product data and they have worked closely with us on this very important project.   Edgenet has been curating product data for over a decade. The worlds top manufacturers, retailers and suppliers already have their product data in our network, said Steve Proctor, Edgenets Chief Executive Officer. By using P2G, they gain quick access to the worlds largest search and shopping engine. We publish it automatically, and make sure it is optimized for Googles needs. The more product attributes you have listed, the more likely it is your product shows up in a search. So, manufacturers who use P2G and Manufacturer Center are likely to stand out in a crowded marketplace.   Rich product data is key to sales and a positive brand experience. Plus, manufacturers who use Manufacturer Center have access to powerful analytics. They can get total impressions, click through rates, and category comparison benchmarks, Proctor said. This is an extremely powerful, new capability for manufacturers. It is also a potential game changer for Edgenet, because it allows our customers to better measure ROI on product data.   About Edgenet: A Nashville-based company with a divisional office in Milwaukee, Wis., Edgenet is a Software as a Service (SaaS) company that provides retailers, distributors, websites and suppliers with the ability to manage and improve their product content. Edgenets Product Content Cloud (PCc), Made-to-Order (m2o) and Outdoor Projects (OdP) solutions help manufacturers, brands and retailers sell easier and sell more across all channels, anywhere, on any device, at any time.

Claire Freier | Courtesy Walking into the Chicago branch of Google’s corporate headquarters is like walking into the Google homepage, but instead of a blank white screen, concrete walls and pillars frame a fluorescently-lit model of  the iconic tetrachrome logo. As part of Living and Working in Chicago, 11 Hillsdale students found themselves on the other side. The visit was a part of Living and Working in Chicago, a two-day experience organized by career services that provides students with alumni networking opportunities, job shadowing, and a chance to spend fall break touring the Windy City. Career services has been connecting students with alumni and businesses in Chicago for more than eight years, but, this was the first time the agenda included meeting Google’s head of home services. John Farrar ’98 is in his second year as head of home services for Google. He was recruited by the technological giant when he was working on a mergers and acquisitions team at Valassis Communications and one of his clients referred Farrar’s name to Google. As head of home services for the U.S., Farrar leads teams in Chicago and New York which manage Google’s largest performance advertisers. “In performance advertising, the company wants you to take action immediately,” Farrar said. “For example if you’re in the market to buy home security online, ADT, one of our clients, wants you to buy their products online in your first search. My job is more about creating a linear action between advertising and commerce and making it easier for you to buy right away.” After graduating with a marketing major and Spanish minor from Hillsdale, Farrar says his appreciation of his Hillsdale education continues to grow. “I’m a huge fan of our education, mostly because a liberal arts education gives us a well-rounded perspective,” Farrar said. “There is a point of diminishing returns on going too deep in undergrad without being exposed to the actual practice of the profession, but I’d rather have exposure to a vast amount of subjects and go deeper from there.” Although he has always counted reading both volumes of Alexis De Tocqueville’s “Democracy in America” as a personal achievement, Farrar has been surprised at how frequently De Tocqueville arises in business situations. “Another valuable skill that Hillsdale grads pick up as result of a liberal arts background is learning to write well,” Farrar said. “I just got married in July and six of my eight groomsmen were classmates from Hillsdale. Pretty much every one of those guys can write really well. We all had to go through it.” Farrar also credits Director of Career Services Joanna Wiseley for helping land his first job as a customer business manager at General Mills. Farrar’s career trajectory isn’t surprising to Wiseley, who said she was impressed by his confidence and determination as an undergraduate student. “John was very proactive and made use of the resources career services had to offer and went to all of our events,” Wiseley said. “I didn’t go to John with a job opportunity, he was always looking for jobs. He was also really good about closing the deal in an interview, telling his interviewer that he would be an asset to the company.” Meeting Farrar and touring the Google headquarters was a surreal experience, said senior Kayla Stetzel. “Getting inside one of the largest tech industries and seeing the coworker dynamics was very informative,” Stetzel said. “There was a lot of open space, smart-looking people casually dressed, and quite a few dogs as it is a dog-friendly company. The company culture and work environment felt almost like a playground to keep people thinking in creative and unconventional ways.” Senior Will Crockett said his favorite part of the day at Google was speaking with a new member of Farrar’s team who was only a few years out from college. “I got to talk to him about what it’s like starting out and he was very encouraging. It’s nice to see what people a few steps ahead of you are doing. Also, I ate one of the most delicious lunches I’ve ever had,” Crockett said of his meal from Google’s complimentary cafeteria. The group of Hillsdale students sat down with Farrar and his team, asking questions from ‘What is working at Google like?’ to ‘What was the dumbest thing you ever did in an interview?’ Speaking to the best career advice he’s received, Farrar said he recommends Hillsdale students maximize their current responsibilities rather than tailoring their experiences to future employers. “Don’t focus so much on what’s on your resume or what it will it be,” Farrar said. “If you’re very passionate about what you’re doing, people will come to you. Also, if you got an itch, then definitely scratch it. At least you can say you’ve tried it. You don’t want to get to be 40 and not try something that you’d expected you might want to experience.” SHARE Facebook Twitter Previous articleNovels in November: Combatting midterm mundanity with creativity Next articleNovel glimpses into the poet’s mind Lillian Quinones Lillian Quinones is a junior from Madison, Wisconsin, majoring in biochemistry and minoring in journalism.

But Facebook is still red hot on Wall Street. So are three other tech stocks that make up the so-called FANG of Four. Facebook. Amazon. Netflix. Google. Sure, Google is technically Alphabet now. But its ticker symbol still starts with G. Besides, FANA doesn’t roll off the tongue. FAAN? AFNA? Nah. None of those acronyms sound as cool as FANG — a fitting moniker given how much bite the stocks have had this year. Shares of Facebook are up 15% so far in 2016, even after factoring in Thursday’s big drop. Amazon is up nearly 15% as well. Netflix, which was in the red for much of the year due to concerns about its growth, is now up 7% following a stellar earnings report that showed big gains in international subscribers. Amazon and Netflix even rallied Thursday while Facebook’s stock was sinking. So it seems as if investors are no longer treating the four as if they should all rise and fall together. And that makes sense. The FANG stocks have some things in common, most notably the fact that they’re betting big on video content. But that’s about it. Netflix has little in the way of commercials. Its money comes from subscriptions. Google’s lifeblood continues to be advertising dollars. Ditto for Facebook. And even though Amazon is diversifying and now has a huge cloud business, it still gets the bulk of its revenue from selling stuff. That’s why some would argue that it’s really more a retailer that uses tech as opposed to a pure tech company. And Google? It is the laggard of the group, up a mere 1% and about 7% below its all-time high. Despite concerns about how much Google is investing on money losing, moonshot “other bets” like Fiber, Nest and health care units Verily and Calico, the core search, YouTube and Android businesses continue to churn out big profits. Investors are still infatuated with these four tech companies. Several Wall Street analysts think Facebook’s drop is an overreaction. Investors shouldn’t be surprised that revenue growth will inevitably slow given how strong it has been this year. Nor should they be shocked to learn that Zuckerberg wants to invest more in the company, even if it hurts short-term profits. At the end of the day, Facebook and other tech stocks may continue to be stars on Wall Street as long as they keep proving that they have long-term momentum. Zuckerberg, Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, Netflix chief Reed Hastings and Google/Alphabet’s Larry Page and Sergey Brin all know that you have to spend money to make money. That philosophy may occasionally tick off myopically minded investors and traders who fret about how many pennies per share a company beats estimates.

We do a side-by-side analysis of each smart-home assistant's answers. Tyler Lizenby/CNET How do the Google Home and Amazon Echo answer the same questions? 0 Share: Smart Home by David Priest November 3, 2016 8:00 AM PDT @david_p_priest Up Next Amazon could start dropping off packages inside your home The Amazon Echo has controlled the smart home speaker niche for nearly two years. But now, there's a second contender: Google Home. Both gadgets can control smart home devices, play music, answer random questions, and tell you all about traffic or news or movie showtimes -- all with simple voice controls. The Echo and Home each have their own exclusive abilities, whether it's casting YouTube videos onto a TV (Google) or ordering products online (Amazon). But picking a virtual assistant for your home is a bit like picking a roommate -- personality matters. To that end, we sat down with the Echo and Home and asked each of them the same questions to see just how different (or similar) the digital assistants are from one another. Here are the questions and a breakdown of how each device responded to help you decide which one is right for you: 17 questions for the Google Home and Amazon Echo We asked the Google Home and the Amazon Echo the same 17 questions to find out how they respond differently. by Brian Tong 6:30 Close Drag 'Can you play some indie music?' Both devices can pull up playlists for you based on a genre request. The only real difference is the platforms from which they draw. The Home uses playlists from Google Play; the Echo uses playlists from Amazon Prime or Spotify (you can select in the app). Your pick will probably just depend on your current preference. 'Can you play the song that goes, "I got soul, but I'm not a soldier"?' Both devices can help you identify a song if you only know a lyric or two. But the Echo correctly identifies the song way more often than the Home. Of course, if the lyrics have the name of the song in them, both devices pretty consistently play the right thing. 'Hey, Google, play trivia.'/'Alexa, play Jeopardy.' Jeopardy is a third-party skill on the Echo, which means Amazon didn't create it (think of "Skills" like apps on your phone). That said, it's a far superior game to the Home's ingratiating trivia game. Alexa asks six questions that you might actually hear on the game show; Google Assistant makes lame jokes, and its questions include basic math equations in multiple-choice form. The only people who might prefer Google's game are children. 9 7 ways Google Home outsmarts Alexa 'Turn on the lights.' The Echo and Home can both control your smart-home gadgets. The Echo boasts a ton of integrations, whereas the Home only works with five platforms. However, the Home offers a lot more flexibility in how you issue commands. Alexa can be a stickler for phrasing (e.g., "entry light" but not "entryway light"), but the Home almost always understands. In addition, Home can control smart LED colors -- something that Echo still hasn't mastered. 'How's the weather? How about on Friday?' The Home's much-touted conversational assistance means you can ask follow-up questions without having to repeat previously established information. This feature is key to making conversations with smart-home speakers feel more natural and helpful. But the feature isn't that much stronger on Home, which is a bit of a surprise. Both Alexa and the Google Assistant can answer the above combination of questions. But both of them are hit-or-miss enough with their contextual conversations that I generally repeat information just so I don't have to repeat whole questions (e.g., "How's the weather? How will the weather be on Friday?"). 'Tell me a joke.' This is pretty self-explanatory, and the jokes vary. One thing you can depend on: The jokes are almost always bad, no matter which device you're speaking to. 9 7 reasons Alexa is better than Google Home's built-in Assistant "What movies are Jeffrey Wright and George Clooney in together?" The Echo and Home are both great resources for finding answers to those niggling questions. Both can perform quick online searches to answer even some of the most random questions. But only the Home could answer the above question thanks to Google's robust search technology; it tends to better handle complex searches. 'Cast trending videos onto the living room TV.' Only one of the devices could perform this action: the Home. One of the Home's biggest distinctions is its ability to queue YouTube videos onto TV screens using Chromecast. Google says Netflix and Google image searches are on the way. The feature certainly isn't polished yet, but even its imperfect presence sets it apart from the Echo. Both will order you an Uber at the end of a rough night.Photo by Tyler Lizenby/CNET 'OK, Google, call an Uber.'/'Alexa, tell Uber I need a ride.' The Home and Echo can both call an Uber, albeit with slightly different wording. But what this question really shows is the difference in philosophy behind these two devices. The Home has Uber because it intentionally included the service as a feature; the Echo has it because Uber made an Alexa Skill. Both devices might be able to summon an Uber, but for the Echo, Uber is only one of more than 3,000 Skills. Uber is one of the Home's only integrations with third-party services. Put simply, users will get a lot more options out of the Echo than the Home right now. So which roommate should you pick? With the Home and Echo, the choice might just come down to personality.

Skip to: Start of Article. Author: Davey Alba. Davey Alba Business Date of Publication: 11.03.16. 11.03.16 Time of Publication: 12:00 pm. 12:00 pm You Watching, Twitter? YouTube Just Cleaned Up Comments YouTube Google is finally rolling out new tools for cleaning up one of the worst places ever to exist online—the YouTube comments section—and all we can say is: It’s about time. Recently, so many online citizens, pundits, and publications (including WIRED) have called on internet companies to address rampant harassment on their platforms. And with YouTube, Google is the latest to heed the call. In the spring, Reddit introduced a new blocking tool for users. Then Microsoft launched tools for reporting hate speech online. And Instagram unveiled a way for users to be able to automatically block comments if they include certain abusive words. The big holdout is Twitter. The company has been consistently criticized for its failure to address harassment, and dozens of high-profile users have left the platform. But although Twitter has made some changes, including a quality filter and a new way to limit notifications, it hasn’t been enough. And last month, both Salesforce and Disney—two companies that were reportedly vetting whether Twitter would be a good acquisition—reportedly declined because of concerns about bullying and other abusive behavior on the network. Courtney Lessard, a YouTube product manager, says that YouTube new tools are designed to give video creators new ways of shaping the tone of conversations on the service. Video creators will be able to pin comments to the top of video feeds—which can bury comments from trolls—and they can show appreciation for their favorite comments by marking them with heart symbols. When creators comment on their channel, their usernames will be highlighted with an extra-bright color, so that viewers can easily tell the note is coming from them. The video platform has already implemented word blacklisting, user blocking, and the ability for creators to hold all new comments for their review since 2013. James Grimmelmann, a professor of law who studies social networks and online communities at Cornell University, questions whether Google’s moves are enough. “A lot of these are subtle design nudges,” Grimmelmann says. He believes they could “help set a better tone for comments sections by making the things users see more positive,” but he also points out that these tools don’t address the big problems of harassment or brigading on YouTube. Yes, they could help with channels that aren’t under active attack—but what about those that are? “The big challenge is that YouTube comments have been a sea of laziness and meh for so long that they’re a punchline,” Grimmelmann says. But Nathan Matias, a PhD candidate at the MIT Media Lab, as a more positive outlook on YouTube’s changes. He says one idea could be to use pinned comments listing rules for a channel at the top of a comments section. Matias, who has extensively studied online communities on Reddit, says his research shows that newcomer commenters were more likely to both participate and follow the rules when a pinned comment existed atop a forum. The changes can “shape people’s beliefs about what other people find acceptable or unacceptable,” Matias says. “For YouTubers who invest time in moderating comments, this may give them more time to focus” on troublemakers who pointedly want to break the rules, Matias says. Whatever the longterm effect of its changes, YouTube is trying move the needle toward a more productive comments section. At the very least, the new tools can’t hurt—and the company says it will unveil more in the coming months. Update 11/03/2016 3:30 PM ET: Added comments from Nathan Matias. Go Back to Top.

 Alphabet's DeepMind just hinted at another huge commercial opportunity Sam Shead Nov. 3, 2016, 11:56 AM 4,333 facebook linkedin twitter email print DeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman. WIRED/Michael Newington Gray AI research lab DeepMind is looking at how its self-learning algorithms can improve energy efficiencies across the British national grid, according to the company's cofounder. In 2014, Google paid over $600 million (£400 million) for what was then a little-known London startup without specifying how the company's AI technology would be used to increase Google's revenues, which already run into tens of billions of dollars every year. That changed in July when DeepMind announced that Google had found a use for its technology in its enormous server farms. Namely, Google said it was using a DeepMind-built AI system to control the huge air-conditioning units in its power-hungry data centres, where servers consume enough energy to power entire cities and get very hot in the process. At the time, DeepMind said its AI system makes the cooling units in Google's data centres 40% more efficient, ultimately cutting the data centres' overall electricity consumption by 15%. Now DeepMind is looking at how it can apply that same technology to the national grid, possibly presenting its owners with a highly lucrative commercial opportunity in the process. Speaking at the Wired 2016 conference in London on Thursday, DeepMind cofounder Mustafa Suleyman said: "What we’re now thinking about is how we can extend this more broadly to the national grid and to other large scale pieces of infrastructure which essentially have the same characteristic. "All of our algorithms that we develop are inherently general so given some data set, we should be able to train an algorithm based on some inputs, develop a model, predict some outputs, and then, providing we have access to some controls, we should be able to deliver similar sorts of performance." Nigel Roddis/REUTERS DeepMind declined to say how far along any talks with National Grid plans are. But data centres and electricity grids aren't the only place where DeepMind can have an impact on Google's bottom line. The company has also said this year that it intends to sell its products and services to healthcare providers like the NHS at some point, providing Google with an additional revenue stream. All of this adds up to make DeepMind a very interesting acquisition that could create significantly more than the £400 million that Google paid for the startup. Suleyman added that half of DeepMind's team, which stands at around 250 people, is split 50/50 into a "research" and "applied". The applied team is then split primarily between "healthcare" and "DeepMind for Google." DeepMind, is also investing in energy research.  NOW WATCH: A hacker reveals a simple way to come up with a strong password that's easy to remember Loading video...

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Vufine+ wearable display beams iPhone or drone to your eye Chris Davies - Nov 3, 2016 0 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit Google Glass, among its faults, pretty much killed off the head-mounted display segment, but Kickstarter success Vufine is hoping to reignite interest with its latest wearable. The Vufine+, launching on Kickstarter today, doesn’t attempt to do all of the social networking, notification flagging, and voice-controlled interactions which Glass tried to persuade us we needed, and nor – vitally – does it have a camera. Instead, it brings video from your phone, laptop, drone, or pretty much anything else to your eye-line. In short, it’s a wearable display, not a wearable computer. The L-shaped gadget has an LCD at one end and two ports at the other: the first, microUSB, is used to charge up the battery, which is good for around 90 minutes of solid use. The other, a mini HDMI, hooks up the Vufine+ to an external video source. Since it’s standard HDMI – there’s a cable in the box, though you might need an adapter depending on what you’re plugging it into – pretty much anything with that port is compatible. The most obvious device is a smartphone, though it could be a laptop or tablet, the streaming video feed from your drone, or footage from a GoPro. The Vufine+’s display itself tops out at 960 x 540 resolution. This isn’t Vufine’s first ride on the wearable display rodeo, and it shows from the mounting design. One of my big complaints about Glass was that, though the computing part was self-contained, it was screwed into the headset. The most obvious user-group for it, existing glasses-wearers, therefore had to switch to Google’s not-inexpensive frames if they wanted to keep using prescription lenses, as well as carry a second set of spectacles if they ever wanted to take Glass off but still be able to see. Vufine+ – like its 2015 predecessor, Vufine – is designed to be snapped on and off, however. The mount is a tiny plastic and rubber bracket that clips around the right arm of your glasses; the Vufine+ display itself magnetically attaches to it. It means you can easily remove it when you don’t want to use the display, or while it’s recharging, but not fiddle around unduly when you need it again. Along with the bracket, Vufine includes a stabilizing arm in the box for those with thinner, wire-style glasses. There’s also a set of generic frames with clear lenses, for those of you blessed with 20/20 vision (or contact lenses). The bracket itself isn’t the most inconspicuous thing I’ve ever seen, but if you wear black frames it shouldn’t be entirely obvious. The display clips into place and can pivot up or down. It’s designed for the right eye only – you can’t flip the orientation over for left-eye use – and to be positioned either directly ahead for more consistent use, or pushed up or below your eye-line for occasional glances. Wearing it while also using my laptop, I found it was easy to nudge up out of my sight while typing, then flip into place when I wanted to view something from my phone. There’s no focusing mechanism, though the eyepiece moves left and right so that you can center it in front of your eye. Pressing the button on the back turns it on; a subsequent press cycles from the standard view, to a zoomed view that magnifies the center of the video, and then a “fit” version which stretches the video to occupy as much of the screen as possible. That’s one of the primary differences over the first-gen Vufine; the other is its ability to handle screen rotation from a connected smartphone. Tilting my iPhone 7 into landscape, the Vufine+ version flipped too. Image quality is surprisingly good. There are no brightness, contrast, or other picture controls, and no adjustments for focus, but I had no problem making out text in iOS. Unlike Glass’ eyepiece, it’s not designed to be transparent – you can’t see what’s going on behind the display – but that helps with brightness, and you do of course have your other eye unobstructed. The ease of actually interacting with what’s being displayed depends on the connected device. I plugged in a laptop and, being able to type without looking at my hands, was able to put together a text document without too many errors. Trying to type on the iOS on-screen keyboard, however, was more difficult. As for comfort, the eyepiece itself weighs around 25 grams, and adding in the magnetic bracket takes that up to around 33 grams. Of course, you also have the weight of a cable dangling off the side, which can leave you feeling a little lop-sided. If you have a wireless HDMI adapter, as some drone pilots use, you could plug that in to avoid the wire, though of course you’d still have the weight of the dongle to contend with. Still, you’re only looking at wearing it for specific purposes (though you could, in theory, also plug in an external battery and power it for longer than the Vufine+’s own 90 minutes) rather than all day, that’s a lot more bearable. It’s certainly not an accessory for everyone, but if you’ve ever wanted a way to keep an eye on drone footage, remotely see your camera’s viewfinder, or interact with your smartphone more discretely, it’s an effective way of doing that. Vufine’s Kickstarter opens today, priced at $179 (with early-bird pricing for a limited number as low as $159). Regular price will be $199, the same as the first-generation Vufine. If all goes to plan, it’s expected to ship by the end of the year.

Photo: Reuters mail print View all comments Tweet Published: 11:20 PM, November 3, 2016 Updated: 4:00 AM, November 4, 2016 BRUSSELS - Google <GOOGL.O> on Thursday formally rejected European Union antitrust charges of unfairly promoting its shopping service and blocking rivals in online search advertising, paving the way for EU regulators to rule next year on these issues and potentially impose hefty fines. The U.S. technology giant's rebuttal in the shopping case came six years after the European Commission opened an investigation prompted by complaints from rivals such as Microsoft <MSFT.O> and a host of European and U.S. rivals. The EU regulator followed up with an anti-competitive charge against the company in April last year and added more evidence in July this year. It also issued a separate charge sheet against its online search advertising product AdSense for Search at the same time. Google's general counsel Kent Walker said on a blog that the accusations had no factual, legal or economic basis, and that the company's actions were driven by its users rather than any plan to squash rivals. "We never compromised the quality or relevance of the information we displayed. On the contrary, we improved it. That isn't 'favoring' - that's listening to our customers," Walker said. He said the Commission had failed to take into account competition from Amazon <AMZN.O>, merchant platforms, social media sites, mobile web and online advertising by companies such as Facebook <FB.O> and Pinterest. The EU executive said it had received Google's response. "In each case, we will carefully consider Google's response before taking any decision on how to proceed and cannot at this stage prejudge the final outcome of the investigation," Commission spokesman Ricardo Cardoso said in an email. Google may find it difficult convincing the EU regulator with its latest arguments, said Michael Carrier, professor at New Jersey-based Rutgers Law School. "Google has a point that its search results help consumers by allowing them to directly buy the item. But the Commission worries about the effect on rivals. This likely will outweigh the consumer point," he said. Google also rejected a Commission proposal which would let the company charge rivals for displaying their services prominently, with the amount corresponding to its operating cost or a nominal amount based on the lowest reserve price for AdWords which is currently 0.01 euro per click. In the advertising case, the company said it had already scrapped the exclusivity clauses and other provisions identified by the regulator as anti-competitive. The Commission plans to hand down hefty fines to Google if found guilty of breaching EU rules, the charge sheet seen by Reuters showed. The penalty could reach $7.4 billion or 10 percent of the company's global turnover for each case. Walker said Google would respond in the coming days to a third EU charge of using its Android mobile operating system to hinder competitors. The Commission has given it until Nov. 11 to do so.

Google originally introduced Google Home at its I/O Conference in May, and then officially announced it alongside the Pixel Phone at an event in October. The first batch of reviews for Google Home appear to mostly align with a single opinion: the speaker is an impressive addition to the home, but in some ways it's less reliable, and its Google Assistant-powered AI doesn't beat Amazon's Alexa in most instances. As is usual with a new product category gaining entries from various companies, the decision rests solely on personal preference of which company each user believes will deliver the best experience, and iterate most consistently down the line. Images via Engadget That's the way that Wired began its review for Google Home, which it says can sometimes feel "like sci-fi magic," and other times is simply unreliable. The sci-fi magic comes in with Google Assistant, which Wired says provides smart search results for random inquiries (“What’s the difference between acetaminophen and ibuprofen?”), but other times was "shockingly stupid," fumbling movie release date trivia and other questions. Ultimately, Wired found that Google Home was "a lot simpler" and less intuitive than the futuristic advertising Google is generating for the device. The site said that Google Home has great potential, particularly in upcoming features like voice-recognized user profiles, deeper connections with Pixel Phone, and the introduction of more third-party support. For now, it'll depend on user preference for each company -- Google or Amazon -- since the speakers align so closely in most areas. Someday, assuming Google keeps caring about Home, I suspect the device will be more like the ad. It’ll be smart and integrated enough to know that your flight is delayed and change your dinner reservation, to turn on all the lights in your house, to tell you how to get to work, to teach your kids about the world, and all the rest. Right now, it’s simpler than that. Like, a lot simpler. Both devices are excellent, both have bright futures, both are increasingly essential parts of your household. I bought a Home because I like the design, and I like the sound quality. If you buy an Echo because you love your Sonos and don’t trust Google with your data, you’ll be perfectly happy as well. The Verge continued this "rough around the edges" sentiment in its review, liking the way that Google Home could carry on a casual conversation, asking about Abraham Lincoln, in a way that Echo could not. But the device's Google Assistant felt like it's "still in its very early days," with inconsistent responses from a dual-speaker set-up, "fuzzy" speaker quality, and limited single account support. The site has "no doubt it will improve," but early adopters should be aware of the bumpy road ahead. Google Home also "looks a lot better than the Echo," The Verge believed, with a softer white design that meshes better with most home decor than Amazon Echo's tall black cylinder. The interchangeable bottom plates (for $20 extra each) also add to a better overall design that could be a sole selling point for some users who prefer to look at Google Home daily over Echo. To paraphrase Google’s own CEO, Sundar Pichai, artificial intelligence is still in its very early days. And, in my opinion, Google Home shows that. I have no doubt it will improve. But I was surprised that Google Home arrived so rough around the edges, especially when it had an existing competitive product to learn from, and an unmatched wealth of data to draw upon. Like a dominating batter in a tight World Series game, you kind of expect Google to hit a game-winning homer. But it merely hit a double, and the contest is still very much on. One of the biggest categories that Google Home lags behind in out of the gate, according to Engadget, is third-party support. At launch, it can control devices from Nest, Hue, IFTTT, and SmartThings, but Amazon's list stretches far beyond that, now including various "skills" that developers can update on Echo with new commands on a weekly basis. On the other hand, for users who are baked into the Google ecosystem, Engadget said "this might indeed be the home assistant for you." Right now, however, it's little more than a toy. It's fun and occasionally very convenient to ask it questions and have it perform simple tasks, but it's hardly an essential part of my life. But Google Home is worth keeping an eye on -- it will almost certainly be more capable in three months (or even three weeks) than it is now. If you're someone who loves tapping into Google's mighty store of knowledge, don't sleep on Google Home. Just as the Echo got smarter and more valuable over time, I expect the same will happen here. And if you've already bought into Google's ecosystem, this might indeed be the home assistant for you. Wired's advice appears to represent the back-and-forth nature of most Google Home reviews: it's a decent addition into a category that is only increasing in relevance and importance. "There’s only one mistake you can make, really," the site summed up at the end of its review. "Not letting a smart speaker into your home at all. These things are great, and they’re only getting better."

Rating: 7 Votes samcraig 2 weeks ago I not understand, why people need this? for what this is? If I wanted to spend my money on something like that I would rather buy something more useful. Need? No one needs most devices. However, I have had the Echo as an early adopter. The capabilities have grown exponentially. It's actually nice to ask things like the weather and to play music, etc without having to whip out my phone or go to my computer. I have a young daughter that loves to ask it questions. I cook a lot, so setting multiple timers without having to pick up my phone (especially if I'm cooking) is a nice bonus. Everyone has different use cases - maybe an "assistant" doesn't fit any of yours. But I wouldn't dismiss it altogether. These types of devices evolve. Think of the first iPhone (and iOS at release) and how extremely limited it was in comparison to what was already out there.

Right back to the days when the M25 was a little quieter or when the Walkie Talkie building in London wasn’t melting cars. Nostalgia can be a beautiful thing. Google has released a secret Harry Potter game for Android The great news is that there is actually a feature to do this on Google Street View, but many of us simply didn’t realise it was there. All you need to do to travel back in time, is select a sight on Street View, then click on the clock button in the top left corner of the screen. The clock will open up a small window showing all the available historical imagery for that scene – dating all the way back to 2007. The feature, which was launched in April 2014, is perfect for looking back at what your old house looked like or perhaps a park where you used to sit until it got developed into a superstore. Here is what the Olympic Park looked like in 2011 Compared to how it looks today in 2016 The construction of the Shard getting underway in 2008 Versus how the building looks today in 2016 It gives us a glimpse back at the M25 traffic in 2008 And how it isn’t actually busier today in 2016* Jaywick in Essex sees some improvement from 2009 But more fly tipping now And you can see the changing New York landscape from 2011 To the same landscape in 2012 We can also see the devastation effects of natural disasters – and how we rebuild.

Google said Thursday that the EU’s allegations lack evidence and would ultimately harm users in favor “of a small number of websites,” in a blog posting detailing its response to European Commission antitrust objections over its comparison-shopping and AdSense services. “The commission’s revised case still rests on a theory that just doesn’t fit the reality of how most people shop online,” Kent Walker, Google’s senior vice president and general counsel said in the blog post. The EU’s “claims are wrong as a matter of fact, law, and economics.” Google faced four EU antitrust complaints since the Brussels-based regulator opened its first probe into the Mountain View, California-based company in November 2010. In a previous response, Google ridiculed as “peculiar and problematic” a first statement of objections over the way it displays search results. EU Evidence The commission refined its shopping case in July, saying it has “a broad range of additional evidence and data" that the Alphabet Inc. unit systematically favors its own comparison-shopping service in its search results and that smaller rivals lose traffic when they appear lower down in results. “There is simply no meaningful correlation between the evolution of our search services and the performance of price comparison sites,” Walker said in the blog. The Brussels-based commission said it received Google’s responses and will “carefully consider” them “before taking any decision on how to proceed.” Anti-Google campaigners criticized the company’s response. “When consumers look at Google ads they do not get the best, most relevant results. Instead, they get results from advertisers willing to pay Google the most money,” said Thomas Vinje, a lawyer with Clifford Chance who represents FairSearch Europe, whose members include Expedia Inc. and Nokia Oyj. No ‘New Theory’ The extra statement of objections in the shopping case “didn’t offer a new theory, but argued that because sites like Amazon sometimes pay” price comparison aggregators “for referred traffic, they can’t also be considered rivals,” said Walker. Google’s view is that Amazon only gets a small amount of its traffic from such services, “hardly enough to support the idea they don’t compete with price comparison sites,” he said. “The data show that the handful of price comparison sites who’ve filed competition complaints don’t reflect the wider marketplace,” said Walker. Over the past 10 years “a rapidly increasing amount of traffic flowed from our search pages to popular sites like Amazon and eBay as they expanded in Europe, hardly a sign of our ‘favoring’ our own ads.” AdSense Response Walker said Google also sent its response to a separate EU complaint accusing the company of obstructing competition for online ads with its AdSense for Search product, which places advertising on websites, including retailers, telecommunications operators and newspapers. Google has until Nov. 11 to respond to a third charge sheet the EU sent it in April over its Android smartphone software.

If you're looking to buy a voice-controlled speaker there are currently two main choices, but which of the Amazon Echo and the Google Home offers the best sound quality? And which is better at streaming music? Chris Monroe/CNET Amazon Echo vs. Google Home: Which sounds better? 0 Share: Wireless & Bluetooth Speakers by Ty Pendlebury November 3, 2016 7:00 AM PDT @typendlebury Up Next Fantastic Beasts' Dan Fogler sees magic in tech If you're looking to buy a voice-operated speaker how important is sound quality to you? Is it worth buying the new $129 Google Home, or the $179 Amazon Echo, on the strength of sonic performance alone? Amazon Echo has been out in the wild for two years now. We were never thrilled with its sonic abilities -- plenty of similarly priced Bluetooth speakers sound better -- but Echo eventually won us over thanks to its ever-increasing list of compatible products and tasks. Now that the Google Home is here, however, is its self-described "superior sound" enough incentive to pull the trigger on that voice-operated speaker instead? Sure, Amazon may have the jump on Google as far as the number of things Alexa can do -- for now, at least. But the one thing Amazon can't do is meaningfully fix the sound quality. Which is best? We pitched the two speakers against our favorite budget wi-fi speaker, the $199 Sonos Play:1, to see which one you should buy if music is your number one priority. Setting up Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET Both speakers work in the same way: you say the activation phrase and ask for the music you want to play. And both support a number of music services including Spotify, Pandora and their respective proprietary ones (Google Play Music and Amazon Prime Music). In order to level the playing field, we tested each speaker with a Spotify Premium account and sat each of them on top of an AV shelf about six feet (2m) from our listening position. We used the default phrases "OK Google" and "Alexa" to issue commands, and it was here we found the first differentiators. In use, Alexa is much easier to say -- especially if you have to say it repeatedly, such as when turning up the volume. Saying "Ok Google" over and over become an especially leafy word salad after a while. We also played them alongside a Sonos Play:1, which in the absence of voice control right now (though it's coming), which was operated with the Sonos app. Music playback Which one's better? Well, let me put it this way: what's your favorite kind of dental surgery? While neither speaker is outright awful, I wouldn't buy either of them if sound quality was my primary aim. With all of the smarts built into each of them, music performance appears to take a back seat. At best you could say that the Google Home is a "decent" TV speaker while the Amazon is an average one. So, the Google wins right? Well, not exactly. Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET The Google Home's strength is in how natural it sounds. The mid-range is very expressive and is free of the Amazon Echo's sometimes grating edge. It also sounds present, like you're in the same room as the band, not down the hall as the Echo (true to its name) can sound. The Echo's biggest plus is that it can go much louder than the Google Home and do so without distorting. We played the Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds track "Red Right Hand" on each speaker and found that at full volume (or less) the track's deep bass line causes the Home to distort. I've heard that exact same effect on TV speakers -- it's like the bass player has activated a fuzz pedal. Related links Google Home review Sonos music systems adding Alexa voice support in 2017 Amazon Echo review While the Echo doesn't have full sounding bass it also didn't distort in the same way, and was able to go much louder. The Echo also tended not to distort with really "loud" rock music in the way the Home did -- give the Home some Foo Fighters for example and everything but the midrange became mush. The Echo was at least able to resolve music like this with some clarity, especially in the treble. When pushed up against a wall -- such as when used in a kitchen -- the Google was able to make better use of the "boundary effect" to produce more bass. In contrast, the Amazon showed minimal bass improvement when used against a wall. Moving to voice control itself, I found the microphone on the Echo was more sensitive than the Home. Several times, I had to shout at the Google speaker when it was playing music at full volume for it to understand me. This wasn't an issue with the Echo which could get still process my commands at "party conversation" levels. That said, the Echo had real problems with my Australian accent, something the Google Home was unconcerned about. There is a big "but" here, though, is that Google was much better at finding music on Spotify than Amazon (accent notwithstanding). More often than not, Alexa would say "I'm not able to find 'x' in your music library." It happened for songs like the admittedly tricky to say "You Got Yr. Cherry Bomb" as well as the straightforward "Stagger Lee." Google had no such issues there. Comparing both smart speakers to the Sonos Play:1 -- which, admittedly, has no voice control smarts -- was simply no contest: The Sonos sounds like it's playing music, whereas the two voice assistants can only approximate it. It blows both away. Destroys them. It offers deeper bass, an expressive mid-range and articulated highs that the Echo and the Home could only even hint at. How to choose If you want a musical speaker, the choice is simple: get neither. Based on sound quality alone, their weaknesses overcome their strengths. If you crave volume the Echo is the "winner," but if you want some semblance of resolution the Home might be better. However if you want a music speaker get the Sonos, and then maybe control it via Alexa (which will require an Echo or Echo Dot speaker as well) once Sonos adds that promised functionality in 2017. Finally: Great sound.Photo by Sarah Tew/CNET And speaking of the Dot: That $50 entry-level Amazon Echo speaker doesn't even compare to the big Echo or Google Home for audio quality, but it's not supposed to. Instead, it's designed to be paired with a better set of speakers (or stereo system) via its auxiliary output. That's ultimately the best option if you really care about sound quality. But Google has a similar option, too. The Google Home can be used to control a $35 Chromecast Audio, which -- like the Echo Dot -- is designed to be tethered to a better audio system. The Chromecast can sound amazing on a larger high-end system, and you can buy a bunch to set up a multiroom system, too. The bottom line is that neither speaker sounds great out of the box, but you can great great sound from either product family -- once you connect them (or their sibling products) to bigger, better speakers.

Under the leadership of Sameer Samat, who rejoined Google earlier this year after a spell as president of wearable tech firm Jawbone, the company is sharpening Google Play store recommendations with artificial intelligence and expanding support for various payment platforms, among other initiatives. Google's efforts in some way mirror those of arch-rival Apple, which revamped its App Store this year with quicker review times for new apps and an increase in the cut of revenue that goes to developers. Both companies face a chorus of complaints from developers who say they are struggling to stand out in a jam-packed field. Many smartphone users, meanwhile, appear to have tired of downloading apps altogether, especially as messaging services like Snapchat perform more of the functions that once required a separate app. Games remain a focus of the Google Play store, and Nintendo is building a version of its popular Super Mario Run game for Android, said Samat, who leads product management for the Google Play store. The store is also expanding to new platforms, including wearable devices, virtual reality headsets and Google's Chromebook laptops. "What we are excited about is giving developers that single entry point for more and more of the computing ecosystem," said Samat. ANDROID WILD WEST Google has eased the once-complicated process of developing apps for the Play store, said James Knight, a former Google employee who launched Pembroke, a consultancy that helps developers convert Apple-compatible iOS apps to the Android operating system. "The App Store has historically been a little more straightforward, and Android has been a bit more like the Wild West," he said. Mirroring the larger smartphone market, the Google Play store sees far more activity by virtue of its placement on the wide range of devices running the Android operating system - but Apple claims more of the profits. The Google Play store accounted for 70 percent of app downloads in the third quarter of this year, but Apple's App Store logged 65 percent of the revenue, according to App Annie, a mobile analytics firm. A big part of Google's new effort involves emerging markets, where Android is stronger relative to the iPhone. The company has steadily expanded its support of direct carrier billing, a popular payment method in emerging markets where consumers often do not have credit cards. Google now offers the payment method in 47 markets. To improve app recommendations for users, the Play store has also made extensive use of machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that gleans insights from vast troves of data. Google's Play store and machine learning teams began collaborating three years ago, and a partnership was struck last year with Google Brain, a cutting-edge research project. The jolt of artificial intelligence is welcome as developers hunt for an audience for their apps, said Greg Cohn, chief executive of Burner, which makes an app that provides temporary phone numbers. "The harsh reality is that there are a few apps that get the vast majority of people's time and attention," he said.

The fresh claims from the European Union involve the search firm's online shopping and advertising services. But Google has fought back, claiming the EU does not understand the legal and economic basis of the claims. 'Ultimately, we can't agree with a case that lacks evidence and would limit our ability to serve our users, just to satisfy the interests of a small number of websites,' it said. Scroll down for video  EU commissioners have accused Google of boosting its own online shopping services in search results to choke out competition Google filed objections against beefed up charges made by the European Commission's competition chief Margrethe Vestager over online shopping, and fresh charges over its advertising services. But the web giant has hit back against the claims. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Welcome Home: Watch Google's $130 smart speaker take on...

Share this article Share Writing in a blog post, senior vice president and general counsel of Google, Kent Walker, said the shopping case 'still rests on a theory that just doesn't fit the reality of how most people shop online.' 'We believe these claims are wrong as a matter of fact, law, and economics,' Walker said. The European Commission said it 'will carefully consider Google's response before taking any decision on how to proceed and cannot at this stage prejudge the final outcome of the investigation.' Pictured is President of the European Commission Jean-Claude Juncker WHY IS GOOGLE IN TROUBLE WITH THE EU?  The claims around Google stem from anti-competition law. Brussels has taken issue with the Internet search giant over its online shopping and advertising services.   The European Commission has argued on three separate anti-trust points. Online shopping: The issues surrounds Google's shopping search results, which commissioners claim push its products over other competitors. AdSense: Google uses this service to place targeted adverts on other sites using its search bar, generating revenue. Android OS: The third of the anti-trust cases brought against Google surrounds the use of its Android operating system, which the case complains acts as a 'Trojan horse' to push its products and services. The stakes are huge, with Google potentially facing a fine of billions of pounds if it is found to be at fault.  The EU now has three cases on the go against Google, one of a series of US companies targeted by Vestager in a campaign that has raised hackles on the other side of the Atlantic. The biggest and most recent case involves Google's Android mobile phone operating system, a serious challenge to one of the company's most strategic businesses with smartphones fast taking from over traditional PCs. Google is expected to respond to the Android case next week. The second and oldest case involves Google's alleged abuse of the dominance of its search engine for online shopping. It was officially lodged in 2015, and then this July Vestager strengthened the case, to which Google is now responding. Brussels accuses Google of giving its own online shopping services top priority in search results to the detriment of other price comparison services. Thirdly the EU accuses Google of abusing its market power in the placement of search advertising on third-party websites. That case concerns Google's AdSense service where websites can install a customised search engine on their site which generates revenue from having relevant ads appear on the search results page.  The European Commission, confirming it had received the response to the shopping and Adsense cases, said it 'will carefully consider Google's response before taking any decision on how to proceed and cannot at this stage prejudge the final outcome of the investigation.' In its counterclaims, Google has drawn attention to the Commission's exclusion of other giants in the field, including Amazon. Google said it, and others, were chasing Amazon, which it called 'by far the largest player in the field' The legal onslaught against Google came after a long period in which the two sides tried unsuccessfully to settle the case amicably. Instead, the cases have raised tensions between the Brussels and Washington, which has accused the EU of unfairly targeting US giants. Other EU investigations include cases against Starbucks, Amazon and McDonald's. The European Commission, which polices EU competition policy, launched an initial investigation into Google in 2010 following complaints from rivals such as Microsoft and Trip Advisor that it favoured its own services when customers ran searches. 'We believe it is the European Commission that has the interests of consumers in mind, not a private company that makes money by using its market power to charge high prices to advertisers,' said Thomas Vinje, legal counsel to FairSearch, a group that represents many of the complainants in the case. Vestager's predecessor, Joaquin Almunia, made three attempts to resolve the dispute but in each case intense pressure by national governments, rivals and privacy advocates scuppered the effort. Since that time, attitudes in Europe towards Google have deteriorated after revelations by former NSA contractor Edward Snowden that Silicon Valley giants had provided troves of personal data to US intelligence.

Google's efforts in some way mirror those of arch-rival Apple, which revamped its App Store this year with quicker review times for new apps and an increase in the cut of revenue that goes to developers. Alphabet Inc's Google is revamping the Google Play Store to help developers build their businesses as concerns mount that the app economy has reached saturation. This overhauls includes Google Play store recommendations with artificial intelligence and support for various payment platforms WHAT IS THE OVERHAUL?  The Google Play store overhaul will focus on helping developers build their business. It includes recommendations with artificial intelligence and support for various payment platforms.  The store is also expanding to new platforms, including wearable devices, virtual reality headsets and Google's Chromebook laptops.  Both Google and Apple have faced a chorus of complaints from developers who say they are struggling to stand out in a jam-packed field. Many smartphone users, meanwhile, appear to have tired of downloading apps altogether, especially as messaging services like Snapchat perform more of the functions that once required a separate app. Games remain a focus of the Google Play store, and Nintendo Co Ltd is building a version of its popular Super Mario Run game for Android, said Sameer Samat, who leads product management for the Google Play store. The store is also expanding to new platforms, including wearable devices, virtual reality headsets and Google's Chromebook laptops.

Share this article Share 14 shares 'What we are excited about is giving developers that single entry point for more and more of the computing ecosystem,' said Samat. Google has eased the once-complicated process of developing apps for the Play store, said James Knight, a former Google employee who launched Pembroke, a consultancy that helps developers convert Apple-compatible iOS apps to the Android operating system. 'The App Store has historically been a little more straightforward, and Android has been a bit more like the Wild West,' he said. To improve app recommendations for users, the Play store has also made extensive use of machine learning. The store is also expanding to new platforms, including wearable devices, virtual reality headsets and Google's Chromebook laptops. Mirroring the larger smartphone market, the Google Play store sees far more activity by virtue of its placement on the wide range of devices running the Android operating system - but Apple claims more of the profits. The Google Play store accounted for 70 percent of app downloads in the third quarter of this year, but Apple's App Store logged 65 percent of the revenue, according to App Annie, a mobile analytics firm. A big part of Google's new effort involves emerging markets, where Android is stronger relative to the iPhone.  The company has steadily expanded its support of direct carrier billing, a popular payment method in emerging markets where consumers often do not have credit cards.  A big part of Google's new effort involves emerging markets, where Android is stronger relative to the iPhone.  The company has steadily expanded its support of direct carrier billing and now offers the payment method in 47 markets Google now offers the payment method in 47 markets. To improve app recommendations for users, the Play store has also made extensive use of machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that gleans insights from vast troves of data.  Google's Play store and machine learning teams began collaborating three years ago, and a partnership was struck last year with Google Brain, a cutting-edge research project. The jolt of artificial intelligence is welcome as developers hunt for an audience for their apps, said Greg Cohn, chief executive of Burner, which makes an app that provides temporary phone numbers. 'The harsh reality is that there are a few apps that get the vast majority of people's time and attention,' he said.

Close share panel × Image copyright Google Image caption Price comparison site rivals have complained about the priority Google gives to its own shopping service Google has again rejected the EU's objections to how it displays shopping links in its search results. It said the investigation following complaints from price comparison websites had failed to understand the "reality" of online shopping. It blamed a drop in traffic for price comparison sites on Amazon and others. Europe's competition commissioner first accused the firm of abusing its dominance in search in April 2015 and made further claims in July 2016. Prominence Google's shopping results appear as a box of images and links displayed alongside other search results. In 2015, the EU competition commissioner claimed these results gave prominence to Google's own services and advertisements, to the detriment of price comparison websites, which may have lost visitors. Google responded that the EU had failed to take into account the significance of online shopping giants such as Amazon, which it said also competed against price comparison websites. In its updated claim, the EU said Amazon could not be considered a rival to price comparison websites because it sometimes paid such sites to be included in search results. Google's latest response says websites such as Amazon get a "tiny fraction" of their visitors from price comparison websites, "hardly enough to support the idea that they don't compete" with one another. It also pointed out that Amazon provides its own price comparison tools for its customers. "The commission's revised case still rests on a theory that just doesn't fit the reality of how most people shop online," the company said in a blog. "It's not surprising that when Amazon and other new competitors arrived in European countries, traffic to sites offering only price comparison went down." The company said it would "look forward" to continuing discussions with the commission. FairSearch Europe - a lobby group that was one of the complainants against Google - said Google's actions were "anti-consumer". In a statement, the group said: "We believe it is the European Commission that has the interests of consumers in mind, not a private company that makes money by using its market power to charge high prices to advertisers. "When consumers look at Google ads they do not get the best, most relevant results. Instead, they get results from advertisers willing to pay Google the most money."

Photograph: Dado Ruvic/REUTERS Samuel Gibbs Thursday 3 November 2016 11.29 EDT Last modified on Thursday 3 November 2016 11.30 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Google has responded to the European commission’s (EC) renewed statement of objections, declaring its case against Google Shopping to be “wrong on the facts, the law, and the economics” and dismissing it as just “the interests of a small number of websites”. The seven-year case revolves around the charge that the market dominance of Google within search is being used to leverage its price comparison service to the detriment of third-party sites. Within its second 100-page response to the EC, Google said that its Shopping service, which appears as a tab within search results and within adverts at the top of the page, was simply the result of its push to present users with useful information and direct answers to questions. It also said that the exclusion of retailers such as Amazon and eBay from the case was wrong, as they compete with price comparison sites also, despite paying for referral traffic. Kent Walker, Google’s senior vice president and general counsel, said: “Consumers don’t just look for products on a search engine, then click on a price comparison site, and then click again to visit merchant sites. They reach merchant websites in many different ways: via general search engines, specialist search services, merchant platforms, social-media sites, and online ads served by various companies. “And of course merchants are reaching consumers directly like never before. On the mobile web – and more than half of Europe’s Internet traffic is mobile these days – dedicated apps are the most common way for consumers to shop.” Adjoining the EC’s updated charges, European competition commissioner, Margrethe Vestager, said the commission’s preliminary investigation into Google Shopping revealed that Google had “unduly favoured its own comparison shopping service in its general search result pages”, meaning that “consumers may not see the most relevant results to their search queries”. A Google spokesperson said: “We remain confident that these claims lack evidence and are wrong on the facts, the law, and the economics. The surest signs of dynamic competition in any market are low prices, abundant choices, and constant innovation — and that’s a great description of shopping on the internet today.” Google also responded to the charges made against its advertising services, Adsense for Search, which places contextual, text-based ads near and around search results. A Google spokesperson said: “Our text ads help websites generate income and have always faced strong competition from other ad formats, so we disagree with the Commission’s assessment. Nevertheless, even before the Statement of Objections was filed, we changed practices the Commission takes issue with, so we hope to resolve this case quickly.” The EC originally filed charges in April 2015, receiving a response from Google later that year. New, reinforcing charges in the Google Shopping case were then filed by the EC in July this year, which also included charges against Adsense. Google is also facing antitrust charges against its Android mobile operating system, which runs on the majority of smartphones globally. It has until 11 November to respond in the Android case, but faces fines of up to 10% of its global turnover.

It launched officially in January 2014 as snippet knowledge graphs and it looked like this: It came up a ton for Wikipedia results in Google but also for other sites. It often cited data from within Wikipedia or other data sources in Google's knowledge graph. But as of yesterday, it seems to have gone away. RankRanger posted about the drop this morning saying Google features tracking tool spotted the drop. Here is a screen shot of the tool showing the full decline in this feature showing up in Google's search results: I am not sure if this is a bug or if Google decided to remove this feature. I have asked and hope to let you all know. Forum discussion at Twitter.

It basically goes on to say that the Google PR pitch that Google has over 200 ranking signals has not changed for like ten years and by now, it is probably well over 200. The moderator of the forum wrote: The whole idea of 200 factors that Google checks a site for is quaint, like Jell-O . A checklist of things you have to do right is convenient but that's not how search engines work. The 200 ranking factors has been with us since about a year or two after Google was out of diapers. There have literally been thousands of changes to the Google algorithm. Do you still believe there are 200 ranking factors? So then I spot John Mueller of Google posting a message on Twitter yesterday about the thread calling it an "interesting discussion." I think it is him mocking the thread and implying webmasters should not focus on the checklist of ranking signals but rather make a "quality web site" that "users love" and is better than the competitors. Just last year Google reiterated the 200 number and stuck with it. Either way, it is a fun thread to read through if you have time. Of course, going through a check list of ranking signals and applying them to your web site might not be the best use of your time. Forum discussion at WebmasterWorld. Prev Story Next story Tweet This Previous story: Google: Crawl Requests Doesn't Hurt Rankings; Faster Crawl Doesn't Improve Rankings   Comments: Anon User 11/03/2016 01:47 pm The problem with google is that it is not smart enough to identify what a good site actually is on it's own. Google needs the site to already have traction from somewhere other than google itself to start learning about why it is good. And then the issue isn't that you need to build an amazing site it is you need to build an amazing site and get people to talk about it and engage with it. So your task as with any business is to generate some buzz outside of google to gain googles attention. Google is not capable of understanding anything really that us humans just take for granted. Google is actually a pretty dumb black box that needs to be fed loads of data from places around the web. So this brings me to the pathetic advice google always spins about building a great website. A great website without people knowing about it is only a great website in your mind. Google need to amend their advice so people understand that there is no such thing in googles awareness that says you can build a great site and people will come. Lets dispel this pathetic myth peddled by google dreamers and make people aware of what you really need to do to make a site successful ...great or not so great. BushyTop 11/03/2016 02:10 pm Good for him to keep mocking..... NAAAAAT! Alpha Male in a Beta World 11/03/2016 02:43 pm 200million in revenue and 110 million in organic search and I can tell you this... if you have a fairly popular website and write a 10X article on a subject you will be in the top 10 results within a month IF THERE IS NO COMPETITION for that subject matter. If there is competition for that subject matter you won't rank well unless that specific article as links to it. Google claims they want new content - but older crappy content with a crap site design and poor coding will beat you and keep beating you unless you have links to that content. Built a robust definition list and 4 other excellently rated articles that beats all the competition but a few, but still on the 2nd and 3rd page even with some links to the article. Every metric you can point to - we beat those other guys. I wrote a 10X article that has over 110 4+ rating and it still never comes up on the first page. If I showed you the crap that's beating that article, it goes against everything Google states is important. Took a 4 separate page How-To Guide and made it one page with just about the same amount of images as the competition, better info, faster page load, well formatted (highly readable) and perfectly coded - moved up 12 spots from 48 to about 36. At least 20 of the sites that beat this article are Shiat! Just saying... without direct links, the site reputation alone does nothing. In fact, I posted the same article on my personal site as the company site and my personal site did better... with zero credibility for my site and unrelated to the article subject matter. Mambo Man 11/03/2016 04:35 pm It's true, there are (at least) 200 factors. RyanMJones 11/03/2016 06:31 pm The "great website" thing is because people will share and talk about and recommend great websites. They don't do that with mediocre websites. I would argue that if people aren't sharing it or talking about it, it's not really a great website is it? Anon User 11/03/2016 10:12 pm I would argue that people need to be able to find it to see it is a great website. Last I looked it was not possible for websites to telepathically reach out to the world and proclaim their greatness so no idea at all actually what your point is in relation to the comment above. Sanjeev 11/04/2016 06:27 am Well said "webmasters should not focus on the checklist of ranking signals but rather make a "quality web site" that "users love" and is better than the competitors" d 11/04/2016 11:21 am Just to reiterate, if you follow google guidlines you will never rank or make money. END OF DarrinJWard 11/04/2016 12:29 pm Well, if a business model relies exclusively on Google organic in order to make money then it is not much of a business model. Of course it's possible to make money by following the guidelines. Perhaps not if the business model is weak content and AdSense / ad revenue. The site/service needs to be something unique and have some marginal utility in order to be competitive in today's markets. NickAtHisDesk 11/04/2016 04:10 pm Didn't our "favorite" Google Insider (JM) say that they don't look at/use any sort of "site authority"? As you say, it's all about the links (internal/external) Gary narcissist 11/05/2016 12:24 am One persons great is another persons grate Reality is that google is full of stale rankings As anonymous said all that talk about make a great website is by and large, bollocks.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple Google Home Review Roundup: Does it Beat Amazon Echo? Michael Andronico Associate Editor Tech Media Network (Tom's Guide)November 3, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share Google's bid to take over your connected home has finally arrived. Google Home, a $129 smart speaker that serves as a competitor to the Amazon Echo, can play you music, control your Chromecast and even toggle your home lights via Google Assistant. But according to early reviews, the Home, while impressive, is missing a few key features that could make it the true smart home accessory of the future. We'll have our full review up soon, but in the meantime, here's what other critics are saying. Google Home: Review Scorecard The Verge Engadget Gizmodo CNET Time Score 8/10 7.9/10 N/A 7.9/10 7/10 The Verge (8/10) The Verge's Dan Siefert had largely positive things to say about the Home, which he says functions much like Amazon's Echo but benefits from Google's deeper knowledge base. Siefert was a fan of the Home's design and overall sound quality, but noted that the speaker isn't quite as smart as he'd like it to be. The Good "Google smartly designed the Home to blend in with the rest of the mundane products in your home. It’s roughly half as tall as the Echo and arguably much nicer to look at." "It has surprisingly loud output and, in my experience, had no trouble filling the various rooms in my house with sound." The Bad "It needs to be a lot smarter; it needs to know a lot more about me, my family, and our habits; and it needs to be more proactive with its assistance." "The Home's touch-based volume controls are not as easy to use as the Echo’s physical ring." MORE: Best and Worst Bluetooth Speakers Under $40 Engadget (7.9/10) Nathan Ingraham of Engadget also labeled the Home as an ambitious product that hasn't realized its potential just yet. The reviewer praised Google Assistant's conversational abilities and Chromecast integration, but wasn't big on its speaker quality or lack of third-party app support. The Good "The list of things you can ask the Google Assistant is limited only by your imagination, and that's one of Home's biggest strengths." "I'm already dreaming of setting up a few pairs of nice speakers with Chromecast Audio and having a multi-room, voice-connected music system." The Bad "The speaker isn't stereo and lacks much of a low end, despite the two passive 'radiators' meant to increase bass performance." "Asking it to play TV shows from Netflix, Hulu or even Google Play videos doesn't work yet. Google says support for third-party Cast apps is coming at some point, but for now it's far more limited than I had hoped." MORE: Best Tech Gifts For the Holidays Gizmodo (No Score) Read More Gizmodo's Alex Cranz went as far as to say the Home "obliterates" the Amazon Echo, but like her peers, noted that Google's smart speaker still has some work to do. Cranz noted that Home both sounds and listens better than the Echo, but said that it's still missing a few game-changing AI features. The Good "Music sounds richer coming out of the four speakers at its base than out of the two crammed into the tall tube of the Echo. There’s a distinct thump of bass and vocals are crisp compared to the Echo." "When I ask something of the Google Home that is in its realm of capabilities, it never stumbles. It’s easy to adjust the lights in my basement without modulating my voice and uttering every syllable like a robot." The Bad "Google Home, like every robot sidekick you’ve seen in a sci-fi movie, is incredibly literal. It can do amazing things if you know how to ask the right question, but it exaggerates your every failure reminding you that the Skynet apocalypse is still a vague point far in humanity’s future." "It’s worth noting that everything that makes Google Home great will also creep the hell out of people." CNET (7.9/10) While Gizmodo called Google Home an Echo killer, CNET's Andrew Gebhart felt the opposite. While Gebhart praised Google Home's Assistant as a whole, he lamented its lack of support for multiple family members, and called it less versatile than Amazon's Echo. The Good "After downloading the Google Home app, I was up and running with the speaker in minutes, and initially enthralled with how much it could do." "Just like the Amazon Echo before it, Home's a worthy smart home simplifier -- and more forgiving if you flub the exact name of a device than Alexa." The Bad "Google Home's not there yet. It'll hold a conversation, but only a primitive one. It integrates with Google services, but just a couple for now. It works well with the smart home, but only with four platforms." "Right now, Home can only pull up YouTube videos on your Chromecast video streamer — no Netflix, Hulu, or HBO Go — though Google's promised voice casting for Netflix soon." Time (3.5/5) Lisa Eadicicco at Time had similar things to say about the Home, calling it a "promising first try" that doesn't quite top the Amazon Echo. Eadicicco gave the Home props for its customizable design and clear AI answers, but criticized its lack of support for major smart home devices and third-party apps. The Good "With its wider base and slightly sloped top, the Home looks like an air freshener or vase, helping it blend in more seamlessly than Amazon’s tall and narrow Echo." "Google’s expertise in areas like search, transportation, and translation clearly help make Home better at answering questions related to those topics." The Bad "Amazon’s Echo can do a wider variety of tasks. That’s because it’s compatible with a broader array of smart home devices and has its own catalog of apps, which Amazon calls 'skills."

SUBSCRIBE How Google Home turns voice answers into clickable links It turns out Google's new hands-free voice-based assistant has a way to let users click to the answers it gets from publishers. That's via the companion app. Danny Sullivan on November 3, 2016 at 9:00 am More Think of the new Google Home assistant as a voice-only search engine. You ask it questions by voice; it gives back answers by voice. If you’re a search marketer, that immediately raises a big concern: How do I get traffic and visitors from this thing, if they can’t click to me? Turns out, they can. The key is the Google Home companion app for iOS or Android. For certain questions, especially those that are drawn from web-based sources rather than Google’s Knowledge Graph facts database or Wikipedia, Google Home will give a voice answer and send a link to the source of that answer to the companion app. “Related to your activity” cards Here’s an example of this in action. I asked Google Home for a mince pie recipe, and it responded with a voice answer: Someone probably can’t remember everything in a recipe delivered by voice, so Google Home smartly sends a link to the recipe to the Google Home app, for reference: Clicking on the “Visit Website” words does exactly what you think, takes someone to the source site. Enjoy those mince pies! It’s easy to scroll through all the links that have been sent by sliding through the cards presented in a carousel format, under the “Related to your activity” heading. Currently, I have 14 cards with links showing, based on recent Google Home searches that I’ve done. Links from these cards open within your default browser, in my testing. “Google — My Activity” search history I’m still testing, but it seems that over time, some of the links may disappear from the carousel. That leads to the second place where they are stored, as part of the “Google — My Activity” area in the app. You reach this by clicking on the clock icon that’s just above the “Related to your activity” heading. The “My Activity” areas lists every search you’ve sent to Google. If it has come up with an answer from across the web — a featured snippet answer — then a link will also be shown along with the query that was made:   Links from this area, unlike with the activity cards, will load within the Google Home app. How you can optimize for Google Home If you like the idea of being an answer in Google Home, the solution is pretty easy. Become a featured snippet for queries you care about. And to do that, have a good read through Eric Enge’s past article here on Search Engine Land, How To Get Featured Snippets For Your Site. Can you measure your Google Home traffic? If Google wants, it could certainly report through Google Search Console how often a site is showing up in response to Google Home searches, as well as how often clicks are actually happening. SEOs would be keenly interested in this data. Right now, that’s not happening. It’s something that Google has said it is discussing about voice search generally. I certainly hope Google makes a real and fast effort to provide Google Home-related metrics to publishers. The product is very nice. See my review of it today: For answering questions, Google Home bests Amazon Echo & Alexa. But unlike traditional search engines, it upsets the unofficial contract with publishers where Google takes answers in return for traffic. As it turns out, the links within the Google Home app do promise to deliver some traffic. But Google should be transparent with publishers to know exactly what that is in relation to how often they are showing up, so publishers themselves can assess if they feel they’re getting a fair exchange.

(NASDAQ:GOOGL) subsidiary Google has always been very active on talks about virtual reality. With the introduction of Google’s viewer hardware, the Daydream View headset, things seem to be becoming even more promising for the virtual reality world. Google announced its massive plan to move forward in entertainment tech at its 2016 Google I/O developer conference with the introduction of Daydream, the new VR platform for Android devices – built on Android – supporting the company’s viewer hardware, the Daydream View headset. Daydream basically makes access to VR content on a mobile device simpler. Smartphone manufacturers must meet the criteria of an optimal specification list in order to be labelled Daydream-ready. Other manufacturers can also build their own designs as long as the designs meet the company’s criteria. The all-in-one hotbed for VR contents, Daydream Home, is your one-stop-shop where viewers can view videos or can start virtual reality apps while wearing the headset. Presently, VR content remains fragmented. Available at different places, it is accessible from only a single central location. Daydream is designed to counter this at least for Android device owners for now. It plans to house content from all VR developers, no matter how big and small. Announced at the Google I/O developer conference in June 2014, Google Cardboard is an easy and fun device to use in order to experience the VR flavor firsthand. The comfortable VR device is hardly high-tech at all. On the other hand, however, Daydream View headset is even more comfortable and practical in its approach. Android smartphones and headsets meeting Daydream’s minimum specifications must also meet optimal settings in order to be declared Daydream-ready. Smartphone manufacturers are yet to announce devices meeting criteria of Daydream-ready. However, the Mountain View-based company’s Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL are compatible all thanks to the Qualcomm-powered Snapdragon 821 processor. List of other smartphone manufacturers committed to release of Daydream-ready phones includes HTC, Xiaomi, LG, Huawei, Asus, ZTE, Alcatel, and last but not the least, Samsung. These manufacturers are likely to get their own headsets manufactured soon, but no such announcements have been made yet. Along with the Daydream View headset, there’s also a remote controller with it, coming with Google device. Designed by Google, the controller enables users to interact with apps without the need to tap the side of the headset, which is not the case with Samsung’s current Gear VR. It is yet to be determined which apps would be compatible with Daydream. Numerous third-party apps are yet to make such announcements, but Google has confirmed that content to YouTube would be available for viewers, and same would be the case with Google Photos and Google Play Movies. With plenty of awesome games on the list, it is also expected that HBO Go, Netflix, and Hulu would be on the list too. The company in collaboration with Warner Bros. revealed an app based on JK Rowling’s Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them would come soon. With its arrival comes the new spell feature from Google, and you can read all about it here. The Daydream View headset and remote controller are available for pre-order now on Google’s online store. Shipping for the headset will start from November 10 in the US and UK and other countries, coming with a price tag of $79 in the US, and £69 in the UK. The headset would be available in slate grey color at retailers such as Google’s online store, Carphone warehouse, and EE. Two other color options would become available at a later date, including crimson and lighter grey. Google is truly working harder to mark its mark in the VR world. We expect the influence would be welcomed from all consumers around the world. What are your thoughts on Google’s Daydream View headset? Are you excited about its release?

Tyler Lizenby/CNET The complete list of Google Home commands so far 0 Share: Smart Home by David Priest November 3, 2016 7:00 AM PDT @david_p_priest Up Next Fantastic Beasts' Dan Fogler sees magic in tech Over the past year, the Amazon Echo has taken the world of smart home tech by storm. In November, Google finally released its long-awaited competitor. The Google Home is a $130 smart home speaker that showcases the artificially intelligent, voice-activated Google Assistant. This clever bit of software lets you set timers, control lights and thermostats, play trivia games, watch YouTube videos and more -- all with simple voice commands. The Home's roster of supported integrations will likely grow over time, as will its list of native commands. And compared to what you'll get with Amazon's Alexa, Google's commands are a little more flexible, so you typically don't have to search for the perfect phrasing. Google hasn't released a full list of commands for Home, so we had to do our best to assemble and test everything we could think of. If we're missing anything, make sure to leave it in a comment so we can update the list as we go. Here's the (almost) complete list of voice commands for the Google Home so far. 18 Here's everything the Google Home can do Summoning the Google Assistant You can begin a conversation with the Google Home by simply saying, "OK Google," or "Hey Google." Summoning the Google Assistant on your phone works the same way, but your account will know to only respond on one of the devices, even if both hear you. Conversational commands The Google Home allows you to ask lines of questions that are connected. For instance you could say, "Hey Google, play 'Lose Yourself to Dance.'" Then, "OK Google, what album is this from?" Then, "Hey Google, play that album." Even though you aren't using the name of the album, Google Assistant understands the context and supplies the answer. Basic commands Ask for help: "OK Google, help." Control the volume: "OK Google, turn it up" or, "Louder" or, "Turn it to 11." (Yes, the max is 11.) Halt an action: "OK Google, stop" or, "Pause" or, "Be quiet." Tools Roll a die: "OK Google, roll a die" or, "OK Google, roll a 12-sided die." Flip a coin: "OK Google, flip a coin." Math: "OK Google, what's 354 times 11?" Measurements: "OK Google, how many liters are in 4 gallons." Time: "OK Google, what time is it?" Location: "OK Google, where am I?" Translations: "OK Google, how do you say [word] in [language]?" International time: "OK Google, what time is it in [city]?" Currency conversion: "OK Google, how much is 100 Euros in dollars?" Alarm: "OK Google, set an alarm for [time]." Snooze alarm: "OK Google, snooze alarm." Cancel alarm: "OK Google, cancel my alarm for [time]." Timer: "OK Google, set a timer for [time]." Check timer: "OK Google, how much time is left on my timer?" Recipes: "OK Google, how do I make [dish]" Add to shopping list: "OK Google, add [item] to my shopping list." Check shopping list: "OK Google, what's on my shopping list?" Daily briefing: "OK Google, good morning." (includes personalized greeting, info on weather, traffic, and curated news stories) Uber: "OK Google, order an Uber." 9 7 ways Google Home outsmarts Alexa Search Stocks: "OK Google, how are Alphabet's stocks doing?" Weather: "OK Google, how's the weather today?" or, "Do I need an umbrella today?" Traffic: "OK Google, what's the traffic like on the way to work?" Words: "OK Google, what does [word] mean?" Spelling: "OK Google, spell [word]." Special events: "OK Google, when is [event]?" (Easter, for example) People: "OK Google, who is [person]?" Facts: "OK Google, how tall is [person]?" Things: "OK Google, what is [thing]?" Places: "OK Google, what country is [location] in?" Animal sounds: "OK Google, what does [animal] sound like?" Distance: "OK Google, how far is [business name] from here?" Restaurants: "OK Google, what are the nearest restaurants to me?" Businesses: "OK Google, are there any [business type] around here?" Business information: "OK Google, how late is [business] open?" or "Is [business] open now?" Quotes: "OK Google, give me a quote" or, "Give me a love quote." Medical information: "OK Google, what is a torn meniscus?" Calories: "OK Google, how many calories are in [food item]?" Authors: "OK Google, who wrote [book title]?" Inventors: "OK Google, who invented [item]?" Media Play music: "OK Google, play some music" or, "Play some [genre] music." Play an artist or song: "OK Google, play [artist]" or, "Play [song]." Play a song by lyrics: "OK Google, play the song that goes, 'Is this the real life?'" Play a Google Play playlist or album: "OK Google, play some indie music" or, "OK Google, play [album]." Ask what's playing: "OK Google, what song is this?" or, "OK Google, what album is this?" Get more information: "OK Google, when did this album come out?" Fast forward and rewind: "OK Google, skip forward 2 minutes" or, "Skip backward 30 seconds." Play music through other speakers using Chromecast: "OK Google, cast [song] onto [speaker name]." Play music on Spotify: "OK Google, play [artist] on Spotify." Play music on Pandora: "OK Google, play [artist] on Pandora." Like or dislike a song on Pandora: "OK Google, dislike this song." Play music on YouTube Music: "OK Google, play [artist] on YouTube." Play stations on TuneIn: "OK Google, play [station] on TuneIn." Play videos on YouTube using Chromecast: "OK Google, play [video] on the [TV name]." Pull up lists on YouTube: "OK Google, let's look at what's trending on YouTube on [TV name]." Entertainment Sports updates: "OK Google, who is [team] playing next?" or "Did the [team] win last night?" Sports scores: "OK Google, what was the score for the last [team] game?" Team information: "OK Google, tell me about [team]." Movies: "OK Google, what movies came out last Friday?" Casting for movies: "OK Google, what actors are in [movie]?" Shows by network: "Hey Google, what shows are on [network]?" News: "OK Google, what's today's news?" Smart home Google works with only a few smart home devices/platforms at present: Philips Hue, Nest, SmartThings, Chromecast and IFTTT. The roster of integrations will likely expand as time goes on. Even with these limited integrations, though, the flexibility of SmartThings and especially IFTTT allow the Google Home to control a wide variety of gadgets using 3rd-party triggers. For now, here are the built-in Google Home commands for smart home gadgets. Turn Philips Hue lights on/off: "OK Google, turn on/off my lights." Dim Hue lights: "OK Google, dim my lights to fifty percent." Change Hue colors: "OK Google, turn my lights [color]." Control Nest thermostat: "OK Google, turn the temperature to [temp]." Make incremental changes: "OK Google, raise the temperature 1 degree." Customize trigger phrases for IFTTT. For example: "OK Google, let's get this party started." Easter eggs "Hey Google, always be closing." "Hey Google, what is your quest?" "Hey Google, I am your father." "Hey Google, set phasers to kill." "Hey Google, are you SkyNet?" "Hey Google, make me a sandwich." "Hey Google, up up down down left right left right B A Start." "Hey Google, do a barrel roll." "Hey Google, it's my birthday." "Hey Google, it's not my birthday." "Hey Google, did you fart?"

The response marks the latest salvo in a long-running battle between Google and Brussels, which could ultimately result in a fine worth billions. On Thursday, the company issued formal responses to two objections from the European Commission. The Commission accuses Google of exploiting the popularity of its search engine to promote its price comparison shopping service, at the expense of similar websites, as well as pushing its advertising services. Google argued that the existence of shopping websites such as eBay and Amazon mean that it does not dominate the world of online shopping, saying the EU's case "lacks evidence" and that changing its price comparison features would "limit our ability to serve our users just to satisfy the interests of a small number of websites". It argued that it has already made changes to AdSense, the technology that places Google’s search-based adverts on other websites, that should satisfy the EU. The company plans to respond to a third charge, that it abuses the dominance of its mobile operating system Android, next week. Margrethe Vestager, the EU competition commissioner Credit: EPA Google has been fighting a six-year battle with Brussels over accusations of monopoly abuse. It had hoped to reach a truce years ago but the situation has become increasingly adversarial since Danish politician Margrethe Vestager was made the European Union’s competition commissioner two years ago. Ms Vestager has issued separate “statements of objection” related to online shopping, AdSense and Android since last year. EU competition law forbids a company that enjoys dominance of one market from using that to gain an advantage in another, and companies can be fined up to 10pc of their global revenues if they are found to be in breach. This could mean a penalty of up to $7.5bn (£6bn) in Google’s case. The history of Google Play! 02:31 Google first responded to the shopping charge a year ago but has been forced to issue a second rebuttal after the European Commission raised fresh concerns in the summer. “We remain confident that these claims lack evidence and are wrong on the facts, the law, and the economics,” a spokesman said. “The surest signs of dynamic competition in any market are low prices, abundant choices, and constant innovation — and that’s a great description of shopping on the internet today.” On AdSense, it said: “We changed practices the Commission takes issue with, so we hope to resolve this case quickly.” The company has a deadline of next Friday to respond to charges related to Android. After that, the Commission can decide to alter its objections, accept Google’s argument, reach a settlement or fine the company.  Follow Telegraph Science & Tech READ MORE ABOUT: Android Internet Google European Union Show more Technology latest 15 Nov 2016, 12:01am Bad battery life?

(AP Photo/Eric Risberg) .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... .......... ..........NEW YORK — Google’s new smart speaker is at once a secretary, a librarian and a radio. Ask about your day, and the Home speaker will give you the time, weather, estimated commute, the news and upcoming calendar appointments. It will convert miles into feet, and dollars into euros. Want to hear Adele or Coldplay? Home will fetch you some tunes. If this sounds familiar, it’s because Amazon has already been at it for about two years. Its Echo speaker can do what Home does and more, thanks to Amazon’s head start in partnering with third-party services such as Domino’s Pizza and Fitbit. But Home is smarter in a few other ways, as it taps what it knows about you from Gmail, Maps and other Google services. Home is also $50 cheaper, at about $130 (though Amazon offers a mini “Echo Dot” version for just $50). ___ Advertisement Continue reading AT YOUR COMMAND Think of both Home and Echo as extensions of your iPhone or Android device. Sure, I can check weather on the phone, but why not just ask the speaker as I’m getting dressed? And no need to lift a finger to check the calendar. With guests over, I can resolve trivia disputes using voice searches and avoid screens. This week, I was able to keep tabs on the Chicago Cubs’ quest to break a century-long World Series drought. Both devices work as alarm clocks or timers — great in the kitchen. Both can control lights, thermostats and other internet-connected appliances, though you need capable devices first. Of course, I have to get used to speaking aloud with no one around. Privacy is a concern, too, once I enable all the features. Anyone within hearing distance will know when I’m seeing the doctor or leaving my apartment empty for vacation. Home and Echo are continually listening for commands, though Google and Amazon say nothing gets passed back to them until the speakers hear a keyword — “OK, Google” for Home and “Alexa” for Echo. A light comes on to remind you that it’s listening. You can turn off the microphone temporarily, too. ___ LONGING FOR MORE Neither device is all that proactive. Android phones with the Google Now assistant will remind me when it’s time to leave for work or the airport, based on estimated travel times. But I’m usually not checking the phone as I’m getting ready to leave. I could use a nudge from either speaker. On the other hand, I might find a stranger’s voice jarring when I think I’m alone. It’s a new technology, and companies still have to figure out the right balance. And while Home and Echo offer the basics, neither lets me dig deeper. Sure, I have an appointment at 11 a.m., but where is it and with whom? And how can I get there? It’s back to the phone. Another limitation: Both speakers are tied to a single account, so families won’t get individual calendars and preferences. Advertisement Continue reading ___ IN UNITY The speakers are more powerful when they coordinate with your other devices. The best stab so far comes from Amazon. Ask Echo the weather, and the speaker will tell you current conditions and the day’s forecast. But if you have an Amazon Fire tablet nearby, you automatically get a full-screen display with the week’s forecast. Ask Echo about the Cubs, and you’ll hear the score. The tablet gives you inning-by-inning breakdowns. Home can control Google’s Chromecast streaming TV devices, but the preview I’ve been testing has been painful to use. You can pause, resume or forward video; you’re also supposed to be able to rewind and start from the beginning, but Home gets fussy. It currently works only with YouTube video (Netflix and Google Photos are coming soon). Even then, Home keeps thinking I’m requesting a song that doesn’t exist. There’s potential here, but controls on the phone are much easier. Watching TV shouldn’t take a lot of work. Ideally, the technology will just know where and how to present information and entertainment. In such a scenario, you can set one alarm, and Google or Amazon will find you wherever you are — whether it’s on the speaker at home, or a phone if you’re away. Or if you ask the speaker about a nearby restaurant, directions go to your phone. For now, unification is limited to a shopping list you can add to and view (or hear) from any device. ___ EARLY SMARTS, EARLY DUMBS Home, with an early incarnation of a Google digital companion called Assistant, seems the smarter of the two out of the gate. It knows about my upcoming flight, based on reservations in Gmail. It offers commute times using transit, as Google already senses through my Android phone that I don’t drive to work. Home can also estimate driving time to just about any other destination. Echo sends me to work, even when I ask about Boston. And Home is alone in setting alarms more than 24 hours away. But partnerships will make these speakers more useful. I can ask Echo about my Fitbit goals or order pizza from Domino’s; I can’t with Home. Amazon has more than a thousand such partnerships, known as skills. Google’s integrations are initially limited to calling for Ubers, changing news or music providers and controlling smart devices from Phillips, SmartThings and Nest (a Google sister company). Google still has bugs to work out. How are the Chicago Cubs doing? Home told me the Cubs are the regular-season division leaders and are based in Chicago. Duh! I had to ask again for the World Series score. And after the Cubs won in extra innings early Thursday morning, both Home and Echo were nonchalant in giving me the final score. I wouldn’t have known from either that the Cubs were now the world champions and that Chicago fans got to finally celebrate.

Researchers at Google DeepMind found a way around that. by Will Knight November 3, 2016 Most of us can recognize an object after seeing it once or twice. But the algorithms that power computer vision and voice recognition need thousands of examples to become familiar with each new image or word. Researchers at Google DeepMind now have a way around this. They made a few clever tweaks to a deep-learning algorithm that allows it to recognize objects in images and other things from a single example—something known as "one-shot learning." The team demonstrated the trick on a large database of tagged images, as well as on handwriting and language. The best algorithms can recognize things reliably, but their need for data makes building them time-consuming and expensive. An algorithm trained to spot cars on the road, for instance, needs to ingest many thousands of examples to work reliably in a driverless car. Gathering so much data is often impractical—a robot that needs to navigate an unfamiliar home, for instance, can’t spend countless hours wandering around learning. Oriol Vinyals, a research scientist at Google DeepMind, a U.K.-based subsidiary of Alphabet that’s focused on artificial intelligence, added a memory component to a deep-learning system—a type of large neural network that’s trained to recognize things by adjusting the sensitivity of many layers of interconnected components roughly analogous to the neurons in a brain. Such systems need to see lots of images to fine-tune the connections between these virtual neurons. The team demonstrated the capabilities of the system on a database of labeled photographs called ImageNet. The software still needs to analyze several hundred categories of images, but after that it can learn to recognize new objects—say, a dog—from just one picture. It effectively learns to recognize the characteristics in images that make them unique. The algorithm was able to recognize images of dogs with an accuracy close to that of a conventional data-hungry system after seeing just one example.  Vinyals says the work could be especially useful if it could quickly recognize the meaning of a new word. This could be important for Google, Vinyals says, since it could allow a system to quickly learn the meaning of a new search term. Others have developed one-shot learning systems, but these are usually not compatible with deep-learning systems. An academic project last year used probabilistic programming techniques to enable this kind of very efficient learning (see "This Algorithm Learns Tasks As Fast As We Do"). But deep-learning systems are becoming more capable, especially with the addition of memory mechanisms. Another group at Google DeepMind recently developed a network with a flexible kind of memory, making it capable of performing simple reasoning tasks—for example, learning how to navigate a subway system after analyzing several much simpler network diagrams (see "What Happens When You Give a Computer a Working Memory?"). "I think this is a very interesting approach, providing a novel way of doing one-shot learning on such large-scale data sets," says Sang Wan Lee, who leads the Laboratory for Brain and Machine Intelligence at the Korean Advanced Institute for Science and Technology in Daejeon, South Korea. "This is a technical contribution to the AI community, which is something that computer vision researchers might fully appreciate." Others are more skeptical about its usefulness, given how different it still is from human learning. For one thing, says Sam Gershman, an assistant professor in Harvard's Department for Brain Science, humans generally learn by understanding the components that make up an image, which may require some real-world, or commonsense, knowledge. For example, "a Segway might look very different from a bicycle or motorcycle, but it can be composed from the same parts." According to both Gershman and Wan Lee, it will be some time yet before machines match human learning. "We still remain far from revealing humans’ secret of performing one-shot learning," Wan Lee says, "but this proposal clearly poses new challenges that merit further study."

The official Sanket Gupta, programme manager of Google maps said Google has tied up with the survey agency for creating a 360 degree virtual map of monuments which would be available for reference in the company maps. Speaking of India’s importance in digital world, he said the country is among the top five users of Google. The company has launched a plethora of products in the country like offline maps view, live traffic alerts and inclusion of unknown places for the better reference of all but so far Street view has not been done due to permission dilemma. Some most important monuments of international importance like the Taj Mahal, Victoria Memorial, Sun Temple (Konark) notably are in the list of Google’s surveillance.

Under the leadership of Sameer Samat, who rejoined Google earlier this year after a spell as president of wearable tech firm Jawbone, the company is sharpening Google Play store recommendations with artificial intelligence and expanding support for various payment platforms, among other initiatives. Google’s efforts in some way mirror those of arch-rival Apple Inc, which revamped its App Store this year with quicker review times for new apps and an increase in the cut of revenue that goes to developers. Both companies face a chorus of complaints from developers who say they are struggling to stand out in a jam-packed field. Many smartphone users, meanwhile, appear to have tired of downloading apps altogether, especially as messaging services like Snapchat perform more of the functions that once required a separate app. Games remain a focus of the Google Play store, and Nintendo Co Ltd is building a version of its popular Super Mario Run game for Android, said Samat, who leads product management for the Google Play store. The store is also expanding to new platforms, including wearable devices, virtual reality headsets and Google’s Chromebook laptops. “What we are excited about is giving developers that single entry point for more and more of the computing ecosystem,” said Samat. Android Wild West Google has eased the once-complicated process of developing apps for the Play store, said James Knight, a former Google employee who launched Pembroke, a consultancy that helps developers convert Apple-compatible iOS apps to the Android operating system. “The App Store has historically been a little more straightforward, and Android has been a bit more like the Wild West,” he said. Mirroring the larger smartphone market, the Google Play store sees far more activity by virtue of its placement on the wide range of devices running the Android operating system — but Apple claims more of the profits. The Google Play store accounted for 70 per cent of app downloads in the third quarter of this year, but Apple’s App Store logged 65 per cent of the revenue, according to App Annie, a mobile analytics firm. A big part of Google’s new effort involves emerging markets, where Android is stronger relative to the iPhone. The company has steadily expanded its support of direct carrier billing, a popular payment method in emerging markets where consumers often do not have credit cards. Google now offers the payment method in 47 markets. To improve app recommendations for users, the Play store has also made extensive use of machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence that gleans insights from vast troves of data. Google’s Play store and machine learning teams began collaborating three years ago, and a partnership was struck last year with Google Brain, a cutting-edge research project. The jolt of artificial intelligence is welcome as developers hunt for an audience for their apps, said Greg Cohn, chief executive of Burner, which makes an app that provides temporary phone numbers. “The harsh reality is that there are a few apps that get the vast majority of people’s time and attention,” he said. — Reuters                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Facebook accidentally declares some users dead, including founder Zuckerberg Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg says fake news didn’t drive election (VIDEO) Sony seeks to patent method for measuring journalists' accuracy The best action cams for winter sports Consumer drone business stumbles, but commercial markets beckon Apple now sells refurbished iPhones Robotic dinosaur replicas stomp in Tokyo hotel (VIDEO) Best smartphones for holiday 2016 Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg says fake news didn’t drive election (VIDEO) Malaysian gaming content exports soar 75pc to RM80m Most Watched Now Week 'Beauty and the Beast' first full-length trailer Reuters Video: Models with Down Syndrome team up with celebrities Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Ah Beng reviews iguana’s epic escape from snakes (WARNING: EXPLICIT LANGUAGE) Reuters Video: Philippines’ Duterte says ‘Long live Trump’ Reuters Video: Duchess meets movie-star cat, animals go wild Related Articles Mahu tahu apa PM buat?

No matter where you are in the PR world, you’ve probably experienced the highs and lows of media outreach. With nearly 28 years in the industry, The Spin Cycle has these tips to make your news sing: » Audience is everything. – Steer away from the “spray and pray” approach to pitching. Rather than blasting out a pitch and hoping someone bites, taking the time to focus on your target audience can go a long way in getting a response. PR pros have a vast amount of resources to help us select which reporters to pitch. With access to databases like Cision and Muck Rack, there’s no excuse not to locate the best writers and tailor the pitch to them. Research every reporter you’re considering pitching, the topics they write about and their recent articles. Build up a long-term relationship by reading through their work on a regular basis, thoughtfully commenting on articles and following/sharing social media posts. Once you have a relationship with a reporter or editor established, nurture it forever. PR is built on connections – and you never know when you’ll want to work with them again! This way might take more time, but the ROI is well worth it. You’ll earn the trust and respect of the right contacts on your list. » Boring topics don’t earn coverage. – This is where we, as PR professionals, have to be cautious. Clients often feel passionately about their business and what they consider newsworthy announcements, ideas or processes, but it’s our job to provide objective counsel on their PR strategies. If the story isn’t newsworthy or interesting enough to stand on its own, consider these options for including it elsewhere: 1. If you have an existing relationship with a reporter, you might be able to weave the announcement into a larger story. Could it be a supporting point or offer validation around their larger business story or strategy? 2. Tie your news to something reporters haven’t heard before. Does it connect with a timely trend, current event or emerging best practice? 3. Tell your client this isn’t the right story to tell and recommend looking at other opportunities for media exposure. There is no harm in telling a client that their story angle doesn’t have the chops to secure the type of coverage they’re hoping for. It’s better to be honest and upfront then set unrealistic expectations. A better, stronger idea or strategy may emerge as a result. » Capture the reporter’s attention – Once you have a topic that is worth publishing, craft it in a way that will easily catch a reporter’s attention. Pay attention to your email’s subject line, as it can make or break whether a reporter goes any further. Presume that all the journalist can see on his or her computer screen is the preview portion of your email in Outlook. Are you giving it all you’ve got within the first few sentences so that he or she is compelled to click open and read further? Eliminate hard returns between “Hi Reporter Jane” and the crux of your pitch, so that you are taking advantage of prime email real estate. Nobody wants to read lengthy paragraphs or open attached files, let alone an overworked journalist with an overflowing inbox. Use short paragraphs, bullet points, embedded images and links to more information. The art of the pitch takes practice, time and experience, but like any craft, they take time to perfect. Solid research pays off – and good stories don’t come easily – they are earned! Brands must adopt mobile first philosophy, Pepsi says Brands that are connecting at the speed of culture will win, said Adam Harter, PepsiCo’s VP of cultural connections, during a presentation at the Digital Marketing World Forum (DMWF) held recently in New York. Harter took the stage to talk about marketing in a post-mobile world, where big data, influence, and the blending of real and virtual worlds have redefined marketing—for the better. According to Harter, 90 percent of the world’s data has been created in the past 12 months. Mobile, he said, is indispensable in the “connected” world. In fact, 90 percent of 18- to 29-year-olds sleep with or next to their smartphones; by the end of 2016, more than 8 trillion texts will have been sent overall. This mobile-obsessed environment is what made PepsiCo realize it needed its own mobile-first reset. This reset consisted of four parts: 1. A shift in culture. 2. A better strategy for leveraging the data explosion. 3. Driving dynamic creative. 4. Measuring success every step of the way. PepsiCo’s shift in culture is based on a new guiding principle: No campaign, program, or tactic will be considered if mobile isn’t part of the equation, Harter said. Google launches Jamboard Whiteboard Google’s newest gadget is for your office: Today, the company is announcing Jamboard, a new cloud-connected digital whiteboard that hooks into its “G Suite” of apps for corporate customers. The Jamboard itself is a Google-designed, 55-inch 4K touchscreen display that runs Android and a new app for whiteboarding. It includes a built-in camera and speakers and can recognize up to 16 simultaneous touch inputs. (It can also tell the difference between human fingers and its no-batteries-or-Bluetooth-pairing-necessary stylus and eraser accessories.) You can mount it to a wall or wheel it around on a custom stand. Google will start selling the device next year, starting at “under $6,000.” But like most of Google’s suite of business apps, the real point is the software and its collaborative cloud service. As you might expect, inside a “Jam” session, you can draw, type, import and scribble on images and Google Docs, search the web in a mini-browser, communicate with colleagues via Google Hangout and keep a digital record of your work in Google Drive. Teams using multiple Jamboards can work together on the same project in real time, as long as there’s internet access. There’s also a full-featured tablet app for iOS and Android (so others can participate without a Jamboard) and a simpler version of the app for smartphones. Transparent Mic | FBI Director Comey seeks justice in bombastic election When FBI Director James Comey renewed the bureau’s investigation into Hillary Clinton’s secret emails, he brought to light an anchor that could very well sink the U.S.S Hillary. As the 2016 election zooms – albeit with deflated tires on both sides of the aisle – to the finish line, the investigation certainly heightened the stakes for the Democratic presidential nominee, who has been caught in a web of potential criminal activities related to treatment of classified information shared via unsecured private servers. Comey made the announcement after new information relevant to the case, reportedly thousands of emails, were found on a computer belonging to former Congressman Anthony Weiner and his ex-wife Huma Abedin, who serves as a top aide for Clinton. In pure Clintonian fashion, Clinton herself wasted no time going after Comey by accusing him of purposely trying to influence an election. In an effort to paint Comey’s move as purely political, she lied about the letter he sent by saying it was only sent to Republicans. Campaign Chairman John Podesta did the same despite the letter being sent to Democrats and Republicans. Clinton was the First Lady, a Senator from New York who sat on the Intelligence Committee and served as Secretary of State. She knew what the rules were and ignored them for the sake of secrecy and non-transparency. She did it to avoid oversight from Congress, which she admitted in emails. She prioritized her secrecy and criminal behavior above the national security of the United States, which is why she’s in this situation as the election hits the 11th hour. The Spin Cycle would like to point out that without her private server there would be no FBI investigation. Period. If it costs her the election, Hillary has nobody to blame but herself. Comey reopened this investigation to make sure justice is served, and in doing so, brings something to D.C. that all to often goes unheeded – transparency. For that, Comey – and the FBI – get a Transparent Mic! Each week, The Spin Cycle will bestow a Golden Mic Award to the person, group or company in the court of public opinion that best exemplifies the tenets of solid PR, marketing and advertising – and those who don’t.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Home Review: Feeling at home with Google Assistant By Juan Carlos Torres - November 3, 2016 2 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter While Google might be ubiquitous, thanks to Android and the Web, there is one area of our lives it hasn’t fully conquered yet: our homes. Specifically our living rooms. Google TV was stillborn. It was supplanted by Android TV, which still isn’t as a big a presence as Google might have hoped. And while Chromecast is indeed more popular, it still serves only a niche market. Third, or fourth, time’s a charm right? Last month, Google made that attempt with Google Home. But this time, it’s quite focused on what it’s for. And it all starts with “Ok Google”. It’s unavoidable that parallels will be drawn between the Google Home and the Amazon Echo, as both serve practically the same purpose and functionality. But while the Echo looks like a canister prop from a TRON film, the Google Home takes on a more homely appearance, one that isn’t that alien from living rooms. A humidifier or essential oil diffuser. The body of the Google Home is almost seamless, only broken by a different colored bottom half that magnetically attaches to the plain white top. That bottom is actually just a simple speaker cover that you can exchange for other colors, with Google offering optional orange and blue grilles. As separate purchases, of course. As for the speakers themselves, that is comprised of a 2-inch driver and two 2-inch passive radiators. The power cord also plugs it at the bottom and Google has sadly opted for a proprietary connector instead of, say, a USB-C or even a micro USB plug. Given the Google Home’s design, there very little option for an external, portable battery pack that won’t jut out. Simply put, Google has made it clear through its design that the Google Home is really meant to stay at home. The top of device is flat but not completely horizontal. Its angled face isn’t simply an aesthetic decision. It is also a functional one. That surface is touch sensitive, and sliding your finger in a circle, in a clockwise or counter-clockwise direction, adjusts the volume appropriately. There’s also a capacitive button at the very top that you can tap to activate Google Assistant manually, should voice activation falter. And four LED lights, colored to Google’s theme, indicates that it is ready to listen. By its lonesome self, Google Home is practically no better than Google Now, or Google Assistant, on your smartphone. You can ask it to search for things and it will dictate the results. Ask it for the weather and it will find results using the location on the smartphone you used to set it up. Ask it for your upcoming appointments, however, and you might develop a paranoia for missing important meetings. Google Home’s real advantage arrives when you have other smart devices in your home. While any Chromecast will work, it’s more existing if you devices like Nest, Philips Hue, or any SmartThings-powered appliance. You can also connect to different music streaming services . Except for Apple Music. Adding them to Home’s control is simple and straightforward, though for certain accounts or devices, you’ll need to enter in your account credentials. All of that happens on the new Google Home app, formerly Google Cast. But while Google Home would have us dreaming of the home of the future, where everything is conveniently controlled by voice from an inconspicuous object, like Google Home, in practice, it is still quite rough around the edges to make for a compelling proposition. Both hardware and software would make you think that this is yet another beta-quality product that Google may have released a tad too early. Mind you, the speakers are loud, which is impressive for such a cramped space. Perhaps even too loud, as it can sometimes overwhelm the far-field microphone array when you’re trying to say “OK Google” while playing some music. Good thing there’s a button to tap, but that shouldn’t be majority of the case. The Amazon Echo certainly doesn’t seem to have problems there. The biggest concerns, however, are on the software side. Fortunately, they could also be the easiest to fix. First is, of course, the lack of available integrations at the moment, though that can be worked around using IFTTT, which now has an Applet specifically for Google Home. But sometimes, even those that supposedly integrate already, like Google Calendar, seems to be a bit broken, with Home unable to find any trace of appointments. And finally, Google Home has the rather ironic limitation of not supporting multiple accounts and multiple users. The lone account used by Home is the account used to set it up. Dad and mom can’t have separate calendars or search histories, for example. Worse, however, is that there is practically no security measures built-in. Anyone who can say “OK Google” or tap the button to trigger it can practically have access to the user’s data, including, for example, private e-mails. Again, these are more like growing pains rather than critical deal breakers. Almost all, save for the mic problem, can and will be resolved in future software updates. Google has promised an “Actions” update that developers will be able to harness to offer even more functionality to users. Best of all, that will be made available to all Google Assistant-powered devices, Pixel and Pixel XL included. Still, Google Home itself, at this point in time, may feel like a work in progress. Luckily, it will only cost you $129 if you do decide to make an investment. It’s a rather raw $129 “beta” product, but that wouldn’t be out of character for Google anyway.

Partners with CorsPro for Winning Scopes of Work Communication Resources, Inc. Partners with CorsPro for Winning Scopes of Work Posted on November 3, 2016 by Top News US Full Feed in Press Releases Conceptual image of a businessman holding big hammer Cors Productivity Solutions, Inc. (CorsPro) announced today that Communication Resources, Inc. (CRI) has chosen CorsPro’s Sales Doc Architect (SDA) software for their professional services contracting scopes of work and Avaya direct sales proposals. Reston, VA (PRWEB) November 03, 2016 CorsPro announced today that Communication Resources, Inc. (CRI), a premier professional services company for unified communications, has chosen CorsPro’s Sales Doc Architect (SDA) software for their professional services contracting scopes of work and Avaya direct sales proposals. CRI subcontracts their professional services to other unified communication resellers and experiences a greater volume of quoting on their partner side of the house. With CorsPro’s SDA, they are able to quickly create accurate and competitive scopes of work. DYNAMIC TRANSFORMATION After many years of using a previous solution for their scope needs, Paul Leatherman, CRI’s Chief Technology Officer, found the upkeep to be unwieldy and the content stale. The solution being used produced a static document that allowed no room for the various combinations of professional services offered to its resellers nor the ability to further customize a scope of work. Because SDA is built on the Microsoft Office platform, the CRI sales team can now dynamically build highly customized scopes of work. The answers to a workflow of questions are fed into the Excel portion of SDA’s desktop application that are then translated to a Word document output. Leatherman shared his enthusiasm for SDA by stating, “Whereas our outputs were in a static PDF format, today’s Word output allows our partners to easily include our scope in their proposal and scope of work. SDA empowers our sales team to do more, quickly and accurately.” He also stated, “Furthermore, we are able to define dynamic tables in the output that shows what is and is not included in the scope. It is very easy for our partners to assess if they are getting what they asked for – eliminating any misconceptions and exposing them to things they may not have known was available.” Leatherman worked closely with his lead software engineer Joe Sabatini and created a Google form and linked it to SDA utilizing the Google Forms API. Per Leatherman, “The beauty of working with Google Forms is anyone, anywhere can get access and easily follow the prompts to answer the required questions.” Once all the information is in the form, a notification is sent, and a CRI Sales Consultant can import the information via the import utility. Accurate information is pulled in without any second-guessing or potential data entry errors. This “self-service” model educates CRI’s partners so they can make smarter requests. CRI sales members review the request to ensure it is a valid request and if something looks incorrect, they immediately reach out to the reseller. Working closely with one of his engineers, Leatherman created an API with Google Forms whereby partners follow prompts to provide required information. That Information is then automatically fed back to SDA to create a partner scope of work. This “self-service” model educates CRI’s partners so they can make smarter requests regarding the qualification information they need to gather. CRI sales persons review the request to ensure it can be fulfilled and if something looks incorrect, they immediately reach out to the reseller partner. “We love working with our clients and learning how they use SDA in new and unique ways,” shared Brian Cors, President and CEO of CorsPro. “Our typical client works directly with a customer. CRI, on the other hand, works with their reseller partners, providing them a scope of work that can be seamlessly included with the reseller customer output. It is really exciting to see how the API between Google Forms and SDA works to achieve this for CRI.” According to Leatherman, SDA has raised the bar for the quality and polish of the scopes of work. It allows greater productivity from the sales team and provides a robust, well thought-out scope of work that is easy to understand and eliminates questions and mistakes. Leatherman summed up his thoughts with, “SDA is a hidden gem. It is a must-have for our partner channel. When our partners see this scope of work they know it is good, it is clean, it is something they can go to the bank on.” For more information of CRI’s unique use of SalesDoc Architect and its API with Google Forms, visit the CorsPro website.

Tyler Lizenby/CNET The complete list of Google Home commands so far 0 Share: Smart Home by David Priest November 3, 2016 7:00 AM PDT @david_p_priest Up Next Fantastic Beasts' Dan Fogler sees magic in tech Over the past year, the Amazon Echo has taken the world of smart home tech by storm. In November, Google finally released its long-awaited competitor. The Google Home is a $130 smart home speaker that showcases the artificially intelligent, voice-activated Google Assistant. This clever bit of software lets you set timers, control lights and thermostats, play trivia games, watch YouTube videos and more -- all with simple voice commands. The Home's roster of supported integrations will likely grow over time, as will its list of native commands. And compared to what you'll get with Amazon's Alexa, Google's commands are a little more flexible, so you typically don't have to search for the perfect phrasing. Google hasn't released a full list of commands for Home, so we had to do our best to assemble and test everything we could think of. If we're missing anything, make sure to leave it in a comment so we can update the list as we go. Here's the (almost) complete list of voice commands for the Google Home so far. 18 Here's everything the Google Home can do Summoning the Google Assistant You can begin a conversation with the Google Home by simply saying, "OK Google," or "Hey Google." Summoning the Google Assistant on your phone works the same way, but your account will know to only respond on one of the devices, even if both hear you. Conversational commands The Google Home allows you to ask lines of questions that are connected. For instance you could say, "Hey Google, play 'Lose Yourself to Dance.'" Then, "OK Google, what album is this from?" Then, "Hey Google, play that album." Even though you aren't using the name of the album, Google Assistant understands the context and supplies the answer. Basic commands Ask for help: "OK Google, help." Control the volume: "OK Google, turn it up" or, "Louder" or, "Turn it to 11." (Yes, the max is 11.) Halt an action: "OK Google, stop" or, "Pause" or, "Be quiet." Tools Roll a die: "OK Google, roll a die" or, "OK Google, roll a 12-sided die." Flip a coin: "OK Google, flip a coin." Math: "OK Google, what's 354 times 11?" Measurements: "OK Google, how many liters are in 4 gallons." Time: "OK Google, what time is it?" Location: "OK Google, where am I?" Translations: "OK Google, how do you say [word] in [language]?" International time: "OK Google, what time is it in [city]?" Currency conversion: "OK Google, how much is 100 Euros in dollars?" Alarm: "OK Google, set an alarm for [time]." Snooze alarm: "OK Google, snooze alarm." Cancel alarm: "OK Google, cancel my alarm for [time]." Timer: "OK Google, set a timer for [time]." Check timer: "OK Google, how much time is left on my timer?" Recipes: "OK Google, how do I make [dish]" Add to shopping list: "OK Google, add [item] to my shopping list." Check shopping list: "OK Google, what's on my shopping list?" Daily briefing: "OK Google, good morning." (includes personalized greeting, info on weather, traffic, and curated news stories) Uber: "OK Google, order an Uber." 9 7 ways Google Home outsmarts Alexa Search Stocks: "OK Google, how are Alphabet's stocks doing?" Weather: "OK Google, how's the weather today?" or, "Do I need an umbrella today?" Traffic: "OK Google, what's the traffic like on the way to work?" Words: "OK Google, what does [word] mean?" Spelling: "OK Google, spell [word]." Special events: "OK Google, when is [event]?" (Easter, for example) People: "OK Google, who is [person]?" Facts: "OK Google, how tall is [person]?" Things: "OK Google, what is [thing]?" Places: "OK Google, what country is [location] in?" Animal sounds: "OK Google, what does [animal] sound like?" Distance: "OK Google, how far is [business name] from here?" Restaurants: "OK Google, what are the nearest restaurants to me?" Businesses: "OK Google, are there any [business type] around here?" Business information: "OK Google, how late is [business] open?" or "Is [business] open now?" Quotes: "OK Google, give me a quote" or, "Give me a love quote." Medical information: "OK Google, what is a torn meniscus?" Calories: "OK Google, how many calories are in [food item]?" Authors: "OK Google, who wrote [book title]?" Inventors: "OK Google, who invented [item]?" Media Play music: "OK Google, play some music" or, "Play some [genre] music." Play an artist or song: "OK Google, play [artist]" or, "Play [song]." Play a song by lyrics: "OK Google, play the song that goes, 'Is this the real life?'" Play a Google Play playlist or album: "OK Google, play some indie music" or, "OK Google, play [album]." Ask what's playing: "OK Google, what song is this?" or, "OK Google, what album is this?" Get more information: "OK Google, when did this album come out?" Fast forward and rewind: "OK Google, skip forward 2 minutes" or, "Skip backward 30 seconds." Play music through other speakers using Chromecast: "OK Google, cast [song] onto [speaker name]." Play music on Spotify: "OK Google, play [artist] on Spotify." Play music on Pandora: "OK Google, play [artist] on Pandora." Like or dislike a song on Pandora: "OK Google, dislike this song." Play music on YouTube Music: "OK Google, play [artist] on YouTube." Play stations on TuneIn: "OK Google, play [station] on TuneIn." Play videos on YouTube using Chromecast: "OK Google, play [video] on the [TV name]." Pull up lists on YouTube: "OK Google, let's look at what's trending on YouTube on [TV name]." Entertainment Sports updates: "OK Google, who is [team] playing next?" or "Did the [team] win last night?" Sports scores: "OK Google, what was the score for the last [team] game?" Team information: "OK Google, tell me about [team]." Movies: "OK Google, what movies came out last Friday?" Casting for movies: "OK Google, what actors are in [movie]?" Shows by network: "Hey Google, what shows are on [network]?" News: "OK Google, what's today's news?" Smart home Google works with only a few smart home devices/platforms at present: Philips Hue, Nest, SmartThings, Chromecast and IFTTT. The roster of integrations will likely expand as time goes on. Even with these limited integrations, though, the flexibility of SmartThings and especially IFTTT allow the Google Home to control a wide variety of gadgets using 3rd-party triggers. For now, here are the built-in Google Home commands for smart home gadgets. Turn Philips Hue lights on/off: "OK Google, turn on/off my lights." Dim Hue lights: "OK Google, dim my lights to fifty percent." Change Hue colors: "OK Google, turn my lights [color]." Control Nest thermostat: "OK Google, turn the temperature to [temp]." Make incremental changes: "OK Google, raise the temperature 1 degree." Customize trigger phrases for IFTTT. For example: "OK Google, let's get this party started." Easter eggs "Hey Google, always be closing." "Hey Google, what is your quest?" "Hey Google, I am your father." "Hey Google, set phasers to kill." "Hey Google, are you SkyNet?" "Hey Google, make me a sandwich." "Hey Google, up up down down left right left right B A Start." "Hey Google, do a barrel roll." "Hey Google, it's my birthday." "Hey Google, it's not my birthday." "Hey Google, did you fart?"

Previously, every device you have ever owned would be listed, right from the first Android device you used (mine was a Nexus One) to the most recent.

Unless you’re writing instructions or technical copy, writing is a creative process. When writers are in the flow, they work in bursts of energy, hammering out paragraphs without stopping to think about editing. Unedited writing is, in the words of Annie Lamott: shitty. And so it should be. If you’re stopping every three words to check what you’re doing, you’re going to take days to write a disjointed, awkward piece. That’s where using an editing checklist comes in. Editing is a misunderstood practice A common misconception is that editing is looking at the spelling and grammar. Maybe in the days before word processors, that’s what it was, but now we have Grammarly, Google Docs and a wide range of tools to help us fix common errors in seconds. What’s important for the post-Grammarly editor is style, fact-checking and readability. Some of these elements are technical, and you can reduce them to a formula, but as I’ve learned since being the gateway everything on the Process Street blog goes through before publication, you can’t ‘teach’ style. In this article, I want to share with you an internal process I’ve developed for editing articles and hope that it helps you, too. It includes: Copy editing Editing for SEO Optimizing your visuals Part 1: Copy editing Since this part is going to take the most amount of time, it’s best to get it out of the way right now. Before focusing on the finer details (SEO and visuals), make sure that the words are correct. Let’s get into it. Analyze the article’s structure We know this one from school. An article should have an intro, where it gets the reader’s attention, conveys the value of what they’re about to say and sets expectations. Then, it should go on to make a series of structured points, all living up to the promises of the title and intro. To wrap things up, you need a conclusion to summarize your points, call the reader to action and leave them with something to think about. (Source: Lotem Design) While reading the article, think about whether the article follows a logical sequence, all the way through. For more information about article structure, check this out (which, of course, has a great structure). Check spelling and grammar with Grammarly As I was saying, editing isn’t only spelling and grammar, but it is part of it. It’s the bare minimum, and will catch the most obvious mistakes in the eyes of the reader. Check you’ve corrected all the words and phrases flagged by Grammarly. Grammarly isn’t perfect, but it’s the best tool around. It’ll catch incorrect comma placement, confused words and all spelling errors, but it doesn’t compensate for that alchemical ingredient — style. After reading through the article once with Grammarly and making corrections, move onto fact checking. Check for inconsistencies without Grammarly Grammarly can’t flag everything up. As pointed out by Ian Luke on ProBlogger, some terms like ebook / e-book / eBook are a matter of taste, not concrete. Grammarly or another spell-checking tool could miss that, so you have to turn it off sometimes and let your brain do the work. Fact-check the article This step is far more important for news pieces than personal blog posts, but you do always need to make sure you’re backing your facts up. A good method of catching opinion presented as fact is by asking yourself “how do you know this?” for every statement you read. Check all numbers, facts, quotes and percentages have a source link. A good way to find a citation for unsourced statements is with Google Docs’ research toolbar. It brings up a mini-version of Google search in the right-hand pane and you can search keywords to find a source to back the claim up. Ideally, however, your claims will come from sources in the first place. Remove filler words (especially adverbs) There are, there is, however, regardless, perhaps, possibly, rather, a bit, well. Filler words make it sound like we’re nervous about what we’re writing, and adverbs don’t often add anything to the sentence. Here’s a list of the scoundrels: 297 Flabby Words and Phrases That Rob Your Writing of All Its Power. It’s not reasonable to expect you to check for all 297, but check that list of filler words while editing to get a feel for the words to cut. Convert from the passive to active voice The passive voice is unclear. It either clouds the facts of what you’re talking about or sounds long-winded. According to The Daily Post, you can recognize passive sentences by looking for these things: A form of the verb “to be” A past participle (usually the -ed form of a verb) Optionally the word “by” followed by a noun Passive: The window was broken. Active: Ben broke the window. Passive: The ice hockey match was hosted by Russia this year. Active: Russia hosted the ice hockey match this year. Seek and destroy passive sentences. Cut out the cliches If you condense Orwell’s fantastic essay “Politics and the English Language” down to just a few points, a major one would be: What do I mean by cliches? I don’t think I could do a better job than this huge list of 681, to be honest. So, let me give you a few examples and leave it at that. avoid like the plague take the bull by the horns on a roll wake-up call pull your punches When you read a cliche, your brain shuts off and doesn’t cognate the meaning because it’s seen the phrase so many times. You don’t want your readers to switch off, do you? Weed out weak verbs and adjectives One strong word can replace three weak ones with ease. Instead of padding writing with adverbs, adjectives, and extra fluff, use strong words to convey meaning. Example: Think up a plan —> Devise a plan Go and see the world —> Travel the world Not very good —> Atrocious A bit of a pain —> Excruciating Quite interesting actually —> Fascinating A good way to CTRL+F for these is to search for ‘very’, ‘quite’, and other useless modifiers. Don’t stress over commas, but be consistent I know, I said already to use Grammarly early on to catch grammar mistakes, but one debatable rule concerns commas. Since we’re writing to be read, not to pass an English exam, ensure the writer uses commas to help the text flow. The AP Stylebook advises against it, whereas Oxford University demands it, so pick your side. As long as you’re consistent in your usage, it doesn’t matter. A writer’s aim is to put their thoughts into words. If you’re going mad working out whether to adopt the Oxford comma, ask yourself the question: “Will it help the reader understand my point?”. There are many cases where it does. To use Grammarly’s example: “I love my parents, Lady Gaga and Humpty Dumpty” “I love my parents, Lady Gaga, and Humpty Dumpty” Which is less confusing? Type like you talk Convert your cognitions into words befitting of the common vernacular. Write using everyday language. If you’re trying to think of more intellectual-sounding synonyms, don’t bother. You don’t become an authority by alienating your audience. Type like you talk. For a solid guide on this topic, read William Zinsser’s On Writing Well. Self-editing? Leave the article for at least a day Writing is a draining process. If you’re anything like me, you’ll not have the energy to edit after the wide-eyed coffee-fueled writing process. You’ll also be too attached to the piece to be objective. After a day, when you re-read the article, you’ll find parts of it that you hate, and it’ll be obvious passages need rewriting. “The professional writer says, ‘It is almost certain that most of what I write will not resonate with most people who read it, but over time, I will gain an audience who trusts me to, at the very least, be interesting.’” — Seth Godin Part 2: Editing for SEO Writing with SEO as a key concern is the simplest way to… write slow, awkward articles. Others might disagree, but I find that on-page SEO is much easier to edit in than to keep as a consideration all the way through. Maybe you’re writing an article with a keyword already in mind? That should be more than enough preparation because the whole article is what you’re targeting. After the copy editing, it’s time to add in on-page optimization for search. Backlinko recently updated its mega-guide to on-page SEO with an amazing infographic, so let me break that down into action steps for editors. Put the keyword at the start of your H1 title Search engines put more weight on the keyword in line with how early on in the title it occurs. While it’s not an exact science, it’s best to put the keyword in the first half of your title. For example, instead of ’10 Checklists for to Help Your Startup With Employee Onboarding‘ edit this to ’10 Employee Onboarding Checklists for Startups’. Additionally, your title should be in H1. This is very likely a default if you use WordPress, but check and make sure in the HTML of your article in preview mode to see that the title is wrapped in <h1> tags. In Chrome, right-click on a page and go to Inspect Element. You should be able to hover over the article title and see which H tag it’s wrapped in. Make sure the slug is only your target keyword Instead of your slug (everything after your domain.com in the article URL) looking like this: example.com/blog/catgories/editing/checklists/2016/01/editing-checklist-for-content-marketers-and-their-mothers Set it to be just this: example.com/editing-checklist Not only does it look better and is easier to remember, search engines prefer it. Include images, videos, infographic, embeds As well as not boring your reader to tears, multimedia increases time spent on the page, which signals to Google that the post was interesting enough for the user to stick around. A 2-minute video could increase the time on page by that time, for example. Plus, media breaks up the text and makes the post scannable. A reader scrolling further down the page is another signal to Google of quality content. What’s better? Straighten up your subheading hierarchy With your title tag in H1, you need to make sure that your subheads are in H2 and any sub-subheadings in H3. As a general rule, you can never use an H2 without an H1, never an H3 without an H2, and so on. This should come naturally if you structured the article properly in the first place. Use your exact keyword 2-3 times in the body Your keyword should appear in the body 2-3 times. It’s important that one of these occurrences is within the first 150 words of the article. This will also force you to cut the intro down and get to the point, which never hurts! To check this, CTRL + F your keyword. Use 2-4 outbound links every 1,000 words It’s well known that outbound links (to sources or further reading) increase the authority of the article because Google knows it’s well sourced. A new guideline from Brian Dean gets more specific. Brain recommends you use 2-4 outbound links in every 1,000 words you write. If you’re writing a well-sourced piece of work, you shouldn’t have to work hard for this. Internally link (like Wikipedia) Golden Age SEO Joke: How do you get 10 backlinks in one post? Internal linking, my good mate! Believe it or not, even Wikipedia has an SEO strategy, and internal linking is a big part of it. Why? Because link juice flows through your pages according to where they link to. So, if you get backlinks to a page with plenty of internal links, the authority passes to the pages you linked internally. Internally linking both the keywords of the target pages, plus leading phrases like ‘ported to several other platforms’ (begs the question ‘which other platforms?’), helps both SEO and reader engagement on your site overall. Part 3: Optimizing Your Visuals Visuals increase people’s willingness to read your content by 80%. Garbage visuals, however, do you no favors. Get rid of any pictures that look like this: Which brings me to my first point. Please… Get rid of those stock images At Process Street, we have a general rule that helps our blog posts not look godawful. All images should either be custom graphics or screenshots. Just take a look at this collection HubSpot put together of 13 hilarious stock images. Want your blog post to look like a non-parody version of that? As Kathryn Aragon says, images should not be: Inserted willy-nilly, just to have an image. Trite or overused stock photos. Thought of only as share-bait. Boring or irrelevant. The point is, stock images are shoved in for the sake of it. What could a clinically smiling guy with a briefcase be illustrating to the reader? (Apart from ‘the person who wrote this hates good things’.) Make sure your media fits full-width There’s something visually pleasing about aligning your text with your media by keeping both the same width. Depending on the column width of your blog, make sure your image will fit. For a visual reference, the column width of Process Street is 800 pixels. You want your images to look like this: Not this: (sorry, quaint farming blog :( ) Use a wide range of visuals This might seem like I’m assuming you all have no attention span, but seriously, a variety of visual stimuli is better for reader engagement. Try to balance between: Gifs Videos Infographics Screenshots Other embeds (like checklists, hint hint) Custom graphics (we use a range of templates and custom SVGs) With a range of media, you’re more likely to keep readers on the page. If you’ve got relevant podcast episodes or audio of some sort, these are also great to embed using a service like Soundcloud. Optimize your titles and alt text It’s important to optimize your image titles and alt text for a couple of reasons. Firstly, it aids your on-page efforts as I talked about earlier. If you have supporting alt text in line with your keyword choices, then it boosts the optimization of your page. Secondly, you get the chance to rank your images in Google Images. People don’t often talk about image backlinks being important, but Process Street consistently gets a few solid links per month thanks to custom image attribution. If those images weren’t properly optimized with alt text and titles, the linker wouldn’t have known they exist. Keep custom graphics consistent At Process Street, we have a selection of backgrounds and SVGs, used in conjunction with three main colors and one font. That keeps our images consistent, but not uniform enough to be boring. This step stems from the need for having a solid visual style guide for your brand and blog. For more information about the power of visual content and how to create it, check out this infographic from Digital Information World. If you don’t have brand guidelines to refer to, you can create some. They don’t have to be fancy 30-page PDF documents like this one (screenshot below) but use those for inspiration. Here’s a simple image I use to share with writers making custom images for our blog. It shows the hex codes of the three main Process Street colors, and the font used is Cabin. Having resources like that for writers to refer to will save plenty of time in the editing process on your end. You can’t edit a bad post into a quality post After all this, there’s something to be wary of — you can’t edit a bad post and turn it into a top-notch post. Editors traditionally start as writers because editing is harder. It takes a keen eye, great taste, and strong analytical skills. If you’re an editor working alongside a junior writer, the best course of action while running this checklist is to add comments (either in Google Docs or screenshots with annotations) to help the writer improve. Editing in silence doesn’t help the writer get better. Get this post as an interactive editing checklist Click here to get this guide as a checklist you can run through for every post you edit. It’s handy for teaching new writers, and also training yourself to be a tougher editor. Bear one thing in mind… Did you find this post useful? Do you have anything to add?

Thanks. Denny Reply Ravi Chahar says: 11/03/2016 at 3:49 pm Hey Benjamin, I have been using Grammarly for so long and it’s really helpful. You don’t need to look upon the spelling mistakes your own. This tool will do it for you. The SEO audit is required to get a high ranking. Interlinking is one the best things. It would help you to reduce the bounce rate of your website. Thanks for the article. ~Ravi Reply Tim says: 11/08/2016 at 12:57 am Grammarly is great but it has its limitations. It doesn’t catch all mistakes and in addition gives incorrect suggestions to correct mistakes. But nevertheless, it’s a good improvement over previous spelling and grammar checkers. Reply Aaslin Sathrak says: 11/03/2016 at 5:54 pm Such an awesome article benjamin. Very nicely put up. I run a niche website service and have a hard time explaining my writers each time I hire a new one. This article is perfect for them. Printing it now. Reply Maria says: 11/04/2016 at 3:53 am So super useful. I got myself a WordPress SEO tool recently which is pretty helpful, but this post takes those things and explains them so I actually understand it, and don’t have to just follow guidelines that don’t make that much sense..! Reply Dan Smith says: 11/04/2016 at 4:31 am Yet to try Grammarly but will give it a go soon. At present I proofread around 3 times, so time consuming. Really in depth post and no fluff. That’s what we need! Reply Jennifer Stewart says: 11/04/2016 at 7:47 am Thank you for this great read! I appreciate that someone actually took the time to put this into steps that could be easily referenced for those that IGNORE the fact that this SHOULD be part of a process in everything marketing. Just drop this in (you don’t need to review, it’s good) is a common saying in my industry. Again, thank you. I plan to print and use as a hand-out at every marketing implementation training I conduct. Reply Amar kumar says: 11/04/2016 at 5:11 pm Hey Benjamin, For people with English as the second language, it is essential to use some tools to find the grammatical errors in articles so that writing can be error-free. From my opinion, Inefficiency in English grammar is affecting our success in speaking, reading and writing more than we might realize. One of the hardest parts of blogging is consistently coming up with engaging and relevant topics to write about. The Web application claims to let us analyze the best-performing content for any niche.When we start marketing with content, we probably have some idea of the topics around which we want to create content. One of the easiest ways to create engaging content is to avoid sticking to one type of medium to communicate with our subscribers. This means that if we’re used to writing text-based blogs, we need to start varying it with things such as images, graphics, Infographics, quotes, videos, etc. Eventually, thanks for sharing much information with us. With best wishes, Amar kumar Reply Jordan Kahill says: 11/05/2016 at 1:52 am Great Article. I am a Master’s of Literature student as well as a freelance writer. All of the things listed here are crucial to my day to day life, but that doesn’t mean I always remember all of them! Pinning to my taskbar as a gentle reminder. Reply Shais says: 11/05/2016 at 4:07 am This is a great detailed informative checklist. Some of them were dumb for me but you really hit the nail on the head. Thanks Reply David Boozer says: 11/06/2016 at 11:25 pm Ah, great article Benjamin! I have been using Grammarly for months now. I however, use the half image a little further down, personally, I love to have a video embed around the 3rd paragraph. A video really does personalize the content, and even increases your conversion rate. Reply Gee says: 11/09/2016 at 10:47 am I’m curious about fitting media to full-width. I use Blogger. My post area width is 991. I usually set my images to x-large which varies depending on the image (mostly my photos but sometimes outside content). I experimented with your suggestion but the results didn’t look as polished as the posts on your blog. Any suggestions? Thanks. Reply Nishat Mahmud says: 11/11/2016 at 8:47 pm Such an awesome post. Surely this will help any content marketer. Great checklist Reply Michael LaRocca says: 11/12/2016 at 8:15 am It’s also possible to forget to write something that’s firmly entrenched in your mind but which your reader isn’t aware of, or to forget that you wrote something and then write it again. (Outlining helps with the latter problem.) That’s why it’s always good to get someone to look over your writing before you pass it on to your reader(s). Reply Anil Agarwal says: 11/13/2016 at 1:55 pm Great guide on writing top performing posts. From research to writing and publishing, one should spend quality time. Writing mediocre posts not going to give you any results. Just make sure you are spending time and money to find great keywords, using top images and writing great content to give ultimate experience to your readers. Also focus on networking with others. Promote more than you create. THat’s how you succeed as a content marketer. Reply Speak Your Mind Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

Comments By Dan Rosenbaum Follow Computerworld | Nov 3, 2016 6:08 AM PT RELATED TOPICS Personal Technology Internet of Things Comments Google Home, the company's new voice-controlled interface to the internet, is hardly the first to appear on the consumer market. But it may be the best -- although "best" may not yet be good enough. Amazon's Echo, introduced in late 2015, was, of course, the initial entry, although it started as a gimmick with very limited ability. You could ask it a question ("Alexa, what's it like outside?") and get an answer ("It's 64 degrees and sunny. There's a chance of rain later tonight."). You could build a wish list, or order stuff, or play music. More recently, with the help of third-party extensions, it's become, well, a little bit less of a gimmick with slightly greater abilities. In the end, though, any voice control system is ultimately only as good as the ecosystem behind it. By that metric alone, Google Home wins. [ Further reading: Is your IT staff ready for IoT? ] The physical manifestation of Google Home is a curvy, squat white cylindrical tower, about 5.6 in. high and 3.75 in. wide, with an angled slice out of the top. The bottom third is covered by a white fabric grill that hides a 2-in. speaker driver and two 2-in. passive radiators. You can easily replace the grill with separately purchased colored fabric and metal grills (Mango, Marine or Violet for fabric; Carbon, Copper or Snow for metal). It's quite attractive and unobtrusive, as opposed to the Amazon Echo's stark black monolithic tower; it is available from Google Play and several other vendors for $129. The angled top of the unit is touch-sensitive; it displays a series of lights during startup and Google's now-characteristic four colored dots when triggered. You can adjust the unit's volume, start a search, or pause music by touching the top, but you can also do all that by voice command (and will likely never have to touch the thing once it's set up). The whole unit weighs 1 lb. Far and away the worst design decision, though, is with the power brick. Google Home has a brick so bulky that takes at least two, and possibly three, positions on a power strip. Granted that the device draws 16.5 volts and 2 amps, and needs some beef for power conversion. However, the brick needs either to be smaller or oriented differently. Okay Google -- let's set up Setup is quick and painless: Plug it in, download an app (Android or iOS), and run through some simple menus to connect it to your Google account and your Wi-Fi. That's it. If you have a Chromecast, Nest or SmartThings, you add the devices through the app. You can also configure the app to use the Home with IFTTT or to order an Uber car (if you first enter your account details). When you're finished, start everything you say with "Okay Google" ("Hey Google" also works) and you're off. My interactions with Google Home went something like this: "Okay Google. Tell me about pizzerias near me." In a clear and somewhat formal female voice (that you can't change), Google responded with a list of three establishments within 0.7 miles. (Why 0.7 miles? I suspect that Google Home is a secret agent of the Metric Police, because 0.7 miles is more or less 1 kilometer.) "Okay Google. Tell me about the first one." Google gave details about the first one. "Okay Google. Tell me about the second one." Google complied. "Okay Google. Tell me about the last one." Google failed. Apparently, the word "last" won't work. This is not limited to pizza, by the way. It worked with Uzbek restaurants, too; I happen to live near several. That was kind of impressive. If you ask Google Home to call one of the restaurants, it tells you it can't do that yet. The "yet" is provocative, as it implies that Google Voice integration is forthcoming. Google will play music from its own Play Music and YouTube Music libraries, Spotify Premium or Pandora. (More services, including iHeartRadio, are promised.) You can ask to use any specific service -- "Okay Google. Play 'Pump It Up' by Elvis Costello from Google Play Music" -- but you can also set a default in the Google Home app. It takes practice to understand what sorts of information Google Home is good at providing. Its current event updates were very quick -- "Okay Google. What's the score of the Cubs' game?" -- but it couldn't tell me what was on my Google calendar (or any other calendar) for the next day. (Oddly, when asked the same questions, Amazon Echo was fine with the calendar but couldn't give me an accurate game update.) One problem with Google Home is that it's impossible to drill down to a specific piece of content. You can request "Pump It Up," for instance, but the version you get is the one that Google picks. It's the same with video; you can tell it to get "the most recent 'Last Week Tonight'" from YouTube, but you can't pick an exact clip from the show. (Note that this is also an issue with Amazon's Echo, which is a particular problem when you're trying to order a certain version of a product.) Bottom line There's little question that some sort of voice response device that controls a home tech ecosystem is inevitable. Google Home is the best of them today: The best physical design, the best database behind it, the most "natural" because it can retain the context of the last couple of exchanges. If you ask it for pizza restaurants, it will remember that that's what you're talking about. That doesn't mean it's a prime-time mass-market device. Dealing with Google Home is like dealing with a child. You need to speak to it in ways that it understands, not the way you probably talk; you'll get unexpected results that may or may not be okay, and it can't do things (make phone calls, find the exact media you want to play back) that you might reasonably expect it to do. (Yelling doesn't help either -- with Home or the child.) If you keep in mind its limitations and are reasonably confident that it's going to grow and mature, Google Home could be interesting. But never forget that although you paid for it and it's in your home and it does things for you, Google Home is really a new endpoint for an ecosystem and cloud that you're not really in control of. It's listening, and it's harvesting your questions and activities for Google. My colleague JR Raphael raised another interesting problem with all devices of this nature: The lack of authentication. Anyone in your house can issue commands, be it learning the weather, changing the thermostat, ordering detergent, hearing your meeting schedule, or -- eventually, as Google Home doesn't do this yet -- listening to your email. You have been warned. It's not enough that Google knows what you want to know about when you're sitting in front of your computer or fiddling with your phone. It's not enough that Google's Nest thermostat knows when you're home or when you're away, or what the rhythm of your household might be. All of those, you see, require intentional interaction with a device, whether it's a desktop computer, a mobile phone, or a thermostat. With Google Home, Google wants to make it convenient for you to ask it for stuff as casually as asking the air. Whether you're comfortable with that -- or whether it's inevitable regardless of your comfort level -- is for you to decide. At a Glance Google Home Price: $129 (vendor price); also available from several retail outlets Pros: Attractive design; “conversational” search; backed by Google’s immense database Cons: Large power brick; conversational search is still limited RELATED TOPICS Personal Technology Internet of Things Dan Rosenbaum — Contributing Writer Dan Rosenbaum, a contributing writer for Computerworld, is president of Center Ring Media and editor in chief of Wearable Tech Insider.

For about as long as I remember using the Internet, Google has been my encyclopedia, study aide, tour guide, news curator, and more. Given that Google processes more than two trillion searches per year, it’s likely safe to say many Internet users around the world have a similar relationship with the search engine. Google is now looking to deepen our collective reliance on its search prowess by taking up residence in our living rooms, nightstands, and kitchens. Google Home, an Internet-connected speaker that can answer questions, play games and music, and control your other smart devices begins shipping Nov. 4. Google Home is the second big bet by a technology firm that consumers crave a sort of “digital butler” ready at beck and call. The $129 Google Home comes after Amazon’s $179.99 Echo, a similar device, became a surprise hit after launching two years ago. The big difference between Google’s Home and Amazon Echo is the artifical intelligence software powering them. Home runs Google’s newly developed Assistant, essentially a superpowered version of its Siri-like Google Now virtual aide, and which Google pitches as “your own personal Google.” Amazon’s Echo, meanwhile, uses the e-commerce giant’s Alexa AI, which has improved notably in recent months. The similarity between the devices demands a direct comparison. So I replaced my Amazon Echo with the Google Home for the past several days to learn how the two differ. Overall, I found that Google Home is smarter at answering questions and providing helpful, digestible responses, while Echo makes it easier to shop (no surprise, being an Amazon product) and benefits from a range of third-party apps. Here’s a closer look at my experience with the Google Echo. Design In terms of appearance, Google Home fits more naturally into the living room than Amazon’s Echo. With its wider base and slightly sloped top, the Home looks like an air freshener or vase, helping it blend in more seamlessly than Amazon’s tall and narrow Echo. Both devices have a futuristic look about them. Four colored dots illuminate on the top of the Home after you say the “Ok Google” trigger phrase, indicating the device is ready for your question or command. Similarly, the Echo’s rim will begin to glow blue after it hears its “Alexa” wake word. Two key characteristics visually differentiate the Google Home from the Echo. First and foremost, the Home is customizable. The base twists off like a jar lid, making it possible to pop on a different bottom in a new color. (During my time reviewing the Home, I swapped between purple and gray bases.) Google also embedded a touch panel in the top of its Home speaker, which means you can adjust the volume or pause a song by tapping and swiping the Home, in addition to using voice commands. The Google Assistant vs. Amazon Alexa Google Home‘s headlining feature is its ability to answer questions and help you manage daily tasks. In most cases, the Assistant was able to deliver clear and concise answers when asked basic queries, such as requests for nearby restaurants, historical facts, cooking tips, and sports scores. Google’s expertise in areas like search, transportation, and translation clearly help make Home better at answering questions related to those topics. The Google Assistant was able to tell me how long it would take to walk to the nearest Target (It doesn’t yet offer public transportation advice), how to say “food” in Chinese, and how long I should bake chicken breasts for the best results. When trying to get the same answers from the Amazon Echo, Alexa told me it couldn’t pronounce words in Chinese or find the answer to my question about cooking chicken. Although Alexa wasn’t able to give me walking directions to my local Target, it was still able to tell me where it’s located and how many miles away it is from my home. Both the Google Assistant and Amazon Alexa were able to give me traffic updates before heading out to work. I found that Google’s answers were brief but informative, and in several cases clearer than the Echo’s. Amazon’s speaker would sometimes offer long-winded responses that were more difficult to process, which defeats the purpose of using a voice-enabled assistant rather than my smartphone. That said, Amazon’s Echo can do a wider variety of tasks. That’s because it’s compatible with a broader array of smart home devices and has its own catalog of apps, which Amazon calls “skills.” Alexa currently supports more than 4,000 skills, including those which let you order a pizza from Domino’s, check your account balance at Capital One, and find airfare estimates from Kayak. The Echo also works with music services like Spotify, Pandora, and, of course, Amazon Music. Being an Amazon device, it’s also helpful for adding items to your shopping cart, handy when you’re running periously low on paper towels or ketchup. That’s much more than what Google has to offer by way of third-party features. Google Home works with a small smattering of smart home gear, in addition to Google-made devices like the Chromecast. Home also works with recipe platform IFTTT and Uber, and can stream media from Play Music, YouTube, Spotify, Pandora, and TuneIn. The Echo is a little louder than Home, but both offer perfectly adequate audio quality. Google’s Home, however, was often better at answering specific questions. For example, I was able to ask it how to get a stain out of fabric, and it gave me a clear answer. Amazon’s Echo wasn’t always able to answer these kind of queries on its own, making me use third-party skills instead. At that point, it was quicker to use my smartphone. Conclusion The Google Home is a promising first effort that demonstrates how the company can bring its search prowess to the living room. But it’s difficult to recommend it over Amazon’s Echo at this point, which offers a wider feature set. If you’re a heavy Google user and you want a smart speaker for finding quick answers and helping to manage your schedule, Google Home will serve you fine. Others, however, should hold off until the Home is more powerful. Buy here 3.5 out of 5 stars Tap to read full story Read Next Your browser is out of date.

The Google Home, it's listening! The top is cut at a sharp angle. It lets you see the dots from across the room. On the back is a mute button, power light, and Google logo. Let's talk about the top. You've got 12 multi-color lights. Here it is booting up. Normally the lights are off. After you say "Ok Google," four lights kick on and spin around. It looks like Google! Hit the mute button, and the lights turn orange. The top is a touch panel. Scroll your finger around the outside for a volume control. The hardest part is figuring out where to put the power brick. Google Home is a little taller and a little fatter than a can of soda. Here's that power brick again. The bottom of Google Home. The whole bottom pops off. Check out that speaker arrangement! On the back is an old school MicroUSB port. Here's the removable bottom. Those two small circles are magnets. Let's talk bottoms. Here's the default gray fabric one. A nice copper metal cover. It's super heavy. A shimmery fabric blue color. Fresh off the launch of the Google Pixel, the new Google Hardware division is back with its second product: Google Home, a voice command appliance and Google Cast-enabled speaker. There is basically no interface at all to this product—it's all voice commands, all the time. I hope you like speaking to your electronics. Google started its voice recognition journey all the way back in 2007 with "Goog-411," a completely automated phone number lookup service run over a 1-800 number. The human-powered 411 services offered by carriers would apply extra charges to your phone bill, but Google 411 was completely free. Google's goal wasn't to make money on the project, it just wanted to gather as much human speech as possible to build its speech recognition algorithms. Almost 10 years later, the company is finally ready to build a product that completely revolves around voice commands. Google Home is the "Star Trek Computer" the company has always talks about building—at least, it's version 0.1. Yes, Google Home is boldly going where Amazon has gone before. This is an Amazon Echo clone to some degree. Google was beaten to the punch. It's now here to fight the market leader, but recall Google Search, Gmail, Chrome, Google Maps, and Android were "clones" of existing products, too. There's no telling if Google Home will be as successful as those products, but the existence of an established player has never been a much of a roadblock to success for Google before. A Google product makes sense in this area. A voice appliance is, basically, a search engine. You give it some kind of input, and its job is to search through tons of content and third-party integrations to pick out the correct result. It's the same kind of voice recognition and natural language processing technology that Google has been working on for years at Google.com, on Android, and in the Google app. Google Home is packing Google's usual "OK Google" voice system, which has recently been upgraded and rebranded as the "Google Assistant." You'll also get a heavy dose of Chromecast compatibility and media playback via the built-in speaker system. At $129, it's $50 cheaper than the Amazon Echo. If you want to drop the cash on multiple Google Homes, they're also designed to seamlessly mesh together, both in audio playback and voice command response.

By Danny Zepeda | November 3, 2016 Share Stay Connected with Us! Follow TechnoBuffalo The smart home race has been going on for some time, but it still hasn’t quite caught on. There are different types of controls, lights, light switches, speakers and a myriad of other things, but they are all fragmented. Has a solution been found for that? It’s too early to tell, but Google is delivering the hub that will possibly one day control all of those external properties with one single device: Google Home. Amazon Echo already had its turn in trying to fill the space of an always-listening home hub, but it mostly just works to set timers and turn off lights. Google Home has Google’s gargantuan data bucket to draw from, and it hopes that this advantage will separate it from Echo. Introduced in May at Google IO, Google Home is a small speaker with an understated design meant to fade into your furniture. It’s not a black round tower like Alexa with a glowing blue circle. No, Google Home just wants to work for you whenever you need it, without you even noticing it’s there. Some of the notable features of Home include the ability to control music, set timers, cast to Chromecast, query traffic, and, of course, asking Google mundane questions. That sounds pretty close to the Echo’s capabilities but there are some big differences, like the ability to ask follow-up questions. But for as much as Google Home promises to do right with Google’s muscular intelligence, it’s still stuck in a time where every step towards the future just reminds you of how far away we are from it. Lack of support and basic mistakes still drag it down to the dumb, fragmented present. You can play music on Google Home with services like Google Play, Pandora and Spotify, but you can’t control your Lifx bulbs because they are not yet supported (yet Phillips Hue is). You can ask how the traffic is to work, but it can’t set reminders (a function not yet available). You can even ask it to tell you a funny joke, but it can’t read out an email. Google Home is supposed to bring the intelligent Google Assistant to your living room, but a lot of the time it feels like a half-baked service. The concept of a Google-backed hub to control all of the smart home accessories is enticing, but the full realization of that dream is still a few updates or generations away. Google Home is a first generation product and early adopters will suffer a lot of the growing pains of a developing product, but it has a bright future. This is just the first of many “Google Home” products, and when you include Google Wifi and Chromecast, there’s a lot of exciting potential to grow. UPDATE: Correction from our video review, Google Home is contextually aware. But unlike the Google Assistant on the Pixel, to continue a line of questions, you need to use the keyword “Ok Google” after every question.

The partnership between SkyLife and Google helped the local satellite broadcasting operator offer two-way communication for its users. This will enable them to enjoy live video content provided by YouTube or other Android-based multichannel networks (MCN), according to the KT affiliate. "The new service, skyUHD A+, is the first step for us to expand our presence into a converged media platform operator here," a KT SkyLife spokeswoman said. The move came amid the growing popularity of internet-based media platforms with the rise of internet protocol television (IPTV). "The new Android-based platform is expected to drastically change users' viewing experiences at home, as they can access all the Google services _ including YouTube, Google Play Store or Google Play Movie & TV," she said. The platform, which comes with Android 6.0 Marshmallow OS, is also linked to users' mobile devices. For instance, a user can play video on a television by using his or her smartphone, according to KT SkyLife. Users can also enjoy YouTube's 4K UHD video content by using its Android TV application. "SkyUHD A+ can also display a list of recommended content for each user by analyzing their viewing patterns, which will become another major selling point of the new service," the company official said. mhlee@ktimes.com 'Legend of the Blue Sea is our own anc...

Baig , USA TODAY 1:37 p.m. EDT November 3, 2016 Skip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share USA TODAY'S Ed Baig compares Google Home to the Amazon Echo. USA TODAY You can remove the Google Home base to dress it up in different colors (Photo: Google) Ask Google Assistant inside Google Home what it thinks of Amazon Echo's Alexa and you get a gracious reply: “I like Alexa’s blue lights. Her voice is nice too.” (Alexa offers no opinion of the Google Assistant.) Civility aside, the standalone $129 Home speaker that becomes available Friday is Google’s answer to the $179.99 Echo speaker, and a potentially strong answer at that, though Google is still in catchup mode and too often answered my voice queries with a “sorry I don’t know how to help with that yet.” Echo was better at answering questions on who was expected to win the presidential election and who won the World Series and guessing a song you're looking for. Google Home had the edge with some features, like "tell me about my day." Still, the competition between the two cloud-based, artificial intelligence-infused, voice-activated digital assistants is only likely to heat up—and promises to get even better. Gartner recently projected that the global market for wireless speakers enabled by personal assistants will reach $2.1 billion by 2020, up from $360 million last year. OK, Google You summon the Google Assistant on Google Home, with a familiar “OK Google” verbal command, since the only physical button on Home mutes the microphone. Google Home stands roughly half as tall as the cylindrical-shaped Echo and you can change its aesthetic by replacing its base with one of a different color or texture. Indeed, Google Home is meant to be shown off in the home. It slopes down at the top, where you’ll find a capacitive touch surface and hidden LED lights that come alive when you issue a verbal command or Home is responding to your request. This is similar to the lights that ring the top of Echo. You can slide your finger on this touch surface to change the volume on Home, but as with Echo it is much easier to do so via voice (e.g. “OK Google, set volume to 50%.”) Home and Echo each exploit far-field voice recognition microphones, and way more times than not both recognized what I had to say, even with background noise and even if I was on the other side of the room. Both speakers sound pretty swell too, though to my ear, I’d give the nod to Google Home. Alexa has a head start: I’ve been a huge fan of the Echo/Alexa tandem for some time. Amazon’s speaker has obviously had a big head start versus the Google Assistant’s own voice, which only recently debuted as a key feature inside the Google Pixel smartphone. (A non-verbal version of the Assistant launched prior to that inside the Google Allo messaging app.) According to Amazon, tens of thousands of developers are building Alexa “skills” and there are more than 4,000 such skills already in place. Alexa has also expanded voice beyond the original Echo into spin-off products such Echo Dot and Amazon Tap, not to mention certain Fire Tablets and Fire TV devices. For its part, Google doesn’t kick off its developer platform for the Google Assistant until next month, and you do wish it could do more right at launch. Google Home still doesn’t handle some of the basics that Alexa can do, such as setting reminders or letting you add entries to your Google Calendar. It can let you know what is already on your Google Calendar. Overlapping capabilities. That said, both Alexa and Google Assistant are already capable of delivering on overlapping vocal stunts: among them, adjust a Nest thermostat, turn Philips Hue lights on or off, arrange a ride through Uber, convert euros to dollars, solve math problems, set timers, tell jokes, and deliver the news, sports and weather. And of course they both play music or radio stations. Google Home can play music, radio or podcasts from Google Play Music, Spotify, YouTube Music, Pandora and TuneIn, and through accessory Chromecast devices and Cast-capable speakers, numerous other apps. It comes with a six-month subscription to YouTube Red. If you have more than one Google Home unit you can take advantage of multi-room capabilities to hear the same song in different rooms. Via voice, I was also to “cast” a video of Uptown Funk from YouTube videos onto a TV connected with Chromecast. That's pretty cool and not something Echo is capable of. For its part, Echo can tap into Spotify, Pandora and TuneIn, as well as iHeartRadio and Amazon Music. Google Home  (Photo: Google) Where Google excels. Google Home’s biggest advantage over Alexa comes with the rich reservoir of knowledge that defines Google itself.  So Google Home can translate words and phrases into foreign languages—Alexa cannot do that right now. Within limits, Google is also ahead of Echo in conversational speech, the idea that you can ask follow up questions to your original request, without repeating every parameter of that request. I asked how the Google Assistant how far Neptune is from the Earth and got a detailed response from Space.com. I followed up by asking, “how about Saturn?” without having to repeat “from the Earth.” Alexa could answer the first question but couldn’t handle the follow-up. In another fun example, I asked the Assistant to “start instrument tuner.” It asked me which which musical note I wanted to hear. When I responded with “A,” “C,” “D” or whatever, Google Home played the scale for that note. I like how you can ask the Assistant to “surprise me.” Upon doing so, Home rattles off random factoids (e.g., citing Wikipedia, the Assistant mentioned that “apple seeds contain a small amount of cyanide.”) I also appreciate how Google Home responds to a “tell me about my day” query, with an immediate summary of the local weather and traffic, followed by a listing of upcoming calendar appointments, and then, the headlines from NPR, Fox News and other sources. I got hooked on this Google Assistant feature on the Pixel. Unfortunately, for now, Google Home supports only a single Google account holder, meaning family members can’t ask about their own specific daily agenda. What’s more, you keep hearing how Google Assistant learns from you, but if all the members of your household start firing away requests, Google Home can’t distinguish one person from another. Among the other growing pains I encountered during my tests: Google Home froze in the middle of a trivia game I was playing. Where Echo prevails. As I pointed out, Amazon is way ahead in the skills department. And Echo gave a more satisfying answer to the question  “Who will win the presidential election?” No, it didn’t respond with Clinton or Trump. But it gave me results from the RealClear Politics polling average. Google said it couldn’t help with this yet. And when I commanded Echo to “play that famous song from The Wizard of Oz” it began playing the soundtrack.” The same query on Google Home began with a Spotify playlist that was completely off the mark. Echo also did better at helping me findi nearby sushi restaurants. While Amazon Echo costs more than Google Home, Echo Dot is a comparative bargain at $49.99. Its speaker is ho-hum, though you can connect it via Bluetooth to better speakers, just as you can connect Google Home to better Chromecast-enabled speakers. Room to grow. The results you get with both assistants often still have to do with how you ask your question. When game 7 between the Cubs and Indians entered extra innings Wednesday night, I asked both assistants the identical question: “What’s happening in the World Series?” Alexa responded by starting an NPR flash briefing and Google Home came back with the frustrating “I don’t know how to help with that yet.” When I instead asked “What’s the score of the Cubs game?” Echo correctly informed me that it was 6-6 at the time. Google Home instead gave me the prior night’s result. Suffice to say, there’s room for improvement. But having two of tech’s heavyweights push one another in the Home is ultimately good news for the consumer. Along the way hopefully the Google Assistant will remain civil to Alexa--and vice versa.

Here's what communities and citizens can learn about the benefits of the onrushing digital transformation. Read More I didn't understand the value of an always-listening device. In some aspects, I'm yet to figure it out. Eventually, I put an Amazon Echo in my house, and for the first month, my family and I used it all the time. From playing music during dinner to asking random questions and playing Harry Potter trivia games. But, as time has passed, its primary use is now reserved for setting timers along with my kids putting random condiments in my Amazon shopping cart as a prank. When Google announced its version of the Echo, Google Home, I was immediately interested. The thought of a personal assistant in the form of a speaker on my desk being the same personal assistant I interact with on my phone is intriguing, and something Amazon can't come close to offering with Alexa. Google Assistant on Home is far from perfect. It can't answer every query, and it has a hard time keeping context within a string of commands. There's lots of work to do, or as Google executives prefer to say: "It's early days." And yet, Home feels very much like it's from the future. An unassuming device Google Home with alternative bases. Jason Cipriani/ZDNet Top ZDNET Reviews Dell Latitude 11 5000 7.9 Apple iPhone 7 Plus 9.3 Amazon Echo 9.0 Google Pixel XL Phone 8.0 There's not a whole lot to Google Home. Standing 5.62-inches tall and 3.79-inches round, the bottom third of Home is covered with a decorative speaker grill. Google sells additional bases, which are made of metal or fabric in various colors starting at $20. The top of Home has a ring of indicator lights that turn on when it's listening for a command, and the back of the device has a mute button along with a power indicator light. Home's design reminds me more of something I would expect a home fragrance company like Scentsy to offer. It tends to blend into your surroundings, or at least it does a better job than the Amazon Echo (Echo Dot notwithstanding). Setting up Home is done through a companion app on an iOS or Android device, taking me under 15 minutes to complete. Think of the Home app as the control center for Home and any other Chromecast devices you own. An Assistant across multiple devices Google Home looks more like a Scentsy accessory than an always-listening speaker. Jason Cipriani/ZDNet Right now, you can access Google Assistant across several devices. Android and iOS users can use the chat app Allo to interact via text with Assistant. Google Pixel owners can use voice or text. And, of course, there's voice access with Google Home. CNET Smart Home Guide From connected light bulbs, to plant sensors, to smart locks, and beyond, smart home tech is growing and evolving rapidly. Here you'll find the latest product reviews, news, and how-tos to help you connect your surroundings to the internet in the smartest way possible. Read More The experience of Assistant on the Pixel and Assistant on Google Home is very similar. To activate Assistant, you use the wake phrase of "OK Google" followed by a command. For example, "OK Google, play some music" will begin playing music using your preferred music service. Or "OK Google, tell me about my day" will run through the weather forecast, commute time, any items on your agenda, and then play a news podcast of your choosing. The biggest selling point of Google Home is that it's not a standalone product, but instead it's an extension of Google products across multiple platforms. You don't have to learn the semantic nuances of interacting with yet another personal assistant, as is the case with Alexa. With Google Assistant, you can interact with it using the same commands and queries, regardless if it's through Google Home, your Pixel phone, or an iPhone. There are some limitations, including the inability to use Google Assistant on the Pixel to begin playing a YouTube video on a nearby Chromecast. For the most part, however, the experiences and capabilities line up with what you'd expect from a portable device like your phone -- and one that is stationary in your home. Using Assistant on a Pixel and Home when the two devices are in the same room is a non-issue. When using the wake phrase, both devices naturally begin to listen. On a Pixel, that means the screen lights up and the Assistant interface is displayed. For Google Home, the indicator lights are activated. However, as you continue with the interaction, Assistant on Pixel realizes a nearby Home device is responding and your phone stops listening. A brief message is displayed on the phone, stating "Answering on another device". One of the issues I encounter using Siri on my iPhone and Apple Watch is that both devices listen for and respond to voice commands without ceding power to whichever one makes more sense to use based on the command. OK Google, OK Google, OK Google The back of Google Home where you find the power cable, a power indicator light, and a mute button to disable the microphone. Jason Cipriani/ZDNet Right now, OK Google is the lone phrase you can use to get Google Home's attention. It's frustrating repeating a rather lengthy phrase over and over when interacting with Home. Just imagine repeating these phrases during the course of a few short minutes. It becomes a mouthful. "OK Google, play." "OK Google, next." "OK Google, stop." "OK Google, tell me about my day." "OK Google volume level one." Google's use of this phrase originated from Google Glass, and it made sense at the time. Glass was a device surrounded by privacy concerns from day one, and having a concise wake phrase made it clear to everyone nearby when a user was interacting with the camera-equipped headset. Interacting with Google Home is something you are doing in the privacy of your own home. As such, having the option to customize -- or at the very least shorten -- the wake command is something Google needs to consider. Privacy concerns Naturally, whenever there's a connected device sitting with a microphone that's always on and listening, privacy concerns are sure to follow. As is the case with similar devices, Google Home is only listening for its wake command. Only after hearing it, does the device begin transmitting what is said to Google's servers to decipher whatever action it needs to take. You can view all of your personal recordings in the My Activity section of the Home app or by visiting a dedicated webpage that details your use. Through the site, you can listen to recorded commands and delete recordings you don't want Google to have. Additionally, a button on the back of Home will disable the microphone. You can still interact with Home by touching the top of the device until it lights up. With the microphone disabled, you turn Home into a device that only listens after physical interaction, in turn losing out on the convenience of giving commands from across the room. Performance and overall experience Google Home with its based removed, revealing its speaker layout. Jason Cipriani/ZDNet A week after welcoming Home into my home, I'm really impressed with Google's approach. The microphones are sensitive enough to pick up my kids whispering "OK Google" from two rooms away, and the speaker is loud enough to fill my office with music in place of my Sonos speaker. I've used Home nonstop since it arrived, doing things like streaming music and setting timers. It seems basic, but those two tasks are very repetitive, and something that no longer takes the same amount of my attention away from what I'm currently doing. Google Home is more than a pathway to music and timers; it can interact with devices within my home as well. After linking Home to my Nest account, I can now adjust the thermostat with my voice just as you can when using the Echo. If you own a Chromecast streaming device, Home automatically recognizes it and allows you to play content on your TV using nothing more than your voice. For example, "OK Google play Vice News on TV" will begin streaming the latest YouTube videos in the Vice News YouTube channel with little effort on my part. Even more impressive is the lack of a delay between the time the command is registered and when the video starts playing. I cannot wait until Google adds support for more services, such as Netflix or HBO Go. There's something fun, if not magical, about giving a voice command and a few seconds later watching your TV turn on and begin playing a show. It's not perfect. As useful as Google Home is for certain tasks, it falls flat for others. Asking Home for the start time of World Series Game 7 returns the expected result, but a follow-up command of "Add it to my calendar" fails with the response "Sorry, I can't add events to your calendar yet." A Google representative tells me adding the ability to create events on a calendar and send messages is something the company will eventually add but stopped short of providing any sort of timeframe. Asking "Who wears number nine for the Colorado Avalanche" gets the response "I'm not sure how to help with that yet, but I'm learning more every day." The same query with Siri returns Matt Duchene, as it should. That's just a couple examples of something Google Home, and by extension Google Assistant, should be able to handle but can't. Early days, indeed. Should you buy one? Ah, yes, the $129 question. Is Google Home something you should buy? As is usually the case, it depends. Seamlessly interacting with Assistant across multiple devices and through various mediums is a critical feature that can't be overlooked. For someone who is heavily invested in Google services, I see no reason not to recommend it. Google Assistant leverages the data you already provide to the company and creates one of the more robust personal assistant experiences currently available. For those who don't use Google services like Gmail or Calendar, Google Home can still provide you with access to Google's knowledge graph for quick searches, and it's a capable speaker all in one.

USA TODAY You can remove the Google Home base to dress it up in different colors (Photo: Google) Ask Google Assistant inside Google Home what it thinks of Amazon Echo's Alexa and you get a gracious reply: “I like Alexa’s blue lights. Her voice is nice too.” (Alexa offers no opinion of the Google Assistant.) Civility aside, the standalone $129 Home speaker that becomes available Friday is Google’s answer to the $179.99 Echo speaker, and a potentially strong answer at that, though Google is still in catchup mode and too often answered my voice queries with a “sorry I don’t know how to help with that yet.” Echo was better at answering questions on who was expected to win the presidential election and who won the World Series and guessing a song you're looking for. Google Home had the edge with some features, like "tell me about my day." Still, the competition between the two cloud-based, artificial intelligence-infused, voice-activated digital assistants is only likely to heat up—and promises to get even better. Gartner recently projected that the global market for wireless speakers enabled by personal assistants will reach $2.1 billion by 2020, up from $360 million last year. OK, Google You summon the Google Assistant on Google Home, with a familiar “OK Google” verbal command, since the only physical button on Home mutes the microphone. Google Home stands roughly half as tall as the cylindrical-shaped Echo and you can change its aesthetic by replacing its base with one of a different color or texture. Indeed, Google Home is meant to be shown off in the home. It slopes down at the top, where you’ll find a capacitive touch surface and hidden LED lights that come alive when you issue a verbal command or Home is responding to your request. This is similar to the lights that ring the top of Echo. You can slide your finger on this touch surface to change the volume on Home, but as with Echo it is much easier to do so via voice (e.g. “OK Google, set volume to 50%.”) Home and Echo each exploit far-field voice recognition microphones, and way more times than not both recognized what I had to say, even with background noise and even if I was on the other side of the room. Both speakers sound pretty swell too, though to my ear, I’d give the nod to Google Home. Alexa has a head start: I’ve been a huge fan of the Echo/Alexa tandem for some time. Amazon’s speaker has obviously had a big head start versus the Google Assistant’s own voice, which only recently debuted as a key feature inside the Google Pixel smartphone. (A non-verbal version of the Assistant launched prior to that inside the Google Allo messaging app.) According to Amazon, tens of thousands of developers are building Alexa “skills” and there are more than 4,000 such skills already in place. Alexa has also expanded voice beyond the original Echo into spin-off products such Echo Dot and Amazon Tap, not to mention certain Fire Tablets and Fire TV devices. For its part, Google doesn’t kick off its developer platform for the Google Assistant until next month, and you do wish it could do more right at launch. Google Home still doesn’t handle some of the basics that Alexa can do, such as setting reminders or letting you add entries to your Google Calendar. It can let you know what is already on your Google Calendar. Overlapping capabilities. That said, both Alexa and Google Assistant are already capable of delivering on overlapping vocal stunts: among them, adjust a Nest thermostat, turn Philips Hue lights on or off, arrange a ride through Uber, convert euros to dollars, solve math problems, set timers, tell jokes, and deliver the news, sports and weather. And of course they both play music or radio stations. Google Home can play music, radio or podcasts from Google Play Music, Spotify, YouTube Music, Pandora and TuneIn, and through accessory Chromecast devices and Cast-capable speakers, numerous other apps. It comes with a six-month subscription to YouTube Red. If you have more than one Google Home unit you can take advantage of multi-room capabilities to hear the same song in different rooms. Via voice, I was also to “cast” a video of Uptown Funk from YouTube videos onto a TV connected with Chromecast. That's pretty cool and not something Echo is capable of. For its part, Echo can tap into Spotify, Pandora and TuneIn, as well as iHeartRadio and Amazon Music. Google Home  (Photo: Google) Where Google excels. Google Home’s biggest advantage over Alexa comes with the rich reservoir of knowledge that defines Google itself.  So Google Home can translate words and phrases into foreign languages—Alexa cannot do that right now. Within limits, Google is also ahead of Echo in conversational speech, the idea that you can ask follow up questions to your original request, without repeating every parameter of that request. I asked how the Google Assistant how far Neptune is from the Earth and got a detailed response from Space.com. I followed up by asking, “how about Saturn?” without having to repeat “from the Earth.” Alexa could answer the first question but couldn’t handle the follow-up. In another fun example, I asked the Assistant to “start instrument tuner.” It asked me which which musical note I wanted to hear. When I responded with “A,” “C,” “D” or whatever, Google Home played the scale for that note. I like how you can ask the Assistant to “surprise me.” Upon doing so, Home rattles off random factoids (e.g., citing Wikipedia, the Assistant mentioned that “apple seeds contain a small amount of cyanide.”) I also appreciate how Google Home responds to a “tell me about my day” query, with an immediate summary of the local weather and traffic, followed by a listing of upcoming calendar appointments, and then, the headlines from NPR, Fox News and other sources. I got hooked on this Google Assistant feature on the Pixel. Unfortunately, for now, Google Home supports only a single Google account holder, meaning family members can’t ask about their own specific daily agenda. What’s more, you keep hearing how Google Assistant learns from you, but if all the members of your household start firing away requests, Google Home can’t distinguish one person from another. Among the other growing pains I encountered during my tests: Google Home froze in the middle of a trivia game I was playing. Where Echo prevails. As I pointed out, Amazon is way ahead in the skills department. And Echo gave a more satisfying answer to the question  “Who will win the presidential election?” No, it didn’t respond with Clinton or Trump. But it gave me results from the RealClear Politics polling average. Google said it couldn’t help with this yet. And when I commanded Echo to “play that famous song from The Wizard of Oz” it began playing the soundtrack.” The same query on Google Home began with a Spotify playlist that was completely off the mark. Echo also did better at helping me findi nearby sushi restaurants. While Amazon Echo costs more than Google Home, Echo Dot is a comparative bargain at $49.99. Its speaker is ho-hum, though you can connect it via Bluetooth to better speakers, just as you can connect Google Home to better Chromecast-enabled speakers. Room to grow. The results you get with both assistants often still have to do with how you ask your question. When game 7 between the Cubs and Indians entered extra innings Wednesday night, I asked both assistants the identical question: “What’s happening in the World Series?” Alexa responded by starting an NPR flash briefing and Google Home came back with the frustrating “I don’t know how to help with that yet.” When I instead asked “What’s the score of the Cubs game?” Echo correctly informed me that it was 6-6 at the time. Google Home instead gave me the prior night’s result. Suffice to say, there’s room for improvement. But having two of tech’s heavyweights push one another in the Home is ultimately good news for the consumer. Along the way hopefully the Google Assistant will remain civil to Alexa--and vice versa.

Google Home, the voice-assistant smart speaker Google debuted last month, officially launched on Thursday. With years of search data collection under its belt, Google is poised — in theory — to take on the Amazon Echo and become a remote control for your life. But before we start calling it an Echo killer, let’s take a close look at how it actually handles voice and service commands. I tried the small round speaker in various rooms throughout my home — one that’s already become used to the superb Echo and its built-in assistant, Alexa. Out of the box, Google Home is a solid home accessory for those who want to control apps and services with their voice. Its voice assistant, appropriately called Google Assistant, responds to the trigger word “OK, Google.” And at $129, the gadget is significantly cheaper than the $180 Echo. Like the Echo, Google Home connects to your home Wi-Fi, while a companion app saves and displays your searches or queries. I had difficulty connecting Chromecast, Google’s streaming dongle, and my calendar to the Home app, but eventually got it set up correctly in the kitchen. Google’s device gave recipes for baked chicken, read the news to me from NPR and played my Spotify Discover playlist. While it fit nicely in a corner, the cord was a bit of an eyesore with limited counter space. But it wasn’t exactly the game changer I expected. Frequently, the assistant’s response to my questions and commands were met with the following: “I don’t know how to help with that yet, but I’m still learning.” In fact, Google Home has a bit of catching up to do with the Echo, which has been on the market for two years. Both devices successfully told me facts about President Barack Obama when asked, but only Amazon’s device provided the Rangers score in real time. A follow-up question about the World Series turned up empty with Google Home; Echo gave the date and start times to the next game. This was disappointing considering Google’s robust search engine — after all, the Echo relies on Bing, widely regarded as an inferior search engine. It’s key to remember Google Assistant is still a nascent product with limited third-party apps. This is an area where the Echo already excels, thanks to thousands of “skills” and app integrations. Google’s repertoire of early partners include Uber — allowing you to call up a car via a voice request — as well as music Spotify and Pandora. It also lets you control smart products in the home, such as Nest thermostats and Philips Hue light bulbs. When Google Home debuted last month, Rishi Chandra, vice president of product management for Home products, said he anticipates Google Assistant being as big or bigger than Android, the company’s mobile operating system. “Once we open this up, we’re very good at building developer ecosystems,” he said. “[When] we have real momentum, the scale Google can bring is so unique that we will have tons of people participating.” Google Assistant’s Actions on Google program will open up to developers in December. As a speaker itself, Google Home struggled to hear and understand my commands. I often had to repeat myself and shout at the device. In contrast, Echo responds even when I’m in another room. But the audio quality on both is similar and adequate. If you’re looking for top-shelf sound for blasting your favorite tunes, you’re better off using bluetooth speakers like Sonos. While the Amazon Echo has an edge up on Home for now — you can even buy items from Amazon directly via your voice — Google has a better grasp on languages. When asked to translate the word “hello” to Spanish, Google Home responded correctly. Although Alexa could not pronounce it, it wrote out translation in the Alexa app. Once Google Assistant learns commands and connects to more services, it will be a forceful competitor to Amazon’s Echo. For now, it has a bit more growing to do. It’s also important for buyers to consider which ecosystem they want to be a part of. If you’re already entrenched in Google services, Google Home might be more appealing. But for frequent Amazon shoppers, the Echo is your obvious choice. Forget your old alarm system.

Like many tech enthusiasts, I’ve been using a $180 Amazon Echo intelligent speaker at my home for a year or more. And, while I love using it for some things — playing music and podcasts, setting timers, and re-ordering items from Amazon — I’ve come to realize that, like Apple’s Siri and all other virtual assistants, its Alexa voice-driven artificial intelligence system disappoints a lot. So I was excited to test Google Home, the $129 Echo competitor that puts the search giant’s much-touted new Google Assistant intelligence technology inside a small, but powerful Echo-like speaker and microphone unit. Surely, I thought, after collecting all that info about the world (and about me) for years and years, Google would crush Amazon in the home-intelligence race. But after nearly a week of using two Google Home units in two different rooms, my conclusions are decidedly mixed. Google Home does beat Alexa and the Echo in some ways, but it’s remarkably dumb in others. It needs enough work that, if I were Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, I wouldn’t be losing any sleep about it, at least not yet. Really? It looks so good! In my opinion, and, more importantly, that of my wife (whose taste is much better than mine and whose tech addiction much less) the Google Home looks a lot better than the Echo. While the Echo is a tall black metal cylinder, Google’s contender is a smaller, more stylish, white plastic cylinder with an angled top and a mesh speaker base. You can get alternate bases in different colors. The top is touch sensitive, and has built-in lights that show when the Home is ready to accept a command. It snaps to attention when it hears the trigger phrases “OK, Google” or “Hey, Google”. (The Echo’s trigger phrase can be set to simply “Alexa”, “Echo” or “Amazon”.) You can raise or lower the volume, or pause or resume something, using voice commands. Or you can control the volume by tracing a circle on the top and play / pause by gently tapping it. I were Jeff Bezos, I wouldn’t be losing any sleep about Google Home I ran into some glitches with setup, which is performed using an Android or iOS app called Google Home. My first unit wouldn’t recognize my Wi-Fi network and I had to use a temporary workaround to get connected. Google said that might be because I was using an Eero router system. It says it has seen issues with Eero and is working to resolve them. The Echo just a few inches away had no problem with the Eero Wi-Fi and neither did the Google Pixel phone or iPhone I was using, also within inches of the Google Home. In the case of both Google Home units, the app reported trouble completing an initial update of the device. Google says it believes this was a bug which it will fix. It’s not OK, Google. There’s an election going on! In my tests, it was often a toss-up as to whether the Google Assistant or Alexa would do better. For instance, when I asked “who’s running for president?”, Home listed the two main third-party candidates as well as the major-party nominees; the Echo left out Gary Johnson and Jill Stein. But when I asked Google Home, in four different ways, to give me the latest election polls, it answered “Sorry, I can’t help with that yet, but my team’s helping me learn,” the device’s go-to excuse. The Echo piped right up with the latest average of polls from the respected site RealClearPolitics. Google says that, by election day next week, Home will be able to say who’s won or who’s winning for president, via a variety of queries — but that seems a tad late. Google Home currently only supports a single Google account Google Home knew the address of my office. The Echo told me either the address of the nearest post office, or, when I asked using the words “work address”, said it couldn’t help. But, while Google Home couldn’t give me any info about my calendar (which is kept on Google Calendar, but via a different account), the Echo knew all about it. (Google Home currently only supports a single Google account. I chose my personal account, which contains most of my search data. Google says it’s working on enabling multiple accounts.) Lincoln vs. Lipitor When I asked “where is the nearest pharmacy?” (a question suggested for reviewers by Google), Google Home was dumb. It listed three. One was the correct answer (a CVS) — but with the wrong address. A second was the clinic inside the same drugstore, which isn’t a pharmacy. The third was a nearby supermarket that lacks a pharmacy. The Echo gave me the CVS and also the nearest Walgreens, plus two smaller ones. Google Home couldn’t take a note or set a reminder, like the Echo can. Google says it’s working on adding that. The Home’s speaker is a bit fuzzy On the other hand, Google Home carried on a conversation with me about Abraham Lincoln, telling me first when he was born, and then answering several other queries about him without requiring me to repeat his name. The Echo couldn’t do this. Home gave a detailed answer to the question of when Jimmy Fallon was in the cast of Saturday Night Live, while the Echo had no idea. For playing music, Google mostly did well. Home supports Spotify and Pandora, but I set it to rely on Google’s own Google Play and YouTube services. It handled even my hand-crafted playlists fine. But it occasionally stopped playing a song for a few seconds and then resumed. While the sound from Home was quite good, my wife and I preferred the Echo’s sound slightly, both for music and voices. The Echo’s speaker was crisper, the Home’s a tiny bit fuzzy, to our ears. Also, on at least one album (the “Sleepless in Seattle” soundtrack), Home repeatedly declined to play more than one song, while the Echo played them all. Like the Echo, Google Home can control some third-party smart home devices, but I couldn’t test this, as I have decided not to help bring down the internet by owning such devices. Video via voice Home is much less versatile than Echo, because it lacks the thousands of third-party apps (or “skills”) that the latter boasts. But it has its own special trick: it can, via a voice command, allow you to cast streaming videos or programs to your TV, provided you have one of Google’s Chromecast devices. For now, these videos have to come from Google’s own YouTube service, but the company says Netflix and others are coming. The mics aren’t quite as good as the Echo’s In my tests, I was able to get all the Saturday Night Live presidential debate parodies to play on my TV using just Google Home and a single voice command. I also used Home to cast rock star music videos, other TV clips and a random YouTube video of a person playing a guitar. About that guitar video: I saw it due to the fact that the dual long-range mics on the Home simply couldn’t grasp the name of my colleague “Lauren Goode” despite repeated attempts (you should watch her YouTube videos anyway.) So I saw other people. I had a handful of other experiences in which the Google Home mics just couldn’t figure out what I was saying. At other times they seemed overly sensitive. For instance, if you have two Home units set up, as I did, only the one closest to you is supposed to respond to your voice. I found this generally true, but on two occasions, both units responded. Overall, the mics had very good range and accuracy, even several rooms away, but not quite as good as the 7-mic array on the Amazon product. If you do spring for multiple Google Home speakers, you can set them up, via the app, to play the same music in multiple rooms. This worked fine for me. Speaking of the app, it works on both Android and iPhone, and I tested both successfully. Privacy A lot of people might be suspicious about placing a constantly-listening Google device in their homes, since the company is famous for collecting personal information. I asked Google about this, and a person who worked on Google Home swore that it only collects what you say after it hears the trigger phrases. Further, he said, the data goes into the same data store as other information Google collects about you. And, like that information, you can tweak or even delete it at myactivity.google.com. Bottom Line To paraphrase Google’s own CEO, Sundar Pichai, artificial intelligence is still in its very early days. And, in my opinion, Google Home shows that. I have no doubt it will improve. But I was surprised that Google Home arrived so rough around the edges, especially when it had an existing competitive product to learn from, and an unmatched wealth of data to draw upon. Like a dominating batter in a tight World Series game, you kind of expect Google to hit a game-winning homer. But it merely hit a double, and the contest is still very much on.

That last part makes all the difference this year. Google is using their control to push the Pixel phones harder than they ever did with Nexus devices. According to one analytics firm, it’s working wonders so far. Appboy reports that it took one week for the Pixel XL to reach the market share that tool the Nexus 6P two weeks. Even better news is the numbers after one week of sales. The Pixel went up 274% and the Pixel XL went up 158%. That all sounds great (and it is), but to put things in perspective, the chart below includes the Samsung Galaxy S7 and Samsung Galaxy S6. Google has a long way to go to match those numbers. Still, Google should be very happy with initial sales and word of mouth. The buzz about the “Google phone” has been louder than any Nexus. The mainstream is interested in what Google has to offer.

 REVIEW: Google Home is a win (and better than the Amazon Echo) Steve Kovach Nov. 3, 2016, 9:00 AM 14,372 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Google Home.Hollis Johnson/Business Insider Google may be late to the hardware game, but that doesn't seem to matter. In addition to the excellent new Pixel phone, Google is releasing an enticing new WiFi speaker called Google Home this week.  It’s best to think of Home as Google’s version of the Amazon Echo, a WiFi speaker that reacts to voice commands so you can play music from streaming services like Spotify, get news and weather updates, call an Uber, or get answers to basic questions like how many calories are in a baked potato. Echo was the first real connected product that actually makes sense in the your home, and this is Google's take on the category. But Google Home is a much more “Googly” take on the concept, injecting the search giant’s vast knowledge of the web’s information into its new Google Assistant and culling together a lot of the services you probably already use like Google Calendar, Gmail, and search. The result is a more personal and customized helper. It’s everything that made Google Assistant so great on the company’s new Pixel phone, stuffed into a $129 connected speaker. Home is a brilliant first step towards Google’s ambition to make the Assistant available everywhere. Home is an exciting product, and you're going to want one. The speaker Google Home is dead-simple to use and install. Plug it in, fire up the new Google Home app on your phone, connect the speaker to your WiFi network, and log into your Google account. That’s it. From there you can link music services like Spotify and Pandora or take advantage of the free six-month YouTube Red trial, which also gives you unlimited streaming music and an ad-free YouTube experience. Logging into your Google account gives you all the benefits of the new Google Assistant. The Home speaker is a lot smaller than I expected, about half the height of Amazon Echo. But it’s also more attractive than the Echo, which has a cold, industrial vibe to it. Home looks like an Air Wick air freshener from the future and fits more naturally into a living room’s decor. You won’t be embarrassed displaying this thing where everyone can see it. You can also swap out the speaker grill on the bottom with different colors like copper or blue, but I’m boring and stuck with the standard gray color Home ships with. There are a variety of base colors to choose from.Hollis Johnson/Business Insider Voice recognition is shockingly accurate too. Home can understand you from across the room, even if it’s pumping out music at a loud volume. (You activate it by saying “OK, Google.”) Google already excels at accurate voice recognition, and Home is no exception. It almost never stumbled when I asked it something. There are also limited controls on the device itself. The top is a touchpad that you can swipe to adjust the volume or tap to play/pause music. But Home, like the Echo, is really designed to be controlled with your voice. I didn’t use the touch controls very much, but my cat did figure it out pretty quickly and scared the living daylights out of himself when my Spotify Discovery Weekly playlist started blasting after he pressed his nose against the touchpad. Larry FREAKED when he accidentally activated my Google Home.Steve Kovach/Business Insider There’s a big flaw with things on the hardware side of Home. Audio quality is borderline terrible. While the speaker is plenty loud, the sound came out tinny or high pitched, which is annoying when listening to anything that requires some bass. It probably won't bother most people, but after listening to the excellent quality of the Echo and my Sonos Play One speaker for so long, I couldn't help but notice the dip in quality. (By the way, Sonos and Echo will start working together early next year.) Luckily, Google Home does work with Chromecast Audio, the dongle that you can attach to regular speakers and stream music. That’s going to be the best option for now if you care about audio quality. Speaking of the Chromecast, Google Home can also control the version that plugs into your TV so you can start playing videos with just a voice command. It only works with YouTube for now, but Netflix support is coming soon. You can bet other services will want to tie in if Home really takes off. It’s a much better solution for TV voice control than shouting into your remote like you have to with Apple TV or Roku. And who needs fancy menus on the screen when you can just say what you want to watch and have your TV light up? Chromecast Audio will let you control any standard stereo with Google Home.Tim Schofield (Qbking77)/YouTube Finally, Google Home can control a variety of smart home appliances like the Nest thermostat, Phillips Hue lights, and a host of other gadgets. It’s the same concept as the Echo’s smart home control. Just tell the speaker what you want to happen (turn off the lights, set the thermostat to 70, etc.) and Home will handle the rest. I don’t have any smart appliances in my home, so I didn’t get to test this feature. I doubt many of you will either, since the whole smart home dream is quite out of reach for most. The Assistant The real star is Google Assistant, Google’s new digital helper that had an impressive debut on the Pixel phone that launched last month. Overall, Google Assistant is smarter and more capable than Apple’s Siri or Amazon’s Alexa, which I think gives Home a slight edge over Echo for now. But it’s also clear that we’re in the early days of the growing digital-assistant-in-a-speaker category, and it’s going to take some time before these products fully mature. Google Assistant on the Pixel.Hollis Johnson/Business Insider I’ve been using Google Assistant on the Pixel and Home for about three weeks, and I’m still surprised and delighted by all the things it can do. Beyond the basics, its real strength is seamlessly syncing with all the Google services you normally use. Need to know if your flight is on time? Just ask Google Home, which can scan your Gmail account for the flight confirmation sent by your airline. Same goes for package deliveries, calendar appointments, and so much more. This really comes together in the new “Good Morning” feature on Home, which gives you a rundown of your day based on information stored in your Google account. For example, when I greet my Home with “OK, Google. Good morning,” I get a weather report, the commute time to my office, appointments in my calendar for the day, and a snapshot of the news from outlets like NPR. It’s already the first thing I do when I wake up and start getting ready in the morning. Lights on the top indicate the volume level.Hollis Johnson/Business Insider My only gripe is that I wish I could link multiple accounts to Home, instead of just my personal Gmail account. Most of my calendar appointments are stored on my work calendar, which also happens to be powered by Google, so it’d be nice Home could sync with that too. Since Google does search better than any other company, Home can answer most of your basic queries. Just ask it anything you’d normally type into Google and Home will spit out the one answer you’re looking for. The Echo can do some of that, but Google has a major advantage when it comes to tapping into the vast knowledge of the internet and reliably delivering the information you need. Unlike Siri, it’s rare that you’ll stump Google Assistant. That’s the key differentiator between Assistant and the rest of the competition. No one is better at delivering the information you need than Google. Just ask it anything and you’ll likely be surprised. Music Music playback on Home is pretty much what you’d expect. It works with Google Music, YouTube Red, Spotify, and Pandora for now, and you can set which service you want as your default. From there, just tell Home what you want to listen to and you’re good to go. I had no problem getting it to play my Spotify playlists, and there's some extra intelligence built in so you can be pretty vague about what you want to listen to and still get the right song. ("OK Google, play the new Lady Gaga album.")  Music will likely be the feature you use the most, and Home works great no matter which streaming service you favor. Hollis Johnson/Business Insider Third-party apps The only major thing missing from Google Home right now is third-party app support. It does have Uber and all those music services I mentioned earlier, but it’s lacking the hundreds of third-party "skills" the Amazon Echo has. Of course, Echo has had over a year head start on Home, and Google will be opening Home up to more developers soon. It’s hardly a deal breaker, and Assistant is good enough on its own to do pretty much everything you want anyway. Conclusion Google introduced a new version of itself at its big product launch event last month. It's finally getting serious about hardware in order to push its excellent ecosystem of services forward. The Pixel phone was a great start, and Home is a thoughtful way to make Assistant even more accessible. Home may be a brand new category of gadget, but Assistant is so smart and works so well that it's like experiencing a bit of the future right now. It's one of those rare products you didn't even know you needed. SEE ALSO: The Google Pixel review NOW WATCH: We got our hands on the Home — Google’s answer to the Amazon Echo Loading video...

clock menu more-arrow Circuit Breaker Google Home Google Home review: Home is where the smart is Help me, Google by Dan Seifert@dcseifert Nov 3, 2016, 9:00am EDT share tweet Linkedin For over a decade, Google search has been indispensable. It’s the first place we go whenever we need to find information on virtually anything. It’s used countless times a day on our computers, our phones, sometimes even in our cars and on our wrists. Using Google search, whether it’s to win an argument, self-diagnose an injury, or just to look up what other people are saying about you, has become second nature. Our interactions with Google have always revolved around screens. But if you ask futurists what the next platform for interaction is, chances are they’ll say there’s no screen involved. In the future, we’ll be able to access information without having to type on keyboards, tap on screens, or even hold anything in our hands. So it’s not surprising that Google is making a massive effort to make its services accessible via voice, for all those times when you don’t have a screen in front of you. And the most obvious way it’s doing that is with the Google Home, a $129 voice-controlled, connected speaker. Vjeran Pavic / The Verge The Home is a squat little device that’s intended to sit in your house or apartment, providing an access point to all of Google’s services whenever you need them, even if your hands are full or you’re not in front of a phone or computer. It can play music, answer questions, tell you the weather, wake you up in the morning, control smart home gadgets, and do other tricks. At this point, you’re probably thinking that this sounds awfully familiar. That’s because everything the Google Home is designed to do can also be done with Amazon’s wildly popular Echo, which launched two years ago. The similarities between the two are near-endless: like Google Home, the Echo is a screenless, connected speaker that’s always listening for a voice command and can play music, answer questions, turn your smart lights on or off, and more. There’s a lot of overlap between these products, and for most intents and purposes, they are all but identical in use. But the Home has something that the Echo doesn’t: a wealth of knowledge about the world, my personal preferences, and my habits. In other words, it has Google. Vjeran Pavic / The Verge Google smartly designed the Home to blend in with the rest of the mundane products in your home. It’s roughly half as tall as the Echo and arguably much nicer to look at. Most people would say it looks like an air freshener, and I’d agree. That’s not a bad thing: it’s easy to put the speaker anywhere in your home — your kitchen, bedroom, living room, etc. — without having it stick out like an obvious piece of gadgetry. The Home is only available in white, but Google is selling optional bases for $20 each that can be had in fabric or metal finishes with a variety of colors to match your décor. The company provided me with a purple fabric base and white metal option to accompany my review unit’s standard gray fabric, and they are both quite modern and attractive. My wife can’t stand the looks of the Echo, but she found the Home to be cute and inoffensive, which might be the most praise she’s ever given to a piece of technology. Colorful bases let you match the Home to your décor On top of the Home is a touch-sensitive panel, which can be used to control the device’s volume, play and pause music, and activate its listening mode. There are colorful lights embedded in the panel that come to life whenever the Home hears its wake word or is responding to a command. It’s a subtler and more friendly approach than the Echo’s blue light that feels like it’s looking at you when you talk to it, but the Home's touch-based volume controls are not as easy to use as the Echo’s physical ring. Also integrated into the top panel are two far-field microphones, which let the Home hear voice commands from across a room. The Home doesn’t have the seven microphones of the Echo, but I haven’t had many issues with it hearing my commands, even when it was playing music and I was speaking from across the room. Occasionally, the Home would not respond immediately, but it didn’t ever perform a different action than requested. Other colleagues that have tested it, however, have noticed that it doesn’t pick up their voice quite as well from a distance. Vjeran Pavic / The Verge Like the Echo, the Home comes to life with a wake word, which is either the familiar-to-Android users "OK Google" or the easier-to-say "Hey Google." Neither are particularly natural to speak out loud, and both make it feel like you’re talking to a brand instead of a human assistant. Google says it is looking at and testing different wake words and phrases, but it would not commit to offering a fully customizable option when I asked. (Selfishly, I want to set the wake word to "Computer," so I can pretend that I’m living on the Starship Enterprise every day.) This always-listening feature is what makes the Home (and Echo) so useful, but raises a number of privacy concerns you might not be comfortable with. In order to perform actions and provide responses, the Home sends its information to Google’s cloud for processing. The company insists that it only does so after it’s heard the wake word, so it’s not constantly recording every sound and conversation around it. There’s also a mute button on the back of the device that turns off the listening feature entirely. The data that the Home does send back to Google is stored with all of the other data in your Google account, and can be reviewed anytime at myactivity.google.com. Still, you might not feel comfortable with an always-listening Google device in your home, and that’s perfectly understandable. (For what it’s worth, this is the same policy Amazon has with the Echo, but some might feel more comfortable with the Echo always listening and collecting data versus the Google Home, which touches many more parts of their lives and thus collects substantially more data.) Vjeran Pavic / The Verge The bottom half of the Home houses one speaker with two passive radiators. Google says it designed the speaker to get loud enough to fill a room without distorting at full volume. It has surprisingly loud output and, in my experience, had no trouble filling the various rooms in my house with sound. Much like the Echo, it won’t win any awards for sound quality and is mostly comparable to an average Bluetooth speaker, but for everyday listening it’s fine. Despite Google’s marketing and desire for the Home to be a virtual assistant, most people will use it as a voice-controlled connected music speaker, and it’s quite good for that purpose. In addition to using the built-in sources of Google Play Music, YouTube Music, Spotify, and Pandora, you can wirelessly cast audio from your phone or laptop to the Home, opening up a wealth of sources that can be played on it. It doesn’t have Bluetooth connectivity like the Echo, but I haven’t missed that in the time I’ve been using it. A connected speaker can change how you listen to music Having a connected speaker in your home changes how you listen to music. A simple "Hey Google, play Discover Weekly" will fire up my personalized Spotify playlist. Or I can say "Hey Google, play some chill music" in the evening and it will comply. The Home works with more precise requests, too: I can ask for specific songs, artists, or albums, and it will pull them up in a matter of seconds. All of this is done without requiring me to pick up a device, open an app, or type in anything — I just say "Hey Google" and ask for what I want, change the volume, skip tracks, and so on. The Echo is controlled in much the same way, and the differences between the two are negligible at best. The Home won’t replace a full speaker system and it isn’t designed to keep the dance floor going at your next house party. If you do want more volume or better sound, the Home can send its audio to a Chromecast Audio-connected speaker, by just saying "Hey Google, play this on Chromecast Audio." It doesn’t yet work with speakers with built-in Cast support, but Google says this will be coming in the near future. You can also group multiple Home units together and play music though all of them simultaneously, similar to how Sonos works. Amazon doesn’t yet provide this feature with the Echo. Vjeran Pavic / The Verge While a voice-activated, connected speaker is great, and probably enough to justify the Home’s cost, Google, like Amazon, has much greater ambitions for the Home. One of those ambitions is for it to become a control center for smart home gadgets, allowing you to turn lights on and off or adjust the thermostat with a simple voice command. Right now, the Home supports Nest, Hue, and SmartThings, which covers the most popular smart lights and devices. If you’re up for it, you can also program IFTTT commands for other products. The Home has far fewer integrations than are now available for the Echo, but Google says it is working to bring more in the future. Controlling smart lights is what I find the Home most useful for Controlling my lighting system is probably what I find most useful about the Home, as it precludes the need for me to pull out my phone, open an app, and tap a button to just turn out the lights. I’ve found Home to be more reliable than the Echo for my Hue and SmartThings systems — it generally is able to work with just one command, which I can’t always say about the Echo. Another ambition for the Home is for it to be an entertainment controller, allowing you to ask it to play video on your TV. Right now, it can cast YouTube video to a Chromecast, so a "Hey Google, play the Hotline Bling video on the Chromecast" will kick off Drake’s video on my TV. Other requests I tested, such as "Play the Rogue One trailer" or "Play The Verge on the YouTube" were also successful. It’s very cool to see it in action, but it doesn’t work without some intervention from me: I still have to use my TV remote to turn on the TV, which takes away from the hands-free living in the future aspect of it all. (This, of course, varies on your setup — your TV might turn on when the Chromecast is activated, but mine did not. It did, however, correctly change the input if the TV was already on.) Casting video to your TV with a voice command to Home is mostly just a demo at this point, but it’s easy to envision a future where you walk into your living room and ask the Home to play something on the TV before you even plop down on the couch. Google says that support for Netflix and other Cast-enabled apps is coming in the near future, which will make this feature much more relevant and useful. Vjeran Pavic / The Verge But the killer app for Google Home is artificial intelligence, better known as Google Assistant. The main ambition for this device and the software that powers it is to be a personal assistant that’s always at the ready, waiting for your command. Most of the company’s marketing around the product has been to push the concept of a virtual assistant that manages your calendar, tells you of flight delays, keeps tabs on your to-do list, requests an Uber when you need it, and so on. The Home is a pretty useless assistant in its current form The reality is that the Home is a pretty useless assistant in its current form. Sure, it can answer questions like how far away the moon is, or tell me how many cups are in a liter, or set a timer for my cookies in the oven when I ask it to. I can ask it to wake me up at six in the morning, then ask it to snooze the alarm when I don’t want to wake up at 6AM. It can give me a news briefing on command, put things on a shopping list, or tell me the score of the most recent Broncos game and when the next game will be. A lot of these functions are exactly the same as the Echo’s, but Google’s intelligence shines through in small ways: it knows that when I ask to be woken up at six tomorrow, I’m referring to 6AM and not 6PM. Alexa isn’t smart enough for that and asks me to clarify. It’s also smart enough to remember the context of prior questions, so I can use pronouns with follow ups, which is something Alexa on the Echo cannot do. An example is asking "Who is the president of the United States?" and then asking "When was he born?" or "When did he take office?" and so on. It will even tell jokes. The only thing that really spoils this conversational experience is the fact that I have to say "OK Google" before each and every question. But as smart as the Home and Google Assistant is, none of the things it does are proactive — at least, not yet. They all require me to ask it to do something. A true assistant would know when I need to wake up in the morning based on my schedule, or know when I need to leave for my next meeting. It would know that I typically go grocery shopping on Sundays and would have a list of usual things I buy ready to go in the morning and ask me if there’s anything I’d like to add. Even better, it’d place an order for those groceries for me, so they’d be delivered to my door automatically. Further, the Home’s virtual assistant can’t do a lot of the things I’d expect it to. It can’t add appointments to my calendar, it can’t set reminders, it can’t send messages, and it can’t place phone calls. It can’t even see appointments on a shared calendar on my account. I can do all of those things with the Google Assistant on the Pixel, so why can’t I do them with the same Google Assistant on the Home? The most limiting factor is the Home only works with one account at a time Perhaps the most limiting factor is the fact that the Home only works with one Google account at a time. I have a personal Google account that has all of my search history, music tastes, purchase history, communications, and whatever else Google has saved on me, and a work account that has most of my calendar appointments, contacts, and flight reservations. The Home is most useful when it’s linked to my personal account, but then it doesn’t have any of the critical information from my work account, so most of the time it just thinks my calendar is empty or that I have no upcoming travel itineraries. The single account limitation also makes it very difficult to use the Home in a family setting — the precise way that Google advertises it in its marketing. If my spouse asks the Home to add something to a to-do list, it gets added to my account, my to-do list, my devices, etc., not hers. (My wife would probably argue that this is exactly how it should work.) The Home has no idea what her schedule is like, nor does it know her personal preferences for music and other things. All of this is fine when a virtual assistant is baked into a phone, which is primarily used by a single person. But the Home is supposed to be a center-point in the modern home, accessible and useful to everyone that lives there. Google says that it is well aware of these issues and it is working through ways to resolve them. Company representatives wouldn’t say exactly how it’s going to make multi-account support on the Home work, nor would they commit to a time frame for when it will be available. The fact is that as it stands right now, like the Pixel, the Google Assistant on the Home is not great, though it may be one day. Vjeran Pavic / The Verge The takeaway is this: Google has a lot of ambition for the Home that’s just not realized in its current form. Google wants the Home to be the access point to all of its intelligence and services in your home, the thing you turn to when you need a question answered or need something done and don’t have a phone or other screen in front of you. And Google, arguably, is better-positioned to do this than some of its competitors. But right now, the Home is largely just a Google-fied Echo: it’s a little better-looking, is a little smarter when you ask it questions, and is a little easier to set up. It’s a pretty good voice-activated connected speaker and a pretty good way to control smart home gadgets, if you have them. Despite Google’s wealth of knowledge about me and my habits, information I’ve been handing it for over a decade, I’ve really just found the Home to be useful for the same things I’ve been doing with the Echo for the last 18 months: playing music, controlling my lights, setting my alarm, and setting timers. If you’ve been tempted by the Echo and haven’t yet jumped in, the Home will give you largely the same experience for $50 less, which is a good thing. A lot of people love the Echo, and I think a lot of people will love what the Home can do for them right now. The Home needs to be a lot smarter than it is But for the Home — and by extension, Google Assistant — to be as indispensable as Google is everywhere else, it needs to do a lot more. It needs to be a lot smarter; it needs to know a lot more about me, my family, and our habits; and it needs to be more proactive with its assistance. Google says this is just its first effort, and it has a lot more planned for the Home, including addressing many of the specific shortcomings I’ve pointed out. If Google succeeds with its ambitions for Home, the question will not be whether or not the Home is ready to do everything you need it to, it will be are you ready to have an always-listening Google bot in your home?

Listen Listening... / 0:40 The Michigan Public Radio Network's Cheyna Roth reports on a new initiative to fight human trafficking. Google offers $10,000 in free ads to non-profit organizations.  The Michigan Human Trafficking Commission and a state police taskforce are working on gathering as many non-profits as possible to apply for the advertising with one goal in mind – deter people who search for paid sex from following through.  The non-profits would use their advertisement allowance for anti-trafficking ads that would pop up when someone uses certain key words.  Kathy Maitland is a member of the committee and the taskforce.  She said some people, like those with sex addictions, might not realize the harm they are causing.   “That’s ultimately the desire is to help people get out of this and to you know see people transformed rather than just arresting bad people,” she said.  Maitland says the idea behind the project is to work on whittling down the demand for paid for sex, which is a core cause of human trafficking.  She says for some people, just realizing the ramifications of using escort services and paying for sex can be a deterrent.   “Some people don’t understand what they’re doing,” she said.  “That there’s victims behind what they’re doing.  And for some people knowing that will make a difference.” Maitland says they are currently working on an informational website that viewers will go to if they click on the ad.  They hope to have the website ready by early 2017.

Google initially reported the bug directly to Microsoft and reported another bug directly to Adobe at the same time as well, according to a blog post by Neel Mehta and Billy Leonard on Google’s Security Blog. Adobe promptly addressed their bug and issued an update. Microsoft, according to Google, did not take the same initiative to address their bug in a timely manner. Google then publicly announced the bug via the Security Blog. “On Friday, October 21st, we reported 0-day vulnerabilities — previously publicly unknown vulnerabilities — to Adobe and Microsoft,” Mehta and Leonard wrote. “Adobe updated Flash on October 26th to address CVE-2016-7855; this update is available via Adobe’s updater and Chrome auto-update.” Microsoft has confirmed some Windows users were under attack earlier this month by a specialized hacking group. https://t.co/kGcfUaoWvL — CNNMoney (@CNNMoney) November 2, 2016 The Security Blog post suggests that Google disclosed the Microsoft bug as a public service announcement, more or less. “After seven days, per our published policy for actively exploited critical vulnerabilities, we are today disclosing the existence of a remaining critical vulnerability in Windows for which no advisory or fix has yet been released,” Mehta and Leonard explain. “This vulnerability is particularly serious because we know it is being actively exploited.” The post then explains, in detail, how the security bug can be triggered. That’s part of the issue Microsoft has with the Google disclosure. It could instruct hackers on how to capitalize on the bug. “We believe in coordinated vulnerability disclosure, and today’s disclosure by Google could put customers at potential risk,” Microsoft said in a statement, according to a CNET article by Steven Musil. In a subsequent statement, Microsoft said that Google exaggerated the threat the bug presents. “We disagree with Google’s characterization of a local elevation of privilege as ‘critical’ and ‘particularly serious,’ since the attack scenario they describe is fully mitigated by the deployment of the Adobe Flash update released last week,” the Microsoft statement reads, according to Musil. “Additionally, our analysis indicates that this specific attack was never effective in the Windows 10 Anniversary Update due to security enhancements previously implemented.” Google’s published policy for actively exploited critical vulnerabilities provides a timeline for when it will publicly disclose such vulnerabilities after it has notified a company that they exist. A post titled “Disclosure timeline for vulnerabilities under active attack” on Google’s Security Blog explains that the company’s security researchers discover attackers targeting previously unknown vulnerabilities in other companies’ software on “a semi-regular basis.” When these vulnerabilities are discovered, Google notifies the company and also assesses whether or not the vulnerabilities are “critical” and whether or not they are being “actively exploited.” Their policy states that all critical vulnerabilities should be assessed within 60 days and that all critical vulnerabilities that are actively being exploited should be addressed within seven days. Google’s assessment was that the Microsoft bug fell into the latter category because their researchers determined it was being actively exploited. Microsoft not happy with Google disclosing major Windows bug https://t.co/VTCyHEBrVG pic.twitter.com/5JNtftYB8J — CNET (@CNET) November 1, 2016 Microsoft’s argument, in this case, is that it appears that the Adobe patch, which was issued within the seven-day window, addressed both the Adobe and Microsoft bugs. Therefore, no action was needed on Microsoft’s part because the bug was no longer an issue on their end. Microsoft has been plagued by security bugs, to varying degrees, for years. In 2010, EWeek reported on persistent problems the company faced in terms of preventing attacks on its software. It seems that every time Microsoft addresses one glitch or bug, another arises. EWeek explained that one simple but significant problem that Microsoft faces in terms of security bugs is that the company is just so big that it makes it the most common target for hackers and other cyber attacks. Whatever tensions between Microsoft and Google may arise from the two companies’ disagreement over the bug are sure to blow over. Microsoft and Google collaborate on several projects together, including a groundbreaking artificial intelligence partnership between Facebook, Microsoft, IBM, Amazon, and Google, as the Inquisitr previously reported.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek The Complete Guide to Improving Android Battery Life Once upon a time, you had to really keep an eye on your Android phone to make sure the battery wasn’t being depleted prematurely. Manually toggling connections, constantly adjusting brightness, and the like are basically all things of the past now—but there are still things you can do to maximize your handset’s battery life. RELATED ARTICLE How Android’s “Doze” Improves Your Battery Life, and How to Tweak It Before we get into the how, however, let’s talk about how far Android has come. Back in Android 6.0 Marshmallow, Google released a new feature called Doze Mode, which promised to improve battery life by “forcing” the phone into a deeper sleep when it’s not in use—leave it lying on the table or desk for a bit, and Doze would kick in, saving you precious juice. Then, with Android Nougat, they improved this even further by making it a bit more aggressive: instead of kicking in while the phone is completely still, Doze now works while the phone is in your pocket, bag, or anywhere else it isn’t in active use. This means fewer apps will take up precious resources on your phone when you aren’t using it, translating to longer battery life. And so far, it works exceptionally well. There’s just one problem: not everyone has Nougat, or even Marshmallow. If your handset happens to be forever stuck on Lollipop or KitKat (or older), there are still some things that can you do to make sure you’re getting the most life out of the battery. First: Know Where to Check Your Usage Look, this may seem like common sense, but I’m going to say it anyway: if you think your battery is draining faster than normal, look at your phone’s battery stats! This is very, very simple: just pull down the notification shade, tap the cog icon (to go to the Settings menu), then scroll down to the Battery section. One some devices—like most things from the Samsung Galaxy series, for example—this will just show you a basic screen with some estimates. While those are marginally useful, you’ll want to hit the “Battery Usage” button to see the real meat and potatoes here. On this screen, you can see what’s chewing through your battery, complete with a nice graph and a breakdown by app or service. If there’s an app causing issues, this is where you’ll see it. But wait, there’s more! What many users may not realize is that if you tap on the aforementioned graph, you’ll get a detailed look at when the device is awake—or “wakelocks” as they’re generally called. There’s a really simple way to read this screen: the bars show when each particular sub-head is “on.” Since I never disable my phone’s Wi-Fi, the screenshot above shows that Wi-Fi is always on and connected. Same with Cellular network signal. But as you can see, GPS, while always on, isn’t being used. The “Awake” indicator shows when the phone was allowed to come out of a sleep state—this is what you want to pay close attention to. If this bar is basically solid and “on” all the time, that means something is keeping your device awake all the time, which is bad. You want to see very short bursts on the “Awake” bar while the display is off. (If the screen is on—which you can easily see from its status bar below—then the phone will naturally be awake as well. It’s not going to sleep while it’s being used, after all.) If you’re seeing something different here, then there’s a problem. And, unfortunately, there’s no easy way to diagnose wakelocks without rooting your phone, which makes it difficult for casual users to diagnose battery issues. (If you do have a rooted phone, you can use an app called Wakelock Detector to pinpoint the problem.) RELATED ARTICLES How to Root Your Android Phone with SuperSU and TWRP Find Out Which Apps are Keeping Your Android Awake With Wakelock Detector Disable Wireless Connections Look, I’m not going to pretend that this is going to make a monumental difference in your mobile battery life, but I’m going to say it anyway: disable Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, and GPS if you don’t need them. See, this used to be a very important step in optimizing your Android device’s battery life, but as time has gone on and Google has improved Android, it’s almost unnecessary at this point. Still, if you never use something like Bluetooth, turning it off isn’t going to hurt anything. It’s also worth mentioning that if you do disable Wi-Fi when you’re away from home, don’t forget to turn it back on—you don’t want to chew through your data plan, after all. To toggle Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, pull down the notification shade and tap the appropriate toggle, or jump into Settings and then into each service’s respective entry. With GPS, things aren’t as cut and dry and “on” and “off.” Back in the day, this was a monstrous battery hog, so Google optimized the absolute snot out of it—nowadays, it’s pretty much only used when it absolutely has to be, and only for as long as it needs to be. For example, your weather apps may briefly check for current location when you open the app so it can provide the most accurate forecast. If you’re using Navigation, on the other hand, GPS will stay on the entire time, because, you know…directions. All that said, you can still actually control how GPS works. For example, you can allow the phone to use “High Accuracy” mode, which will find your location using a combination of GPS, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi/cellular networks. This uses the most battery, but it’s also the most accurate. So, if you head into Settings > Location, you can control this. Just tap on the “Mode” entry to see the available options. Remember, the less battery it uses, the less accurate it is! If you don’t use GPS or location services very often, go ahead and try one of the less-accurate and more battery-efficient modes. If you notice anything funky after that, then you may have been using an app that relies on a more accurate location service, so you’ll either have to deal with some jankiness or revert back to a higher accuracy mode. Check Notification Settings You’ve probably heard that notifications can drain your battery, but as with all things, it’s a bit more complicated than that. These days, the majority of apps use Push Notifications. Instead of constantly monitoring for new notifications (which is very taxing on the battery), push notifications use an always-listening port that’s built into Android to receive information. In other words, instead of the app connecting to the internet every several minutes to see if there’s any new information, Android is always ready to accept new information from services that are enabled on the device. This is far more battery efficient because it’s a passive service. There are, however, still apps out there that rely on non-push notifications. The biggest offender is generally going to be email services that still rely on POP3—while these are likely few and far between at this point, they’re still out there. A few social networking apps may do something similar. The easiest way to tell if this is the case with an app is to check its notification options: if you have to specify a “refresh” or “update” interval, the app or service isn’t using push notifications, and you’re probably best off turning off notifications for that app entirely. Your battery will thank you. Use Greenify to Automatically Put Apps into Sleep Mode While this is admittedly more relevant on pre-Marshmallow devices, it’s still a useful tool to have in your arsenal against terrible battery life. Greenify is an app that essentially pushes apps into a “sleep” state of sorts by using Android’s built-in way of preventing apps from running constantly in the background. It is not a task killer, even though it may sound a bit like one—it’s much more effective. To set up Greenify, first install the app from Google Play—if you’d like to support the developer’s work, then you can also opt for the $2.99 “Donation Package.” It’s worth mentioning that Greenify is more useful on rooted handsets, but it can also be used on non-rooted phones—the difference is that everything is automated on a rooted device, where you’ll have to “manually” greenify apps on non-rooted devices. Once it’s installed, go ahead and fire up the app. If your handset is rooted, you’ll grant it superuser access here; if not, well, you won’t. You can add apps to be greenified (aka put to sleep) by tapping the plus sign in the top-right corner. Greenify will show you apps that are currently running, along with apps that may slow your device down under certain circumstances. Go ahead and tap all the items you’d like to greenfiy, but keep in mind that the apps will no longer sync in the background after being greenified! For example, if you greenify your messaging apps, you’ll stop receiving text messages. Or, if you greenify your alarm clock, it won’t go off. Be thoughtful in what you choose to add to this list! Once you’ve selected the apps you’d like to put to sleep, tap the check mark action button in the bottom right. This will take you back to the primary Greenify screen, which will show which apps are already hibernated and which ones will be shortly after the screen goes off. If you’d like to push apps into hibernation immediately, tap the “ZZZ” button. If you’re working on a non-rooted handset, you’ll need to grant Greenify an additional permission. Once you click the “ZZZ” button, a popup will show up at the bottom letting you know that you need to grant the app Accessibility Settings. Click the button to jump directly into the Accessibility menu, then select “Greenify – Automated Hibernation.” There’s an explanation of why it needs to service enabled here—read over it, then click the toggle in the top bar. A warning will pop up, go ahead and tap “OK” to confirm. After that, you can back out to get back to the Greenify app. On rooted handsets, everything will happen automatically moving forward—you’ll probably want to keep an eye on which apps are getting greenified as you install things, but otherwise it’s largely automated. On non-rooted handsets, however, you’ll probably want to throw a Greenfiy widget on your home screen. You can do this by long-pressing on the home screen, selecting “Widgets,” then scrolling down till you find “Greenify.” There are two options here: “Hibernate + Lock Screen,” which will greenify your apps then turn off the display, or “Hibernate Now,” which will greenify apps and leave the display on. Take your pick—if you opt to use the “Hibernate + Lock Screen” option, you’ll have to give Greenify Device Administration access. The first time you tap the widget, it will let you know it needs this privilege—just tap “Activate” and you’re good to go. From now on, when you tap that widget, your apps will be pushed into hibernation and the display will turn off. Keep the Device Out of Extreme Temperatures This one can be a bit trickier because it’s not just a tweak or toggle—it has to do with where the device physically is. Extreme temperatures—both hot and cold!—can cause the battery to drain much faster. For example, let’s say you live in a hot climate (like Texas, for example). It’s July and you jump in your car, toss your phone in a dock, and fire up Navigation. That means your GPS is in use, the display is on, and it has the hot sun beating down on it. That’s a recipe for disaster—the device will run hot because it’s working hard, and when you throw that hot sun into the mix it can be catastrophic to your phone’s battery life. In fact, I’ve seen devices lose charge while plugged in under this exact situation. It’s that bad. What many people may not realize, however, is that extreme cold is just as bad as heat. The safe operating temperatures for lithium ion batteries is –4°F to 140°F—circumstances that are highly unlikely for most people to be in—while the safe charging temperatures are much lower: 32°F to 113°F.  Naturally, as you get close to either end of this extreme, battery life will be negatively affected. Do Not Use Task Killers or Fall for Other Battery Myths RELATED ARTICLE Why You Shouldn’t Use a Task Killer On Android Lastly, it’s important to know what not to do. Lesson number one: don’t use a task killer. I don’t care what anyone says, just don’t. This is a very, very old-school way of thinking that goes back to the day when Blackberries were the hottest things on the planet and mobile operating systems were simply inefficient. While it may seem like a good idea to stop apps from running, it’s not! A lot of times, they’ll just start right back up, which will actually kill more battery than it saves. Task Killers completely disrupt the way Android is supposed to work, so not only does this not positively impact your battery life, it negatively impacts the system as a whole. Use Greenify instead—it handles background apps much more gracefully. RELATED ARTICLE Debunking Battery Life Myths for Mobile Phones, Tablets, and Laptops And while we’re talking about old technology, let’s talk about modern batteries. You’ve probably heard people say “you have to deplete your battery every once in a while to keep it healthy!” While that’s very true for nickel-cadium batteries, it simply doesn’t apply to modern lithium ion batteries—in fact, it’s actually bad to completely deplete those more than once a month or so. To keep your Li-ion battery healthy, it’s best to perform shallow discharges and then bump it back up often. The best rule here is to keep your battery above 20% most of the time, and throw it on the charger somewhere between 40% and 70% whenever you can. We actually have debunked lots of these common battery misconceptions before. Understanding how your battery works can go a long way in knowing how to take better care of it. Honestly, modern Android devices don’t require a lot of intervention from users when it comes to maximizing battery life. If you’re having an issue with poor life, then there’s probably a clear reason. Starting with monitoring what’s happening in the background, you should be able to pinpoint what’s going on. Otherwise, you can use some of these tricks to eke out as much juice as possible from your handset. Godspeed. JOIN THE DISCUSSION (5 REPLIES) Comments (162) August 11, 2010 Ben This is wonderful, but I’m curious about actual resultant battery life numbers given these tips to those as opposed to what you were getting before. How much of a savings did you receive? August 11, 2010 Alan You can also toggle airplane mode by holding down the power button for 1 second and selecting Airplane Mode instead of Power Off. August 11, 2010 gumbald Putting it into Airplane Mode is a little excessive to stop it scanning for Wi-Fi networks? It also stops it being useful as a phone. I could greatly extend my battery this way, by turning the whole thing off. August 11, 2010 Mike This is related to the widget advice. I went from 5 screens to 3 and uninstalled sports tap and my battery life increased substantially. August 11, 2010 Dan Midwood Nice article. The section about disabling WI-FI shouldn’t be pointing at turning on Airplane mode though. August 11, 2010 Ermin Great info! I would recommend an app called JuiceDefender. I worked great for my Nexus One and almost doubled my battery life. August 11, 2010 yah5 You should really add in the task killer section not to leave it on and kill applications in intervals. Not having a task killer on saves about 20% battery life in my own tests. You should recommend that if you feel your phone being a bit slow, open it up, and kill all the things you don’t want running along with the task killer so it shuts it off too. It’s been well documented by users that not using the task killer saves rather than takes away battery life. http://androidforums.com/motorola-droid/18334-task-killer-apps-truth.html http://androidforums.com/htc-droid-eris/16622-advanced-task-killer-killing-my-battery.html http://geekfor.me/faq/you-shouldnt-be-using-a-task-killer-with-android/ August 11, 2010 Jim Nutt Auto task killing is not helpful, all it does is force Android to reload the task again, using even more battery than if it had been left alone. The only time to use a task killer is for rogue apps that chew up CPU time and if you have one of those, you should just uninstall it. I get 16 hours of battery life from my Droid and don’t use any task killers (and that’s with WiFi on all the time). A program that is actually useful is “Screebl”, combined with setting your screen timeout to the minimum it will keep the screen on when the phone is in use and will shut it off rapidly when it isn’t. August 11, 2010 vitor very useful guide! thank you!! August 11, 2010 Mikael R. So basically switch off all of my smart phone’s “smart” capabilities and maybe it will last for a while as a phone… I really like the potential of the Android platform but they have to get this battery management fixed because everyone else has found a way to maintain extended capabilities while still lasting most of a day or more. My Droid Eris barely lasts 4-6 hours even when I’m not activating the screen. Yes, that’s 4-6 hours in STANDBY!!! Unacceptable! “Don’t make me go back to Blackberry!!” August 11, 2010 Ross By far the best way to find the apps that are using a lot of battery power is to download the Spare Parts or the BatteryHistory app. (both get you to the same info) Also, if you get the Tasker app you can automate turning on and off bluetooth, wifi, etc. in certain locations or phone states. August 11, 2010 Shanton Download the “Extended Controls” app from the market. It will set you back $1, but it allows you to create your own Power Control Widget. It allows you to add MANY different power saving toggle items, including many of the items listed above in this article. It is my new favorite app! August 11, 2010 jell *#*#4636#*#* and switch network type to yours August 11, 2010 Shawn Morrison One of the best apps I own is SetCPU. It gives you the ability to modify the speed at which your processor is running. I have my Samsung Captivate running at 400Mhz and also have a setting to throttle it down to 100Mhz when I’m not using it. That in itself has impacted battery life the most. Great article, and thanks for the additional tips ! August 11, 2010 Ross on the battery usage screen, my android shows ‘cell standy’ and ‘phone idle’ as the top two battery consumers (>40% each). I’m not understanding if that’s using up all my juice or if that’s a good thing. If it’s bad – what can I do to drop those?? Thanks August 11, 2010 Ca$e You can check the internal stats of the phone (what’s used the most battery, gps, etc…) by opening the dialer and pressing: *#*#4636#*#* VERY helpful in my experience. August 11, 2010 kelvin I agree with most everything except the part about task killers. They’ve actually been shown to do more harm than good. Sytem Panel is a much better alternative. August 11, 2010 Gig Very very awesome guide… I would however, ask that one does not recommend that users get a task killer… especially with 2.2, it tends to do more harm than good, and leads people to conclusions that aren’t true, and non-techy people to do things that shouldn’t be done. For instance, a friend of mine just got an EVO 4G in NYC. It came with the 4G modem on, despite the fact that there is no 4G in NYC yet. This can take an EVO from full to dead in about 5-6 hours with ZERO use, and if you use it, you’re talking 4-5 hour range. Because of so many guides on the internet recommending task killers… she downloaded one… and would kill everything, thinking that she was doing what she was supposed to do. One of the things she was killing was the HTC 4G widget that they place on your desktop. It is simply a switch, but instead of clicking it to disable 4G, she was killing the app, thinking that she was turning off 4G… a month later, she returned the EVO. Task killers ONLY really benefit the user in killing MISBEHAVING apps, and it’s probably just better to direct people to the battery screen and let them see what’s draining their battery and uninstall, kill that app specifically. Task killers incorrectly cause users to think that all of the apps they see listed are ACTIVE and using their battery, when that isn’t the case, and causes bad behavior on the part of the user. In general, try to not recommend it. August 11, 2010 Phillip Dude, airplane mode to disable wifi? Come on now. (Airplane mode disables phonecalls and data as well, not just wifi). August 11, 2010 sebastian hi, two additional tips: * use “Startup Auditor” to disable auto starts from installed Apps (for non-rooted devices) http://www.appbrain.com/app/com.vesperaNovus.app.StartupAuditor * use Juicedefender to turn off the internet connection in the night when you sleep or if the screen is off. http://www.appbrain.com/app/com.latedroid.juicedefender August 11, 2010 prupert Good article. I thought I’d make a couple of comments. For GPS, if you have no apps running in the background that use GPS, there is no need to turn it off…. As far as task managers go, there really is never any need to kill background apps, Android is designed to fill up your memory with frequently used apps, so they load quicker. Apps in memory use little to no battery power. You can read more here: http://android.nextapp.com/site/systempanel/doc/taskmanagement You are however correct about CPU usage, so if you identify any apps hogging the CPU, then kill that sucker! For me, the main culprit of battery use is my 3G connection, so checking the use only 2G networks option under Settings > Wireless & Network Settings > Mobile Networks pretty much doubles my battery life to around three days (and that’s with autosync on all the time, but tasker turning off mobile data via APNdroid at nights). August 11, 2010 Dan J How about the 30% of us who are STILL on 1.5??? These menus don’t exist… GRRRRR… August 11, 2010 Dave Kaufman - Techlife Awesome article, I recently switched to a Nexus 1 and the beautiful screen is certainly a battery drain. Some of your ideas were wonderful. I would suggest to you and your readers you look carefully at Timeriffic in the Market. http://bit.ly/aZnc77 It is not Tasker or Locale but focuses on improving battery life and controlling your phone using time settings. It’s got a 4.5+ Star rating and many happy customers. (and yes full disclosure I am part of the development team.) Oh yeah…and it’s FREE. August 11, 2010 ad You had me until you suggested installing a task killer. http://geekfor.me/faq/you-shouldnt-be-using-a-task-killer-with-android/ August 11, 2010 Jeff Awesome guide, very basic, and comes with pictures. I work for T-Mobile and get asked this all the time. I now have a link for them, thanks. August 11, 2010 jimf buy a 2d battery and keep it handy… August 11, 2010 ric Yeah, these’ll help. What’ll help more are: 1) going into settings…wireless and networks….mobile networks and unticking “enable always-on mobile data” and 2) going into settings…wireless and networks…menu…advanced…wifi sleep policy and setting it to 15 mins. Neither will have any appreciable effect on the way your device behaves other than improving battery life. If you root your phone you can use SetCPU to set CPU frequency to minimum level when screen off, too, which makes a difference. August 11, 2010 Will Get JuiceDefender! I’ve used tasker and while it works its not nearly as simple (nor effective) as juicedefender This means I’m @ 45% battery at the end of the day, rather than 0% August 11, 2010 Paul Won’t airplane mode turn off all transmission including calls, not just wifi? August 11, 2010 HTC Desire I noticed WiFi is a big battery drain when on, but not connected. I use WiFi Status app which puts a notification in the status bar when WiFi is on but not connected and allows you to turn off WiFi from the notification. August 11, 2010 Chris This was helpful. But I still want to know why my “Cell Standby” meter in my battery history is always higher than anything else. I haven’t actually talked on the phone in a day or so yet thats at 34% and my “Android System” is at 31%. Can someone explain what’s wrong? August 11, 2010 stad Task Killers kill more battery than they save. August 11, 2010 Gary I have used most of the tips listed, but my battery life improved substantially after I uninstalled the task killer app. Perhaps I wasn’t using it correctly, but I get at least a day and a half on my Droid using the built in memory management of the custom ROM Bugless Beast v0.4 with the stock kernel. August 11, 2010 Izkata Note on task killer: A large amount of them list the cached apps in with the backgrounded ones. The cached apps use no cpu or battery, and their memory can be reclaimed instantly for use in another app. “Killing” a cached app just causes Android to reload it into memory, draining battery faster. SystemPanelLite by NextApp, Inc is one of the few I’ve seen that actually separates them. And it comes with very nice views of CPU/Memory usage. August 11, 2010 Matt You should indicate which versions of Android each of these functions will work with. For instance, my brand new Behold II runs Android 1.5… ancient. It doesn’t have “Settings –> About Phone –> Battery” which looked (and would be) very useful! August 11, 2010 Joel Juice Defender worked wonders for me. I get through the day now without a charge easily -EVO August 11, 2010 TimK I’m using an app called JuiceDefender, and it really extends my battery life significantly without me having to do anything other than set it up. However, there is a price to be paid. The general idea behind JuiceDefender is that it keeps data connections (GPRS/EDGE/3G, and WiFi if you buy the optional UltimateJuice) turned off when the screen is off, and then activates them at an interval you set so that apps like Gmail can sync. The price you pay is that this means you no longer get your E-mail and similar notifications right away. Also, if you don’t like this behavior, you can choose not to do it. If you disable the Screen control, JD will not turn off data connections when the screen is off; alternatively, if you disable Schedule, JD will not regularly enable data connections for you. The feature I really bought UltimateJuice for, though, is the Location feature, which disables WiFi when you are not in range of a known network (it learns which networks you normally connect to). I previously found that having WiFi enabled all day at work was what was sucking up my battery so quickly, and this really helps. August 11, 2010 Nicholas Turner I have a nexus one, anything that syncs like facebook, twitter, are set to 2 hour intervals, gmail is on push. Wifi is on all the time (never sleep), bluetooth is off, and I’m using 3G/WiFi most of the day. I’ll get 18-20 hours before its at 20% if I text all day and listen to some music every now and then. Don’t use a task killer it will give you LESS battery life, androids method of managing tasks is very good already, no need to screw it up. But like everyone says use one to kill an app that’s stuck. Also just set your screen to auto brightness, my screen uses very little of my battery according to the stats page. August 11, 2010 Xenio Just turning Wi-Fi Off when I leave home give me 30% more battery at the end of the day. I am using Y5-Battery Saver to automatically start Wi-Fi when I am at home. No task killer, manual brightness about 25/30% and extended controls to fast switch what I need. With this I am finally enjoying my Nexus One… August 11, 2010 WC What about turn off the device? This save the whole battery. August 11, 2010 Mike I can’t believe this didn’t talk about cell phone signal. Next to run away apps constantly syncing or using CPU cycles your phone having poor signal strength will suck your battery. If you are someplace with poor signal strength try using WiFi with the sleep policy set to never. If you can’t get good 3g strength but good voice signal you can turn off Mobile Data (mentioned in the comments). This helped me the most because my apartment has terrible 3G Sprint signal and if my phone isn’t on WiFi it’ll drain in like 5 hours. August 11, 2010 jerrod when i check my battery it says “camera” for 96%? that doesnt seem right–i dont use my camera that much. August 11, 2010 Katie I’ve followed many a guide on how to increase the battery life of my HTC Hero. Nothing bothers me more than a battery draining when I haven’t used my phone at all. I literally turn off the Mobile Network option. My battery charges much faster when this is turned off and I have noticed a significant increase of battery life. I toggle between On/Off mode often enough that this is always in my recently used apps/settings. It is cumbersome to have to turn the network back on anytime I want to use the Internet, check e-mail or send pictures, but the return on battery life makes it worth doing. August 11, 2010 John Great Guide, I really liked it. I use Advanced Task Manager Free on my Android and with that application you can add a widget that takes up the amount of space as putting the shortcut up on a screen. All I have to do is click the widget and it will kill all open apps that I don’t have already exluded, I do that every time I shut off my screen and it really helps my battery life. August 11, 2010 Alan Wild I find the About Battery completely useless on my 2.1 Samsung Moment. It only ever has three rows in the list. Right now it’s showing: Android System 91% Cell Standby 7% Phone Idle 2% To be honest, that’s pretty typical for me when I check it. I already kepe the brightness at 10%, disbale WiFi and I keep GPS disabled most of the time. I’m lucky if I can get 10 hours out of my battery. August 11, 2010 Brian I’ve glanced the comments, but if this has been mentioned, I apologize: http://www.appbrain.com/app/pl.polidea.y5 It turns on WiFi only when known networks are around and helps from having to manually turn wifi on and off. I’ve had it on my phone since nearly day one. August 11, 2010 Jm In other words folks, cripple your phones so that you are able to use it. There has to be better Battery management coding built into Android. Come on google. August 11, 2010 Nicholas Turner @Jm There is, it works really well. But like on any phone if you leave everything on and all your apps sync at 10 minute intervals, your battery is going to suck. August 11, 2010 Joshua Drake This is great but I find the simplest way to get long life is just turn off the data connection. It is simple (hold the top button on the incredible for a moment and the screen pops up). When I need data, I just turn it back up, open up whatever app and go. Then turn it off again. I get very long battery life and it is much easier than the super tuning above. August 11, 2010 TheDead Parrot Hm. I have the Samsung Captivate. My screen accounts for 60% of my battery drain. (with lots of use and lots of widgets/apps constantly updating on wifi) My backlight is turned all the way down. It’s still brighter than I need. Sigh. August 11, 2010 DJRyan920 I removed the twitter app and my FB account from my Hero and normally by this time today my battery would be down to 1/2. I am still over 3/4 charged. Now granted a portion of that is because Im not picking it up to look at those sites now so the screen isnt on, its not transferring as much data, and not using as many CPU cycles. I will just use my iPad for that stuff. August 11, 2010 bob these are all common sense things that you should be doing anyway. for most of my suggestions you need root access, like increasing the time between WiFi scans, or dropping the backlight lower then the O/S usually allows. The only tip i could give the avg user is ditch the new Facebook App, v1.3 and 1.3.1. I know i know it is pretty and personally i love it but when 1.3 was released people discovered that it would not let your phone sleep properly and was draining major battery life. A day or two later they released 1.3.1but in my testing it did not fix the problem. It could still be present for me since i am rooted and running the latest leaked Froyo (FRG22) build so that may be my issue. It was somewhat hard to discover too because the battery menu doesnt show Facebook eating up anything extra until you dig a little deeper. To see it you will need SpareParts or BatteryLeft (no root needed for either) installed so you can get tot he hidden battery history display. In there you change “Other Usage” to “Partial wake usage” and you will see Facebook is eating up extra battery when the phone should be sleeping. August 11, 2010 leo whats sad about this world is people have improved technology but cant seem to improve the batteries it takes to power more powerful devices. August 11, 2010 Andrew Use a program like Omnidroid (http://code.google.com/p/omnidroid/) to automatically toggle some of these settings (brightness, wifi) when low on power or unplugged. August 11, 2010 sanjay You show a task killer in your screenshots, they don’t work in Android 2.2 (Froyo). You make a reference to the following: Disable Your Wi-Fi When You Don’t Need It Wi-Fi can really speed up accessing data on your phone, Um, most phones are usually running on a network using either 3 or 4G, using WiFi as well is overkill and does NOT speed up accessing your data. It’s like trying to put two keys in one lock, you only need the one key and you’re already paying for 3/4G coverage, so why again are you advocating that even WiFi should be on when in the network-covered area? The article is okay, needs a lot of rewriting to make it relevant to Froyo. August 11, 2010 Rahul Its true but my x10’s battery doesnt last for half a day nd if i dont touch it the battery drains out within 24 hours,, i am so confused wit ah fone i seriously dont know wat to do. August 11, 2010 Pookie Task killer applications are kind of pointless on Android. If Android thinks it needs more memory, it will hard stop whichever process it figures is best. Killing a process with a task killer only increases the workload on the phone the next time the process is launched. The moral of the story is that you should worry about what you want to do with the phone, and let the OS worry about processes and memory. As somebody mentioned above, you may actually be doing more harm than good. August 11, 2010 gh Auto task killing is a myth. It won’t help and will sometimes be worse. Install Airplane Mode Wi-Fi Tool by Daniel Velazco. It’s in the market. You can put it in airplane mode except with wifi still running. This can help sometimes. August 11, 2010 Matt My HTC Hero does not have the battery screen in the 1st tip :( August 11, 2010 keion Also turning off vibration is an important feature. That drains the battery every time you send a message. August 11, 2010 jeff If you didn’t know about any of the suggestions listed in this post, you dont deserve to own an android phone. August 12, 2010 Nathan Wouldn’t a curated application marketplace with vetted APIs that are focused upon protecting battery life be the way to go? I am not saying close the platform down and restrict the marketplace. I am saying, what if there was another marketplace that was curated by Google (or a nominated third party) and had app development restricted to practices that don’t kill battery life? I for one would happily pay a little extra money to buy apps from such a marketplace to have the reassurance that they wont harm my battery life. That being said, iPhone for teh win! :) August 12, 2010 andferno I use Autorun Killer on my Nexus One (no need to root it). Now I can disable all those apps that start on phone boot (there are a lot you even can imagine). That improves boot time (not so useful) and gives me control over loaded apps. It’s an important thing to have only used apps loaded, so you can save memory and a little battery. Loading and unloading apps consume CPU and active apps could also do it. That’s why I also use Advanced Task Manager to control CPU and memory consuming apps. So I can kill background running apps that consume too many CPU or are increasing memory usage without sense. My 3G connection is enabled only on demand (like Wifi), but I don’t use apps like Twitter, GoogleTalk or Facebook that are more interactive than Gmail. Don’t use bluetooth too much and screen bright is on auto. By the way, good guide to keep our phones running longer. August 12, 2010 Umesh Everything was OK with my N1 till recently when the battery started getting run down from full to zero in a mere 6.5 hrs!! The battery use chart showed that this happened whenever the ‘Android OS’ used up to 90% of the battery. I thought that the Android OS used to use only about 2% or so. Also, I installed the latest update of Google maps, so maybe that would help in the diagnosis. Please help on how to set this battery drain problem right. Also, the phone gets a bit warm during this runaway battery gorging events. August 12, 2010 Thomas Interesting article, although I think activating Airplane mode to get rid of WiFi is not a good tip. Anyway, on my Samsung Galaxy S’s battery stats screen I read 44% for Display. It also tells me 6 1/2 h since last plugged in and “time on” for Display is 30 min. Does that mean that 30 minutes of Display usage accounts for 44% of the whole battery usage? To tell you the truth I find the layout of the battery stats screen very confusing and not exactly intuitive. The bad German translation doesn’t make it easier. But switching the phone to English is not an option as then I don’t have the German keyboard layout any more. Android sucks with this connection between UI language and keyboard layout… I have the brightness of the screen set to the lowest possible setting as it’s still bright enough then even when I’m outside. WiFi is only activated in my house or office and Bluetooth isn’t used at all. There’s one Gmail account which is set to be checked with Push. I have to recharge the phone every evening and would like to minimize this to perhaps every other day or so. Is this possible? Thanks, Thomas August 12, 2010 Brett Disabling Wifi does nothing. Information posted by Google from the I/O says that Wifi uses almost no battery unless data is flowing. They also suggested to use Wifi instead of 3G to save battery. Though it uses a little more battery than 3G to transfer data, it transfers data faster and shuts down. 3G takes longer to load pages causing it to use more battery. At the end of the day when my battery is almost dead, my battery information says that live wallpapers used about 5%. That’s nothing to disable it for. Most of the information on this page goes against everything Google said at their I/O. Source: http://img97.imageshack.us/img97/9594/batteryconsumption.jpg Notice how Wifi uses almost 0 battery unless data is flowing. Also notice how Wifi uses more battery while information is being transferred but the information transfers so much faster with Wifi. When the web page has loaded (or any other data request) wifi goes back to near 0 power consumption while 3G would still be loading. The information about task killing is absurd. Killing background applications will not speed up your phone or save battery. Applications that are running in the background are stored in your RAM. RAM uses the same power consumption if it’s full or empty. Google Developer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL6gSd4ugSI I think I’ll go with the information stated at the Google I/O… August 13, 2010 Matt I’m curious as to how you got the screen shots of your exact phone? I’ve been using emulators for screen shots, but the ability to take them directly from the phone would be useful. August 13, 2010 JoJo Problems like this — the almost universal annoyance of battery sucking and clunky hardware — is the chief reason why the iPhone is so dominant. I love the philosophy of the Android open source OS, and I can see that there’s a difference between OS and hardware issues, but most people won’t. Most people will expect that things work well once you get them out of the box. If they don’t, they will blame the whole package. With the Android phones, Google appears to have exerted zero quality control. With the iPhone, everything from the OS to the hardware to the packaging is overseen by Apple. Yes, they bit it hard when they designed in the antenna problem in the latest version. But their phones are still, over all, a far more satisfactory experience for the average Joe. It’s frustrating. I want the Android to dominate, because open source is that much cooler than the proprietary and controlling approach of Apple. But I am very frequently frustrated with my g1, and now I see from the comment thread here that my frustration isn’t likely to dissipate much if I decide to move up to a newer model Android phone. AAARRRGGGHHH! August 17, 2010 Felix Nagel “You can setup an auto-kill list for applications you don’t use that often—make them cut off when you shut off the screen, or after an interval. ” This is a bad idea. Why? Read: For Dummies: http://android.nextapp.com/site/systempanel/doc/autokill For Techis: http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2010/04/multitasking-android-way.html August 17, 2010 danimo it earnestly surprises me how many android users don’t know about every single one of these tips already. they all seem like common sense to me but i’ve had to school each and every one of my fellow android-powered friends in most of the information above, especially about unnecessarily keeping gps enabled when it explicitly warns that it eats battery! so clearly, while this guide isn’t much direct help to me, it’s definitely useful to the masses. and some of the comments are interesting. :P thankx for the tip on advanced task cleaner. i use both advanced task killer and advanced task manager but neither one is exactly what i want so i’ll try out atc next. : ) August 24, 2010 Patty Golsteijn Too bad there are no ‘tweet this’ buttons for posts! (or maybe I just can’t see them) August 24, 2010 Chirag Too bad this battery feature is not available in 1.5. :( Besides all the other points are very helpful and promising. :) August 29, 2010 JMF Agreed on the no-go for task killers! Ultimately, they turn out to be the cause of a whole ‘nother set of problems. Sorry, iPhone fan-boys — the iPhone was FAR worse for me in terms of battery life, *and* I couldn’t replace the battery. I realize it’s a pain to have to worry about battery life, and I do hope that Google/Android takes a cue from Palm (who improved their Pre’s battery life by leaps and bounds with a single update to the firmware), but in the meantime I: (a) follow the common-sense recommendations above (disable connection items when not needed, etc.) (b) carry a spare battery — or — a solar charger and (c) keep it plugged in whenever possible (home, office, car) I wouldn’t give up my Evo for all the iPhones/iPads or old-style flipphones in the world…. September 8, 2010 SkAndroid Hi, I have downloaded one new app, I wanted to check how much battery the app consumes. How do I check that? October 3, 2010 2FA5T I recently went on vacation out of the country, and did not bring my phone. While gone, I discovered a method much more effective than airplane mode to save battery life. The procedure as follows: 1. Press and hold top button for 2 Sec. 2. Select “Power Off” That is!!! Using this method, I was gone 2 weeks. I came back and still had 97% battery life!!!! This mode makes your phone equally as effective in phone, Bluetooth, and wifi modes as airplane mode, but with much better battery life!!! Give it a try and left me know if you experience the same results. December 7, 2010 Matches Malone Possible fix — Skip to the bottom if you’re short on time I usually leave my cell phone turned on and in my car while I’m at work. I had the problem of coming back to my phone after a full charge and seeing that it need to be plugged in! Or worse yet, it already shut off since the battery was too low. “Nonsense,” I thought. I didn’t use the phone at all for those 8 hours! Over a few weeks I independently tried all sorts of things to try to solve my battery life issue: – the usual: turn screen brightness down; no GPS unless using Maps, no Bluetooth unless driving – switched the phone to Airplane Mode -> FAIL — Phone idle percentage would be around 70% – un-installed ALL non-stock applications -> FAIL — Cell standby percentage would be the majority – turning off Auto Sync -> FAIL I narrowed the problem down to the Browser. If you’re like me, your Browser’s home page is the Google mobile search page — you know, the one that tries to use your phone’s location when you perform a search. Whenever I restarted my phone, I couldn’t repeat my battery problem. This is probably because the Browser wasn’t invoked and thus Google’s home page (with location service) wasn’t invoked. So now I get into the habit of Force Quitting the browser before leaving my phone in the car. I haven’t yet tried adjusting the search page’s setting to select ‘No’ for “Allow use of device location?” But I think this will yield the same result. Long story short: – Force quit your Browser (Phone Settings -> Applications -> Manage applications -> Running tab -> select Browser -> select Force stop) or – Disable use of device location on Google’s mobile homepage (On the Google mobile search page click the Settings link -> select ‘No’ for “Allow use of device location?”) or maybe – Change your Browser homepage to something else Hope that helps! December 14, 2010 Androidfan This is awesome info for beginers like me December 24, 2010 Name Most of the android phones have built it task killers, it would be stupid to download another, just a word to the wise.. December 26, 2010 James Frederick I use battery saver, it helps a lot, easy way to turn off stuff really quickly January 9, 2011 sd Recently got a Motorola Harm Android,Phoneis Good but the battery backup is worst…….. January 11, 2011 shahid. I just want to know howto save androud phone battery from idel. January 20, 2011 Tom.IT ===========!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!============= Yeah this guide is good, but it is very basic and mostly it is not enough! My first advice is=> Use a fine tuned mod and not the basic shitty stuff: I’ve a Samsung Galaxy S i9000 and I’m using Darky’s v8.1 mod (based on Android 2.2.1) and the juice lasts for 48-60 hours with normal usage (wifi usually on because I need it to get my mails, also reading books on it and listening to music), but with lower usage I was able to make it unplugged for 4 days. Also it is possible that your battery cache is storing false info from your battery percentage, if you’ve a newer kernel, the you should clear it and deplete from 100% to zero, this way the cache will store the true range of your battery capacity. Also there are a lot more tips and tricks, you only need to search the web ;) Regards from Hungary! January 21, 2011 Brian Turn “Haptic Feedback” off, just turning this off I got another ~2 hours of battery life on my Captivate. January 24, 2011 Randall Thanks for this. I was down to 3 hours of standby life. With your help, I found a silly app that I rarely used but thought it needed to synch with GPS continuously. Killing that, along with some other apps that synched too often, and I’m up to 16 hours of fairly active use. That is good enough for me and better than I’ve had since getting a smartphone. January 29, 2011 @pryerlee just buy a spare battery January 30, 2011 Aidil Get an iPhone 4. I have one and have nothing to worry bout battery. Been using wifi,apps,games and battery still holding strong at the end of the day. Yeah, multitasking on iPhone is not like on android, but hey, at least I don’t have to carry around spare charges and task managing my smartphone that’s suppose to be smart enough to mange itself in the first place. I like android and all it’s capabilities, but I love iPhone even more. :) February 14, 2011 Nirav Hello Everyone great guide, but I have only have question about email check frequency setting for Gmail. I am new to Android so please bare with me. I just got Droid X running 2.2 Froyo and I went to Account settings and I can not find email check frequency anywhere not even in OS settings menu. So if this setting is removed from 2.2 then where do I go to change email frequency settings? can someone please help. Thank you. February 15, 2011 jhonn mykeal smitthe i pull my fone off the charger at 6:55 am then turn it off at 7:40. i turn it on again at 3:15pm and text a lot and stuff and it usually makes it through the day. i had CHOMPSMS and i deleted it and noticed a lot longer battery life. it is apps after all and i only have 2 apps now because of it February 17, 2011 Outtanames999 All this advice is crap. Just put your POS phone back in the box and take it back. Android especially the shitty Samsung phones are losers. They need to fix this problem now. February 19, 2011 David Berman And, on top of all that, set your wallpaper to something all black or close to all black. No downside, less power, happier planet! February 20, 2011 Kunal @ TechHogger Android eats battery power like anything. All the tips are the only thing you can do to stop battery getting drained soon. February 23, 2011 Hiten Nice useful tips to save/extend battery life for Android based phones. I like this. February 23, 2011 battery problem actually before few days i buy a cell lg optimus n i charged last night till 11 pm (fully charged) but in morning i got shocked when seen the battery its only 54 percent how is it possible? when i seen the usage , my cell using 60 percent battery in standby . how is it possible? plz give me a solution for that February 24, 2011 mik This is going to seem like a really dumb question but a kid has just put a screen saver on my Samsung and I can’t get rid of it. I just want my original screen back. The picture of the city street that we must all start with. Please help!! February 24, 2011 WRAITH For android phones do not put all the widgets on the panels of your phone it can cause more work to the sync engine of your android phones. Just put those widgets that you need uninstall those apps that you don’t use. Power off your phone. February 28, 2011 RK Nice article. But it is all about turning a smart phone back to dumb. I got new myTouch 4G and it used to drain out every 7 to 8 hours (even in stand by mode – with all location, wi-fi, background data, sync turned off) Returned it in 8 days and back to my BB. I wonder how Android is gaining popularity with this big problem in their backyard. March 3, 2011 Albie For all of those who still haven’t tried JuiceDefender, try it at least for a few days. It doesn’t cost anything and can really make a difference! Simply put, what JuiceDefender does is it automatically manages the most battery-draining components of your handset (GPS, WiFi, etc.), powering them only when they are actually needed …rather than leaving them on all the time. So your phone is not crippled, it’s just much more power efficient! Anyway JuiceDefender does much more than that, it’s literally full packed with features for battery consumption optimization (connectivity scheduling, location-aware controls, battery threshold controls, etc.). It’s quite amazing what it can do. It is fully customizable and fully automatic, meaning that it only needs to be set up once, and then it runs by itself improving battery life from behind the scene. Think about it before spending 50$ on an extra battery, going nuts by micro-tweaking or even giving up on Android. You can find some video reviews on JuiceDefender’s Facebook Page and more info on its website. March 14, 2011 rino regarding the “Battery Usage Screen”, how do you read it? does it mean that the phone being idle consumes 15% more battery?? March 17, 2011 Cinny Kudos to Outtanames999 he is right on the mark about Samdung Android phones, they are P’sOS! What a total waste of $$ :( March 25, 2011 Robot Fail to this article for suggesting to use a task killer. I see we must not have much experience with Linux do we? Also Cinny the nexus S is made by Samsung. Case rested. April 5, 2011 gian my battery drains veryfast when I’m browsing using packet data and while sharing wifi(hotspot) isthis normal? April 14, 2011 Iain Great article…have added all relevant to my Galaxy S…sitting back and waiting for the battery bar to slow down now! April 20, 2011 Arvind Simple thing that you could do is that use network and display properties only when necessary. This simple tip can saves your batteries 2x longer. April 22, 2011 Chirag What does one need to do if they find that Android System is the one utilising the battery the most? Anyone having any idea please help. April 23, 2011 Brian N I ditched the Weather Channel and my battery usage is now a couple of days on the MyTouch with Android 2.2. I am going to reload and tell it not to use GPS. I can always request the weather with a zip code where I am at that time. But those iSheep!!! They just KILL ME! You could not PAY ME to own ANY of that Apple garbage. May 24, 2011 chxxn my phone samsung galaxy sl was left 78% of battery during night but the next morning the phone was out of battery and i checked the battery mainly used for cell standby (> 60%). any solution? how to reduce the cell standby %?? May 29, 2011 Tim Sullivan Helpful article and discussion. A new HTC software update from Verizon seems to help my thunderbolt. I use WiFi when available, 4G drains battery very fast: 4 hrs 4G v 12-13 hr w WiFi. I use airplane mode & sleep when not in use – turning off/on drains more than it saves. May 29, 2011 the AC I need to get back into programming, but in the meantime, is there an app that automates a lot of these steps that you can customize for specific battery levels? So far, no dice on search. Otherwise, great article. Hits all the good points. Cheers. May 30, 2011 Loving Android my android lasts 2+ days… just turn off apps you dont need… :D June 1, 2011 DeQueezie This worked for me. I don’t need to have all the settings on while at work so I turned the GPS and WiFi off. I’ll just have to see how it works when I am out and about. June 3, 2011 HardcoreJuice I have on my samsung galaxy S, Custom rom with black theme (black is good to save battery), setCPU at 400mhz normally on-demand and 100mhz when screen OFF, I’m also using Titanium backup PRO to freeze and delete user apps and system apps that arn’t needed for “me”(USE extreme caution if you plan on freezing/deleting system apps!!!!) Autostarts is the best app i have ever seen for disabling apps from starting when your phone boot up. I have just recently changed my theme to black and installed setCPU + autostarts… But before that i got 2 days with heavy use What i don’t recommend is, DONT use Juicedefender if you dont use 3g/wifi that much, it will do more harm to your batterylife…. I have an unlimited data plan on my phone and i have since long have uninstalled juicedefender,… i even had ultimatejuice but it didn’t need it that much June 21, 2011 oketcho augustine Thanks for every thing explained but my problem is not solved still. can you just help me and explain to me what is cell standby and phone idle and how i can reduce it because its the hell consuming a lot of battery on my phone.thanx June 21, 2011 ravi great !!! the backlight timer and the brightness decrement has got a change in my battery lifecycle. when i turn on my netconnection the appplications get automatically updated.any one plz tell the soluion to this to disable it. June 22, 2011 Penetreitor Isn’t suspicious?, it’s incredible how much the wireless functions (WiFi, GPS) waste the battery than the normal 3g calls/data… I can bet they have an arrangement with the phone companies to force battery consume on other wireless connections than 3g, with windows mobile the battery quite different… June 23, 2011 Dave I have been back and forth to the Verizon store and I am sick of this phone. It looses way too much battery life. Also, the Google maps takes forever to load when using the GPS. Sometimes it does not kick in for 20 minutes or so while driving. Does this happen to anyone else? I am hoping they replace this phone as I think I have a lemon. This is by the way a ‘droid 2. June 23, 2011 Casey @oketcho augustine – I assume Phone Idle is the phone looking for network/data when it is in sleep. But Im not positive on that one. Im also not positive how to shut this off, other than using Juice Defender, whose main function is turning off data when the phone sleeps(among many other functions). If you click on “Cell Standby” it will tell you what % of the time your phone is without a signal, which is the likely culprit as to why its eating up so much battery. I have been known to be w/out a signal more than 50% of the day, since my reception is so bad at my work. So occasionally I leave my phone in my car, where it has better reception. Turning off 4G when its not available or your not using it might help. I’ve been using Phone Info lately for that, but there are many others. June 24, 2011 pravin superb tips …!! thanks a lot..! June 26, 2011 attishu Thx, nice article. I recommend two freeware software as the other commenters. The Juice Defender beta is help to minimize the unnecessary data connections and turn off the Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS if the battery going too low. The Timeriffic help to setup profiles (example the data connection is not necessary for me weekdays between 10pm-6am and can change the volume, backlight, wi-fi, gps etc.) and working together with the APNDroid and RingGuard) With this two software my Galaxy S II working for two days. (approx. 2hrs talk, some music, ebook, game, few minutes gps and facebook using every day.) June 30, 2011 justin garnett It’s quite simple really. Disable DATA Disable 3G and use 2G only Set home screen to low back light and a blank wallpaper VOILA. 24 hours +++++++ of battery and full phone useage. If and when you need email, turn it all back on. July 6, 2011 AngieeMariee Thxz a lot i really needed this for my trip which takes 13 hours I know that I can’t last without my phone so I needed this July 11, 2011 Rajwan Ahmed Hi, Nice article please keep it up. can anyone guide me how to enable USB mas storage in galaxy fit.. Regards, Rajwan Ahmed July 19, 2011 les @jerrod “when i check my battery it says “camera” for 96%? that doesnt seem right–i dont use my camera that much.” Me too… and i never use the camera!. Shitty phone or shitty Android? Mine’s an Orange San Francisco. July 21, 2011 David Ellis I’m not very tech oriented and fairly new at this. My LG Optimus was using a ton of battery like every 2-3 hours when I first got it so I began to investigate. Not really knowing what I was doing I made the mistake of going to settings-applications-running services to see what all was running. I wanted to “turn off” the app and went to stop service where it gives a warning about it wont work until started again. The part about “this may have undesirable on the application….” is what concerns me. I can’t seem to get these applications to work again like Market so I can download things like Juice Defender mentioned here. Can anyone help me? I really don’t want to do a factory reset and lose all my setups. July 22, 2011 Alina Okay I’ve never been so frustrated with a phone. I have carry my charger with me all the time. When first got the phone, a few weeks ago I wouldn’t need to plug in my phone for 3 days if a didn’t use it too much. I didn’t use any apps at first. Than slowly i only downlaoded a couple and even than I barely use it! Progressively my battery just kept getting worse and worse. It’s been gradual, very weird. One of my friends sent me a link to this website and showed me how to turn off all these apps and anything that potentially might be draining my battery! So right after I expected the battery to be extended. On my way home from work I called my boyfriend for 1-2min. Once I got of the phone I saw the battery go from almost have 1/2 to connect battery to charger. So when I got home at night I plugged in the phone and allowed it to fully charge, than I unplugged it! I did not use the phone the whole night and by morning the battery was almost fully drained! So I checked my battery usage to makesure I didn’t miss anything and it said cell standby 51%, and phone idle 50%. That’s totally unacceptable. I think I got a bad phone. I love this phone, but I can’t use it I need a replacement. July 26, 2011 chinoo What is the use of purchasing a mobile phone when it is not serving the purpose. Android platform no matter how fast it could be but is still lagging in terms of technology because could not fix the very flaw battery issue (no battery no use of features) that killing the very meaning of mobile device. I would rather use a dated o.s which serves my purpose substantially and is stable enough to keep me connected atleast for telephony. But i am hopeful there will a sensible platform for mobile phones, developed soon by sensible people who would restore the sense of mobile phones. Mobile phones are phones and computers are computers. Grow up. Thats why battery issue. putting wrong software on the wrong hardware. July 26, 2011 Gord Just looked over many comments for Tasker in Android Market. It INCREASES battery consumption a lot. Maybe shouldn’t be recommended in a battery-saving article. July 31, 2011 Mr Khan It is a very bad thing we have with all android phones. August 4, 2011 shania does it cost you if you dont exit everything from your task manager ??? August 4, 2011 SUSAN i believe that the usage report is telling you…that of the battery usage that you had…51% was for one thing and 40% was for another and 9% was for another…it does not mean that 51% of your battery was used …it means that even if only 1% of your battery was used…then 51% of that 1% was for that particular thing…do the math, add up all the usages…it will round, but the total should be close to 100%… it is not how much battery was used August 4, 2011 jonathan setcpu for the win: underclocks to save battery & overclock for better performance August 10, 2011 EJM Just finished reading your article and all of the comments. That’s on my Optimus V, & still have 48% of my battery left. According to Browser’s app, that was about 1.8 MB of information. It only took 2 seconds to capture, but hours to read. To conserve the battery I simply went from your web-page to Airplane mode; allowing me to turn the screen off, go to supper, come back, turn on the screen and read some more……repeat, repeat Sometimes ya just gotta rest your eyes. Well there. Just took it out of Airplane mode & all the text that I’ve written is still there. OK then, Submit Comment . August 10, 2011 Kevin I got my droid two weeks ago and I’m just curious… Instead of bothering with Task Killer, Juice Defender and all that stuff, why not just do what the article says to do (use the power widget to toggle wi-fi, GPS, etc. on and off)? Seems like those other apps are more trouble than what they’re worth. August 14, 2011 Shane I have a samsung galaxy indulge. Was getting 4-6 hours from stock battery even with turning off everything (gps, wifi, auto sync and background) for most of that time. got an extended battery ($15+/-) and universal clip type charger ($5) from amazon. First day with new battery turned everything on plus google maps at 3:00am. Left atlanta for savannah with navigation on the whole way.arrived about 8 am. Worked all day headed back to atlanta.got home at 9pm and still had over 10% battery juice. Definitely worth $20 I think. August 22, 2011 Gipson I just have to chime in here about batteries and battery drain. 1) Both iPhone and Andoid phones (all cell phones in that manner) use Li-Ion batteries. This technology are good for about 300-400 full charge cycles. So if you drain your phone COMPLETELY every day, expect to replace it every year. +1 for Android phones where the batteries are replaceable 2) Phones all use the same technology at the physical layer. If you’re transmitting data, it draws the most power. Also there is a window around a data transfer where it keeps the session up. 1 sync of 100kb is way less power than 4 syncs of 25kb. To sync, it also needs to wake up the processor. So by changing a sync from every 15mins to every hour, you do wonders for your processor. This is the same on iPhone or Android. It is the way the core technology work and has nothing to do with how Google (Android) or Apple implemented it. Install the same apps with the same syncing intervals and battery drain will be the same with this regard. 3) Android phones such as the Galaxy series with AMOLED screens draw more power for their screens than iPhone. It looks better though so it is a tradeoff some people make. 4) iPhone users have a euphoric view on their cell phones. The ignore the little annoyances because they feel blessed by the hand of Steve Jobs. An article posted by “scientists” illustrating how Apple products trigger the same part of the brain as religion. http://news.cnet.com/8301-17852_3-20064577-71.html 5) So if you want the same battery life as an iPhone, buy a phone with as small a screen as the iPhone (can’t get a Galaxy S2 or many HTC phones)… and as dim a screen as the iPhone (can’t get a Galaxy S or many HTC phones). And set up the same sync intervals and VOILA out of the box the same battery life. If you buy a bigger screen with the same size battery, you do the math. If you buy a brighter screen with the same size battery… same thing. August 22, 2011 Gipson Forgot to add: I’ve got a Samsung Galaxy S2. Straight from the store a month ago. Added tons of games and apps. Two e-mail accounts syncing every hour, Facebook, Google+, news feeds and weather downloading, etc.. No task killer or anything done other than the base operating system controls and I get about 30hr on a charge sending emails and talking on the phone, playing the occassional game to waste time. Course if I start streaming YouTube, it’ll only last a couple hours, keeping the screen on, data session active, loud speakerphone and CPU spun up to full power processing the video-feed. August 23, 2011 Dan The easiest thing to do is download quick settings for free on the market. But I wasn’t able to do the whole data auto data thing. August 23, 2011 Gipson Also note that if you have 5 applications all updating every 15 mins (i.e. email, twitter, facebook, news, traffic/weather), there is nothing syncing these up to all update at the same time. So you might have data activity 5 times every 15 mins which is every 3 mins. This will kill battery. August 24, 2011 Brett Is there a difference in using a white wallpaper vrs a black wallpaper August 25, 2011 Alia Some good tips but am really stunned to see that you would recommend AIRPLANE MODE in order to turn off wifi. This is absolutely the most idiotic suggestion ever – doing so will stop any phone calls & messages from being received. Yet you make no mention of this & people don’t always read comments. Task killers are debatable also. You can turn off the function of searching for wifi in the wifi settings and turn wifi only on as needed using the power widget. August 26, 2011 markp1989 one app is recommend is “Watchdog lite” its a Task Manager (not Killer) you set the cpu threshold and it will notify you if a program uses more than that in the background, makes it very easy to spot misbehaving apps. August 31, 2011 XinTuS-1765 Pretty cool intel, very helpul… September 5, 2011 Vortarulo @Brett: Yes, of course. A white background uses as much LCD power as possible, because it’s all bright, while a black screen doesn’t eat any LCD power (almost). But the difference shouldn’t be that big. September 5, 2011 Millie k i have a android…. its a LG Shine Plus With Google. and its soooo slow!!!! it keeps saying ” force Cloes” and its really making me mad!!!!!!!!!!!! i would give it 4 1/2 stars but im giving it 2 stars because its so slow. when im trying to call someone it always freezes and it takes me a while. and sometimes i have to turn off the phone and turn it bak on hoping it will go faster!!! could it be becase the Lithiumlon polymer battery 2.7V in the phone??!! i dont understand!!!! i need help!!! -Millie. September 7, 2011 n00dles My SGS is rooted and running the MIUI custom firmware, battery on light to medium usage lasts for about 2days. Some tips would be to perform a full calibration & power cycle on the battery, for those on rooted phones, download either Titanium Backup or Root Explorer and remove/uninstall/rename an app called TelocationProvider.apk. By removing this you will see a decrease in your AndroidOS % resulting in lesser drain. There are some who claim that by deleting the BatteryStats via CWM helps while others say its not good to delete this and takes longer for the battery to calibrate itself. Always give it a few full charges before you’ll notice a difference, allow the battery to calibrate itself (2 to 3 charges) The thing I did that I noticed the biggest change was formatting the entire SDCard and flashing a clean rom from scratch. Hope this helps some of you guys out there, I know how you feel, it drove me nuts. September 7, 2011 Gzoref I’m sure Juice Defender has been mentioned. It’s an unbelievably easy way to increase your battery life significantly. Another thing is to flash a custom ROM which is made to be lighter and more efficient. I can’t be 100% certain that it helps, but for my Fascinate it has greatly (I mean GREATLY) increased my phone’s speed, eliminated ANY lag time and just overall made the phone more enjoyable to use. I’m pretty sure it cuts battery usage too. September 8, 2011 RealZeratul @Brett and Vortarulo: No, actually for a LCD a white background is best energy-wise because the background light is always on, but a black area additionally needs to have the transistors for the individual pixels powered on. The effect is relatively small, though (and of course darker display settings still help because they affect the back-light and not the transistors). However, for AMOLED displays (and CRTs :D) it is the other way around, here you save large amounts of energy by using a dark theme/background, because an individual pixels battery drain is proportional to its brightness. September 17, 2011 bogs I’ve adjusted the display setting to the lowest possible level but the built-in battery usage screen still shows (display/backlight) at 80%. Need help. September 24, 2011 Jon Judging by the amount of stuff that you have to turn off, there is nothing left to enjoy in Android. I like the “openness” of Android but I will wait until the batteries get better before jumping into more than $600 affair that would cost me a lot of inconveniences. September 28, 2011 KyL3 It’s a trade off that I enjoy making. Openness is just as crucial as the ability to put it to use. Batteries aren’t that expensive and you all make me schizophrenic. Good day. October 3, 2011 VZ I just switched from iPhone to Android. When I read the “Complete Guide to Maximizing Your Android Phone’s Battery Life”, it amazed me that all these features that attracted me to Android need to be turned off. One item they forgot to mention: If you turn off your device completely, the battery lasts a long long time :) October 6, 2011 shiv good advice! But you actually need not go through all this hassle – just get a good ROM installed!! I have a MOTO Defy and it lasts upto 48 hours and even more sometimes with normal use. When I’m on 3G / WiFi it lasts upto 36 hours. With lightning fast speed and such good battery backup, it not that bad I guess!! October 8, 2011 Amr saleh I’ve a samsung galaxy mini it’s a good phone, but thre same battery issue, when using wifi the battery getting down from fully charge to zero after about 2:30 hours, the task killer doesn’t save battery, it’s using more battery plus slowing the phone too bcz it killing the apps that not using any power, but just work as a virtual memory to take aless time to open it when needed,I tried to reduce my usage of the phone as a test,I didn’t use any data connection (wifi,gps, packet data ),I just use it as a phone & listening some music&I get a two days of battery life before need to recharging, absolutely it’s meaning I didn’t use the most of phone services& some of them need a internet connection all the time I think like news & weather widget, yahoo, youtube, market widgets all of them useless when no network connection, you can let the background data & location setting off when you using internet that will save battery & speeds up the data connection (up & downloading) too & just turn them on when needed, gallery is eating the battery too even when no video played so don’t use it if you don’t really need it, turn flight mode on when no signal or signal is week,bcz the phone using more power searching available network & you can turn it on at night too if you don’t expect important calls.I hope that helping you.thanks. October 8, 2011 Amr saleh Some thing else , don’t clearing memory (RAM) all the time bcz it working like task killer app & kill the services didn’t use power or battery, just be sure you end take from the android task manager after using them & clearing ram memory when you need (when the device hang or freezing) October 10, 2011 4G Reaper I have an HTC Sensation 4G rooted and flashed with XE Rom for beats audio, will be going to cyanogenmod as soon as there is an official release with an overclock. I barely lose 70% battery in a day (8AM-11PM) and am a heavy music/data user, often multi-tasking with music/games/web browsing. Most ROMs are undervolted as well as overclocked, and don’t use much battery life. For the average user, you can completely turn syncing off, I noticed it was a major improvement on battery life, and as stated, WiFi drains less juice than data, especially since you can set it off with tasker and what not. Brightness is still one of the main keys for battery life. October 11, 2011 Galaxy My samsung galaxy mini is too slow when browsing or downloading even when using 3g(hsdpa7.2), any one know why??? October 11, 2011 4G Reaper Try using WiFi, 3g is slow to start with, but you could also go and disable background data under settings/accounts and sync i believe, that should give a noticeable speed boost. October 11, 2011 Galaxy Thank you fours advice,i tired all that things before, but it’s still too slow, when using 2g, the download is faster than 3g, even it suspend many times when I trying download files, and 3g signal is very low either (5 to 13 as maximum from phone status list), when compared to nokia x6 (that lower hsdpa about 3.6mps), the x6 was much faster than galaxy, some one told me that is a phone problem, so what you think??is it??? and thanks again. October 12, 2011 Galaxy Thank you,Finally I found the reason, it was a problem with my sim card,I change it and I hour more browsing speed.Thanks alot. October 13, 2011 4G Reaper No problem, glad it was resolved :) October 22, 2011 123 Hi every one,i make simple test,i charged my phones battery to full,i enabled packet data setting (using 2g networks) & put weather widget on one of the screens I have, make some calls (23 m), listening to some music (about 1 hour & a half, very light usage (no browsing or downloading,, no watching videos, at end of day(after 22 hours), my battery usage 35%, that’s mean that enabling packet data all the time don’t affect very much of battery life, it j just how many services & widgets that using back ground data you enabled , so the android phones batteries life may be don’t enough for its great performance & services, but we can still learn how to user our phones & here some advices 1) set your display brightness level to just what you need, for indoor using about 25:35% is very good, and adjust it when needed (like using your phone on sunny day). 2) don’t enable many services or widgets that are using back ground data, just what you really need & use& set the refresh rate to average (i set up the weather widget to update every 3 hours). 3) use a3g on-off widget to switching from 2g to 3g when needed (browsing & downloading), and back to 2g after finish, you can get the on-off 3g widget from android market for free. 4) use wifi to access the web when available, it’s much faster than 3g& less power using. 5) keep your wifi, bluetooth,gps,& rotation sensor disable if you don’t need them. 6) don’t download, using a task killer app, it don’t do any thing positive, it just kill apps that the android system using as a virtual memory to be quick & less power using when using those apps again, mean that the task killer is using power to turn apps (don’t use any power) off, and getting system(device) slower & use more power to enable them again. 7) as the task kilter, don’t clear your memory (ram) all time, it has the same effect of the task killer, just use it when needed (Device hang issue for example). 8) don’t use your phone as a computer all the time and usea real computer when you can, use your phone as computer just when really you need like searching about an important things & informations when no computer available. I hop that helpful, the smart phones are great devices but manufactures really need to improve batteries, and I think they well. October 25, 2011 Johnny MMA fan ######## I have a samsung Galaxy S Rooted with a custom ROM. Roms make a MASSIVE difference on your batterys drain. One user pointed out that MANY of the ROMS he flashed on this phone gave him bad battery life at no more then 10 hours. A different rom (macnut11 if i remember correctly) gave him a huge increase. Keep this in mind. I’ve come to the conclusion if you’ve done steps like toggling data, brightness, removing widgets and auto sync and still see a big drain then its time to replace your battery. They can only last so many cycles. I’ve done all i can to reduce consumption and i get 8 hours tops WITHOUT data on. With it on im looking at 5-6 hours tops with medium usage. Another thing to point out is what MODEM your ROM or phone comes with. Changing that will result in a different outcome. It might simply be time to change your battery. Hope i helped you all!######## October 27, 2011 Johnny MMA fan ############ Huge update by me for you guys just in time. I actually managed to crank out a ton more battery finally! I narrowed it down to two major things. Use the spare parts app to check your partial wake usage in your battery history. You’ll see whats eating your battery the most. Delete all the apps that you can do without. For me Tango was eating a decent percent and i never even use the app. Deleting it helped. Another thing is to drain your phones battery to about 15 %, Turn your phone OFF (VERY Important) ! Charge too 100% (Some phones might not reach a full 100% so make sure not to keep an eye on that) If you have root… Boot into recovery using your hardbuttons, go to advance, wipe battery stats. You should be seeing a few more hours at least. My old rom didn’t allow my phone to sleep and charge which is why by battery was off by a lot. These made a massive difference for me.

Published 11/3/16 SHOW ARCHIVED READER COMMENTS (162) Comments (162) August 11, 2010 Ben This is wonderful, but I’m curious about actual resultant battery life numbers given these tips to those as opposed to what you were getting before. How much of a savings did you receive? August 11, 2010 Alan You can also toggle airplane mode by holding down the power button for 1 second and selecting Airplane Mode instead of Power Off. August 11, 2010 gumbald Putting it into Airplane Mode is a little excessive to stop it scanning for Wi-Fi networks? It also stops it being useful as a phone. I could greatly extend my battery this way, by turning the whole thing off. August 11, 2010 Mike This is related to the widget advice. I went from 5 screens to 3 and uninstalled sports tap and my battery life increased substantially. August 11, 2010 Dan Midwood Nice article. The section about disabling WI-FI shouldn’t be pointing at turning on Airplane mode though. August 11, 2010 Ermin Great info! I would recommend an app called JuiceDefender. I worked great for my Nexus One and almost doubled my battery life. August 11, 2010 yah5 You should really add in the task killer section not to leave it on and kill applications in intervals. Not having a task killer on saves about 20% battery life in my own tests. You should recommend that if you feel your phone being a bit slow, open it up, and kill all the things you don’t want running along with the task killer so it shuts it off too. It’s been well documented by users that not using the task killer saves rather than takes away battery life. http://androidforums.com/motorola-droid/18334-task-killer-apps-truth.html http://androidforums.com/htc-droid-eris/16622-advanced-task-killer-killing-my-battery.html http://geekfor.me/faq/you-shouldnt-be-using-a-task-killer-with-android/ August 11, 2010 Jim Nutt Auto task killing is not helpful, all it does is force Android to reload the task again, using even more battery than if it had been left alone. The only time to use a task killer is for rogue apps that chew up CPU time and if you have one of those, you should just uninstall it. I get 16 hours of battery life from my Droid and don’t use any task killers (and that’s with WiFi on all the time). A program that is actually useful is “Screebl”, combined with setting your screen timeout to the minimum it will keep the screen on when the phone is in use and will shut it off rapidly when it isn’t. August 11, 2010 vitor very useful guide! thank you!! August 11, 2010 Mikael R. So basically switch off all of my smart phone’s “smart” capabilities and maybe it will last for a while as a phone… I really like the potential of the Android platform but they have to get this battery management fixed because everyone else has found a way to maintain extended capabilities while still lasting most of a day or more. My Droid Eris barely lasts 4-6 hours even when I’m not activating the screen. Yes, that’s 4-6 hours in STANDBY!!! Unacceptable! “Don’t make me go back to Blackberry!!” August 11, 2010 Ross By far the best way to find the apps that are using a lot of battery power is to download the Spare Parts or the BatteryHistory app. (both get you to the same info) Also, if you get the Tasker app you can automate turning on and off bluetooth, wifi, etc. in certain locations or phone states. August 11, 2010 Shanton Download the “Extended Controls” app from the market. It will set you back $1, but it allows you to create your own Power Control Widget. It allows you to add MANY different power saving toggle items, including many of the items listed above in this article. It is my new favorite app! August 11, 2010 jell *#*#4636#*#* and switch network type to yours August 11, 2010 Shawn Morrison One of the best apps I own is SetCPU. It gives you the ability to modify the speed at which your processor is running. I have my Samsung Captivate running at 400Mhz and also have a setting to throttle it down to 100Mhz when I’m not using it. That in itself has impacted battery life the most. Great article, and thanks for the additional tips ! August 11, 2010 Ross on the battery usage screen, my android shows ‘cell standy’ and ‘phone idle’ as the top two battery consumers (>40% each). I’m not understanding if that’s using up all my juice or if that’s a good thing. If it’s bad – what can I do to drop those?? Thanks August 11, 2010 Ca$e You can check the internal stats of the phone (what’s used the most battery, gps, etc…) by opening the dialer and pressing: *#*#4636#*#* VERY helpful in my experience. August 11, 2010 kelvin I agree with most everything except the part about task killers. They’ve actually been shown to do more harm than good. Sytem Panel is a much better alternative. August 11, 2010 Gig Very very awesome guide… I would however, ask that one does not recommend that users get a task killer… especially with 2.2, it tends to do more harm than good, and leads people to conclusions that aren’t true, and non-techy people to do things that shouldn’t be done. For instance, a friend of mine just got an EVO 4G in NYC. It came with the 4G modem on, despite the fact that there is no 4G in NYC yet. This can take an EVO from full to dead in about 5-6 hours with ZERO use, and if you use it, you’re talking 4-5 hour range. Because of so many guides on the internet recommending task killers… she downloaded one… and would kill everything, thinking that she was doing what she was supposed to do. One of the things she was killing was the HTC 4G widget that they place on your desktop. It is simply a switch, but instead of clicking it to disable 4G, she was killing the app, thinking that she was turning off 4G… a month later, she returned the EVO. Task killers ONLY really benefit the user in killing MISBEHAVING apps, and it’s probably just better to direct people to the battery screen and let them see what’s draining their battery and uninstall, kill that app specifically. Task killers incorrectly cause users to think that all of the apps they see listed are ACTIVE and using their battery, when that isn’t the case, and causes bad behavior on the part of the user. In general, try to not recommend it. August 11, 2010 Phillip Dude, airplane mode to disable wifi? Come on now. (Airplane mode disables phonecalls and data as well, not just wifi). August 11, 2010 sebastian hi, two additional tips: * use “Startup Auditor” to disable auto starts from installed Apps (for non-rooted devices) http://www.appbrain.com/app/com.vesperaNovus.app.StartupAuditor * use Juicedefender to turn off the internet connection in the night when you sleep or if the screen is off. http://www.appbrain.com/app/com.latedroid.juicedefender August 11, 2010 prupert Good article. I thought I’d make a couple of comments. For GPS, if you have no apps running in the background that use GPS, there is no need to turn it off…. As far as task managers go, there really is never any need to kill background apps, Android is designed to fill up your memory with frequently used apps, so they load quicker. Apps in memory use little to no battery power. You can read more here: http://android.nextapp.com/site/systempanel/doc/taskmanagement You are however correct about CPU usage, so if you identify any apps hogging the CPU, then kill that sucker! For me, the main culprit of battery use is my 3G connection, so checking the use only 2G networks option under Settings > Wireless & Network Settings > Mobile Networks pretty much doubles my battery life to around three days (and that’s with autosync on all the time, but tasker turning off mobile data via APNdroid at nights). August 11, 2010 Dan J How about the 30% of us who are STILL on 1.5??? These menus don’t exist… GRRRRR… August 11, 2010 Dave Kaufman - Techlife Awesome article, I recently switched to a Nexus 1 and the beautiful screen is certainly a battery drain. Some of your ideas were wonderful. I would suggest to you and your readers you look carefully at Timeriffic in the Market. http://bit.ly/aZnc77 It is not Tasker or Locale but focuses on improving battery life and controlling your phone using time settings. It’s got a 4.5+ Star rating and many happy customers. (and yes full disclosure I am part of the development team.) Oh yeah…and it’s FREE. August 11, 2010 ad You had me until you suggested installing a task killer. http://geekfor.me/faq/you-shouldnt-be-using-a-task-killer-with-android/ August 11, 2010 Jeff Awesome guide, very basic, and comes with pictures. I work for T-Mobile and get asked this all the time. I now have a link for them, thanks. August 11, 2010 jimf buy a 2d battery and keep it handy… August 11, 2010 ric Yeah, these’ll help. What’ll help more are: 1) going into settings…wireless and networks….mobile networks and unticking “enable always-on mobile data” and 2) going into settings…wireless and networks…menu…advanced…wifi sleep policy and setting it to 15 mins. Neither will have any appreciable effect on the way your device behaves other than improving battery life. If you root your phone you can use SetCPU to set CPU frequency to minimum level when screen off, too, which makes a difference. August 11, 2010 Will Get JuiceDefender! I’ve used tasker and while it works its not nearly as simple (nor effective) as juicedefender This means I’m @ 45% battery at the end of the day, rather than 0% August 11, 2010 Paul Won’t airplane mode turn off all transmission including calls, not just wifi? August 11, 2010 HTC Desire I noticed WiFi is a big battery drain when on, but not connected. I use WiFi Status app which puts a notification in the status bar when WiFi is on but not connected and allows you to turn off WiFi from the notification. August 11, 2010 Chris This was helpful. But I still want to know why my “Cell Standby” meter in my battery history is always higher than anything else. I haven’t actually talked on the phone in a day or so yet thats at 34% and my “Android System” is at 31%. Can someone explain what’s wrong? August 11, 2010 stad Task Killers kill more battery than they save. August 11, 2010 Gary I have used most of the tips listed, but my battery life improved substantially after I uninstalled the task killer app. Perhaps I wasn’t using it correctly, but I get at least a day and a half on my Droid using the built in memory management of the custom ROM Bugless Beast v0.4 with the stock kernel. August 11, 2010 Izkata Note on task killer: A large amount of them list the cached apps in with the backgrounded ones. The cached apps use no cpu or battery, and their memory can be reclaimed instantly for use in another app. “Killing” a cached app just causes Android to reload it into memory, draining battery faster. SystemPanelLite by NextApp, Inc is one of the few I’ve seen that actually separates them. And it comes with very nice views of CPU/Memory usage. August 11, 2010 Matt You should indicate which versions of Android each of these functions will work with. For instance, my brand new Behold II runs Android 1.5… ancient. It doesn’t have “Settings –> About Phone –> Battery” which looked (and would be) very useful! August 11, 2010 Joel Juice Defender worked wonders for me. I get through the day now without a charge easily -EVO August 11, 2010 TimK I’m using an app called JuiceDefender, and it really extends my battery life significantly without me having to do anything other than set it up. However, there is a price to be paid. The general idea behind JuiceDefender is that it keeps data connections (GPRS/EDGE/3G, and WiFi if you buy the optional UltimateJuice) turned off when the screen is off, and then activates them at an interval you set so that apps like Gmail can sync. The price you pay is that this means you no longer get your E-mail and similar notifications right away. Also, if you don’t like this behavior, you can choose not to do it. If you disable the Screen control, JD will not turn off data connections when the screen is off; alternatively, if you disable Schedule, JD will not regularly enable data connections for you. The feature I really bought UltimateJuice for, though, is the Location feature, which disables WiFi when you are not in range of a known network (it learns which networks you normally connect to). I previously found that having WiFi enabled all day at work was what was sucking up my battery so quickly, and this really helps. August 11, 2010 Nicholas Turner I have a nexus one, anything that syncs like facebook, twitter, are set to 2 hour intervals, gmail is on push. Wifi is on all the time (never sleep), bluetooth is off, and I’m using 3G/WiFi most of the day. I’ll get 18-20 hours before its at 20% if I text all day and listen to some music every now and then. Don’t use a task killer it will give you LESS battery life, androids method of managing tasks is very good already, no need to screw it up. But like everyone says use one to kill an app that’s stuck. Also just set your screen to auto brightness, my screen uses very little of my battery according to the stats page. August 11, 2010 Xenio Just turning Wi-Fi Off when I leave home give me 30% more battery at the end of the day. I am using Y5-Battery Saver to automatically start Wi-Fi when I am at home. No task killer, manual brightness about 25/30% and extended controls to fast switch what I need. With this I am finally enjoying my Nexus One… August 11, 2010 WC What about turn off the device? This save the whole battery. August 11, 2010 Mike I can’t believe this didn’t talk about cell phone signal. Next to run away apps constantly syncing or using CPU cycles your phone having poor signal strength will suck your battery. If you are someplace with poor signal strength try using WiFi with the sleep policy set to never. If you can’t get good 3g strength but good voice signal you can turn off Mobile Data (mentioned in the comments). This helped me the most because my apartment has terrible 3G Sprint signal and if my phone isn’t on WiFi it’ll drain in like 5 hours. August 11, 2010 jerrod when i check my battery it says “camera” for 96%? that doesnt seem right–i dont use my camera that much. August 11, 2010 Katie I’ve followed many a guide on how to increase the battery life of my HTC Hero. Nothing bothers me more than a battery draining when I haven’t used my phone at all. I literally turn off the Mobile Network option. My battery charges much faster when this is turned off and I have noticed a significant increase of battery life. I toggle between On/Off mode often enough that this is always in my recently used apps/settings. It is cumbersome to have to turn the network back on anytime I want to use the Internet, check e-mail or send pictures, but the return on battery life makes it worth doing. August 11, 2010 John Great Guide, I really liked it. I use Advanced Task Manager Free on my Android and with that application you can add a widget that takes up the amount of space as putting the shortcut up on a screen. All I have to do is click the widget and it will kill all open apps that I don’t have already exluded, I do that every time I shut off my screen and it really helps my battery life. August 11, 2010 Alan Wild I find the About Battery completely useless on my 2.1 Samsung Moment. It only ever has three rows in the list. Right now it’s showing: Android System 91% Cell Standby 7% Phone Idle 2% To be honest, that’s pretty typical for me when I check it. I already kepe the brightness at 10%, disbale WiFi and I keep GPS disabled most of the time. I’m lucky if I can get 10 hours out of my battery. August 11, 2010 Brian I’ve glanced the comments, but if this has been mentioned, I apologize: http://www.appbrain.com/app/pl.polidea.y5 It turns on WiFi only when known networks are around and helps from having to manually turn wifi on and off. I’ve had it on my phone since nearly day one. August 11, 2010 Jm In other words folks, cripple your phones so that you are able to use it. There has to be better Battery management coding built into Android. Come on google. August 11, 2010 Nicholas Turner @Jm There is, it works really well. But like on any phone if you leave everything on and all your apps sync at 10 minute intervals, your battery is going to suck. August 11, 2010 Joshua Drake This is great but I find the simplest way to get long life is just turn off the data connection. It is simple (hold the top button on the incredible for a moment and the screen pops up). When I need data, I just turn it back up, open up whatever app and go. Then turn it off again. I get very long battery life and it is much easier than the super tuning above. August 11, 2010 TheDead Parrot Hm. I have the Samsung Captivate. My screen accounts for 60% of my battery drain. (with lots of use and lots of widgets/apps constantly updating on wifi) My backlight is turned all the way down. It’s still brighter than I need. Sigh. August 11, 2010 DJRyan920 I removed the twitter app and my FB account from my Hero and normally by this time today my battery would be down to 1/2. I am still over 3/4 charged. Now granted a portion of that is because Im not picking it up to look at those sites now so the screen isnt on, its not transferring as much data, and not using as many CPU cycles. I will just use my iPad for that stuff. August 11, 2010 bob these are all common sense things that you should be doing anyway. for most of my suggestions you need root access, like increasing the time between WiFi scans, or dropping the backlight lower then the O/S usually allows. The only tip i could give the avg user is ditch the new Facebook App, v1.3 and 1.3.1. I know i know it is pretty and personally i love it but when 1.3 was released people discovered that it would not let your phone sleep properly and was draining major battery life. A day or two later they released 1.3.1but in my testing it did not fix the problem. It could still be present for me since i am rooted and running the latest leaked Froyo (FRG22) build so that may be my issue. It was somewhat hard to discover too because the battery menu doesnt show Facebook eating up anything extra until you dig a little deeper. To see it you will need SpareParts or BatteryLeft (no root needed for either) installed so you can get tot he hidden battery history display. In there you change “Other Usage” to “Partial wake usage” and you will see Facebook is eating up extra battery when the phone should be sleeping. August 11, 2010 leo whats sad about this world is people have improved technology but cant seem to improve the batteries it takes to power more powerful devices. August 11, 2010 Andrew Use a program like Omnidroid (http://code.google.com/p/omnidroid/) to automatically toggle some of these settings (brightness, wifi) when low on power or unplugged. August 11, 2010 sanjay You show a task killer in your screenshots, they don’t work in Android 2.2 (Froyo). You make a reference to the following: Disable Your Wi-Fi When You Don’t Need It Wi-Fi can really speed up accessing data on your phone, Um, most phones are usually running on a network using either 3 or 4G, using WiFi as well is overkill and does NOT speed up accessing your data. It’s like trying to put two keys in one lock, you only need the one key and you’re already paying for 3/4G coverage, so why again are you advocating that even WiFi should be on when in the network-covered area? The article is okay, needs a lot of rewriting to make it relevant to Froyo. August 11, 2010 Rahul Its true but my x10’s battery doesnt last for half a day nd if i dont touch it the battery drains out within 24 hours,, i am so confused wit ah fone i seriously dont know wat to do. August 11, 2010 Pookie Task killer applications are kind of pointless on Android. If Android thinks it needs more memory, it will hard stop whichever process it figures is best. Killing a process with a task killer only increases the workload on the phone the next time the process is launched. The moral of the story is that you should worry about what you want to do with the phone, and let the OS worry about processes and memory. As somebody mentioned above, you may actually be doing more harm than good. August 11, 2010 gh Auto task killing is a myth. It won’t help and will sometimes be worse. Install Airplane Mode Wi-Fi Tool by Daniel Velazco. It’s in the market. You can put it in airplane mode except with wifi still running. This can help sometimes. August 11, 2010 Matt My HTC Hero does not have the battery screen in the 1st tip :( August 11, 2010 keion Also turning off vibration is an important feature. That drains the battery every time you send a message. August 11, 2010 jeff If you didn’t know about any of the suggestions listed in this post, you dont deserve to own an android phone. August 12, 2010 Nathan Wouldn’t a curated application marketplace with vetted APIs that are focused upon protecting battery life be the way to go? I am not saying close the platform down and restrict the marketplace. I am saying, what if there was another marketplace that was curated by Google (or a nominated third party) and had app development restricted to practices that don’t kill battery life? I for one would happily pay a little extra money to buy apps from such a marketplace to have the reassurance that they wont harm my battery life. That being said, iPhone for teh win! :) August 12, 2010 andferno I use Autorun Killer on my Nexus One (no need to root it). Now I can disable all those apps that start on phone boot (there are a lot you even can imagine). That improves boot time (not so useful) and gives me control over loaded apps. It’s an important thing to have only used apps loaded, so you can save memory and a little battery. Loading and unloading apps consume CPU and active apps could also do it. That’s why I also use Advanced Task Manager to control CPU and memory consuming apps. So I can kill background running apps that consume too many CPU or are increasing memory usage without sense. My 3G connection is enabled only on demand (like Wifi), but I don’t use apps like Twitter, GoogleTalk or Facebook that are more interactive than Gmail. Don’t use bluetooth too much and screen bright is on auto. By the way, good guide to keep our phones running longer. August 12, 2010 Umesh Everything was OK with my N1 till recently when the battery started getting run down from full to zero in a mere 6.5 hrs!! The battery use chart showed that this happened whenever the ‘Android OS’ used up to 90% of the battery. I thought that the Android OS used to use only about 2% or so. Also, I installed the latest update of Google maps, so maybe that would help in the diagnosis. Please help on how to set this battery drain problem right. Also, the phone gets a bit warm during this runaway battery gorging events. August 12, 2010 Thomas Interesting article, although I think activating Airplane mode to get rid of WiFi is not a good tip. Anyway, on my Samsung Galaxy S’s battery stats screen I read 44% for Display. It also tells me 6 1/2 h since last plugged in and “time on” for Display is 30 min. Does that mean that 30 minutes of Display usage accounts for 44% of the whole battery usage? To tell you the truth I find the layout of the battery stats screen very confusing and not exactly intuitive. The bad German translation doesn’t make it easier. But switching the phone to English is not an option as then I don’t have the German keyboard layout any more. Android sucks with this connection between UI language and keyboard layout… I have the brightness of the screen set to the lowest possible setting as it’s still bright enough then even when I’m outside. WiFi is only activated in my house or office and Bluetooth isn’t used at all. There’s one Gmail account which is set to be checked with Push. I have to recharge the phone every evening and would like to minimize this to perhaps every other day or so. Is this possible? Thanks, Thomas August 12, 2010 Brett Disabling Wifi does nothing. Information posted by Google from the I/O says that Wifi uses almost no battery unless data is flowing. They also suggested to use Wifi instead of 3G to save battery. Though it uses a little more battery than 3G to transfer data, it transfers data faster and shuts down. 3G takes longer to load pages causing it to use more battery. At the end of the day when my battery is almost dead, my battery information says that live wallpapers used about 5%. That’s nothing to disable it for. Most of the information on this page goes against everything Google said at their I/O. Source: http://img97.imageshack.us/img97/9594/batteryconsumption.jpg Notice how Wifi uses almost 0 battery unless data is flowing. Also notice how Wifi uses more battery while information is being transferred but the information transfers so much faster with Wifi. When the web page has loaded (or any other data request) wifi goes back to near 0 power consumption while 3G would still be loading. The information about task killing is absurd. Killing background applications will not speed up your phone or save battery. Applications that are running in the background are stored in your RAM. RAM uses the same power consumption if it’s full or empty. Google Developer: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fL6gSd4ugSI I think I’ll go with the information stated at the Google I/O… August 13, 2010 Matt I’m curious as to how you got the screen shots of your exact phone? I’ve been using emulators for screen shots, but the ability to take them directly from the phone would be useful. August 13, 2010 JoJo Problems like this — the almost universal annoyance of battery sucking and clunky hardware — is the chief reason why the iPhone is so dominant. I love the philosophy of the Android open source OS, and I can see that there’s a difference between OS and hardware issues, but most people won’t. Most people will expect that things work well once you get them out of the box. If they don’t, they will blame the whole package. With the Android phones, Google appears to have exerted zero quality control. With the iPhone, everything from the OS to the hardware to the packaging is overseen by Apple. Yes, they bit it hard when they designed in the antenna problem in the latest version. But their phones are still, over all, a far more satisfactory experience for the average Joe. It’s frustrating. I want the Android to dominate, because open source is that much cooler than the proprietary and controlling approach of Apple. But I am very frequently frustrated with my g1, and now I see from the comment thread here that my frustration isn’t likely to dissipate much if I decide to move up to a newer model Android phone. AAARRRGGGHHH! August 17, 2010 Felix Nagel “You can setup an auto-kill list for applications you don’t use that often—make them cut off when you shut off the screen, or after an interval. ” This is a bad idea. Why? Read: For Dummies: http://android.nextapp.com/site/systempanel/doc/autokill For Techis: http://android-developers.blogspot.com/2010/04/multitasking-android-way.html August 17, 2010 danimo it earnestly surprises me how many android users don’t know about every single one of these tips already. they all seem like common sense to me but i’ve had to school each and every one of my fellow android-powered friends in most of the information above, especially about unnecessarily keeping gps enabled when it explicitly warns that it eats battery! so clearly, while this guide isn’t much direct help to me, it’s definitely useful to the masses. and some of the comments are interesting. :P thankx for the tip on advanced task cleaner. i use both advanced task killer and advanced task manager but neither one is exactly what i want so i’ll try out atc next. : ) August 24, 2010 Patty Golsteijn Too bad there are no ‘tweet this’ buttons for posts! (or maybe I just can’t see them) August 24, 2010 Chirag Too bad this battery feature is not available in 1.5. :( Besides all the other points are very helpful and promising. :) August 29, 2010 JMF Agreed on the no-go for task killers! Ultimately, they turn out to be the cause of a whole ‘nother set of problems. Sorry, iPhone fan-boys — the iPhone was FAR worse for me in terms of battery life, *and* I couldn’t replace the battery. I realize it’s a pain to have to worry about battery life, and I do hope that Google/Android takes a cue from Palm (who improved their Pre’s battery life by leaps and bounds with a single update to the firmware), but in the meantime I: (a) follow the common-sense recommendations above (disable connection items when not needed, etc.) (b) carry a spare battery — or — a solar charger and (c) keep it plugged in whenever possible (home, office, car) I wouldn’t give up my Evo for all the iPhones/iPads or old-style flipphones in the world…. September 8, 2010 SkAndroid Hi, I have downloaded one new app, I wanted to check how much battery the app consumes. How do I check that? October 3, 2010 2FA5T I recently went on vacation out of the country, and did not bring my phone. While gone, I discovered a method much more effective than airplane mode to save battery life. The procedure as follows: 1. Press and hold top button for 2 Sec. 2. Select “Power Off” That is!!! Using this method, I was gone 2 weeks. I came back and still had 97% battery life!!!! This mode makes your phone equally as effective in phone, Bluetooth, and wifi modes as airplane mode, but with much better battery life!!! Give it a try and left me know if you experience the same results. December 7, 2010 Matches Malone Possible fix — Skip to the bottom if you’re short on time I usually leave my cell phone turned on and in my car while I’m at work. I had the problem of coming back to my phone after a full charge and seeing that it need to be plugged in! Or worse yet, it already shut off since the battery was too low. “Nonsense,” I thought. I didn’t use the phone at all for those 8 hours! Over a few weeks I independently tried all sorts of things to try to solve my battery life issue: – the usual: turn screen brightness down; no GPS unless using Maps, no Bluetooth unless driving – switched the phone to Airplane Mode -> FAIL — Phone idle percentage would be around 70% – un-installed ALL non-stock applications -> FAIL — Cell standby percentage would be the majority – turning off Auto Sync -> FAIL I narrowed the problem down to the Browser. If you’re like me, your Browser’s home page is the Google mobile search page — you know, the one that tries to use your phone’s location when you perform a search. Whenever I restarted my phone, I couldn’t repeat my battery problem. This is probably because the Browser wasn’t invoked and thus Google’s home page (with location service) wasn’t invoked. So now I get into the habit of Force Quitting the browser before leaving my phone in the car. I haven’t yet tried adjusting the search page’s setting to select ‘No’ for “Allow use of device location?” But I think this will yield the same result. Long story short: – Force quit your Browser (Phone Settings -> Applications -> Manage applications -> Running tab -> select Browser -> select Force stop) or – Disable use of device location on Google’s mobile homepage (On the Google mobile search page click the Settings link -> select ‘No’ for “Allow use of device location?”) or maybe – Change your Browser homepage to something else Hope that helps! December 14, 2010 Androidfan This is awesome info for beginers like me December 24, 2010 Name Most of the android phones have built it task killers, it would be stupid to download another, just a word to the wise.. December 26, 2010 James Frederick I use battery saver, it helps a lot, easy way to turn off stuff really quickly January 9, 2011 sd Recently got a Motorola Harm Android,Phoneis Good but the battery backup is worst…….. January 11, 2011 shahid. I just want to know howto save androud phone battery from idel. January 20, 2011 Tom.IT ===========!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!============= Yeah this guide is good, but it is very basic and mostly it is not enough! My first advice is=> Use a fine tuned mod and not the basic shitty stuff: I’ve a Samsung Galaxy S i9000 and I’m using Darky’s v8.1 mod (based on Android 2.2.1) and the juice lasts for 48-60 hours with normal usage (wifi usually on because I need it to get my mails, also reading books on it and listening to music), but with lower usage I was able to make it unplugged for 4 days. Also it is possible that your battery cache is storing false info from your battery percentage, if you’ve a newer kernel, the you should clear it and deplete from 100% to zero, this way the cache will store the true range of your battery capacity. Also there are a lot more tips and tricks, you only need to search the web ;) Regards from Hungary! January 21, 2011 Brian Turn “Haptic Feedback” off, just turning this off I got another ~2 hours of battery life on my Captivate. January 24, 2011 Randall Thanks for this. I was down to 3 hours of standby life. With your help, I found a silly app that I rarely used but thought it needed to synch with GPS continuously. Killing that, along with some other apps that synched too often, and I’m up to 16 hours of fairly active use. That is good enough for me and better than I’ve had since getting a smartphone. January 29, 2011 @pryerlee just buy a spare battery January 30, 2011 Aidil Get an iPhone 4. I have one and have nothing to worry bout battery. Been using wifi,apps,games and battery still holding strong at the end of the day. Yeah, multitasking on iPhone is not like on android, but hey, at least I don’t have to carry around spare charges and task managing my smartphone that’s suppose to be smart enough to mange itself in the first place. I like android and all it’s capabilities, but I love iPhone even more. :) February 14, 2011 Nirav Hello Everyone great guide, but I have only have question about email check frequency setting for Gmail. I am new to Android so please bare with me. I just got Droid X running 2.2 Froyo and I went to Account settings and I can not find email check frequency anywhere not even in OS settings menu. So if this setting is removed from 2.2 then where do I go to change email frequency settings? can someone please help. Thank you. February 15, 2011 jhonn mykeal smitthe i pull my fone off the charger at 6:55 am then turn it off at 7:40. i turn it on again at 3:15pm and text a lot and stuff and it usually makes it through the day. i had CHOMPSMS and i deleted it and noticed a lot longer battery life. it is apps after all and i only have 2 apps now because of it February 17, 2011 Outtanames999 All this advice is crap. Just put your POS phone back in the box and take it back. Android especially the shitty Samsung phones are losers. They need to fix this problem now. February 19, 2011 David Berman And, on top of all that, set your wallpaper to something all black or close to all black. No downside, less power, happier planet! February 20, 2011 Kunal @ TechHogger Android eats battery power like anything. All the tips are the only thing you can do to stop battery getting drained soon. February 23, 2011 Hiten Nice useful tips to save/extend battery life for Android based phones. I like this. February 23, 2011 battery problem actually before few days i buy a cell lg optimus n i charged last night till 11 pm (fully charged) but in morning i got shocked when seen the battery its only 54 percent how is it possible? when i seen the usage , my cell using 60 percent battery in standby . how is it possible? plz give me a solution for that February 24, 2011 mik This is going to seem like a really dumb question but a kid has just put a screen saver on my Samsung and I can’t get rid of it. I just want my original screen back. The picture of the city street that we must all start with. Please help!! February 24, 2011 WRAITH For android phones do not put all the widgets on the panels of your phone it can cause more work to the sync engine of your android phones. Just put those widgets that you need uninstall those apps that you don’t use. Power off your phone. February 28, 2011 RK Nice article. But it is all about turning a smart phone back to dumb. I got new myTouch 4G and it used to drain out every 7 to 8 hours (even in stand by mode – with all location, wi-fi, background data, sync turned off) Returned it in 8 days and back to my BB. I wonder how Android is gaining popularity with this big problem in their backyard. March 3, 2011 Albie For all of those who still haven’t tried JuiceDefender, try it at least for a few days. It doesn’t cost anything and can really make a difference! Simply put, what JuiceDefender does is it automatically manages the most battery-draining components of your handset (GPS, WiFi, etc.), powering them only when they are actually needed …rather than leaving them on all the time. So your phone is not crippled, it’s just much more power efficient! Anyway JuiceDefender does much more than that, it’s literally full packed with features for battery consumption optimization (connectivity scheduling, location-aware controls, battery threshold controls, etc.). It’s quite amazing what it can do. It is fully customizable and fully automatic, meaning that it only needs to be set up once, and then it runs by itself improving battery life from behind the scene. Think about it before spending 50$ on an extra battery, going nuts by micro-tweaking or even giving up on Android. You can find some video reviews on JuiceDefender’s Facebook Page and more info on its website. March 14, 2011 rino regarding the “Battery Usage Screen”, how do you read it? does it mean that the phone being idle consumes 15% more battery?? March 17, 2011 Cinny Kudos to Outtanames999 he is right on the mark about Samdung Android phones, they are P’sOS! What a total waste of $$ :( March 25, 2011 Robot Fail to this article for suggesting to use a task killer. I see we must not have much experience with Linux do we? Also Cinny the nexus S is made by Samsung. Case rested. April 5, 2011 gian my battery drains veryfast when I’m browsing using packet data and while sharing wifi(hotspot) isthis normal? April 14, 2011 Iain Great article…have added all relevant to my Galaxy S…sitting back and waiting for the battery bar to slow down now! April 20, 2011 Arvind Simple thing that you could do is that use network and display properties only when necessary. This simple tip can saves your batteries 2x longer. April 22, 2011 Chirag What does one need to do if they find that Android System is the one utilising the battery the most? Anyone having any idea please help. April 23, 2011 Brian N I ditched the Weather Channel and my battery usage is now a couple of days on the MyTouch with Android 2.2. I am going to reload and tell it not to use GPS. I can always request the weather with a zip code where I am at that time. But those iSheep!!! They just KILL ME! You could not PAY ME to own ANY of that Apple garbage. May 24, 2011 chxxn my phone samsung galaxy sl was left 78% of battery during night but the next morning the phone was out of battery and i checked the battery mainly used for cell standby (> 60%). any solution? how to reduce the cell standby %?? May 29, 2011 Tim Sullivan Helpful article and discussion. A new HTC software update from Verizon seems to help my thunderbolt. I use WiFi when available, 4G drains battery very fast: 4 hrs 4G v 12-13 hr w WiFi. I use airplane mode & sleep when not in use – turning off/on drains more than it saves. May 29, 2011 the AC I need to get back into programming, but in the meantime, is there an app that automates a lot of these steps that you can customize for specific battery levels? So far, no dice on search. Otherwise, great article. Hits all the good points. Cheers. May 30, 2011 Loving Android my android lasts 2+ days… just turn off apps you dont need… :D June 1, 2011 DeQueezie This worked for me. I don’t need to have all the settings on while at work so I turned the GPS and WiFi off. I’ll just have to see how it works when I am out and about. June 3, 2011 HardcoreJuice I have on my samsung galaxy S, Custom rom with black theme (black is good to save battery), setCPU at 400mhz normally on-demand and 100mhz when screen OFF, I’m also using Titanium backup PRO to freeze and delete user apps and system apps that arn’t needed for “me”(USE extreme caution if you plan on freezing/deleting system apps!!!!) Autostarts is the best app i have ever seen for disabling apps from starting when your phone boot up. I have just recently changed my theme to black and installed setCPU + autostarts… But before that i got 2 days with heavy use What i don’t recommend is, DONT use Juicedefender if you dont use 3g/wifi that much, it will do more harm to your batterylife…. I have an unlimited data plan on my phone and i have since long have uninstalled juicedefender,… i even had ultimatejuice but it didn’t need it that much June 21, 2011 oketcho augustine Thanks for every thing explained but my problem is not solved still. can you just help me and explain to me what is cell standby and phone idle and how i can reduce it because its the hell consuming a lot of battery on my phone.thanx June 21, 2011 ravi great !!! the backlight timer and the brightness decrement has got a change in my battery lifecycle. when i turn on my netconnection the appplications get automatically updated.any one plz tell the soluion to this to disable it. June 22, 2011 Penetreitor Isn’t suspicious?, it’s incredible how much the wireless functions (WiFi, GPS) waste the battery than the normal 3g calls/data… I can bet they have an arrangement with the phone companies to force battery consume on other wireless connections than 3g, with windows mobile the battery quite different… June 23, 2011 Dave I have been back and forth to the Verizon store and I am sick of this phone. It looses way too much battery life. Also, the Google maps takes forever to load when using the GPS. Sometimes it does not kick in for 20 minutes or so while driving. Does this happen to anyone else? I am hoping they replace this phone as I think I have a lemon. This is by the way a ‘droid 2. June 23, 2011 Casey @oketcho augustine – I assume Phone Idle is the phone looking for network/data when it is in sleep. But Im not positive on that one. Im also not positive how to shut this off, other than using Juice Defender, whose main function is turning off data when the phone sleeps(among many other functions). If you click on “Cell Standby” it will tell you what % of the time your phone is without a signal, which is the likely culprit as to why its eating up so much battery. I have been known to be w/out a signal more than 50% of the day, since my reception is so bad at my work. So occasionally I leave my phone in my car, where it has better reception. Turning off 4G when its not available or your not using it might help. I’ve been using Phone Info lately for that, but there are many others. June 24, 2011 pravin superb tips …!! thanks a lot..! June 26, 2011 attishu Thx, nice article. I recommend two freeware software as the other commenters. The Juice Defender beta is help to minimize the unnecessary data connections and turn off the Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, GPS if the battery going too low. The Timeriffic help to setup profiles (example the data connection is not necessary for me weekdays between 10pm-6am and can change the volume, backlight, wi-fi, gps etc.) and working together with the APNDroid and RingGuard) With this two software my Galaxy S II working for two days. (approx. 2hrs talk, some music, ebook, game, few minutes gps and facebook using every day.) June 30, 2011 justin garnett It’s quite simple really. Disable DATA Disable 3G and use 2G only Set home screen to low back light and a blank wallpaper VOILA. 24 hours +++++++ of battery and full phone useage. If and when you need email, turn it all back on. July 6, 2011 AngieeMariee Thxz a lot i really needed this for my trip which takes 13 hours I know that I can’t last without my phone so I needed this July 11, 2011 Rajwan Ahmed Hi, Nice article please keep it up. can anyone guide me how to enable USB mas storage in galaxy fit.. Regards, Rajwan Ahmed July 19, 2011 les @jerrod “when i check my battery it says “camera” for 96%? that doesnt seem right–i dont use my camera that much.” Me too… and i never use the camera!. Shitty phone or shitty Android? Mine’s an Orange San Francisco. July 21, 2011 David Ellis I’m not very tech oriented and fairly new at this. My LG Optimus was using a ton of battery like every 2-3 hours when I first got it so I began to investigate. Not really knowing what I was doing I made the mistake of going to settings-applications-running services to see what all was running. I wanted to “turn off” the app and went to stop service where it gives a warning about it wont work until started again. The part about “this may have undesirable on the application….” is what concerns me. I can’t seem to get these applications to work again like Market so I can download things like Juice Defender mentioned here. Can anyone help me? I really don’t want to do a factory reset and lose all my setups. July 22, 2011 Alina Okay I’ve never been so frustrated with a phone. I have carry my charger with me all the time. When first got the phone, a few weeks ago I wouldn’t need to plug in my phone for 3 days if a didn’t use it too much. I didn’t use any apps at first. Than slowly i only downlaoded a couple and even than I barely use it! Progressively my battery just kept getting worse and worse. It’s been gradual, very weird. One of my friends sent me a link to this website and showed me how to turn off all these apps and anything that potentially might be draining my battery! So right after I expected the battery to be extended. On my way home from work I called my boyfriend for 1-2min. Once I got of the phone I saw the battery go from almost have 1/2 to connect battery to charger. So when I got home at night I plugged in the phone and allowed it to fully charge, than I unplugged it! I did not use the phone the whole night and by morning the battery was almost fully drained! So I checked my battery usage to makesure I didn’t miss anything and it said cell standby 51%, and phone idle 50%. That’s totally unacceptable. I think I got a bad phone. I love this phone, but I can’t use it I need a replacement. July 26, 2011 chinoo What is the use of purchasing a mobile phone when it is not serving the purpose. Android platform no matter how fast it could be but is still lagging in terms of technology because could not fix the very flaw battery issue (no battery no use of features) that killing the very meaning of mobile device. I would rather use a dated o.s which serves my purpose substantially and is stable enough to keep me connected atleast for telephony. But i am hopeful there will a sensible platform for mobile phones, developed soon by sensible people who would restore the sense of mobile phones. Mobile phones are phones and computers are computers. Grow up. Thats why battery issue. putting wrong software on the wrong hardware. July 26, 2011 Gord Just looked over many comments for Tasker in Android Market. It INCREASES battery consumption a lot. Maybe shouldn’t be recommended in a battery-saving article. July 31, 2011 Mr Khan It is a very bad thing we have with all android phones. August 4, 2011 shania does it cost you if you dont exit everything from your task manager ??? August 4, 2011 SUSAN i believe that the usage report is telling you…that of the battery usage that you had…51% was for one thing and 40% was for another and 9% was for another…it does not mean that 51% of your battery was used …it means that even if only 1% of your battery was used…then 51% of that 1% was for that particular thing…do the math, add up all the usages…it will round, but the total should be close to 100%… it is not how much battery was used August 4, 2011 jonathan setcpu for the win: underclocks to save battery & overclock for better performance August 10, 2011 EJM Just finished reading your article and all of the comments. That’s on my Optimus V, & still have 48% of my battery left. According to Browser’s app, that was about 1.8 MB of information. It only took 2 seconds to capture, but hours to read. To conserve the battery I simply went from your web-page to Airplane mode; allowing me to turn the screen off, go to supper, come back, turn on the screen and read some more……repeat, repeat Sometimes ya just gotta rest your eyes. Well there. Just took it out of Airplane mode & all the text that I’ve written is still there. OK then, Submit Comment . August 10, 2011 Kevin I got my droid two weeks ago and I’m just curious… Instead of bothering with Task Killer, Juice Defender and all that stuff, why not just do what the article says to do (use the power widget to toggle wi-fi, GPS, etc. on and off)? Seems like those other apps are more trouble than what they’re worth. August 14, 2011 Shane I have a samsung galaxy indulge. Was getting 4-6 hours from stock battery even with turning off everything (gps, wifi, auto sync and background) for most of that time. got an extended battery ($15+/-) and universal clip type charger ($5) from amazon. First day with new battery turned everything on plus google maps at 3:00am. Left atlanta for savannah with navigation on the whole way.arrived about 8 am. Worked all day headed back to atlanta.got home at 9pm and still had over 10% battery juice. Definitely worth $20 I think. August 22, 2011 Gipson I just have to chime in here about batteries and battery drain. 1) Both iPhone and Andoid phones (all cell phones in that manner) use Li-Ion batteries. This technology are good for about 300-400 full charge cycles. So if you drain your phone COMPLETELY every day, expect to replace it every year. +1 for Android phones where the batteries are replaceable 2) Phones all use the same technology at the physical layer. If you’re transmitting data, it draws the most power. Also there is a window around a data transfer where it keeps the session up. 1 sync of 100kb is way less power than 4 syncs of 25kb. To sync, it also needs to wake up the processor. So by changing a sync from every 15mins to every hour, you do wonders for your processor. This is the same on iPhone or Android. It is the way the core technology work and has nothing to do with how Google (Android) or Apple implemented it. Install the same apps with the same syncing intervals and battery drain will be the same with this regard. 3) Android phones such as the Galaxy series with AMOLED screens draw more power for their screens than iPhone. It looks better though so it is a tradeoff some people make. 4) iPhone users have a euphoric view on their cell phones. The ignore the little annoyances because they feel blessed by the hand of Steve Jobs. An article posted by “scientists” illustrating how Apple products trigger the same part of the brain as religion. http://news.cnet.com/8301-17852_3-20064577-71.html 5) So if you want the same battery life as an iPhone, buy a phone with as small a screen as the iPhone (can’t get a Galaxy S2 or many HTC phones)… and as dim a screen as the iPhone (can’t get a Galaxy S or many HTC phones). And set up the same sync intervals and VOILA out of the box the same battery life. If you buy a bigger screen with the same size battery, you do the math. If you buy a brighter screen with the same size battery… same thing. August 22, 2011 Gipson Forgot to add: I’ve got a Samsung Galaxy S2. Straight from the store a month ago. Added tons of games and apps. Two e-mail accounts syncing every hour, Facebook, Google+, news feeds and weather downloading, etc.. No task killer or anything done other than the base operating system controls and I get about 30hr on a charge sending emails and talking on the phone, playing the occassional game to waste time. Course if I start streaming YouTube, it’ll only last a couple hours, keeping the screen on, data session active, loud speakerphone and CPU spun up to full power processing the video-feed. August 23, 2011 Dan The easiest thing to do is download quick settings for free on the market. But I wasn’t able to do the whole data auto data thing. August 23, 2011 Gipson Also note that if you have 5 applications all updating every 15 mins (i.e. email, twitter, facebook, news, traffic/weather), there is nothing syncing these up to all update at the same time. So you might have data activity 5 times every 15 mins which is every 3 mins. This will kill battery. August 24, 2011 Brett Is there a difference in using a white wallpaper vrs a black wallpaper August 25, 2011 Alia Some good tips but am really stunned to see that you would recommend AIRPLANE MODE in order to turn off wifi. This is absolutely the most idiotic suggestion ever – doing so will stop any phone calls & messages from being received. Yet you make no mention of this & people don’t always read comments. Task killers are debatable also. You can turn off the function of searching for wifi in the wifi settings and turn wifi only on as needed using the power widget. August 26, 2011 markp1989 one app is recommend is “Watchdog lite” its a Task Manager (not Killer) you set the cpu threshold and it will notify you if a program uses more than that in the background, makes it very easy to spot misbehaving apps. August 31, 2011 XinTuS-1765 Pretty cool intel, very helpul… September 5, 2011 Vortarulo @Brett: Yes, of course. A white background uses as much LCD power as possible, because it’s all bright, while a black screen doesn’t eat any LCD power (almost). But the difference shouldn’t be that big. September 5, 2011 Millie k i have a android…. its a LG Shine Plus With Google. and its soooo slow!!!! it keeps saying ” force Cloes” and its really making me mad!!!!!!!!!!!! i would give it 4 1/2 stars but im giving it 2 stars because its so slow. when im trying to call someone it always freezes and it takes me a while. and sometimes i have to turn off the phone and turn it bak on hoping it will go faster!!! could it be becase the Lithiumlon polymer battery 2.7V in the phone??!! i dont understand!!!! i need help!!! -Millie. September 7, 2011 n00dles My SGS is rooted and running the MIUI custom firmware, battery on light to medium usage lasts for about 2days. Some tips would be to perform a full calibration & power cycle on the battery, for those on rooted phones, download either Titanium Backup or Root Explorer and remove/uninstall/rename an app called TelocationProvider.apk. By removing this you will see a decrease in your AndroidOS % resulting in lesser drain. There are some who claim that by deleting the BatteryStats via CWM helps while others say its not good to delete this and takes longer for the battery to calibrate itself. Always give it a few full charges before you’ll notice a difference, allow the battery to calibrate itself (2 to 3 charges) The thing I did that I noticed the biggest change was formatting the entire SDCard and flashing a clean rom from scratch. Hope this helps some of you guys out there, I know how you feel, it drove me nuts. September 7, 2011 Gzoref I’m sure Juice Defender has been mentioned. It’s an unbelievably easy way to increase your battery life significantly. Another thing is to flash a custom ROM which is made to be lighter and more efficient. I can’t be 100% certain that it helps, but for my Fascinate it has greatly (I mean GREATLY) increased my phone’s speed, eliminated ANY lag time and just overall made the phone more enjoyable to use. I’m pretty sure it cuts battery usage too. September 8, 2011 RealZeratul @Brett and Vortarulo: No, actually for a LCD a white background is best energy-wise because the background light is always on, but a black area additionally needs to have the transistors for the individual pixels powered on. The effect is relatively small, though (and of course darker display settings still help because they affect the back-light and not the transistors). However, for AMOLED displays (and CRTs :D) it is the other way around, here you save large amounts of energy by using a dark theme/background, because an individual pixels battery drain is proportional to its brightness. September 17, 2011 bogs I’ve adjusted the display setting to the lowest possible level but the built-in battery usage screen still shows (display/backlight) at 80%. Need help. September 24, 2011 Jon Judging by the amount of stuff that you have to turn off, there is nothing left to enjoy in Android. I like the “openness” of Android but I will wait until the batteries get better before jumping into more than $600 affair that would cost me a lot of inconveniences. September 28, 2011 KyL3 It’s a trade off that I enjoy making. Openness is just as crucial as the ability to put it to use. Batteries aren’t that expensive and you all make me schizophrenic. Good day. October 3, 2011 VZ I just switched from iPhone to Android. When I read the “Complete Guide to Maximizing Your Android Phone’s Battery Life”, it amazed me that all these features that attracted me to Android need to be turned off. One item they forgot to mention: If you turn off your device completely, the battery lasts a long long time :) October 6, 2011 shiv good advice! But you actually need not go through all this hassle – just get a good ROM installed!! I have a MOTO Defy and it lasts upto 48 hours and even more sometimes with normal use. When I’m on 3G / WiFi it lasts upto 36 hours. With lightning fast speed and such good battery backup, it not that bad I guess!! October 8, 2011 Amr saleh I’ve a samsung galaxy mini it’s a good phone, but thre same battery issue, when using wifi the battery getting down from fully charge to zero after about 2:30 hours, the task killer doesn’t save battery, it’s using more battery plus slowing the phone too bcz it killing the apps that not using any power, but just work as a virtual memory to take aless time to open it when needed,I tried to reduce my usage of the phone as a test,I didn’t use any data connection (wifi,gps, packet data ),I just use it as a phone & listening some music&I get a two days of battery life before need to recharging, absolutely it’s meaning I didn’t use the most of phone services& some of them need a internet connection all the time I think like news & weather widget, yahoo, youtube, market widgets all of them useless when no network connection, you can let the background data & location setting off when you using internet that will save battery & speeds up the data connection (up & downloading) too & just turn them on when needed, gallery is eating the battery too even when no video played so don’t use it if you don’t really need it, turn flight mode on when no signal or signal is week,bcz the phone using more power searching available network & you can turn it on at night too if you don’t expect important calls.I hope that helping you.thanks. October 8, 2011 Amr saleh Some thing else , don’t clearing memory (RAM) all the time bcz it working like task killer app & kill the services didn’t use power or battery, just be sure you end take from the android task manager after using them & clearing ram memory when you need (when the device hang or freezing) October 10, 2011 4G Reaper I have an HTC Sensation 4G rooted and flashed with XE Rom for beats audio, will be going to cyanogenmod as soon as there is an official release with an overclock. I barely lose 70% battery in a day (8AM-11PM) and am a heavy music/data user, often multi-tasking with music/games/web browsing. Most ROMs are undervolted as well as overclocked, and don’t use much battery life. For the average user, you can completely turn syncing off, I noticed it was a major improvement on battery life, and as stated, WiFi drains less juice than data, especially since you can set it off with tasker and what not. Brightness is still one of the main keys for battery life. October 11, 2011 Galaxy My samsung galaxy mini is too slow when browsing or downloading even when using 3g(hsdpa7.2), any one know why??? October 11, 2011 4G Reaper Try using WiFi, 3g is slow to start with, but you could also go and disable background data under settings/accounts and sync i believe, that should give a noticeable speed boost. October 11, 2011 Galaxy Thank you fours advice,i tired all that things before, but it’s still too slow, when using 2g, the download is faster than 3g, even it suspend many times when I trying download files, and 3g signal is very low either (5 to 13 as maximum from phone status list), when compared to nokia x6 (that lower hsdpa about 3.6mps), the x6 was much faster than galaxy, some one told me that is a phone problem, so what you think??is it??? and thanks again. October 12, 2011 Galaxy Thank you,Finally I found the reason, it was a problem with my sim card,I change it and I hour more browsing speed.Thanks alot. October 13, 2011 4G Reaper No problem, glad it was resolved :) October 22, 2011 123 Hi every one,i make simple test,i charged my phones battery to full,i enabled packet data setting (using 2g networks) & put weather widget on one of the screens I have, make some calls (23 m), listening to some music (about 1 hour & a half, very light usage (no browsing or downloading,, no watching videos, at end of day(after 22 hours), my battery usage 35%, that’s mean that enabling packet data all the time don’t affect very much of battery life, it j just how many services & widgets that using back ground data you enabled , so the android phones batteries life may be don’t enough for its great performance & services, but we can still learn how to user our phones & here some advices 1) set your display brightness level to just what you need, for indoor using about 25:35% is very good, and adjust it when needed (like using your phone on sunny day). 2) don’t enable many services or widgets that are using back ground data, just what you really need & use& set the refresh rate to average (i set up the weather widget to update every 3 hours). 3) use a3g on-off widget to switching from 2g to 3g when needed (browsing & downloading), and back to 2g after finish, you can get the on-off 3g widget from android market for free. 4) use wifi to access the web when available, it’s much faster than 3g& less power using. 5) keep your wifi, bluetooth,gps,& rotation sensor disable if you don’t need them. 6) don’t download, using a task killer app, it don’t do any thing positive, it just kill apps that the android system using as a virtual memory to be quick & less power using when using those apps again, mean that the task killer is using power to turn apps (don’t use any power) off, and getting system(device) slower & use more power to enable them again. 7) as the task kilter, don’t clear your memory (ram) all time, it has the same effect of the task killer, just use it when needed (Device hang issue for example). 8) don’t use your phone as a computer all the time and usea real computer when you can, use your phone as computer just when really you need like searching about an important things & informations when no computer available. I hop that helpful, the smart phones are great devices but manufactures really need to improve batteries, and I think they well. October 25, 2011 Johnny MMA fan ######## I have a samsung Galaxy S Rooted with a custom ROM. Roms make a MASSIVE difference on your batterys drain. One user pointed out that MANY of the ROMS he flashed on this phone gave him bad battery life at no more then 10 hours. A different rom (macnut11 if i remember correctly) gave him a huge increase. Keep this in mind. I’ve come to the conclusion if you’ve done steps like toggling data, brightness, removing widgets and auto sync and still see a big drain then its time to replace your battery. They can only last so many cycles. I’ve done all i can to reduce consumption and i get 8 hours tops WITHOUT data on. With it on im looking at 5-6 hours tops with medium usage. Another thing to point out is what MODEM your ROM or phone comes with. Changing that will result in a different outcome. It might simply be time to change your battery. Hope i helped you all!######## October 27, 2011 Johnny MMA fan ############ Huge update by me for you guys just in time. I actually managed to crank out a ton more battery finally! I narrowed it down to two major things. Use the spare parts app to check your partial wake usage in your battery history. You’ll see whats eating your battery the most. Delete all the apps that you can do without. For me Tango was eating a decent percent and i never even use the app. Deleting it helped. Another thing is to drain your phones battery to about 15 %, Turn your phone OFF (VERY Important) ! Charge too 100% (Some phones might not reach a full 100% so make sure not to keep an eye on that) If you have root… Boot into recovery using your hardbuttons, go to advance, wipe battery stats. You should be seeing a few more hours at least. My old rom didn’t allow my phone to sleep and charge which is why by battery was off by a lot. These made a massive difference for me. XD Enjoy people.########### DID YOU KNOW?

Image: John Allen Photography Gráinne Dwyer, CEO at Ludgate Digital Hub and co-organiser of National Digital Week, answers some of our questions ahead of Skibbereen’s big tech event. Gráinne Dwyer is CEO of the Ludgate Initiative in Skibbereen, which recently launched a co-working hub with one of the fastest broadband connections in the country. The €1m 10,000 sq ft Ludgate Digital Hub has attracted start-ups from LA, Chicago and London and is now being used as a case study for Europe on how to rejuvenate rural coastal communities. Dwyer is also co-organiser of National Digital Week, a digitally focused conference aiming to explore opportunities for digital in rural areas. The conference ran for the first time last year, with over 1,600 attendees and 80 international and national speakers. What will National Digital Week bring to the busy tech calendar? National Digital Week is beginning to attract a cult following, with over 70pc of attendees to date registered as return visitors to Skibbereen. The audience is a mix of national and international start-ups, SMEs, tech and digital enthusiasts, industry leaders, third-level students, female entrepreneurs, corporate employees and those looking for inspiration. The event is unique as it is in an unusual rural location and is supported by event partners, AIB, Vodafone and Google. We don’t do early-bird discounts, VIP areas and ‘gurus’, and ultimately our pricing is affordable. Attendees can expect to get full access to all stages, workshops and one-to-one clinics, lunches, teas and coffees with the inclusive ticket price. National Digital Week is like a mini festival where attendees can enjoy activities around West Cork as well as access to all entertainment in the arenas each night, including Céilí Allstars, Booka Brass, Dr Feelgood & the Electric Mayhem, and DJ Ian Richards. Attendees from last year liked our informal but quirky approach and the networking opportunities are fantastic. You could even be sitting for lunch with speakers from Uber, Airbnb, Just Eat, and lots more, which gives the event a very personable dimension. The Google workshops and Google Digital Garage [are] a fantastic selling point for us, as it provides attendees access to expertise they would only find in London or Dublin. The one-to-one Google Digital Garage clinics will be a big hit again this year! If you attend National Digital Week, it is assured you will have a fantastic experience, make valuable lasting connections and if you are a start-up, you might even bag yourself some investment financing. How have things been going for the Ludgate Digital Hub? Since opening, we have had an unprecedented demand in use for the Ludgate Digital Hub. By now, we are averaging over 150 users of the hub every month. We are now home to regional meetings, off-site programmes for large corporates, and a base for local and visiting businesses. We secured our first company from Silicon Valley who have relocated to Skibbereen. We have recently launched a Call II for the Ludgate Seed Capital fund which is valued at over €450,000. This has attracted interest from national and international start-ups and we hope to process all applications before Christmas. What did it take to get the Ludgate Digital Hub off the ground? The concept around Ludgate developed in November 2014 when a group of local entrepreneurs and business people met to discuss what could they ‘as a collective’ facilitate in Skibbereen. The Ludgate initiative was ultimately to create a digital roadmap for the region; sustaining jobs, enterprise and digital education which will create a sustainable future for Skibbereen and the wider West Cork area. ‘There has been little or no state investment in Skibbereen for the last 30 years so a self-help model was the only option for the town’ There has been little or no state investment in Skibbereen for the last 30 years so a self-help model was the only option for the town. Looking towards Government should no longer be option A for rural areas. Places like Skibbereen, Dingle, Dungarvan and Westport, to name a few, all have savvy business people, fantastic community spirit and a willingness to work in collaboration to create a future for their local town. It is now just up to the Government to meet these communities halfway. What are the key selling points to attract business to Skibbereen? We have four core selling points which we use to attract companies. One: State-of-the-art office space equipped with a 1GB connection, meeting rooms, training and innovation spaces, and video-conferencing suites to ensure all start-ups can remain connected with their clients and networks. With our 1GB connection, geography is no longer a limiting factor of where start-ups can locate. The Ludgate Hub offers broadband connectivity provided by Vodafone of 1000 Mbps, as the town is connected to Siro’s 100pc fibre-optic broadband network. This has turned Skibbereen into a ‘1 Gigabit town’. Gráinne Dwyer at the Ludgate Digital Hub. Image: Valerie O’Sullivan Two: Talent. We have a comprehensive database of skilled professionals in the area to match with re-locating start-ups. By matching talent with our affordable rates, it proves an attractive option for start-ups. Our board has an extensive global contact list which offers an additional angle to locating in the Ludgate Hub, especially for those looking to scale internationally. The Ludgate Hub offers mentorship to tenants, which can prove an invaluable resource to early-stage start-ups. To say as a company you have been mentored by our board member Ronan Harris (managing director of Google UK and Ireland) or Lord David Puttnam (Oscar-winning film producer) is something Irish start-ups would not normally have easy access to. We have 11 high-profile board members which mentor our tenants when requested. If they do not match the sector of the start-up, they will use their contact list to ensure they get access to the right people. ‘Ours is is a very attractive option for those looking for an alternative outside of Dublin, New York or Berlin’ Three: Our 1GB town offers scope of development way beyond the Ludgate Hub. We run a number of local projects encouraging all to use the 1GB connectivity to its fullest potential. We have an e-retail scheme called eStreet; iPad and digital literacy classes; secondary school courses which teach coding, HTML and Java; as well as a range of other programmes. By encouraging the town to utilise the connectivity, it provides scope to develop Ludgate 2 and Ludgate 3 in other office spaces around the town. Four: Lifestyle. It is no secret that West Cork can be considered the Riviera of Ireland. Our location on the Wild Atlantic Way, stunning scenery, world-class artisan food, access to schools (without waiting lists), access to affordable accommodation and a typical six-minute commute to the workplace is a very attractive option for those looking for an alternative outside of Dublin, New York or Berlin. And what are the weak spots? The most challenging aspect of the initiative is to address the lack of digital education for all citizens of our community. There is no point in communities getting a 1GB connection if they do not know how to use it. Our board member, Lord David Puttnam, who is Digital Champion of Ireland, has tirelessly campaigned for the digitisation of Ireland and he encourages young and old to utilise technology as a means and way of making life easier. ‘There is no point in communities getting a 1GB connection if they do not know how to use it’ The Ludgate Hub features in a four-part series called Making Ireland Click and the site has some fantastic resources on how to get access to training and how to utilise technology. We need to create a pipeline for future employees for the tech companies of Skibbereen in 2020, so we run tech modules in the local secondary school. Everything is now possible with our 1GB connection. Do you see this model for a rural digital hub being replicated elsewhere? We have been working on the Ludgate Hub initiative for over 18 months now, and many ask, ‘How has Skibbereen become so successful?’ To answer them, in brief, I say Skibbereen is surfing a wave of positivity which boosts the community. I explain that they need to identify their unique assets, and the rest is risk, grit and determination. In the case of the Ludgate Hub, the 1GB fibre-optic connection creates opportunities for the town to develop employment and foster enterprise, as a location is often irrelevant for service-based industries. Digital will negate the need to focus on geography, in a locational sense. Coming from a geography graduate, I am careful how I phrase that sentence! ‘Rural towns need to identify their unique assets, and the rest is risk, grit and determination’ If communities can work together and come up with a cohesive plan, Ludgate can be replicated nationally. Since our launch, we have been contacted by over 20 villages and towns around Ireland reaching out and looking to see how Ludgate was created. They all have empty post offices, empty Garda stations and abandoned premises. Once you have the willingness of the community to help themselves, good things will happen. Each town can create their own digital roadmap, bespoke to their own local strengths. The Ludgate initiative is also akin to the Google Kansas project, where a 1GB connection facilitated the growth of 121 new companies within two years. I was selected to represent Ireland at the European Digital Assembly in Bratislava in September where I showcased Ludgate as an example of best practice, and it received unanimous praise as a blueprint for rural Europe. We have also been selected as a finalist for the European Best 1GB Broadband Project 2016 and will travel to Brussels after National Digital Week to hear the result of the competition. What would you like to see from a renewed Government plan for this region? I think projects like the Ludgate initiative [have] hopefully inspired policymakers to think outside the traditional models of out-of-town enterprise parks and the historic drive to have an exclusive urban focus for job creation. We have proven that areas like Skibbereen could be the test bed for the next generation of new Googles or Facebooks. We have attracted start-ups from Miami, Illinois, LA, South Africa and London. ‘We have proven that areas like Skibbereen could be the test bed for the next generation of new Googles or Facebooks’ In time, I think we have given confidence to [the] Government to showcase alternatives for international start-ups to locate in areas like Skibbereen. We now have a very attractive menu for those looking to locate in Ireland. Initiatives like the PorterShed in Galway can help promote coastal cities like Galway, and we can represent the south-west of Ireland. I think renewed plans to focus clustering of sectors in regional Ireland would be welcomed; co-working and office spaces are only buildings without experienced networks and people. I think a greater focus needs to be placed on developing regional hubs with experienced business people like our board, who have the expertise to drive and support job creation. We can learn a lot from what has failed in the past, in terms of regional and rural action plans. Bottom-up initiatives like Ludgate [are] the most sustainable option for areas like Skibbereen. Once the community and Government can work together to create local blueprints for development, success is more likely. National Digital Week returns to Skibbereen, West Cork from 10 to 12 November, expecting over 1,600 attendees for two arenas with over 80 speakers. National Digital Week 2015 was a sell-out, and you can book online for 2016 at digitalweek.ie, and follow @DigitalWeekIrl and #NDW16 on Twitter for updates.

The ROM is quite rich with features and should make a happy camper out of any Nexus 5 owner at any day of the week. No dout you're interested in this ROM, and we're going to share how to download it and have it up and running on your device. It's not hard to do but the steps are very meticulous. Initial Steps First off, you'll need to download the USB drivers for your Nexus 5 on your computer. Go to Menu > Settings > Applications and activate USB debugging. Furthermore, make sure your Nexus 5 is rooted — but we shouldn't even be saying this in the first place. Bear in mind, it would be wise to install a TWRP or CWM recovery tool just in case something goes wrong. Make sure you've backed up your software with the tools mentioned above. Installing The Euclidean ROM After securing your backup, connect the Nexus 5 to a PC using a USB cable. Copy the downloaded ROM files to the SD card, according to WCCFTECH. Remove the Nexus 5 from the computer and power it off. You now need to boot into recovery mode. To do this, press and hold the 1) Volume Up 2) Home and 3) Power buttons all at the same time. It's now time to reset your device. Do this from the TWRP/CWM menu. Go to Wipe > Factory Reset, and you're all set to move on. Finally, it's time to return to the recovery menu and hit the Install button. The next step is to search for the Euclidean ROM from the SD card where the firmware was copied. Confirm to kick start the installation and watch as Android 7.1 Nougat begins to power your Nexus 5. After the installation is complete, restart the device and have fun using Android 7.1 Nougat. It's the best version of Android and works well with the Google Pixel. However, there's no word at this time on how well it works with the Nexus 5.

Log in Sign up Login with Facebook Login with Google Go Advanced News Reviews Phones Home News Blog Reviews Comments (39) Post your comment Pixel XL adoption is faster than Nexus 6P, says analytics firm 03 November 2016 Google is pushing the Pixel phones much harder than it did any Nexus before it. According to data by Appboy, its working. The Pixel XL took a week to reach a market share comparable to the Nexus 6P two weeks after launch. And this is with some stock shortages at both Google and Verizon stores. The smaller Pixel is showing some amazing growth too. A week after launch day, its numbers were 274% up. Similarly, the Pixel XL more than doubled its launch day numbers after a week of sales (up 158%). Compare that to the established Galaxy brand - the S7 doubled its numbers a week later, growing slower than its predecessor, the Galaxy S6, which grew 171% in a week. Of course, the chart makes it clear that while the Pixels are winning in terms of relative numbers, the absolute number of Galaxy S phones sold in the first week far outweighs the Pixels. Still, not a bad showing for a new brand and its clearly going better than the last round of Nexus phones.

A view of the Red Fort in New Delhi. Google Maps will have 360 degrees virtual tour of 280 monuments across the country Kolkata, Nov 3:   Google has tied up with Archaelogical Survey of India (ASI) for 360 degree virtual tour of 280-odd monuments across the country, an official of the tech giant said. “We have a tie-up with ASI for 360 degrees virtual tour of 280 monuments across the country of which 30 are in West Bengal,” Sanket Gupta, programme manager of Google Maps told reporters here today. He said ASI had given the permission to Google for creating the virtual tour, which would be available in the maps. Some of the major monuments are Taj Mahal, Victoria Memorial and the ruins of Hampi, he said, adding eight were from Kolkata. He said Google has launched an array of products in India like offline view of maps, live traffic alerts and inclusion of unknown places on the maps by local guides. Asked about Google Street View, Gupta said that authorities at the central and state levels were denying permission. “In India we are trying to work with the state and central levels for allowing Street View,” he said, adding neighbouring countries like Bangladesh and Sri Lanka had allowed the same. Gupta said one billion people across the globe were using Google maps and India was among the top five.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Google’s new Pixel lineup may be its most expensive smartphone family yet, but that hasn’t stopped pure Android fans. The company’s new devices managed to outsell the popular Nexus 6P during their first week on the market. Pixel and Pixel XL are by far Google’s greatest smartphones to date. They’re pretty, they have stellar displays and superb cameras, and they offer almost all the features you could want in a high-end smartphone (except water-resistance and a microSD card slot). Google has also put more effort into marketing the Pixel lineup than it did with previous handsets, which means more consumers are aware of them. It has ads all over the internet, billboards in big cities, and ads on TV. According to Appboy, which analyzed more than 100 million app installs between October 20 and October 27 to determine Pixel sales, this marketing effort is paying off. Pixel and Pixel XL are selling a whole lot faster than the Nexus 6P. During its first week, the Pixel grabbed 0.016 percent of the entire smartphone market share, while Pixel XL grabbed 0.020 percent. That doesn’t seem like a lot, but it’s not bad when you consider how tough the smartphone market is, and how many devices are available. Incredible growth in week one What’s more impressive is Pixel’s growth rate. After one week, sales of the Pixel were up 274 percent over launch day, while sales of the Pixel XL were up 158 percent. That’s even greater than the Galaxy S7, which grew 104 percent, and the S7 edge, which grew 171 percent. It’s important to note that the Pixel sales are nowhere near those of the Galaxy S7 series, but Google will certainly be pleased with growth like this. And let’s not forget it could have been even greater had Pixel supply not been constrained for Google and Verizon. Have you picked up your Pixel yet?

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google ends support for Eclipse Android Developer Tools By John Hoff - November 3, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter If you remember your Android development history, you will find that years in the past (ok, not so long ago, but you get the idea) Google provided a plugin for the Eclipse integrated development environment (IDE) so that developers wouldn’t have to switch IDEs to start developing apps for Android. With the release of Android Studio 2.2, Google is now announcing that it is officially ending support for the Eclipse plugin. To be clear, Eclipse will still work, as it is not Google’s software. It’s just that the plugin will no longer work. Google is clearly pushing its own project in Android Studio to be the recommended IDE where developers make their Android apps. That’s pretty understandable, if you think about it. More so when you see that almost all of the tools and thingamajigs in the Eclipse plugin are present in Android Studio. And then you realize that Android Studio 2.2 is a free download on Windows, Mac OS, and Linux, so the arguments stack up against you not using Android Studio. On the other hand, there will be some developers out there who will rail against this decision by Google. If you’ve gotten used to working in Eclipse, moving to Android Studio will take some effort. But then again, all the tools you need will be there, and then some.

(Image: Google) Google's virtual reality headset, the Daydream View, will be available in five countries from November 10, 2016, priced $79 in the USA. The device is an exclusive gateway to Google's Daydream VR platform and all of its content. Unveiled at Google's latest major conference, October 4, 2016, in San Francisco, this new virtual reality headset promises to plunge users into a whole world of virtual reality content via the Daydream platform. To access this content, users will need a Daydream View headset as well as a compatible smartphone. For the moment, the only compatible phones are Google's new Pixel handsets. The headset will be available November 10 from the Google Store and retailers in the US ($79 USA), Canada ($99 CAD), the UK (£69 GBP), Germany (€69 EUR) and Australia ($119 AUD). The system promises spectacular content, including 3D video from sites like YouTube, Google Play Movies and Hulu, as well as loads of games. There's even access to Street View for virtually visiting more than 70 countries. In a different genre, the platform also features news apps like The Guardian and The Wall Street Journal. The Daydream View headset is actually a fairly basic piece of kit. Like Google's rudimentary Cardboard viewer, it's designed for use with a smartphone, which slots into the device. The Daydream View is, however, sturdier than the cardboard version and has a remote control with trackpad, gyroscope and accelerometer. This kind of 3D headset is a world away from more sophisticated models like the Oculus Rift or the HTC Vive, for example. Still, such devices seem to have a bright future ahead. Chinese manufacturer Xiaomi recently launched a very similar device, the Mi VR Glasses, compatible with all of the brand's smartphones and featuring a remote, selling for just $38. Microsoft recently announced the upcoming release of various virtual reality headsets from partner manufacturers like Acer, HP and Lenovo, all priced under $300 and designed for use with Windows computers.
