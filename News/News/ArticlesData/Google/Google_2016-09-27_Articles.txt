For convenience, Google will not close these private searches when you leave the app. You will have to do that yourself. A friendly reminder, though. Going incognito doesn’t mean you’re completely private. It “doesn’t hide your browsing from your employer, your internet service provider, or the websites you visit.” The Google app won’t hide your searches from Google, either, but it won’t tie them to your account. One other feature added to the Google app on iOS is allowing you to watch YouTube videos directly in the app. Nicole Batac | Post a Comment | Share Article Print Article Permalink tagged Google app, iOS Email Article in Apple, First Looks, Google, Mobile, News, app news Reader Comments There are no comments for this journal entry.

After celebrating its 18th birthday earlier this week, the Mountain View based firm had much to announce at the Google for India event, including a brand new app called YouTube Go. On Tuesday, the company also updated its Google Search aka Google app for iOS, bringing several new features. Announcing the changes in a blog post, Google's Unni Narayanan, Director, Product Management, said the three new features being added will make the app "more private, video-friendly and stable." The updated app (v19.0) is now available via the App Store.Users of the Google Search app for iOS can now search privately with incognito mode. Just like incognito mode in browsers, searches and browsing history will not be saved. Users can turn on incognito mode via settings. Users will also be able to utilise Touch ID fingerprint recognition technology to ensure only they are able to re-entering an existing incognito session. A 3D Touch shortcut has also been provided, allowing users to enter incognito mode simply by hard pressing the app icon. The next major feature addition is the ability to watch YouTube videos directly within the Google app. This means, users will not be directed to their browser or YouTube app once they click on a video link in their search results. Finally, as mentioned, the third major addition is stability - Google claims the crash rate of the app has been reduced by 50 percent, which in other words means the app is now "twice as reliable" in Google's words. The company has also improved compatibility and stability of the app for iOS 10 users. Another unmentioned change is that the Google Now cards have been renamed to Feed - mirroring a similar move on the Android app. Tags: Google Search, Google, Google for iOS, Google Search for iOS, iOS 10, iOS Apps Abhinav LalEmail Abhinav You’ll most likely find Abhinav editing news stories, humouring his possibly unhealthy interest in playing Dota 2, and defending where his beliefs lie in the ...

YouTube hires industry veteran Lyor Cohen as global head of music September 28th 2016 at 10:31PM YouTube has appointed music industry veteran Lyor Cohen as its new global head of music. Cohen, who has previously served as CEO of Warner Music Group’s recorded music group and president of Def Jam, has been appointed primarily to help smooth relations between YouTube and record companies and artists. In recent months, several high profile artists and record labels have called into question YouTube’s practices, with many accusing the firm of not adequately compensating rights holders. The relationship between Cohen and Google is not recent. Back in 2013, when Cohen launched his music company 300 Entertainment, Google was an early investor, pumping some $5m into the venture. Robert Kyncl, Chief Business Officer at YouTube, commented: "Lyor is a lion of the music industry. From Rush to Def Jam to Island Def Jam to WMG then 300, he has consistently been a pioneer, charting the course for where music is heading. As we enter the growth era of the music industry, Lyor is in a position to make tremendous difference in accelerating that growth in a fair way for everyone. We are thrilled to welcome him to YouTube.” The arrival of Cohen at YT marks another instance where a top music industry executive joins a digital service in a senior position following the landing of former Lady GaGa maanger Troy Carter at Spotify and the arrival of former Universal Music executive Jimmy Iovine at Apple Music. “Lyor is a lion of the music industry,” Robert Kyncl, YouTube chief business officer, said in a statement. “From Rush to Def Jam to Island Def Jam to WMG then 300, he has consistently been a pioneer, charting the course for where music is heading. As we enter the growth era of the music industry, Lyor is in a position to make tremendous difference in accelerating that growth in a fair way for everyone. We are thrilled to welcome him to YouTube.” In a letter announcing his appointment, Cohen wrote: “It’s an incredible time to be in the music business. Back in 2006, as an executive at Warner Music Group, I worked closely with a fledgling video site to sign its first big record licensing deal. That site was YouTube. Over the next decade, I watched as your work transformed YouTube into an incredibly powerful platform that connects artists with fans all over the world. “Throughout my career in the music industry, I have strived to stay on the forefront of new technologies and cultural movements. And since starting in the industry over thirty years ago, I’ve always sought to be an advocate for artists and do everything possible to shine a light on the great talent I’ve been lucky enough to work with, including Jay Z, Run-DMC, DMX, Public Enemy, Kanye West, The Killers, Bruno Mars, Ed Sheeran, Young Thug, Fetty Wap, and Highly Suspect among others. Bringing attention to the often overlooked, but talented communities has been a huge part of my life’s work and I’ve seen how music can truly bring people together. "Over the last two decades we have seen dramatic shifts, both to the inherent value of music and the literal value that people are willing to pay. Technology and new business models have completely changed the established distribution channels that have long-served the recorded music industry. And while change has been met with understandable resistance, I strongly believe that this transformation provides opportunities that will be larger and more rewarding for both artists and the music industry. “That’s why I am excited to join this incredible team as Global Head of Music. I look forward to working together with all of you on three things. First, helping the music community embrace the technological shifts we’re seeing in music today so we can help take the confusion and distrust out of the equation. Second, building on the great work you all have done to help the music industry and creative community break new songs and artists to YouTube’s audience of over 1 billion fans. From building on the success of the YouTube Music app, to shining a light on emerging artists, I believe our potential to strengthen the industry is massive. And third, I hope that together we can move towards a more collaborative relationship between the music industry and the technologies that are shaping the future of the business. "I’m confident that we can bridge the worlds of technology and music in ways that benefit everyone, instead of the zero-sum mentality that exists today. I’m proud to be a music man, and hope that the perspective I bring from both the creative community and the music business at large will help us, our music partners and artists grow and thrive together.” In June this year, Coldplay, Sir Paul McCartney and Lady Gaga were among over 1,000 pop stars from across the globe to sign a letter of complaint over YouTube's practices, which was handed to EU president Jean-Claude Juncker. The letter said that the future of music is being “jeopardised by a substantial ‘value gap’ caused by user upload services such as Google’s YouTube that are unfairly siphoning value away from the music community and its artists and songwriters." It also called on Europe’s leaders to address the issue and create “a fair playing field for artists and rights owners. In doing so, you will be securing the future of music for generations to come.” FOLLOW Daniel Gumble   Tags : youtube, Digital, Warner Music Group, Lyor Cohen, Appointments, appointment, defjam Related Content Metallica drop entire new album on YouTube Sony Music Entertainment appoints Andre Stapleton SVP digital partner development Nadia Holmes named head of digital audio at Bauer Media 'Streaming services are like pyramid schemes' says John Lydon Careers & courses JOBS COURSES PROJECTS Electronic Music Production certificate Audio Production Music Business Creative Musicianship VIEW ALL COURSES Senior Label Manager UK Apply Now Brand Solutions Director - Music Festivals UK - London Apply Now MUSIC CURATOR Maidstone, Kent Apply Now VIEW ALL JOBS Looking for a singer/songwriter or spoken word vocal to feature on a deep house / bass-house style t Read More Looking for Suspenseful Long Build 5min Track for TV Series End Credits Read More $500-$1000 Percussive Fun Library Tracks Needed for Twitter Marketing Videos Read More Indie Rock/Alternative Needed For Prominent US TV Series Read More Looking For Lo-Fi Rock Music For High Profile US Drama Read More VIEW ALL PROJECTS VIDEOS Music Week Radar, 6th October 2016 Nova Twins – Hitlist.

In case you’re not familiar, the frog – known as Pepe the Frog – is a meme that is incredibly popular with the so-called ‘alt-right’, a group of far-right, tech-savvy, racist misogynists who tend to fester in online forums such as 4Chan’s /pol/. Despite being first created by cartoonist Matt Furie in 2005 under completely innocuous circumstances, Pepe’s image has been so deeply sullied that he has now been added to the Anti Defamation League’s Hate on Display watchlist – an online database of hate symbols. He’s now ubiquitous in alt-right circles (Picture: Facebook) ‘Images of the frog, variously portrayed with a Hitler-like moustache, wearing a yarmulke or a Klan hood, have proliferated in recent weeks in hateful messages aimed at Jewish and other users on Twitter,’ the ADL explained. Google Earth VR will let you explore the world from your living room The move comes just two weeks after Pepe was denounced by Hillary Clinton’s campaign as being a common factor between Donald Trump and white supremacist groups. ‘In recent months, Pepe’s been almost entirely co-opted by the white supremacists who call themselves the “alt-right”. They’ve decided to take back Pepe by adding swastikas and other symbols of anti-Semitism and white supremacy.’ They added that the frog had been altered to have some ‘Trump hair’, and referred to this rather disturbing (for many reasons) Instagram post by Trump’s son. A friend sent me this. Apparently I made the cut as one of the Deplorables😂😂😂 All kidding aside I am honored to be grouped with the hard working men and women of this great nation that have supported @realdonaldtrump and know that he can fix the mess created by politicians in Washington. He's fighting for you and won't ever quit. Thanks for your trust! #trump2016 #maga #makeamericagreatagain #basketofdeplorables A photo posted by Donald Trump Jr. (@donaldjtrumpjr) on Sep 10, 2016 at 7:18pm PDT Although having said that, it’s pretty common for Pepe to be edited to have Trump’s hairstyle. Case in point (Picture: Twitter) What is the alt-right? The alt-right is a far-right conservative movement, largely made up of young trolls fluent in digital culture, free-speech activists fighting against PC culture, misogynists, and just out-and-out white supremacists. Followers of the movement can be found lurking in forums – such as the 4chan board /pol/ (warning: explicit content and Pepe memes). They tend to be younger and more internet-savvy than the white supremacists found lurking on sites such as Daily Stormer. But Pepe’s face (and, disturbingly, other body parts) did not always have such sinister connotations. The cartoon frog was created in 2005 for Furie’s comic Boy’s Club. However, it only became famous a few years later when 4Chan noticed the character. For the next seven years or so he existed purely in internet meme form – slightly nerdy but relatively harmless. Coca-Cola's new 'selfie bottle' is actually a thing It was only relatively recently that the alt-right adopted Pepe as its unofficial icon. Furie has, unsurprisingly, since publicly distanced himself from the character and what it now stands for. This is the second time the ADL has had to add a new hate symbol to its database because of the alt-right. Back in June, (((echoes))) were added to the watchlist after online racists used it as a dog whistle to target Jewish people on social media.

Le and Mike Schuster, research scientists on the Google Brain Team. GNMT already is powering the Google Translate mobile and Web apps for 18 million or so Chinese to English translations daily. Google will roll out GNMT to the rest of the 10,000 language translation pairs its Google Translate service supports in the coming months. For English to French or German translations, GNMT achieves "competitive results" to the state of the art, Le and Schuster noted in a blog post. A human side-by-side evaluation on a set of isolated simple sentences found GNMT reduces translation errors by an average of 60 percent compared to Google's phrase-based translation system. Data from side-by-side evaluations, where human raters compare the quality of translations for a given source sentence. Scores range from 0 to 6, with 0 meaning "completely nonsense translation," and 6 meaning "perfect translation." GNMT "can still make significant errors that a human translator would never make, like dropping words and mistranslating proper names or rare terms, and translating sentences in isolation rather than considering the context of the paragraph or page," Le and Schuster acknowledged. GNMT's Inner Workings The GNMT model consists of a deep long short-term memory network with eight encoder and eight decoder layers using attention and residual connections. Its attention mechanism connects the bottom layer of the decoder to the top layer of the encoder to reduce training time and improve parallelism. Neural networks are inherent parallel algorithms, which can be leveraged by multicore CPUs, graphical processing units and computer clusters with multiple CPUs and GPUs During inference computations, GNMT uses low-precision arithmetic, which helps in the design of very power-efficient hardware for deep learning, to accelerate the final translation speed. It divides words into a limited set of common sub-word units Google calls "wordpieces" for both input and output. That provides a good balance between the flexibility of character-delimited models and the efficiency of word-delimited models. It also naturally handles rare word translation and improves the system's overall accuracy. The Mechanics of Translation When translating a sentence from Chinese to English, the GNMT considers an entire sentence as a single unit for translation, encoding the words in it as a list of vectors with contextual meaning. Each vector represents the meaning of all words read so far, instead of being considered on its own. The system then decodes the sentence, generating it in English, one word at a time in context. The decoder refers to a weighted distribution over the encoded Chinese vectors that are most relevant to generate the appropriate English word. An example of a translation produced by our system for an input sentence sampled from a news site. Go here for more examples of translations for input sentences sampled randomly from news sites and books. "This is more scale than just accuracy, but it's a very impressive showcase of applied artificial intelligence," said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. "While it's a pale shadow of what's coming, it's a huge step forward in this area," he TechNewsWorld. "The processing power to translate context between these vastly different languages at Internet scale has only existed for a very short time," Enderle noted. GNMT "not only showcases the impressive amount of performance now available, but also how quickly we're now able to apply it to both interesting and critical problems." Google researchers have not been the only ones tackling translation problems, noted Michael Jude, a program manager at Stratecast/Frost & Sullivan. GNMT "is an advance in natural language translation, but not a real breakthrough," he told TechNewsWorld. "IBM has been doing this for a while." On the Horizon The goal is perfect translation at scale, and "we should be closer to that goal in the 5-to-10-year time frame," Enderle said. Processing power is the main hitch, and "we'll likely need a 10x improvement to get this system where it needs to be." Human translators occasionally make mistakes, and emotional freighting and sometimes nonverbal contexts may impact translation, he noted. That said, "a system that looks deeply at context should be able to exceed the performance of two people talking natively, because it'll always consider context while we often don't hear it," Enderle suggested. "To get there, however, there will likely need to be a visual element, so that nonverbal communications are captured as well." Richard Adhikari has written about high-tech for leading industry publications since the 1990s and wonders where it's all leading to. Will implanted RFID chips in humans be the Mark of the Beast?

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Assistant to soon have Hindi language support By Ida Torres - September 28, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Google really has a soft spot for India, don’t they? Well aside from being the second most populous country in the world, Hindi is of course the fourth most-spoken language in the globe. And of course, a lot of the people there are digital-savvy and apparently always on the lookout for something new. So Google’s announcement that they will soon be adding Hindi language support to Google Assistant, their newly-launched voice-controlled AI tool, comes as no surprise. Google Assistant was actually introduced to the general public just last week as it was integrated into Google’s new messaging app, Allo. And since the video-calling app Duo has seen an “amazing uptake” in India since it was released, then they expect that Allo will do the same. One of the selling points of the messaging app is that it has a built-in voice assistant and so having Hindi support will surely boost interest in Allo. Google Assistant leans heavily on artificial intelligence and machine learning so adding another language to support it is pretty significant for the tech giant and a great thing for users that speak Hindi. The demo that they showed off in an event in Delhi was a seamless switching between English and Hindi while using Google Assistant in Allo. So if they’re actually able to officially do it on the app, then it would probably be a big hit in India, just like Duo. The preview of the app with the Hindi option will be launched by the end of the year. This is just one of the many India-fcoused initiatives that Google has launched over the past few days, including YouTube Go, Google Station with its public Wi-Fi, and a data-saving version of Chrome as well.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Caitlin Dewey September 27 Follow @caitlindewey Google is an imperfect oracle of popular will, but here’s one trend that seems pretty clear: Searches for the phrase “registrarse para votar” — “register to vote,” in Spanish — hit an all-time high during Monday’s presidential debate, spiking to more than 100,000 searches. (Google) The term was Google’s third trending search in the United States at 10:30 p.m. Monday, preceded only by two phrases related to the Houston shooting. According to Google, search volume was highest in the ever-important swing state of Florida, followed by New Jersey, New York, Texas and California. A quick note on this data, and what Google means by “trending”: The designation doesn’t refer to the most popular searches, but the ones that — relative to all other searches — are spiking. In other words, the blue trend line above doesn’t show you how many Spanish-speaking people are Googling how to vote. It shows you what normalized share they represent, in the grand scheme of all U.S. Google searches. Spanish-language searches for voting information have only neared this interest share on one prior occasion: That was after the first presidential debate in 2012. In the current election cycle, the last comparable spike occurred on Aug. 31, the day Donald Trump made his much-anticipated Phoenix immigration speech, though search volume also increased after both parties’ conventions. Incidentally, Google just introduced a major expansion to its in-search voting guides, the automated Knowledge Box that provides searchers personalized information on how and when to register in their states. (To be fair, this probably compounded the apparent spike from the debates.) While the box was previously only triggered by English-language searches, queries like “registrarse para votar” or “como votar” now also pull up the guides to registering. Hispanic voters are far more likely to vote for Hillary Clinton than for Trump, statistically speaking. Liked that?

Celtic were outstanding - in fact, they showed outstanding character - and the only disappointment for them is that they allowed Manchester City to peg them back on three separate occasions. They just didn’t hold on to any of their leads for long enough. But a point against Pep Guardiola’s City is not to be sniffed at and, with Borussia Monchengladbach losing 2-1 to Barcelona, it’s enough to take Celtic third. They’ve only gone and ended City’s winning streak as well, showing the way forward for other sides with their pressing game. City are second, while Barcelona are top. Thanks for reading. Night.

This includes creating self-driving vehicles that are able to make ethical choices and how artificial intelligence is used to treat diseases. "The positive impact on AI will depend not only on the quality of our algorithms but the level of public engagement, transparency, and ethical discussion that takes place around it," Mustafa Suleyman, the co-founder of DeepMind said on a call with reporters. In this respect, the Partnership will publish its research using open-source licences as well as looking to publish minutes from its meetings. Suleyman added: "One of the roles we might play is propagating best practice, displaying some benchmarks, make available some datasets."

"If it had been announced five years ago people wouldn't have taken it seriously because they might have said it was premature." As AI has moved from academic research labs to real-world implementation it has caused problems – none of which have easy answers. Google's photo scanning algorithm mistakenly called black people gorillas, an algorithm used to predict crimes has been identified to prejudice against racial groups, and code in apps dictates the work schedules of those in the on-demand economy. The concerns are legitimate and that is before the well-trodden fears of AI world domination. Stephen Hawking, Elon Musk and Steve Wozniak have previously joined 1,000 academics in calling for AI to be carefully controlled by its creators.

"There's no explicit attempt at the notion self-regulation to repel government intrusion," said Eric Horvitz, a managing director at Microsoft's research division. "Questions come up about the transparency of our systems and their ability to explain themselves, the ethics that are encoded in the AI systems the potential for the embedding of hidden biases," he added. Ó hÉigeartaigh, who isn't involved with the partnership, said the Partnership on AI helps to bring legitimacy to areas of AI research. "The issues around data privacy, automation in employment, algorithmic fairness, are not only being raised by academics in ivory towers but the people who are the forefront of the research and understand where it is going to go in five, ten or 15 years." As such, the group won't be closed off to new members. Those involved with the new non-profit organisation will include academics, policy makers, other non-profits and ethical specialists.

The former, which has included machine learning in its latest iPhone and iPad operating system and is said to be developing a home automation assistant, traditionally has kept its technological ecosystems locked down. Access to Siri was only granted to developers in recent months. Apple has been in discussions with the group but has not joined at present – the members say they hope it will in the future. Whereas Open AI – a pre-existing AI research non-profit, backed with $1 billion in investment from Elon Musk and others – already promotes the publication of open AI research and methods. "They are research labs like many of our research labs here," Yaan Lecun, director of AI research, at Facebook said. "There is no fundamental difference in that respect." He added that many researchers already publish their work in an open and reusable way. "In that sense it is not very different from Open AI." Read more Finish him!

The AI partnership's 8 goals 1. Ensure AI technologies benefit and empower as many people as possible. 2. Educate and listen to the public and actively engage stakeholders to seek their feedback on our focus, inform them of our work, and address their questions. 3. Commit to open research and dialog on the ethical, social, economic, and legal implications of AI. 4. AI research and development efforts need to be actively engaged with and accountable to a broad range of stakeholders. ADVERTISEMENT 5. Engage with and have representation from stakeholders in the business community to help ensure that domain-specific concerns and opportunities are understood and addressed. 6. Work to maximize the benefits and address the potential challenges of AI technologies, by: protecting privacy;remain socially responsible; ensure research is robust, reliable and trustworthy; opposing development of AI that would violate international human rights. 7. Believe that it is important for the operation of AI systems to be understandable and interpretable by people, for purposes of explaining the technology. 8. Strive to create a culture of cooperation, trust, and openness among AI scientists and engineers to help us all better achieve these goals.

SHARES As a former career coach at Google and co-founder of the company's career mentorship program, Jenny Blake knows what makes for a successful career. Blake individually mentored over a thousand people at Google and now runs her own business and career strategy firm. She's learned that constant people-pleasing can be detrimental to your career. "People-pleasing and doing what friends or family or society would deem successful often keeps people stuck in place," she told CNBC. In her new book "Pivot," Blake explains why you shouldn't always follow the instinct to make others happy. 1. It's tiring "People-pleasing is exhausting," Blake writes. "It is inauthentic. It means placing everyone else's needs above your own." 2. It's not realistic "You cannot make everyone happy all the time, and it is futile to try," she says. "You are no good to anyone if you run yourself ragged trying to please everyone." 3. It detracts from your own goals "You have a choice: You can spend your time ceaselessly worrying about other people or you can bravely follow your own path," Blake writes. 4. It could hurt your career "The universe rewards backbone," she writes. "Not speaking up or acting authentically may lead to a bigger explosion down the road, when you least want or expect it." Of course, Blake notes that it is important not to burn bridges in your career. Instead, she recommends people always be friendly and a team player, but reiterates that obsessing over other's thoughts and emotions is not helpful. "You can either go emotionally broke running around trying to please everyone, or you can spend your time creating, being authentic to your own needs and desires, and then serving others from that full place," she says.

Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Andrea Peterson September 28 Follow @kansasalps (Pawel Kopczynski/Files) Just months after Google banned payday loan advertisements, regulators have cracked down on a similar type of company backed by the venture capital arm of Google's parent company, Alphabet. The company, California-based LendUp, bills itself as an alternative to traditional payday lenders that can help risky borrowers build up their credit with short-term loans and get access to more favorable lending terms over time. But federal and state regulators say that LendUp didn’t live up to its promises, and now the company has agreed to pay a total of $6.3 million in penalties. LendUp misled consumers by advertising certain loan products nationwide that weren't available at locations outside of California and hid the true cost of the loans -- which can come with annual interest rates in the triple digits -- the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau said in a news release.  The company also failed to give information about borrowers' loans to credit reporting companies from when it started offering loans in 2012 until “at least February 2014," the CFPB said. That meant that consumers’ credit ratings didn't actually get the boost the company said it could offer, according to the agency. Under a consent order with the CFPB, more than 50,000 consumers will receive a total of about $1.8 million in refunds from LendUp, and the company will pay a $1.8 million civil penalty. LendUp also agreed to pay the California Department of Business Oversight $2.7 million in a separate settlement over allegations it broke banking laws. LendUp did not admit wrongdoing in either agreement. In a statement posted to its website Tuesday, LendUp said the regulators' actions "address legacy issues that mostly date back to" the company’s start-up phase. "In those days we didn't have a fully built out compliance department," the statement said. "We should have." The company said it now has a 10-person compliance team and a six-person in-house legal team. Google Ventures, or GV, the investing arm of Alphabet, started investing in LendUp before it even launched, according to the Wall Street Journal. Google and GV declined to comment for this report. That relationship was put under a spotlight earlier this year when Google announced it would no longer accept advertisements for payday lenders. LendUp’s loan products fell under Google’s definition of payday loans, LendUp chief executive Sasha Orloff said shortly after the decision to ban the ads were announced in May. Google declined to specifically comment to The Washington Post on LendUp’s ability to advertise on Google under its new rules at the time. business technology the-switch true Please provide a valid email address.

RSS ALL ARTICLES FEATURES ONLY   TRIVIA Search How-To Geek How to Set Your Google Account to Automatically Delete (or Share) Upon Your Death Want to share your family photos after your death, but take your search history to the grave? All that and more is possible with Google’s Inactive Account Manager. Let’s take a look at how you can put your Google account on autopilot when you’re no longer at the wheel. How You Can Control Your Information After Death It’s not nice to think about, but one day, you will die, along with the keys to your online kingdom. And these days, those online accounts can hold a lot of stuff you may want to pass on. Your Google account has a feature tucked deep in the bowels of your account settings called “Inactive Account Manager”. Although the feature is several years old now, it’s practically unknown among Google users–in a casual survey of people outside our office who had Google accounts, not one of them was aware of the feature. Inactive Account Manager is what fans of old spy movies and psychological thrillers will immediately recognize as a “dead man’s switch”. Once activated if you do not interact with your Google account in X amount of time, then Google’s servers will automatically either notify your trusted contacts and/or share specified data with those select contacts. Or, at your instruction, it can wipe your account. In this way, you can ensure that things like family photos stored in Google Photos are available to your family, that your spouse can will have full access to your contacts to manage your business affairs, or that anyone you wish to share your account with upon your demise or incapacitation can access it legitimately and without resorting to masquerading themselves as you. Setting Up the Inactive Account Manager To set up Inactive Account Manager, make sure you’re logged into your Google account and visit this page. On the information splash page, click the “Setup” button. The setup all occurs on a single page, but we’ll break each section down. First, the “Alert me” section. You will be notified 1 month before the actions you have selected take effect. Your mobile number is required and you cannot enable the Inactive Account Manager without it–you will need to verify you control this number by supplying the verification code sent to your phone. Further, you should add a secondary email address that you regularly use if the only listed email address is your Gmail account (if you’re not using your Google account regularly you obviously won’t get the notice via Gmail). Next, we’ll set the timeout period. You can set the timeout period in quarter year increments ranging from 3 months at the minimum to 18 months at the maximum. Regardless of the length of the timeout period, you will always be notified 1 month before the timeout period ends. In the next step, “Notify contacts and share data”, there are two settings to attend to: adding trusted contacts and setting an auto-response in Gmail. First, let’s look at adding a trusted contact. You can set up to 10 trusted contacts and set variable degrees of access for each one. Click on “Add trusted contact” to continue. Then their email address. Check “Share my data with this contact” if you wish to do so. Click “Next”. In the next step you need to supply a contact phone number for the person (don’t worry, they won’t get an immediate text indicating that you’ve selected them, so there won’t be any awkward conversations about death triggered by this process). Then you need to specify what Google data you want to share with them. We’d encourage you to apply this step selectively, and not simply check “Select all”. Most of us would happily share our Google Photo collections with our next of kin, after all, but would prefer to take our search histories private. Once you’ve made your choices, click “Next”. In this final contact setup step, you get the sobering task of sending a message to your trusted contact. This is not an optional step, and you must input even a minimal message with at least a subject line. When you’ve finished with your message, click “Save” and then repeat the process for any additional contacts you wish to share your personal data with. If you wish, you may also set up an automated message that will go out to anyone who contacts your Gmail address, regardless of whether or not they are on your trusted contact list. Let’s say, for example, that you ran a small hobby business where people contacted you through Gmail to place orders. You could set up the auto-responder to indicate that the business had closed and that, sadly, they would need to look elsewhere for their lovingly mixed period authentic miniature paints. Or maybe you just want one last opportunity to Rickroll people–we don’t judge. The final step is the weightiest one: selecting whether or not your Google account will be wiped upon the completion of the timeout period. There is no option to partially delete the data, so make this very binary decision with care. You cannot, for example, wipe your search history and email but leave your YouTube content and Blogger posts intact for posterity. Once the countdown is complete, like a real dead man’s switch, the account data is gone forever. Once you’ve made all your selection, written notes to your trusted contacts, set up your auto-responder, and so forth, you must press the “Enable” button at the bottom to complete the process. Confirm that the process is enabled, your screen should look like this: You can uncheck the email reminder box, but we left it active. Not only is it a good reminder that the service is active (so you can return to edit the settings or disable it if need be) but if the specter of Death resting his hand on your shoulder now and then isn’t motivating, what is? It’s not the most pleasant thing to contemplate, but a little planning ensures that your Google account and all the data therein is safe even if you aren’t.

And that’s when you realise – if you have need for it, this Watch might be entirely different. Swimming For people who swim (obviously), this was the most clearly lacking thing in the first watch. It claimed to be a fitness tracker, but it excluded one of the most popular fitness activities in the world. That’s all fixed now – a combination of swimproofing that means the water won’t kill the phone, and new software that can accurately track how you’re doing, makes it into a great all-round fitness tracker. (There are still some things lacking, like tracking for weights, but it’s possible to put those in the “Other” category.) The software works by watching for when the Watches sensors feel that it’s been moved enough for one stroke. And other sensors watch for when a swimmer has turned around in the pool, meaning that it can know both how frantically a person is swimming and how far they’re actually getting. Georgie Bloy, swim manager at Virgin Active Broadgate, said that having that sort of information can prove especially useful to beginners. Read more Apple Watch Series 2 review: The same, but entirely different “Some of my clients when they first start may only be able to swim 4-6 lengths in one go,” she said. “Fitness trackers are great for keeping tabs on progress and helping you reach your goals. For those who are also looking to monitor calories, they also can help you monitor how many you burn during swimming.” Unfortunately, some of the more granular and useful information is lacking. As Ms Bloy indicates, it’s very useful to know how much you’re advancing, for instance – but the Apple Watch’s Activity app doesn’t give much information about how you’re coming along and what you could do better. For example, professional swimmers might want to track their time per 100 meters and see how quickly they can swim it, Ms Bloy said. “If your fitness tracker allows you track your time in 100m period, it can help you monitor progress – particularly useful for people who are training for swimming competitions or triathlons.” The Watch does track speed over distance. But it doesn’t present that information especially helpfully – and does nothing with it. It would be incredibly helpful, for instance, to know whether you’re better at swimming in the morning or at night; or if going for a swim before you go to bed helps you sleep better. Apple has all of that information – it can now even track sleep by watching how you use your phone – but it still doesn’t feel like it’s making the most out of it. GPSing The other big feature is the addition of GPS. That’s even less obviously there than swimming – but it’s perhaps even more important. The key fact is that the Watch will now be able to tell where it is, even when it doesn’t have the phone. That makes it into a genuine running companion on its own – something it was regularly advertised as, but which was undermined a little by the fact that it needed the phone to properly track your activity. Now it will know where you are. And despite Apple’s somewhat limited use of data, it does that information in a very useful way – decorating the Activity app with a map that shows everywhere you’ve run and how quickly you’ve done it. And the big worry in advance of the event – that battery life would die with GPS – doesn’t seem to have happened. The GPS only switches on when the Watch is away from the phone, and the battery is much improved so that (Apple claims) it can make it through an entire marathon. And it even works with swimming, grabbing its location from the sky when it’s above the water. At Apple’s event, it showed off that feature with a new app called ViewRanger. That isn’t actually about running, or about fitness in the strict sense that it tends to appear in Apple’s marketing documents – instead, it’s about walking (or running) into nature. Craig Wareham, founder and CEO of ViewRanger, said that the new features in the watch together made it into exactly the kind of thing that it’s easy to imagine taking out into the wilderness. “Individually they’re all interesting,” he said. “But when you put them together on the same device, it really moves the Apple watch into something I’m very happy and secure taking out to the most rugged of environments.” A sneak-peek at the new Apple Watch As such, the Watch can easily take on the more devoted outdoor watches – which tend to be big, expensive and not especially nice to look at, Mr Wareham said. ViewRanger shows too that GPS tools aren’t just about running around and tracking that information. The company lets its users download information about particular areas - meaning that they can go out on a walk without their phone, and don’t have to worry about losing contact with it. Because the Watch now has GPS, it can use that local information to find its own way around. It all adds up to a Watch that might still have its own problems, but finally becomes something that you can rely on for everything. On the face of it, adding relatively small features like swimming and location might seem small – but they finally push the Watch from being something specialised to something that can happily sit on your wrist all the time.

Both Phandroid and Stephen Hall of 9to5Google have shared a message sent to some of their readers via Twitter direct message that states: “We love that you love Google, and on October 4th we’re going to introduce something new for you to love (youtu.be/aNnCtmyujLA) at a private event in San Francisco. We’d be honored to have you as our guest. If you’re interested in joining us, please respond to this note and confirm your email address.

Invitations appear to be limited to U.S. residents. However, we’ve reached out to Google to find if it has invited any Canadian Android fanatics. Whatever the case, the fact that Google is opening up the event to fans suggests the company has something special planned for the 4th. Related: It’s now possible to go ‘incognito’ in Google’s iOS app SourcePhandroid, Twitter Arman That’s nice actually. fred I just hope the pixel phone is going to be affordable. neo905 Define “affordable”. It’s going to start at $900 which is inline with other flagships. Book it. fred $350 like the Nexus 5 would have been nice. I know the CAD is not as strong, but still under $500 would have been possible. At $900, it better be perfect. neo905 The Nexus 5 was an exception to the norm though. Every other Nexus phone was more expensive. Even the first two. Only the Nexus 4 and 5 were relatively cheap. fred well the Nexus 5x wasn’t that expensive neo905 It wasn’t meant to compete with other flagships either. It was just a cheaper alternative to the 6P was inferior specs. Other Nexus’ always tried to put the best specs for a reasonable price. Mamba Affordability is different in everyone’s eyes. Apple devices are affordable. Expensive, but affordable. thereasoner Google is reportedly going to offer payment plans to offset the sticker shock of the new premium segment pricing expected for the Pixel phones. I’m getting one regardless of whether that is offered in Canada or not…so long as they don’t gimp the 5″ version again. King Cyrus I thought the payment plan option was not available in Canada? thereasoner I haven’t heard yet one way or another. I was thinking that it might be available to anyone who buys it from the Play Store. fred paying a phone on 24 months doesn’t make it any more affordable If you can’t afford a phone outright, you can’t afford it, period. thereasoner Some don’t want to pay full freight up front though, even if they can afford it. After all, why give them all the money right away if you don’t have to? fred You are paying for it one way or another. It’s like 0% interest deals on cars. They jack up car prices. thereasoner Personally it won’t matter for me but if I have the option to give them the money slowly then it would be foolish not to take it imo. That and it’s a good for people who can afford the monthly payment but otherwise would shy away from large up front costs, especially with the holidays not far off. fred If you shy away from a $900 phone because of the upfront cost, you shouldn’t be getting a $900 phone. If you can afford a $900 phone upfront and they offer you to finance it at 0% over two years, then of course go ahead and make some money by investing that $900. Rev0lver Funny they didn’t use Google +. I guess they wanted people to actually get the invite… Ryan I’m sure some MS commenter will come on here saying how his G+ circles are active and lively, and he wished that all the “haters” would stop bashing his favourite social network. But in reality I’m waiting for Google to just kill G+. It failed, try something else. thereasoner Something else? Like there’s something else that will supplant Facebook….ever? Leaving G+ be in the very unlikely event that people actually get tired of Facebook someday is the best Google, or anyone else, can hope for. Stephen B Morris “Something else? Like there’s something else that will supplant Facebook….ever?” I’m sure MySpace users said the exact same thing. thereasoner Lmao! MySpace is a pimple on the butt of a mosquito in comparison to the behemoth that is Facebook! It peaked in 2008 with barely 75 million visits per month compared to Facebooks 1.71 billion visits. Not to mention the Facebook messenger that over a billion people use every day! If you think that Facebook can be brought down as easily as MySpace then you just don’t understand how deeply ingrained in peoples lives Facebook is compared to what MySpace was.

By Conner Forrest | September 28, 2016, 12:52 PM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/jastrijebphoto The biggest value proposition of Google's Android—its openness—requires a distinct approach to security. On Wednesday, at the 2016 Structure Security conference in San Francisco, Google's Adrian Ludwig took the stage to explain how the Android team balances openness and security. Ludwig, who is the director of security for Android, opened by explaining that the approach Google has been taking to keep Android as open as possible is also a strategic decision from a security standpoint. "We believe that being as open as possible will ultimately lead to better security," Ludwig. SEE: Interview questions: Android developer (Tech Pro Research) Android is often criticized for not properly vetting the apps that end up on its app store. Ludwig said that there are measures and safeguards in place for the Google Play Store that he believes are likely similar to those implemented by Apple in its App Store. However, he said, Google believes that allowing for any expression on mobile is important. That has led them to allow for third-party app stores, which is where many of the major malware scares for Android have originated. Still, does that mean that Google isn't responsible for protecting those stores as well?

According to Ludwig, over a billion devices have an endpoint security system on them that allows Google to better monitor the devices and safeguard against bad apps or malware. In terms of spyware incidents, Ludwig said those are very rare. Ludwig said he is most worried about developers who are trying to establish push messaging to promote applications, as a type of commercial fraud. Another major worry for Ludwig is the supply chain. Smartphones have a complicated supply chain, and he wants to make sure he has true visibility into that chain and what happens to the devices along the way, especially at the chip level. Being open source means a certain level of transparency is coming from Android. But, as Ludwig mentioned: "Transparency doesn't solve the problem." Platform providers need to provide transparency, Ludwig said, but they also need to be responsible for what happens "because of that transparency." So, he said, they need to make everything visible, but they need to shepherd that transparency in the right direction. One of the biggest challenges in the Android ecosystem is the issue of device updates. This is an issue for IoT devices as well as Android smartphones, Ludwig said, and Google is trying to solve it from a technical standpoint, but also from a business standpoint. The core problem, he noted, is that building a software supply chain that encourages updates is difficult for manufacturers and often costly. On the Android level, Ludwig said they are continually working on a smoother update cycle. Google has also been working on building features like verified boot on Chrome OS, and now on Android, that will help return the device to a secure state after it's been compromised. In the past, security has been tactically focused. Now, in a strategic shift in mobile and cloud, Ludwig said that manufacturers and companies are starting to realize that they can no longer rely on users or entities to protect themselves. That's a major shift that he believes will define the next 10-15 years of security. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Android's balance between openness and security is the biggest challenge facing the Android ecosystem. Updates continue to be problematic for Android, but Google's Adrian Ludwig explained that it is based on the fact that building a software supply chain that encourages updates is expensive and difficult. Companies realize they can't rely on users and entities to protect themselves, so they must take a stronger role in guaranteeing security.

In a post on the Google product forums, the Android Wear team said it has reported a “serious pairing issue” when it comes to some Android Wear watches. The affected watches include the Tag Heuer Connected, Moto 360 v2, Asus ZenWatch, the Michael Kors Access watch and those made by Fossil. The issue is affecting only those users attempting to pair with an iPhone 7, with all previous iPhone versions unaffected. Related: Apple Watch Series 2: What you need to know “Google has reported the issue to Apple, and the Android Wear team is actively working to fix this as soon as possible,” wrote Ernest of the Android Wear team. With the Apple Watch Series 2 now on the shelves, we can’t imagine Apple frantically racing to clear up this issue – but we’ll keep you posted. Android Wear compatibility with iOS was announced at the end of August 2015, and supports devices running iOS 8.2 and up. Features are limited compared to what you can do with an Android smartphone pairing, as you’d expect. Are you batting for both teams with an Android Wear watch on your wrist and an iPhone in your pocket? Share your experiences below.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Huawei makes one of the best Android Wear devices around, but the company could be setting a new course for future smartwatches. A report out of Korea claims the Chinese giant will ditch Google’s operating system and team up with Samsung to use Tizen OS instead. An anonymous Samsung employee told Korean newspaper JoongAng Ilbo that the two companies recently agreed to work together. The source notes that Huawei started looking for a new partner because Google “had not been very collaborative.” Samsung denied the rumors in an official statement to The Korea Herald. It’s unclear exactly how Tizen OS would run on a Huawei smartwatch. However, the Chinese firm likely wouldn’t have to copy Samsung’s exact UI, which features a rotating bezel. The Korean company is allegedly going all out to customize its software for Huawei’s new wearable device. If this rumor is true it could be a huge win for Samsung, which has long promoted Tizen as an alternative to Android even as it continues to run Google’s mobile OS on the majority of its smartphones. Tizen is best known for powering the Gear S smartwatch series, along with a few entry-level Galaxy Z smartphones and some smart home appliances. Huawei is expected to announce its latest flagship phone, the Mate 9, later this fall, providing a clear opportunity to unveil a new smartwatch as well. But until then we’d take these rumors with a grain of salt.

Neural Networks Give Google Translate a Boost Say What? Neural Networks Give Google Translate a Boost By Stephanie Mlot September 28, 2016 01:01pm EST 10 Comments Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT) is currently at work on Chinese-to-English translations. Google Translate often serves up some laughable results, but that could become a thing of the past with Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT), which is currently at work on Chinese-to-English translations. "Rapid advances in machine intelligence have improved our speech recognition and image recognition capabilities, but improving machine translation remains a challenging goal," Quoc V. Le and Mike Schuster, Google Brain Team research scientists, wrote in a blog post. GNMT "utilizes state-of-the-art training techniques to achieve the largest improvements to date for machine translation quality." When Google Translate launched a decade ago, it relied on Phrase-Based Machine Translation. The algorithm simply looked up individual words, replaced them with the equivalent word in another language, and pieced them together for what were often incoherent sentences. Neural Machine Translation, however, considers the entire input sentence as a unit—like you would comprehend a whole image rather than its individual pixels—taking into account the nuances of speech and meaning. //Related Articles Google Now on Tap Brings Language Translation Into Apps "The advantage of this approach is that it requires fewer engineering design choices than previous Phrase-Based translation systems," Le and Schuster wrote. Google highlighted a Chinese-to-English translation produced by GNMT (above), which is just one of the more than 10,000 language pairs supported by Google Translate. "We will be working to roll out GNMT to many more of these over the coming months," Google said. "Machine translation is by no means solved," the company concluded. GNMT can still make "significant errors" a human translator would never make, like dropping words, or mistranslating proper names and rare terms. "However, GNMT represents a significant milestone."

Rumours suggest a new VR headset and upgraded 4K Chromecast are in the offing as well as a device for your smart home which will be something like the Amazon Echo. Frankly it's kind of nuts they don't have one of those out already. But the one they're teasing most is definitely their latest smartphone upgrade. We're hearing that the 'Nexus' name is being dropped in favour of calling it the Google Pixel, which brings it into line with their premium laptop range. Now, the Venture Beat folks have a very high quality look at a render of the new phone. It looks like a smartphone, and a fairly basic design at that. The word is there'll be a headphone jack (!) at the top and a USB-C port on the bottom, while Google and manufacturers HTC have opted to place their fingerprint scanner on the rear. We're not mad about that positioning as it's impossible to unlock with a single touch while lying on a flat surface. Leaked specs suggest a 5 inch screen, 4 gigs of RAM and a 12 MP rear camera. So far it doesn't sound like there's anything here to set it apart from the crowd, which makes it all the more alarming when we hear that this will be Google's most expensive phone when it launches.

Google is expanding its online shopping and delivery platform into much of the East Coast. Sarah GantzContact ReporterThe Baltimore Sun Google's answer to Amazon Prime launches in Maryland. Aiming to muscle into e-commerce giant Amazon's turf, Google is expanding its online shopping and delivery platform into Maryland and much of the East Coast. The expansion is part of a push to make Google Express available nationwide by the end of the year. The service, which launched in select cities in 2013, expanded to 16 states earlier this year and on Wednesday added 13 more. "Our mission, broadly, is to connect customers with merchants they love and vice versa," said Brian Elliott, general manager of Google Express. The move comes as Amazon Prime, with its members-only benefits and same-day delivery, gains popularity and draws away shoppers — and advertisers — from Google, analysts said. "They're trying to protect their ad base, of course, because they're getting crushed by Amazon," said Howard Davidowitz, a retail analyst and founder of Davidowitz & Associates Inc. in New York City. Booze-delivery service to launch in Baltimore Drizly, an online and mobile service that lets users order alcohol for delivery, will launch in Baltimore on Thursday. (Baltimore Sun) Drizly, an online and mobile service that lets users order alcohol for delivery, will launch in Baltimore on Thursday. (Baltimore Sun) See more videos Google's search engine used to be the first stop for people surfing the web for a good deal. But as Amazon Prime solidifies the online retailer's reputation for can't-beat offers, more shoppers are turning directly to Amazon to search for products, he said. With Google Express, Google aims to win back shoppers, though the task won't be easy. "At the end of the day Amazon has many more products to choose from, a much broader selection and they give more perks," Davidowitz said. "I'm not saying people won't use it — of course they will — but I don't think this is going to be a threat to Amazon at all." Amazon adds new level of competition in Baltimore restaurant delivery Sarah Meehan Amazon, the online behemoth that has toppled bookstores and threatened big-box retailers, is trying out its next play — food delivery — on the streets of Baltimore.

Amazon, the online behemoth that has toppled bookstores and threatened big-box retailers, is trying out its next play — food delivery — on the streets of Baltimore. The company announced Thursday that it would begin offering delivery for 59 local restaurants, making Baltimore the fourth market in... (Sarah Meehan) Google Express works with a limited number of retailers — 14 in Maryland and the other states where service expanded Wednesday. Those retailers include Costco, Kohl's, PetSmart and Whole Foods Market. The company plans to add more retailers in the coming months, Elliott said. Similarly to Amazon Prime, Google Express is accessed through a membership — either $10 a month or $95 a year. Members pay nothing more for delivery on orders of at least $15, while smaller orders incur an extra charge. Non-members can shop through a "pay-as-you-go" option that starts at $4.99 per order. The service will be available statewide. Google Express contracts with delivery companies to pick up items from the retailer and deliver them to customers within two days. Same-day service and overnight delivery are possible depending on a retailer's proximity to the delivery address. During the checkout process, shoppers will see which delivery options are available for their specific order and choose. While AmazonFresh will deliver fresh food to your doorstep in some cities, including Baltimore, Google Express is sticking with non-perishable food items. Elliott said Google Express isn't trying to be Amazon. Rather, its approach is to connect shoppers with brands instead of specific products. "We don't think of it as being in competition with anybody," Elliott said. "We think of it as how do we do what we're good at." The service's strength is its technology platform, which is intended to appeal to both shoppers and retailers, Elliott said. Google Express deliberately partnered with retailers with loyal customers. Some, such as Costco, have their own membership programs. The service could be an asset to these companies, by helping them attract new customers and increase sales among existing ones, Elliott said. Google Express may never eclipse Amazon as the go-to place for online shopping, but likely will be popular among retailers regardless, said Dan Kogan, CEO of 1Digital Agency, a Philadelphia consultant for online retailers. "A lot of people don't want to put all their eggs in one basket and are looking for other ways to sell," Kogan said. Merchants pay Amazon hefty referral fees on every product sold through the website — between 6 percent and 20 percent of the sale price for most items, according to Amazon's website. What's more, when a particular product starts selling well, Amazon often starts competing with retailers, selling the product itself, Kogan said. Google Express could help retailers diversify their online sales portfolio and reduce their reliance on Amazon, he said. sarah.gantz@baltsun.com twitter.com/sarahgantz Copyright © 2016, Capital Gazette, a Baltimore Sun Media Group publication | Privacy Policy UberEATS food delivery app launches in Baltimore Roughly Speaking podcast: Game of Drones (episode 98) Read our most popular stories Election 2016 ENewspaper Ad Circulars Calendar Obituaries Classified Real Estate Jobs 55°

Follow TechnoBuffalo Google is reportedly getting serious about introducing a smartphone(s), and Oct. 4 will be the day we get our first official look. These won’t be the Nexus devices fans have grown to love. Rather, numerous reports suggest Google is planning to ditch the Nexus name and instead place these under the Pixel brand. Get used to it. Thanks to numerous rumors and leaks, we have a pretty good idea of what to expect before Google even takes the stage. Let’s recap what the company (probably) has up its sleeve. Sayonara, Nexus Say your good-byes now, because Google’s future handsets won’t be referred to as “Nexus devices.” Instead, it’ll be Pixel from now on. Loyal Google followers followers shouldn’t be too surprised by this. The company already offers a few different devices under the Pixel moniker and with two new smartphones joining the family, Google will have an entire lineup aimed at consumers, from computers, to tablets, to mobile phones. The Nexus name has been around for years but leaving it behind makes sense. By starting fresh, Google is making a statement: The Nexus name has always been associated with the “geek” and developer community. Moving to the Pixel brand is far more consumer-facing. Couple this with the aggressive marketing of its Oct. 4 event and it becomes clear Google wants people to know something big is on the way. Price Dropping a name is one thing. Dropping the wallet-friendly prices associated with the Nexus brand is another. Apparently, Google’s most inexpensive Pixel device is going to start at $649, which is far more expensive than the most recent Nexus devices released in 2015. For comparison, the Nexus 5X launched with a starting price of just $379. Google is reportedly counting on consumers to purchase its new devices on a payment plan, which is a model that’s been widely adopted throughout the mobile industry. Rather than pay an upfront lump sum, customers can pay their new phone off over a set amount of time, typically 24 months. $649 is a flagship price, so it would seem Google is confident the price won’t scare people away. Still, sitting in the same price bracket as the iPhone and Galaxy S7 will be a tough sell, and ultimately seems like a missed opportunity to undercut two of the market’s most popular devices. Specs The top Nexus devices have always been among the most powerful, and this year shouldn’t be any different. Similar to last year, there will reportedly be two handsets, one with a 5-inch Full HD display and another with a 5.5-inch QHD display. Beyond that, we’re expecting them to be pretty similar in terms of design and specs. If true, fans can expect 4GB of RAM, 32GB of storage (base), a 12-megapixel rear-facing camera, an 8-megapixel front-facing camera, fingerprint sensor, USB-C, and either a Snapdragon 820 chip or a Snapdragon 821 chip. Either way, these devices will be powerful enough to take on today’s most popular Android flagships. One area of concern, however, is just how durable these phones will be. A recent report claimed the handsets would sport rating of IP56, which is essentially the least amount of protection against dust and water. Most people probably don’t consider water and dust resistance to be a selling point, but some of today’s top devices, such as the new iPhone 7, feature an IP67 rating or higher. All that is to say, don’t expect to submerge Google’s new devices in water and expect them to survive. Design We’ve seen Google’s Pixel devices pop up on a few different occasions over the past few months, so there shouldn’t be too many surprises come Oct. 4. If you’re thinking the handsets look familiar, that’s because HTC allegedly helped Google with production this year. Based on the leaks we’ve seen, the device will feature an aluminum unibody design that looks suspiciously like the HTC A9. The home button, however, has seemingly been removed in favor of a fingerprint sensor on the back, leaving a a lot of empty space under the display. There’s also supposedly going to be a glass panel on the back, which appears to only cover about one-third of the device. It’s unclear what purpose the glass serves, or if it’s simply a design choice on Google’s part. One thing we do know: It’s going to be a fingerprint magnet. X-factor Software will apparently be the x-factor at next week’s event. According to multiple reports, “stock” Android will be a thing of the past, as Google will reportedly introduce new features exclusive to its new Pixel phones. For starters, Google’s unreleased Pixel Launcher will seemingly be the default going forward, while Assistant is rumored to play a big part as well. In addition, a previous report revealed the glass panel on the back could be used for gestures, allowing users to easily access their notifications. Beyond what’s been leaked, it’s hard to say what other software tweaks to expect. If Google wants Assistant to become a focal point of its larger ecosystem, the software will likely be a key part of the experience. That means text inquiries, a la Allo, and two-way voice conversations, a la Google Home. Folks curious to see what the Pixel Launcher has to offer can already find the APK floating around. It doesn’t appear to add too much functionality at the moment but we could see more when it’s properly unveiled by Google. Project Andromeda It’s been a long time coming but it sounds like Google will finally combine the best features of Android and Chrome OS. What does that mean? According to reports, the hybrid OS will bring Android to laptops and 2-in-1 devices, evidence of which we’ve already seen pop up with features such as free-form window mode hidden in Android Nougat. Google has been working to blur the lines between the smartphone and laptop, recently introducing Android apps to Chrome OS, and Andromeda sounds like a natural progression of where Google ultimately hopes to end up. Unfortunately, the first device equipped with the hybrid software, a Pixel 3, reportedly won’t be available until Q3 of 2017, so we’re still a long way off. However, we could get our first glimpse of what to expect next week. Google Home Announced at I/O in May, Google Home is the search giant’s answer to the Amazon Echo. But in addition to simply setting timers and telling you the weather, Home’s Assistant, Google’s intelligent new personal assistant, is capable of engaging in two-way conversations, which means users will be able to ask a question and then follow that up with another one. Google still hasn’t revealed a final release date or price, so expect that next week. If a recent report is to be believed, Home will cost $129, which is about $40 cheaper than Amazon’s Echo. Seeing as we’re so close to the holiday season, that’s a pretty major price difference. Google Wi-Fi You’ve heard of Google’s OnHub routers, right? Well forget about those, because the search giant is reportedly gearing up to release a new router that offers simple mesh network features. Setting multiple routers up in a home isn’t a new concept but the process has become increasingly simplified over the past few years and it appears Google wants in on the new trend. Where that leaves existing OnHub routers is unclear. Whatever the device ends up being, a recent report claimed the device will cost $129 when it launches. Google VR/AR headset Word has it Google is preparing to unveil a standalone headset that mixes virtual and augmented reality. Curiously, the device won’t use Daydream, Google’s new VR software introduced at I/O. The headset, according to a report, will feature a built-in display and won’t need a computer or smartphone to power it. Chromecast Ultra To go with the Chromecast and Chromecast Audio, Google is reportedly going to release the Chromecast Ultra, a small streaming dongle that supports 4K and HDR. The catch is the price has allegedly been raised to $69, which is double that of the regular Chromecast. Wrap-up Google’s portfolio is shaping up to be pretty competitive, particularly as it pertains to Google Home. The Pixel and Pixel, on the other hand, sound like more difficult beasts to wrangle. From what we’re hearing, they sound like they’ll be competitive. But that alleged price is giving us pause. There probably won’t be too many surprises at next week’s event. But, who knows, maybe the rumor mill hasn’t spoiled everything. Stay tuned for Oct. 4.

Menu Home Apps Network Gadget Latest Mobile Home / Gadget / Is It Worth Buying A Tablet With 3G Or 4G LTE? Is It Worth Buying A Tablet With 3G Or 4G LTE? Posted on September 2, 2016September 20, 2016 by Rafid Sharif When any of the most powerful manufacturers in the mobile sector (read Samsung, Apple, Sony, Google, etc.) launches a high-end tablet, never missing a version of it with mobile connectivity, which at this point is usually compatible with networks 4G LTE. However, we also found many ranges entry and mid range devices capable of connecting via 3G, with a SIM card, and even phone function. Is it worth betting on this feature? The mobile connection raises the price of equipment It is one of the first factors to consider: a tablet with 4G will always be more expensive than the same model in WiFi only version. However, quite often it depends on the manufacturer the price at which the difference in performance is fixed. Let’s look at some of the tablets pointers moments. For example, the Galaxy Tab S2 the difference is 100 euros (499-599), according to the official prices of Samsung. In the Google Nexus 9, the jump is 80 euros (from 479 to 559, with 32GB). However, the palm takes Apple, which measured up to 120 euros a connectivity type and the other for iPad Air 2 (489-609). Given these data, we can estimate that normally buy a tablet with 4G LTE cost us around 100 euros more than if we acquired a WiFi only. But that is not the only implicit spending on a device such features. Possible problems with the SIM card Have mobile connectivity in a tablet is not relevant at all if we do not have a SIM card with which to take advantage. In this sense, we have two options, or request a duplicate our card mobile with which we have contracted the data to the operator (and not all operators have a service so far) paying any kind of fee, or hire a new rate, significantly increasing the monthly bill. If you have mobile, easily you have Internet on your tablet Today we can share the Internet connection between a smartphone and a tablet using almost any phone, if we use it as a WiFi router. Here is a tutorial to do it the easiest way possible. In this way, we avoid having to hire data for our tablet and we can equip ourselves with a WiFi only model to navigate from anywhere. Only we must activate a specific function on the phone and use the data rate for contracted with our mobile. We should also note that this will raise your battery consumption, though not excessive if the software is well optimized. Other tricks to not depend on the Internet In recent days we have talked about a couple of resources to have website content without being connected at the time. The first is to convert a story or article that interests us in a PDF, which is stored in the computer’s memory. The second in save web pages and links in one app to navigate quite efficiently without connection. Both solutions, however, require a bit farsighted and go select content at the time to have them available later. There is also a way to send messages to our contacts (provided they are within more or less close) without being hooked a network is a prerequisite, as we told you in this publication. Phone function, attractive but not decisive At one point, if we are at home enjoying our tablet and receive a call, it is very comfortable to answer from the same device and even keep doing our stuff with the screen as we consider the interlocutor. In fact, today is a good list of teams that included the large format option. However, WhatsApp, Skype or VoIP calls Hangouts already offer and, it seems, will gradually gain ground, if the operators fail to cut its progression. A tablet is a perfect tool to keep a video chat or a simple voice conversation and can perform this operation connected to a WiFi network. Is it really useful a 4G tablet For whom? More or less, it is a question we have clear. A tablet may be interesting mobile connectivity in the workplace, especially if our company is responsible for providing Internet service. You have a fast and direct connection will save certain disturbances which, in the event that we are working and we need maximum efficiency, be worth escape.   A tablet with 4G LTE will offer more comfort in the user experience, which we think is “in my case, is as necessary as to bear the extra costs?” Posted in GadgetTagged Latest 4G Tablets Related posts How To Make A Good Bargain From Selling Your Old Phone Buying CPUs And Ssds Everything You Wanted To Know Benefits And Drawbacks Of LCD-Led TELEVISION Post navigation The 7 Best Social Networking Apps For Android Know All The Processes Involved In Your Business Transactions Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

The Alphabet division, established in December 2015 after being spun out from Google’s own healthcare team, may not be ready to go public with its gadgets – a line-up expected to eventually include smart contact lenses for diabetics and wearables that can monitor for cancer – but an early preview has spilled new details on what one of Verily’s gadgets will be like. MIT Technology Review spotted a Verily smartwatch on the wrist of CTO Brian Otis, and was given a brief walkthrough of the homegrown technology. Although the last prototype we saw resembled a basic watch, with a square LCD display, this newer version is considerably different (unfortunately no photos were permitted). For a start, it has a circular screen, and uses e-paper. That’s apparently set into an analog-style watch case – bronze in color, in this case, with a pink rubber or silicone strap – and only shows the time, not any sort of real-time feedback from the bio-sensors. That’s intentionally minimalistic, Otis says, because it helps keep the power requirements down. Indeed, he claims a key focus of Verily’s research is cutting power consumption so that wearers won’t have to recharge their watches every night or every other night, as is usually the case with the Apple Watch or any of the current crop of Android Wear models. Even so, the amount of data Verily plans to collect with each wearable is considerably more extensive than what most smartwatches gather. An outer ring works as an electrocardiogram (ECG) measure of heart rate, for instance, while on the inner side there are optical sensors for also tracking heart activity. A quartet of “raised metal pads” could be for charging the device on some sort of cradle or, alternatively, provide a second point of contact for the ECG readings to be taken. NOW READ: The tech in Google’s smart contact lens They might also be bioimpedance sensors, used to track galvanic skin response and potentially unlocking everything from stress measurements through to hydration and respiratory rate. Jawbone promised something similar from its UP3, though has yet to enable the more advanced features in its band. However, Verily appears to be focusing on research rather than end-user sales. According to scientific advisor Dennis Ausiello, the watch may be deployed in future iterations of Verily’s so-called “Baseline” study, which could eventually monitor 10,000 to 20,000 people to give a big data insight into health patterns.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Software Google Play Music store finally lands in India Software Google Play Music store finally lands in India By Sohil Nikam - Google has finally launched its Play Music store in India just a day after it announced a slew of new products for the country. The company hasn’t officially announced the platform yet, but it’s now open for both desktop and mobile. To recall, rumors about Google Play Music’s arrival in India began in July this year. It’s taken a few months since then, but the store is now ready for business. Songs start at Rs 15 a pop and albums are priced between Rs 70 and Rs 200. There are a wide range of genres on display for both regional and international music enthusiasts. Categories include Best of Bollywood, Punjabi Pop, Tamil, Devotional & Spiritual, Telugu, Indian Pop Hits, International Music, Indian Classical, For the Kids, and Ghazals & Sufi. Sadly, the India-specific Play Music doesn’t stream podcasts yet. The platform gained support for them back in April this year. Also See: Google announces YouTube Go, Google Stations, Play Store update Google also hasn’t brought along Play Music All Access, radio, and its family plan. The first allows users to pay a subscriptions fee to stream an unlimited amount of music. One feature it has introduced is the ability to upload a maximum of 50000 songs from a user’s personal collection via Chrome so that they can stream the tracks from their phone. Google will now be competing against the likes of Apple Music, Gaana, Saavn, and Wynk Music for music streaming domination in India. While the search giant is at a disadvantage since it’s arrived so late in the game, the one major factor that it does have going for it is the fact that Play Music comes preinstalled in all Android devices. Android dominates the smartphone sector in India, meaning Play Music could serve as a person’s first and last destination for streaming songs. Google’s made the process of buying stuff easier as well, since it offers the option of purchasing physical Google Play prepaid vouchers with cash, effectively avoiding the need to have a credit card to buy items. You can check out Google Play Music via its Android or Web avatar.

Chief among them was the launch of a Google Glass-like accessory. Over the weekend, Snapchat announced plans to deliver a set of glasses complete with built-in video camera. The glasses, called Spectacles, connect wirelessly with the Snapchat app. Wearers can send videos they record on the device straight to the app. From there, users can send the video to friends, their stories, or added to the memories function. [Image by Carl Court/Getty Images] Connections between the glasses and device goes through Bluetooth and Wi-Fi on Apple devices. Transfers are made through Wi-Fi on Android devices. The accessory is compatible with all devices, and according to a blog post released by Snapchat, “Circular video plays full screen on any device, in any orientation, and captures the human perspective with a 115-degree field of view.” Spectacles come in three colors. The user can record video by pressing the record button located on the top of the glasses on the left side. Pressing the button captures 10 seconds of video recording. A second tap of the button is required for 30 seconds of video. The company says that the glasses can take a whole day’s worth of Snapchats with a single charge. Snapchat also took a lesson from Google, whose Google Glass, though more expensive, flopped on release. The firm decided to incorporate a light on the glasses that turns on when the glasses are recording video. Before launch, Google had to deflect the fear that everything and everyone near enough to a Glass would be recorded and stored by Google. Many of the fears were grossly unfounded, however; Glass was not deemed to be a major source of privacy issues. Still, the hype from privacy replaced the excitement about the device in many circles. Privacy is an often listed reason that the device failed to gain any commercial success. [Image by Stephen Lam/Getty Images] Unlike Google Glass, the Spectacles have been deemed by reviewers at Wired as being more affordable, more useful, and generally less creepy. The Spectacles also look like a normal pair of sunglasses. The cost stays on the more affordable side of the popular brand, Ray-Ban. Priced at $129.99, Snapchat’s CEO, Even Spiegel, described the device as more of a “toy” designed to allow users to see more of what is in front of them. They are also designed to prevent users from keeping their devices “like a wall in front of your face.” Snapchat has gathered 150 million daily users since its launch in 2012. The company is currently valued at $20 billion. Known as Snap by loyal followers, the company also recently officially changed its name from Snapchat to Snap. Snap entered the marketplace at a time where user-generated video was popular online, but had not yet exploded. However, it now has more competition like Instagram. The Facebook-owned photo sharing site has notably plundered Snapchat of its most valuable features. Some reviewers note that Snapchat’s entrance into the hardware market with the launch of Spectacles may give it an edge over competitors. Snap’s 26-year-old CEO was first spotted wearing what was allegedly an early prototype of the glasses on vacation in 2015. Paparazzi photos of Spiegel and girlfriend Miranda Kerr showed him wearing a pair of circular sunglasses that likely featured cameras on each side of the glasses. Business Insider reported that the glasses shared similarities with glasses created by Vergence Labs. Snapchat acquired Vergence Labs in 2014. Snapchat Spectacles will first arrive via a limited release. The expected release date is this fall, though no release date has been set either for the limited release or wide general release to the public.

On Monday, a leaked image of Google's Pixel smartphone made its way to the Internet, suggesting a bunch of details about its looks and UI. Now, a new image has been leaked online, and surprise surprise, it looks exactly the same. In an updated post, VentureBeat has a render of what it claims to be the Pixel XL - the bigger smartphone to be launched by Google. In an attempt to give its smartphones a facelift, Google has finally done away with the Nexus branding and is launching the smartphones under its own brand. The leaked image shows the new Pixel XL to have a home screen just like that of its new Pixel Launcher to give a fresh look to its new range of smartphones. The new icons are now solid filled instead of plain borders at the bottom. The image also shows a gradient wallpaper, unlike the blue-coloured one on the earlier leaked image of the Pixel.Home screen now has onscreen buttons alongside other interface changes. One of the most visible changes in the new user interface is the rounded app icons. The new UI and rounded icons are speculated to be exclusive on Pixel and Pixel XL, as per the report and may not be seen on other Google smartphones running Android 7.0 Nougat. Rest of the features and looks go identical with the Pixel smartphone Google is also said to enhance the UI of the smartphones to match up with the likes of Apple's 3D Touch technology, without additional hardware requirements. Talking about the specifications, another report from AndroidPolice suggests that the Pixel XL, codenamed Marlin, will sport a 5.5-inch QHD display, quad-core 2.0GHz 64-bit processor, 4GB of RAM, 32GB of inbuilt storage, a 3450mAh battery, a 12MP rear camera, and an 8MP front camera. The report also said that the smartphone will contain a headphone jack on the top, a fingerprint scanner on the rear, and a USB Type-C port at the bottom. As we mentioned, Google is quite in a form to showcase multiple products at its October 4 event. Apart from the Pixel phones, it is expected to unveil the Android-Chrome OS merger Google Andromeda, apart from Google Wifi router, the Chromecast Ultra, and the Google Home assistant.

Image: naulicreative/Shutterstock Google is full of Easter Eggs, often themed and packaged for one-off times of year, but occasionally more long-lasting than that. Here are some secret games you may not have been aware of. Last November, Google’s Easter Egg game hit the big time, allowing users to choose a side in celebration of the Star Wars movie released at the time. Logging into their Google account, users either chose a black or white to adorn their screen, within which they would browse the web, handle emails etc. It was one of the more prominent, well-received Easter Eggs, though that’s not to say it was the best. Pac-Man fever Last March, Goggle let users play Pac-Man through their own city’s streets, wasting thousands of working hours over the course of the day. Pac-Man is one of the Easter Egg themes that has remained on Google. If users simply type ‘Pac-Man Game’, up pops a small version of the arcade classic. Other nice gimmicks include searching for ‘Atari Breakout’ in Google’s image search, or ‘Zerg Rush’ in a standard Google search for a more bizarre variation on the theme. Beyond Google, there are also Easter Eggs on mobile sites and social media. In Facebook’s Messenger tool, for example, you can play chess or even basketball with someone over your chat. Your move Open up a conversation with a friend and type ‘@fbchess play’; if your Messenger is up to date, then a chess board will appear. Then you can just use standard algebraic notation to move your pieces, beginning each instruction with that opening command. ‘@fbchess Pe6’ would move your pawn to square E6, for example. ‘@fbchess help’ will open up instructions. Then, of course, shooting some hoops. Beyond Facebook and Google’s standard search engine lies even more Easter Eggs, constantly changing, appearing and vanishing. Below is an infographic from Euroffice, highlighting some of the better ones across Google’s services, should you need a distraction today.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Google rolls out welcome mat for rabidly anti-gay official By Ethan Baron / September 28, 2016 at 10:45 AM In March, Ezekiel Mutua, head of Kenya’s film-classification board, threatened to sue Google for not taking a gay music video off YouTube, Kenyan news reported. But soon, Mutua will be treading the hallowed ground of Google’s Mountain View campus as an invited guest for the firm’s Web Rangers digital-safety program summit, according to a new report. Mutua has been “on a crusade to ban content that ‘promotes homosexuality,'” said the report Wednesday in Quartz. And the man certainly knows his way around traditional anti-LGBT lingo: “There are things I am not neutral about and will never compromise on account of my position or status in life: my love for God and commitment to family values,” he wrote on Facebook on Monday. Earlier this month, he posted what he described as a “borrowed” commentary that equated homosexuality with bestiality, and described homosexuality as a “perversion.” Quartz reported that in addition to demanding Google take down the YouTube video, Mutua has banned a film about Kenya’s LGBT community and a podcast by lesbians, and shut down a gay speed-dating event. The Web Rangers program is Google’s international effort to keep children safe while online. Google said in a blog post that its Kenya program works with several organizations, including Mutua’s Kenya Film Classification Board. Homosexuality is illegal in Kenya and carries a maximum sentence of 14 years in prison. In June, a judge there upheld a ruling that men suspected of being gay be subjected to mandatory rectal exams. Google hypes its LGBT policies as one of the most “talked-about benefits” of working at the firm, where diversity groups include the “Gayglers.” Google did not respond immediately to a request for an explanation about Mutua’s invitation. Quartz said a Google Kenya representative confirmed Mutua had been invited to the event in Mountain View. “Politicians have many questions about the internet and Google,” the rep reportedly said. “To help answer these questions Google has a team that engages with and responds to queries from politicians and sometimes we invite them to events so they can get an understanding of the work we do.” Photo: Google employees walk to and from the Googleplex in Mountain View in June 2014.

Could we get some contact info for Google to tell them so? Tuco Carrera Yeah, Call 1-800- GOESAD Mary Meugniot Scott that’s the way it should be, it is not natural to be gay or trans MB It’s not the “way it should be”…and being homosexual is as natural as being heterosexual. Tuco Carrera NOT even REMOTELY, Normal, Natural or SANE ! A form of Treatable Mental Illness would best describe this CHOSEN Depravity ! Incognito Tuco Not according to the American, England, Swedish, and many other groups of Pyschology experts. What are your credentials? beardediris Actually, extreme bigotry is a form of mental illness, not homosexuality. Seek treatment. MB Your nonsensical comments aside, again, being homosexual is very natural to anyone who’s homosexual. What would be ‘unnatural’ would be for a homosexual to pretend to be something they’re not to appease bigots like yourself. mark.saylor Tuci – Missy, you’re just a mess. Incognito They are too ignorant to realize that people don’t choose to be gay. Why would they go against what’s so called natural to them and then be ridiculed for it? beardediris Is that you, Mary, dressed like Mario? You might not be trans, but looks like you’re into cross-dressing. Tuco Carrera REally butt princess is that the Best you Got ? Go use Mouthwash Maggot-Mouth Dog ! ConeyIslandBaby75 Isn’t Tuco Carrera Spanish for butt princess? Adam Kadmon Its not natural to get on your knees and tell someone who isn’t listening your “sins” either, but I bet you do it so you can feel good about how ugly you are on the inside the rest of the day. Mary Meugniot Scott nope don’t get on my knees jim Anti-Pervert official. Tuco Carrera GOOD, WHY should Perverted Depravity be Celebrated I’m PROUD of this KENYAN Official ! Mainstream Americansare just Plainly Sick & Tired of Homosexuals n their ILK stinking up the Place ! Every Legitimate Poll NOT sponsored by a Homosexual Agenda Group shows 82 to 87 % of Americans say NO to Same-Sex Marriage ! Incognito I don’t believe that at all. I work in a very conservative state and I travel to many facilities here and I see a lot more acceptance than disapproval. Tuco Carrera WRONG, Privately they talk about how Nasty n Disgusting you are Cinder-Fella ! mark.saylor lol beardediris Everything you said is wrong. The majority of Americans are for same-sex marriage. Polls not sponsored by LGBT groups say the same thing–between 55% and 60% are FOR it. Tuco Carrera No filthy troll Drama Queen Youre WRONG ! TRUMPS Supreme Court is going to Put you Defects back DEEP in the CLOSET forever ! mark.saylor It is so sad that you are so ignorant. You seem to have no idea how SCOTUS or our Constitution works. Repealing a constitutional amendment requires a 2/3 vote by Congress and ratification by 3/4 of the states. The President gets no vote. SCOTUS can not simply repeal. Welcome to America, ConeyIslandBaby75 Actually the vast majority of Americans like the Gays way better than loudmouth nosy bodies like you who always want to stick your nose into other people’s private bedrooms. It’s like you’re a stalker Tuco. What the hell is wrong with you. Adam Kadmon Its not up to those taking Polls, its up to 9 Justices on the Supreme Court, and WE WON. 🙂 greg b Go read your Bible, and its thoughts of protecting children: 44 “However, you may purchase male and female slaves from among the nations around you. 45 You may also purchase the children of temporary residents who live among you, including those who have been born in your land. You may treat them as your property, 46 passing them on to your children as a permanent inheritance. You may treat them as slaves, but you must never treat your fellow Israelites this way. -Leviticus 25:44-46 New Living Translation (NLT) mark.saylor Tuci – You are downright lying. The fox news national poll in May 2015 matched Gallup, Rasmussen, NBC, NY Times, Washington Post and ABC. All showed approximately 61% of Americans supported ssm. MA, CO, IO, VT, NH, DC, NY, RI, DL, MN, ME, MD and WA all voted to legalize ssm. Did you know only 4% of Americans supported interracial marriage in 1958 and only 28% supported it when it was made legal? Tuco Carrera Its very INSULTING to try and Equate Racial Injustice with Homosexual Depravity not even REMOTELY the Same ! Daniel Pascoe If the rabid homosexuals want to go about the country banning Christians then turn about is fair play. beardediris First of all, Christians have been banning, hunting, and killing gays before the Bible was written so the “turn about is fair play” applies to gays, not Christians. Second of all, no gays or laws in America ban Christians. No gays kill or attack Christians, en masse, for the purpose of wiping them out. You’re the persecutor, not the persecuted, in the real world. You’re a victim only in your imagination. Adam Kadmon We need to close the Churches and fine Christians for wearing crosses, etc. Oh, well, it will happen. 🙂 MB Homosexuals are “banning” Christians? From where? Incognito No, they don’t wish to ban Christians they just wish to not have their beliefs play a role in their rights or lack of. Sepetation of church and state benefits everyone including Christians. Incognito Google is very lgbt friendly. An invite doesn’t change that. beardediris So WHAT? It’s like people can’t even work together over a common cause unless they are all in agreement about everything! Do I like that this official from Kenya is anti-gay? NO! But if he’s committed to keeping kids safe on the internet–like, making sure the Kenyan kiddie-porn pushers get no content and create no new content and do not interact with minors–Then work with the man! You can remain true to your own ideas and still work with people who disagree with you. You don’t change minds or hearts or attitudes by EXCLUDING people. Google is pro LGBT. They’ve proven themselves. Guess what? You don’t always get to be around people you like, who inspire you. Sometimes, you have to work with “haters”. It’s called life. Some people should get one. MB My question is this…is this guy interested in keeping kids safe from predators, or is his interest in keeping children from reading anything that would appear to HIM as ‘pro-homosexual’? Putin made pretty much the same argument this guy is…that his interest is in protecting the “children”, when his REAL goal was to criminalize homosexuals and homosexuality under the banner of protecting children. …and thus, my concern is only that Google may not be aware of this and could be naively supporting a program that may target homosexuals. Let’s not forget that at least a small percentage of these children he allegedly wants to ‘protect’ will also be homosexual. That said, I do agree with much of your comment. Kajsa Zachausson Rabid anti-gay, huh? That means they’re usually way deep in the closet themselves. Dustyn Polk Can we retire this nonsense along with the bestiality thing? It’s equal levels of stupidity, and if one side isn’t allowed to be stupid, the other side should dive in head first to take the place of the first side… mark.saylor Actually it seems that quite often the most outspoken anti-gay crusaders are found to be self-hating, closeted homosexuals. http://www.ranker.com/list/top-10-anti-gay-activists-caught-being-gay/joanne?utm_expid=16418821-253.1pST8hHXRlGe0nguOTQEHQ.0 Tuco Carrera WRONG we’ll leave being maggot mouth SOCKCUCKER to you boy ! Tuco Carrera Really maggot, is that the Best you got The Vast Majority of Normal Sane People just find Homosexuals to be Nasty n Disgusting ! Alex Ezekiel Mutua knows how to “filter” information already. Kenya’s efforts to tackle its escalating security crisis have been marred by serious human rights violations by Kenyan security forces, including extrajudicial killings, arbitrary detentions, and torture. Kenya has tried to restrict civil society and independent media. If he can stop google them maybe he can save some bullets and give the death squads a rest. The barbarian should not have been given a visa. Tyler Well, he is right about one thing, it’s a pretty dangerous and unhealthy activity particularly for M/M homosexuals. Mike McDermid Well, well, well, it looks like the Homosexual Agenda crowd have met their match. Money talks, if Google or any other merchant wants to do business in Kenya, then promoting perverted behavior gets you kicked out of the country. Google simply made a good business decision. Tuco Carrera AMEN, Awesome to see somebody Stand Up to the Homosexual Mafia ! greg b Go read your Bible, and its thoughts of protecting children: 44 “However, you may purchase male and female slaves from among the nations around you. 45 You may also purchase the children of temporary residents who live among you, including those who have been born in your land. You may treat them as your property, 46 passing them on to your children as a permanent inheritance. You may treat them as slaves, but you must never treat your fellow Israelites this way. -Leviticus 25:44-46 New Living Translation (NLT) Tuco Carrera GOD declared your CHOSEN depravity to be an ABOMINATION, Slavery has NOTHING to do with Sodomy IDIOT !

Now a report out of Korea has revealed that Huawei may be switching its wearable OS entirely, ditching Google’s Android Wear for Samsung’s Tizen…. Now this should all be taken with a huge grain of salt, but if this report is to be believed, Huawei wants to separate itself from Google’s Android Wear on its wearables. Why? The report states that “Huawei [is] looking for an OS other than Google’s as the US firm had not been very collaborative.” Samsung, on the other hand, apparently has agreed to be fully cooperative in tailoring Tizen for Huawei’s wearables. So what does that mean? More or less, Huawei wasn’t happy with Google’s tight grip on the Android Wear ecosystem and wants to be able to further customize its devices, as we’ve seen with its software skin on smartphones. We even saw Huawei call on Google to allow more customization of the OS in early 2015. Again, this is all just a report, so don’t count on it as a fact. The Korea Herald further reports that a Samsung spokesperson said that “Samsung has not officially received any request for such collaboration from Huawei yet.” While Android Wear continues to live on with devices such as the recently announced ASUS ZenWatch 3 and the new Nixon Mission smartwatch, cutting Huawei out could impact how consumers and OEMs both look at Google’s wearable OS. Tizen, on the other hand, currently only runs on Samsung hardware, such as the Gear S3. This potential collaboration between the two companies would be a first for the platform. It’s entirely possible that this could be the route Huawei plans to go with its next lineup of wearables, but we’ll just have to wait and see in the meantime.

Google for iOS just got a lot more private, as a Tuesday update adds incognito mode. As it does in Chrome, the feature allows users to surf without having searches and browser history collected. For added security, Unni Narayanan, director of Google product management, suggests enabling Touch ID so only your unique fingerprint (or those of anyone whose prints are saved on your phone) can unlock an existing incognito session. Incognito mode does not provide complete anonymity on the Web—sites are still going to record your IP address, for example. But whether you want to do a surreptitious Google search or purchase a birthday gift for someone who shares your device, incognito is a good way to make sure your browsing activities won't land you in hot water. The update, meanwhile, also allows users to watch YouTube videos in Search. "Skip the extra step before you break into dance to your favorite music video or before you learn a thing or two in the latest how-to," Narayanan said. "No new Web pages + less load time = more fun." //Related Articles 21 Google Search Tips You Need to Learn He also promised under-the-hood improvements that make the app twice as reliable and less likely to crash. Earlier this year, Google gave its iOS app a major speed boost. Keep an eye out for the lightning bolt and "AMP" (Accelerated Mobile Pages) next to articles in the Top Stories section of your search results for quicker access to articles. The update also made it easier to track sports events: Users can watch highlights directly in your Now cards; just tap the play button and watch without leaving the app. Back to top Previous : iMessage App Store Launches With Stickers, More Bored?

Or perhaps not the “public,” but rather — so far, at least — some non-press that are close to Google… It’t not clear how Google is choosing who to invite, but they appear to be people that are significantly tied to the company in some way. Two non-press that we have confirmed have received invitations include Kimberly Ann Graham, and Ivan Yudhi, two of the earliest group of Google Glass Explorers and current Local Guides in SF. Others appear to be receiving invitations via private Twitter DM, but it’s not clear who Google is selecting for these invitations and why. All this said, I wouldn’t get your hopes up if you haven’t already gotten an invitation. If Google wants you, chances are they’ll find you. But this is a sign that Google’s October 4th event, which is said to include vast swaths of hardware, is going to be a big deal. It also further reinforces the idea that Google is going all-out on marketing this launch to normal people, but I guess we already knew that. Looks like Google (might?) be sending out non-press 10/4 event invites to Google fans via Twitter DM? pic.twitter.com/lxCTFODnxa — Stephen Hall (@hallstephenj) September 28, 2016 Guides Google View THe Guide event View THe Guide October 4th View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

Home News Reviews iPhone Apps Android Apps Windows Apps Top Mobiles Latest Mobiles Upcoming Mobiles PhoneRadar Explains Search PHONE FINDER COMPARE PHONES Android Apps New Chrome OS Update brings Android Apps support on the Chomebook Pixel 2 Earlier, Google released Android Apps to a couple of Chromebooks, whereas some of the other Chromebooks like the Chromebook Pixel 2 still had Android Apps by the courtesy of Beta update. But now it looks like the wait is over. Google has now released the Chrome 53 update to the Chromebook Pixel 2 as well which will bring along with it, the Android Apps. So users can now download the Apps from the PlayStore and use them just like any other user would do. It is reported that it will be as simple as launching the PlayStore app from the launcher and wait for the setup to complete and then proceed normally just as you would on an Android smartphone. However, it is reported that the Apps might be buggy or crash in some cases since these are essentially built for Android smartphones and not laptops. And not to forget the fact that these devices were built for touchscreen devices hence the experience will be different. And as far as other ChromeBooks are concerned, we don’t have any info on them so we just have to wait and see what happens and how it goes. Earlier: We have already seen a bunch of ChromeBooks in the market so far. They are much more popular now as compared to what they were. At the time of launch a couple of years back. The main reason for the same is majorly the OS. The Chrome Operating system has evolved over time and now offers a good overall performance. Also, Google announced that the Chrome OS would be getting the Google Play store and the Android apps. On the same lines, the initial rollout came in the unstable developer channel. It is expected to become more stable later this year as the availability expands. Now a new update is rolling out to the ChromeBook Pixel (2015), Acer Chromebook R11, and Asus Chromebook Flip with access to the Google Play services. Yes, the Chrome OS beta 53.0.2785.36 is live, and it includes Google Play access. However, the company says that it is still in Beta only, and the all the Google Play portions might not work as intended. It is reported that the system will be receiving the updates over the next couple of days. According to the sources, the beta channel of the Chrome OS should now be more stable than the dev channel. Hence the overall experience should be much better even though the Google Play access feature is not that stable. So it is advised that if you are currently running the dev version of the Chrome OS, then you simply update to the beta version for a better and solid experience. However, it will be tested over time as to how the Google Play access is working and we will get more reports on the same pretty soon. But as mentioned, it is expected to be more stable than the previous one in terms of overall usage. Recommended: Asus Chromebit converts a Monitor into a Computer powered by Google Chrome OS In the meantime, if you are using the latest build then you can use and report any bugs which you come across to Google Dev team via the Forum or filing a bug page. The latest version of Google Play store also allows you to join the beta testing for apps. If you updated this version, then let us know your experience and stay tuned for info on this.

Google Express, the delivery service that launched in Manhattan two years ago, can now bring groceries from Costco or ski jackets from Paragon Sports to shoppers' homes anywhere in the five boroughs starting Wednesday. The expansion is part of Google's plans to make the service available across the country by the end of the year. The focus for now is on large retailers, which typically have the sales volume and personnel to handle the picking and packing of goods. Courier services perform the deliveries, which range from same-day to two-days, depending on availability and proximity to the customer. Google's response has also been to roll out new advertising products to help merchants in their fight to keep Amazon at bay. Google Express will eventually expand to include small businesses. "Even though we've been at this for three years, we were still figuring out how the pick and pack process will work," Elliott said. "We're going to get to the point where the platform is much more open and we can bring in small businesses. That's part of the plan." Photo: Google Express The service also went live across the rest of New York state as well as from Maine down to Virginia. It costs $4.99 per order, or $95 a year. About 15 retailers are currently working with Google Express in New York City, including Whole Foods, Payless ShoeSource and camera shop Adorama. Deliveries from Fairway are only available in Manhattan. "We'd love to expand with them, but we don't think there's enough capacity that we could deliver to the five boroughs," said Brian Elliott, general manager of Google Express. "Paragon, on the other hand, we're delivering to the entire Northeast." Google has been rolling out Express as part of its battle with Amazon: The Seattle-based e-commerce behemoth has been eating into Google's search-advertising business as more and more shoppers make Amazon their first online stop.

By Stephanie Ritenbaugh / Pittsburgh Post-Gazette Google has launched its Express online shopping service in Pennsylvania as the search engine giant continues to expand the program across the country — joining rivals like online retailer Amazon in the push to get goods into the hands of online shoppers more quickly. Google Express aims to connect customers with fast delivery from big name retailers like Whole Foods, Costco, PetSmart and Sur la Table. The idea is to make it “easy for shoppers to get the things they need in one convenient place, from multiple stores,” the Mountain View, Calif.-based company said. Deliveries can be overnight or two-day shipments. In addition to Pennsylvania, Google is adding the service throughout the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, estimating that about 70 million more people will now be able to use Express — a calculation based on population and ZIP codes. “About 75 percent of the U.S. population will have access” after Wednesday’s roll out, said Brian Elliott, general manager of Google Express. “We expect to bring it to the rest of the continental U.S. in a couple of months.” Google has not disclosed the number of users of its express service. According to comScore, a Virginia-based firm that measures media audiences and consumers, Google Express had about 1 million unique visitors in the U.S. as of August. Google sites have about 240.7 million unique visitors overall, comScore data. Mr. Elliot said bringing the service to the Pittsburgh region is personally exciting because a team in Google’s Bakery Square office has been part of developing the project for years. “It’s about time we bring it to them,” he said. Google first launched its delivery service in 2013, putting it in competition with Amazon Prime and Prime Now, the Seattle-based online marketplace’s speedy delivery service. Amazon Prime offers two-day shipping, along with access to movie and TV streaming for $10.99/​month or $99 for the year. Prime Now offers members same-day deliveries in select metro areas from grocery and home stores and restaurants, in addition to what is offered at Amazon.com. For Google Express, membership costs $95 the year or, for those who want to pay as they go, $4.99 per order. “They have a long hill to climb in this part of the sector,” said Neil Begley, a senior vice president for Moody’s Investor Services’ telecommunications/​media team. “That said, Google is hardly a Johnny-come-lately company. They’re extremely well recognized and have integrated their services to mobile and desktop, and their pricing is competitive with Amazon. However, Amazon has added benefits with its membership with movies, TV, and books.” As Google evaluates how it will claim market share in the delivery space, it has shelved plans for a similar service that would deliver fresh groceries, a program that it experimented with on the West Coast in February. “We’ve been testing a lot of types of services,” Mr. Elliot said. “It worked well, but we can’t really scale that to the entire United States. “What we’re trying to accomplish is to create a platform that will be available to everybody,” he said. “That’s hard to do with refrigerated and frozen goods, for a lot of reasons, including the packaging and the service being too expensive for some customers.” So far, Google Express-affiliated merchants include Costco, Kohl's, L'Occitane, PetSmart, Stop & Shop, Giant, Sur la Table, Ulta Beauty, Payless, Adorama, Road Runner, Vitamin Shoppe and Whole Foods. The company plans to add more merchants, Mr. Elliot said, and make the service available to smaller retailers and independent merchants over time.

Tags : Android-Android+ Google-Google+ G'day, mates! October 4 is fast approaching and for fans of everything Google and Android-related this date is going to be nothing else but a cherished holiday. Admit it, you've already cleared your schedule and readied the popcorn, haven't you? Apart from the new Pixel lineup of phones which will take up the relay from the loved Nexus family of stock Android devices, the real highlight of El Goog's upcoming event is expected to be the intriguing Andromeda OS, which seems like a pretty big deal. While we will have to sustain our impatience for six more days, Google is definitely eager to remind us about the anticipated event whenever possible. A few days ago we showed you the minimalistic sculpture in Brooklyn, which is a self-explanatory teaser for the upcoming "made by Google" Pixel smartphones — well, it seems that Australia now has several now, too. Overlooking the impressive Sydney Harbour bridge in the most populous city in the Land Down Under, the new advertising is essentially similar to the Brooklyn one and is a nice addition to the local urban planning. There's a small difference, though - Australia's sculptures sport an October 5 date for the Pixel event, which can be attributed to the time zone differences. There's also a sculpture at the Bondi to Bronte coastal walk near, as well as one in Melbourne. We bet Android fans will snap multiple selfies near the sculpture while they're waiting for the Pixel event. October 4 (or 5) can't come soon enough.

The tech giant is expected to launch the new Nexus phones called Pixel and Pixel XL on October 4, 2016 (Photo : Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) It is a week ahead of Pixel and Pixel XL launch but the heavy leaks have already shown us what the Google Nexus Phone 2016 designs look like. Google Pixel and Pixel XL leaks show the design of both Nexus phones Previously, a render image of Google Pixel surfaced on the internet and this week, it is the Pixel XL turns to make a 'debut' ahead of its official launch, as posted by VentureBeat. The leak only shows a press image of what's believed to be the Pixel XL - a larger variant of the Google Pixel phones. What's interesting about the image is the clear view of its navigation icons.   Leaked images show what Google's Pixel phones are set to look like https://t.co/0NYIeeflci pic.twitter.com/LcMdLNHgSQ — Wired UK (@WiredUK) September 27, 2016   It is obviously different from the usual navigation with its white border on top of black background - as seen in an image published by Android Police. The rounded icons and new launcher are some of the changes to be seen and it could be Google's effort in trying to give Android a refresh for the new phones. Google Pixel and Pixel XL specifications: What to expect in the next Nexus Phone 2016? Investigating the rants and previous leaks, it can be argued that the Google Pixel will sport 5 inch screen and 2,770 mAh battery. It will be equipped with 4 GB RAM and 32 GB internal storage. The optics department will get 12 MP and 8 MP cameras. The fans should expect fingerprint scanner, USB type C port and a headphone jack on the Nexus phones. As for the larger variant of Google Pixel - the Pixel XL - it will sport 5.5 inch screen with larger battery, 3,450 mAh. These specifications, however, have sparked debates among the high-tech crowd since the speculated price of Pixel XL is $649. It is considered an expensive pricetag for some people judging from the specs that Google offers in the larger Pixel phone, University Herald reported. Google Pixel and Pixel XL release date It is no longer secret that Google 'Nexus' phones will be launched on October 4 alongside the new Andromeda OS, a merge of Chrome and Android - that will run under the hood of Pixel 3 laptop.     Tags google nexus phone 2016, google pixel and pixel xl, pixel xl leak, pixel image render, Andromeda OS, google october event © 2016 University Herald, All rights reserved.

News Feature articles Blog posts Podcasts Shortbread Forums Google Data Saver improves mobile browsing on narrow pipes by Eric Born  9:00 AM on September 28, 2016 Many of us have gotten spoiled by our always-available internet connections, but web access isn't that dependable in every market. Google has announced a couple of improvements for Chrome on Android that could improve browsing experience for those with slow or limited data connections. These improvements build on Chrome's Data Saver mode, which removes most of the images from web pages when users are browsing with a slow connection. First, Google has expanded the Data Saver technology to videos. The company claims that users will be able to use 67% less data when watching MP4 format videos with Data Saver enabled. Additionally, Data Saver will now optimize websites by paring them down to the bare essentials. Users can opt to load the original website through a dialogue at the bottom of their screen. This mode does not, however, appear to act as a de facto ad-blocker. Judging from Google's "Before and After" preview picture, it appears that Data Saver considers banner ads to be an essential feature. Next, Google plans to implement a "download" feature that allows users to save web content for later offline viewing. The company claims that this feature works with web pages, music, images, and videos. Users can access their saved content through the "Downloads" option in the Chrome menu. This feature is currently only in Chrome Beta, though Google assures us it will roll out soon. The company's Data Saver mode might be aimed at communities with limited or absent wireless internet, but could prove useful elsewhere. Despite being designed for India, Google's offline Maps mode has been useful in the United States and Europe as well. As long as there are mobile users contrained by data caps, there will be people looking for tools to limit their data usage. One of Google's major motivators for improving web browsing on poor internet connections appears to be its interest in developing its market in India. On Tuesday, Google's CEO Sundar Pinchai published an article on India's Economic Times detailing the company's plans and aspirations for the country. Among other things, Google is working to provide Wi-Fi at 400 train stations across India, and a program for training Indians to build Android apps.   Tags: Mobile computing Register | Remember me View options x Subscriber options: E-mail me when people reply to my comments Comment sorting order: Flat, chronologicalNo threading.

By Stephanie Condon for Between the Lines | September 27, 2016 -- 15:30 GMT (08:30 PDT) | Topic: Enterprise Software As companies like Google, Microsoft, and Salesforce compete for enterprise business, they're increasingly offering customers a wide range of integrated productivity tools, rather than siloed applications. Google, however, seems to be missing one key piece: customer relations management (CRM). What's Hot on ZDNet When will Microsoft end support for your version of Windows or Office? GE Digital builds up its global presence with acquisitions, partnerships ​Domino's claims world-first pizza drone delivery Microsoft delivers test builds of Visual Studio for Mac, Visual Studio 2017 for Windows For that, it's turned to ProsperWorks, a cloud-based CRM platform built expressly for Google Apps for Work. Linking its future to Google's enterprise business, ProsperWorks has done well for itself so far, growing its revenue 504 percent year-over-year and attracting 63,000 businesses. On Tuesday, the company announced it's secured $24 million in Series B funding, enabling its plans to expand internationally and build a data science team that will transform its CRM from a database to effectively a virtual VP of sales. "We want to be able move CRM from being just a database to a system that tells you what to do next," CEO Jon Lee told ZDNet. The funding round is led by Next World Capital, with additional financing from Storm Ventures, True Ventures, Industry Ventures, Devoteam, and a consortium of strategic angels. ProsperWorks' total funding now stands at $34 million. "Stage One" of the business was developing a CRM product that, through automated data entry and integration with Google productivity apps, ensures data quality and comprehensiveness. Stage Two, he said, is helping sales teams find the connections between their actions and their performance and, ultimately, to give sales teams advice on how to close deals. For instance, Lee explained, the system may tell a salesperson, "You've only done seven phone calls to this customer, you need to do eight more." While ProsperWorks will be using its new funding to build out its data science team, it's also leveraging Google's machine learning platform, meeting with their team on a weekly basis. "Where we can leverage third party tools, we're 100 percent Google," Lee said. Hitching its fate to Google as the internet giant ramps up its enterprise business may be the best way for a relatively small CRM company to go up against Salesforce and other dominant players in the market. More than 5 million businesses use Google Apps, and ProsperWorks is uniquely positioned to capitalize on their growth. In turn, ProsperWorks gives Google the ability to stay competitive with Salesforce as the CRM giant encroaches on its space -- the company's acquisition of the productivity platform Quip expands Salesforce's offerings in word processing and collaborative communications. Meanwhile, Microsoft's recent LinkedIn acquisition gives it the data to improve its own Dynamics CRM. Both of those companies are also offering more intelligent sales and marketing services -- Salesforce recently announced its Einstein platform, while Microsoft's expanded partnership with Adobe combines its AI investments with Adobe's Marketing Cloud data. "Everyone is recognizing sales software is a massive market," Lee said. As to whether Google would acquire ProsperWorks, Lee said, "We work so closely with Google, we're almost a part of it already." In the meantime, ProsperWorks is also using its new capital to build its sales and marketing teams, both domestically and internationally. The company is expanding its business abroad for the first time, starting in Europe -- the second largest market behind the US by total IT spend. One of its investors, Devoteam, is the largest IT systems integrator in Europe.

Friday November 18, 2016 US WORLD PERSECUTION MINISTRY CULTURE VIDEO Subscriptions Homepage CULTURE Google Nexus 7 release date, news, details: Will it be rebranded as the Pixel 7? Jess Dailo 28 September, 2016 10:53 AM Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter (Asus)The Nexus 7 (launched in 2013). People from the tech community are expecting the release of the Google Nexus 7 this year, and it seems that it may be unveiled during an event that is set this October. Moreover, there is a possibility that Google may change the Nexus brand and give it another label instead. According to reports, there were rumors before that the next flagship smartphones of Google were supposed to be codenamed Sailfish and Marlin. However, this next batch of smartphones may possibly be named the Pixel and Pixel XL instead, and that the company might actually abandon the Nexus brand. Furthermore, the tech company is already preparing for an event this coming October that will reveal its latest gadgets. Based on reports, the event may possibly be on Oct. 4 as it was hinted by Hiroshi Lockheimer, Google's senior vice president of Android, Chrome OS and Google Play. He mentioned in a tweet, "We announced the 1st version of Android 8 years ago today. I have a feeling 8 years from now we'll be talking about Oct 4, 2016." There is also a possibility that the tablet of Google will be rebranded as Pixel 7 instead of the Nexus 7. With this, there are speculations that the company is already collaborating with Huawei on the production of the tablets. However, this information is yet to be confirmed since both companies have remained silent about the rumors. As for the specs of the latest device, there is a possibility that it will be equipped with a Snapdragon chipset and a random access memory (RAM) that is worth 4GB. The base model will have an internal storage of 64GB and it has a microSD card slot that has the capability to store up to 2TB. It will be run by Android Nougat operating system. There is no official release date yet for the upcoming device, but it may possibly be announced on Oct. 4, 2016 during Google's event.

Toggle navigation Financials Consumer Discretionary Technology Energy Gaming Healthcare Industrials Sports Video Toggle navigation Home About us Contact Us Authors US Edition November 18, 2016 Financials Consumer Discretionary Technology Energy Gaming Healthcare Industrials Sports Video Alphabet Inc (GOOGL) Nexus Smartphones VS Pixel Smartphones Facebook Google+ Twitter Pinterest Stumbleupon GOOGL Google is all set to replace its Nexus smartphone lineup with its upcoming Pixel smartphone devices If you already don’t know, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is gearing up for its October event, where the US-based tech company is predicted to launch its next generation of smartphone models. It is widely accepted that the highly rumored Google Pixel will replace the current line of Nexus smartphone devices. Interestingly, images of Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL have recently been leaked by credible sources which have led to comparisons of the upcoming smartphones with their respective predecessor Nexus line. Here is a quick review of the main differences between the current generation Nexus lineup and the upcoming Google Pixel smartphones. Interestingly, the first thing that you will notice about the upcoming Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL is that both smartphones share the exact same design. This is a completely opposite approach that Google has incorporated in its current generation line of Nexus smartphones. The HTC Nexus 6P has a very different design compared to the LG Nexus 5X but it this will not be the case with the upcoming Pixel smartphone models. However, it is possible that the more expensive Pixel XL smartphone will feature a more premium build quality to complement its expected high-end price tag compared to its budget friendlier little brother.   The internal specifications is another area where the Google Pixel will greatly vary to the current line of Nexus. Reliable sources have widely reported that both Pixel smartphone models will feature the latest Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor compared to the Qualcomm Snapdragon 808 processor and Qualcomm Snapdragon 810 processor incorporated in the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P, respectfully. If this turns out to be the case, then both upcoming Google Pixel smartphone models will be faster and more power efficient compared to the current line of Nexus smartphones. Also, both upcoming Pixel smartphones are tipped to be powered by a 4GB RAM which would give the devices another advantage over the 3GB RAM and 2GB RAM incorporated in the Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X, respectfully. Furthermore, numerous knowledgeable sites are predicting the Pixel smartphone models to sport similar display screens, battery life and camera sensors compared to their respective predecessor Nexus smartphone. Hopefully, Google will not keep us all waiting for its upcoming projects and officially introduce its next generation smartphone devices during the October event.

PC-Tablet Videos Tech Apps Telecom Science Business Social Auto Reviews How-To’s Featured Google Station, Google Assistant in Hindi, YouTube Go: An attempt by Google to stay on top of Indian market By Anand Narayanaswamy - 27/09/2016 Google, during the Google For India event on September 27 announced that the company has launched Google Station in India, which will bring public Wi-Fi to schools, malls, and other prominent places. Moreover, the company also announced that it will launch Hindi version of Google Assistant by the end of 2016. The company also announced the launch of YouTube Go. As part of the Google Station service, the company will roll-out Wi-Fi hot spots in places frequently visited by a large number of people. This includes malls, transit stations including social hangout locations such as cafes and universities. In addition to India, Google Station will also be launched in Indonesia and Philippines in the upcoming future. Google Station aims to tap people deeply Announcing the launch of Google Station at the second ‘Google For India’ event on September 27, 2016, in New Delhi, the company revealed that the station is a service that aims to deepen its reach across the country. Moreover, the launch of Google Station is part of the search-engine giant ambitious plan to bring more people on to its Google platform. Responding to media queries, Caesar Sengupta, Vice-President, Next Billion Users at Google disclosed that the main aim of the program is to provide people with many hot spots within a few minutes’ walk from their home, university, or workplace. Moreover, the entire mechanism will be unified by a simple login process that works across all of them. Speaking on the sidelines of the Google For India event, John Giannandrea, VP of search revealed that India is leading the mobile world with search queries on mobile surpassing desktop years ahead of others. Google is now capable of translating 100 languages and 12 of these are Indic.

The search company had started bringing Wi-Fi to railway stations in India last year in partnership with RailTel and Indian Railways; expanding that rollout to cafes, shopping centres and other public places appears to mark the second stage of Google Station. The current rollout covers 53 railway stations across India with Google citing ambitions to scale that number up. “The goal is to give people many hot spots within a few minutes walk from their home, university, or workplace, unified by a simple login process that works across all of them,” said Caesar Sengupta, Vice-President of the Next Billion Users programme at Google. India’s Internet Despite being a country with one of the largest population in the world, India’s rapid growth over the past few decades has led to a divide between wealthy middle-class with Internet access and poorer people who have a poor or no Internet access. Projects like Google Station and Facebook Internet.org, which aims to provide free Internet connectivity in India and other regions where a connection is not widely available, look to fill in the divide between those who have Internet access and those who do not. It could be argued that Google and Facebook’s seemingly philanthropic endeavours are perhaps means of getting more people to use their services in return for free Internet services. However, the Internet is pretty much the great enabling tool of our generation, giving people a voice, status and access to the wider world, be that through social platforms or access to online marketplaces; either way it offers opportunities that narrow the gap between the rich and poor. With Facebook’s Mark Zuckerberg committed to Internet.org and its ambitions to bring wireless broadband to Africa via satellites, we can expect access to the Internet on a global scale to expand significantly in the near-future.

ClickZ ClickZ Intelligence ClickZ Learn ClickZ Live header-ad-slot November 18, 2016 Search Engine Watch Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports Toggle navigation Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports Five surprising benefits of high CTR across all marketing channels PPC 28 Sep 16 | Larry Kim Facebook0 Linkedin74 Google+10 Twitter 84 Obviously, CTR is important in PPC marketing. A higher CTR means a higher Quality Score, which reduces your CPC and improves your ad rank. But it goes much further than that. A remarkable CTR is not only the most important thing in AdWords, but it is also extremely important for other marketing channels. These include organic search, CRO, social media, and email marketing. Here are five surprising benefits of having a remarkable, unicorn-worthy CTR across all your marketing channels. 1. Much higher ad impression share You get big discounts from having a high CTR. Namely, a lower cost per click, which really adds up as clicks accumulate. This is true not just of vanilla search ads, but all Google properties, whether we’re talking about theGoogle Display Network or Gmail Ads. But a remarkable CTR doesn’t just impact CPC. It also impacts your impression share – how often your ads show up in the first place. On the Google Search Network, every increase (or decrease) of 1 point in Quality Score can make a huge positive impact on your impression share:                       If you can increase your Quality Score by one point, your impression share on average will increase by about 6% on desktop. This is even bigger deal on mobile, where impression share is twice as competitive.         Increasing your Quality Score by one point would increase your impression share by an average of 12%! Data sources: Impression share data is based on an analysis of approximately 10,000 small and medium-size accounts (spending between $10,000 and $15,000 per month), based worldwide, advertising on the Search network in Q1 and Q2 of 2015. 2. Your organic search positions will get a boost We recently conducted research to test whether achieving above-expected user engagement metrics results in better organic rankings. We observed an unmistakable pattern:   The more your pages beat the expected organic CTR for a given position, the more likely you are to appear in prominent organic positions. So if you want to move up by one spot (e.g., Position 5 to Position 4) in Google’s SERP, you need to increase your CTR by 3%. If you want to move up again (e.g., Position 4 to Position 3), you’ll need to increase your CTR by another 3%. If your pages fall below the expected organic search CTR, then your pages will appear in lower organic SERP positions. Basically, if your page fails to beat the expected click-through rate for a given position, it’s unlikely your page will appear in positions 1–5. You want your pages get as many organic search clicks as possible, right? Attracting more clicks means more traffic to your site, which also tells Google that your page is the best answer for users – it is relevant and awesome. Another thing we discovered was that the weighting of click-through rate is in Google’s organic search ranking algorithms is becoming more important every month this year.       Here I was tracking a group of 1,000 keywords and URLs for the past 5 months. What I found was that the Google algorithm is shifting to increasingly higher CTRs for top-4 organic ranking status. This is what you would expect to see if Google Search were employing a machine learning-based algorithm that reordered listings based on CTR – people would see more of what they were hoping to see at the top, reducing the need to scroll lower down into the SERPs. 3. Your conversion rates increase Increasing your click-through rate will also increase your conversion rates. If you can increase your CTR by 2x then your conversion rate should increase by 50%. That’s why click-through rate is the most important conversion metric (in my opinion). For example, look at this data from one large client’s account: This is just one example. We see this same conversion curve in many accounts. (It’s just difficult to combine multiple accounts into one graph because conversion rates vary depending on factors like the industry and offer.) What’s happening here is that if you can get someone excited to click on your website (via email, ads, organic search listings, or whatever), the excitement carries through to sign-up and purchase.

Free clicks from social Ads Facebook and Twitter don’t have a Quality Score. Well, they do, Facebook just calls it Relevance Score and Twitter calls it Quality Adjusted Bid. Whatever they call their version of Quality Score, having a higher score results in a higher ad impression share for the same budget at a lower cost per engagement. A high engagement rate means your ads will be more visible and more cost effective, as shown here: Notice how the cost per engagement on Twitter Ads falls dramatically as the engagement rate of the post you’re promoting rises. One of the surprising benefits of having high engagement on Facebook and Twitter is that you’ll benefit from free clicks. How? On Facebook, if someone shares one of your boosted posts, that will show up in another person’s news feed and you won’t get charged for any of the additional engagements that happen there. On Twitter, if you do a Promoted Tweet, when one of your followers retweets or shares it, you’ll get more totally free organic impressions. 5. People will actually see your emails Now let’s talk about email marketing. How many emails do you get each day? Dozens? Hundreds? If you engage with the emails that brands and businesses regularly send to you, you’ll continue to see them. If not, it might get filed away in Outlook’s Clutter folder or it may be relegated to Gmail’s Promotions tab – or even worse, the Spam folder. Microsoft Outlook’s clutter filter regularly filter emails I’ve opted into receiving – including internal emails from my own company! These emails are being filtered out based on machine learning. What does this mean for your company? If your emails have a higher CTR (though for emails the better equivalent is actually higher open rate), then it’s more likely that your emails will actually get seen, opened, and clicked on. If your click-through rates are terrible, your emails will be rounded up and thrown in the dark “clutter dungeon.” One thing we did was to delete people from our email lists who were unresponsive. If you’re just accumulating emails over many years, why? Do you think someone who has been dormant and never engaged with your emails is going to magically turn into a sale 5 years later? Deleting half your database is one way to instantly more than double your CTR. Email providers will notice that more people are engaging, making it less likely your emails will end up in the dungeon.

PERSONAL TECH BIZ TECH FUTURE TECH SCIENCE LIFE TECH TV Advertisement hot newsNES Classic Edition: Nintendo Will Restock for the Holiday Season, Where to Buy it Follow Us Home PERSONAL TECH Software & Apps Google Announces 'YouTube Go' App for Offline Video Streaming and Sharing By Angel Soleil, | September 27, 2016 Google has launched its "YouTube Go" app in India. "YouTube Go" is a new app launched by Google in Delhi which enables mobile users to stream videos in areas with limited or no connectivity at all. The app is part of the "Next Billion" program which aims to connect India's next billion people to the internet. Like Us on Facebook Google CEO Sundar Pichai wrote in The Economic Daily that "[in] an increasingly mobile-first world, India gives us early insights into the future of the Internet." India is one of the countries that suffer from data constraints due to slow or limited internet connectivity, and "YouTube Go" is designed to address the issue, at least in terms of video streaming. By default, streaming a video online could be near to impossible with a network as slow as 2G, but Google promises that the features offered by the app can reach devices even if it seems to be off-limits. First of all, "YouTube Go" offers users with video recommendations on the home screen based on what is trending and popular. A video preview is then loaded with a choice to select the video resolution and identify the file size to help users decide if they would opt to watch the video or download save it for offline viewing. The app also allows video sharing via Bluetooth, to save users the hassle of needing the internet. Users in India can now sign up to test "YouTube Go," but Google has not made a formal announcement about when the app will be rolled out, or if it plans to make it accessible across the globe.

About Us Contact HOME Financials Technology Consumer Discretionary Healthcare Energy Gaming Search Technology Here Are The Biggest Announcements Expected From Alphabet Inc's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) October Event Published By Blake Audett at September 28, 2016 11:43 am Over the course of 2016, there have been countless speculations and reports regarding Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) upcoming projects. Unfortunately, Google has consistently remained very secretive about its future projects which have made it tough to accurately predict what the US-based tech giant’s next generation of devices will be all about. However, the company is all geared up to host its October event, where it is highly tipped to shed some light regarding the popular rumors that have been circulating the tech world. Here is a quick review of all the biggest announcements expected from Google during its upcoming event. Pixel Smartphones: There has been significant speculation and reports from reliable sources regarding Google’s next generation smartphone devices. The highly anticipated Google Pixel and Pixel XL are expected to officially take over the mantle from the current line of Nexus smartphone devices. Interestingly, in an attempt to make its upcoming devices more ‘Google,' the tech giant will replace the naming strategy of its upcoming smartphones from Nexus to Pixel. Also, it is rumored that the upcoming Google Pixel smartphones will incorporate welcome upgrades compared to the current Nexus phones. It is highly likely that HTC will once again be responsible for manufacturing Google’s upcoming smartphone devices. Chromecast Ultra: Even though images of the next generation Chromecast have been leaked online, it is yet to be confirmed when Google intends to launch the device officially. As things stand, the tech giant is tipped to officially unveil its Chromecast Ultra during the upcoming October event. Popular rumors suggest that the upcoming Chromecast Ultra will feature 4K enhancements which will make it much superior to its predecessor. This would explain why earlier speculation has tipped the upcoming Chromecast Ultra to retail for more than twice the price tag of the current generation Chromecast Ultra. Google Home: Not to be outdone by Amazon and its Echo smart speakers, Google is one of the numerous tech companies set to introduce its own smart speaker devices. The tech giant has already announced during its recent I/O Event that it intends to release a smart speaker system before the end of the year. There is no doubting that Amazon Echo currently dominates the smart speaker market but that could potentially change after Google introduces its Alexa powered Echo competitor. Project Daydream: Google confirmed during its I/O Event that it was developing its next generation virtual reality headset called Google Daydream which is expected to be officially unveiled during the tech giant’s upcoming October event. It is widely accepted that a host of tech companies are currently developing their own VR headsets, so Google can attain a head start over its rivals by announcing its Project Daydream on October 04.

Vine Report HOME U.S. SCIENCE/HEALTH WORLD ENTERTAINMENT TECH LIFE&STYLE Subscriptions Home TECH Google Nexus 7 2016 release date, specs rumors: Tablet to be unveiled on Oct. 4, available to purchase by Oct. 20? Jenah Paclibar Sep 28, 2016 4:34 AM Like Us Share on Facebook Share on Twitter (REUTERS/Mark Blinch)Google (pictured) is rumored to launch its next-generation devices on Oct. 4. The upcoming next-generation device from Google dubbed Nexus 7 is believed to be rebranded under the Pixel series and tipped to be launched during the company's upcoming event on Oct. 4. According to reports, the next-generation tablet may carry the moniker Pixel 7 and may be unveiled alongside Google's new smartphones, the Pixel and Pixel XL, during the press conference taking place in San Francisco on the said date. It will start at 9 a.m. PT/12 p.m. ET and will be streamed live on YouTube. Although it may be presented during the first week of the month, the gadgets will apparently be available to purchase starting Oct. 21. The tech giant is believed to have partnered up with Huawei for mass production of the tablet and it isn't the first time the two companies collaborated with each other. When it comes to specifications, the tablet is deemed to be powered by a Qualcomm Snapdragon chipset although the specific version remains to be seen. It may also be combined with 4 GB of random access memory (RAM) and 64 GB of internal memory for the base model. The storage is said to be expandable up to 2 TB via a microSD card slot. Moreover, other purported features include a 13-megapixel primary camera and 5-megapixel front-facing lens. It may also run on Google's latest operating system, Android Nougat packed with energy-saving applications such as Doze. It may also have support for Google's virtual reality (VR) platform Daydream, and may have a starting price of $258. On a related note, Pixel and Pixel XL will apparently be equipped with 4 GB of RAM, 32 GB of base internal memory and up to 128 GB of built-in storage, a 12-megapixel rear-facing camera and an 8-megapixel selfie-shooting lens. Both will also run on Android 7.1 Nougat integrated with the tech giant's own user interface. However, since there is no official announcement from Google yet, available information should be taken with a grain of salt.

Gulte Home Movie News Political News Photos Movie Reviews Box Office Advertise Telugu You are here: Home Google's first laptop - Get More Details Here September 28th, 2016, 04:00 PM IST Going by latest set of reports, Technology giant Google is gearing up to launch its first laptop within few months. The hardware is likely to run on Google's newest operating system 'Andromeda', a hybrid OS which merges the major features of Android and Google chrome. Internally termed as 'Bison', the ultra thin pixel 3 laptop will come with a 12.3 display and completely supports tablet mode too. Bison is speculated to be powered by either Intel core M5 or Core i5 processor wherein it'll be supplemented by 8GB and 16GB RAM for 32GB and 128GB hard disks respectively. With 10mm thickness and finger print scanner, the price of this Google's hardware may start from 799$. Reportedly, the Andromeda OS is also coming in a Huawei-made Nexus tablet which would likely hit the markets by end of this year or early 2017. Being named as Huawei 7P, Google's tablet comes with 7 inch display and 4GB RAM. Andromeda OS, being the mix bag of Chrome and Android, is something to looking forward for and it'll first be introduced in all Nexus-tablets. Google, which recently launched a counterpart to WhatsApp in the form of Allo, is considering to target Apple's MacBook with 'Bison'. Also, the company is planning to release its pixel smartphone at an official event next week.

Just when we were all starting to think the Silicon Valley giants were only in it for the cash, Google has shown its caring side by offering data starved Indians reason to hope. Connectivity within the country has traditionally been poor and data plans offered to customers less than ideal. Google is seizing this opportunity to show just how big its heart is by launching pre-loading features for YouTube, more free wifi spots, as well as the Hindu version of Allo. Aren’t those Googlers nice chaps. “The growth of the Internet has been explosive in India,” the company said in a blog. “Every second, three more Indians come online for the first time — that’s over 10,000 people every hour. But this latest wave of Internet users still has significant barriers to getting the most out of the Internet: low-powered phones, 2G connections, and very little data.  So today at our second Google for India event, we announced several new Google products, platforms and access programs to deepen India’s participation in the Internet.” The team will begin testing of YouTube Go, new mobile app built to tackle the access and affordability challenges of the Indian market. The app will allow customers to preload videos and play in ‘various connectivity situations’ as the company claims, which one can only assume is a polite way of saying when ‘ur totes owt of signal fam’. The feature is being tested only in India for the moment though there are plans to roll out worldwide in the future. The team also plan to localise the newly launched Allo to the India market by introducing Hindi to the messaging app. Another area being expanded in the country is the public wifi initiative. Launched last September in partnership with Indian Railways and RailTel, the initiative plans to provide free Wifi at 400 train stations throughout the country. The team currently provide Wifi access at 50 stations, claiming 15,000 Indians come online each day through these stations. Building on this initiative, the team has just unveiled a new project called Google Station, which gives partners tools to roll-out wifi hotspots in public places, including malls, bus stops, city centres, and cafes. The team are currently looking for new partners and plan to extend the coverage of the project throughout India. India is one of the world’s fastest growing economies, and more importantly for companies such as Google is the wealth is being distributed through to a fast growing middle-class. Connecting the Indian people to the internet is a very noble gesture by the team, and I’m sure we’ll hear in the quarterly announcement how much it cost Google, but it doesn’t matter, because that’s how much Google cares about connecting the world. Not to mentioned the extra couple of billion which the team may collect through advertising revenues. But Google could be building momentum for another play in the Indian market which could demonstrate the connectivity crusade the team has embarked is not just a crude effort for advertising revenues. The company’s MVNO, Google Fi, currently only operates in North America. The US market is prime for Google Fi, as the USP for the offering is its automatic link to open wifi connections. Users pay a small amount for texts and voice calls and the Google engineers have created a clever algorithm which detects, and automatically connects to, open wifi connections to allow messages and calls to take place over the internet. In these circumstances, calls and messages are effectively free. It’s a clever idea, and potentially very disruptive. Connectivity is paramount, which has been a barrier to entry for Google Fi into the Indian market. The success of Google Station could reap substantial rewards far beyond advertising revenues. It could position Google as a major player in the MVNO sector. Alongside these developments, Jio has been causing quite a stir in the industry. The operator, owned by Mukesh Ambani, one of India’s richest men, is in the process of building a vast 4G network which will cover the majority of the country. Jio has not been making many friends in India as competitors have questions why it has been given a nationwide license when they have struggled to obtain one after years of lobbying. Jio is basically giving everything away for free as well, which is great for the consumers but not so much for the telcos. If Jio succeeds in delivering the 4G network across India, this could make some of the features Google has delivered for the connectivity-starved Indian consumers less compelling. However, if the Google Fi team are able to snuggle up next to Jio and become one of its MVNO partners this could be a useful move. Google has not indicated its MVNO proposition will enter into the Indian market to date, though there could be an opportunity for disruption, and the Google team does like a good old bit of disruption. In any case, whether it is because of the goodness of Google execs or flashing dollars signs, the internet giant is set to stomp its sizable footprint on the Indian nation.

Looking at the issues people face and the lengths people go to in order to view videos on YouTube, international tech giant, Google has come up with Youtube Go, inspired by India. Google will be launching Youtube Go next year in India. Google had earlier launch YouTube Offline in the country that was very popular among the users. For the new product, YouTube Go, Google has mainly worked on four important aspects connectivity, cost, relatable and social. Here’s how the product works and why it makes sense for India. In terms of connectivity, it is designed to work in areas with low or no connectivity. Users can choose whether they want to view the videos on Youtube Go in low and standard resolution. With the new product that is designed for India, users can also save videos for later on YouTube Go and share the downloaded videos with just one click. In order to make the product reach all across the country, Google will also make YouTube Go available in 10 different Indic languages. The page is going to be a lot simpler with just 10 videos on the home page. YouTubers can go on YoutubeGo.com/signup and experience the product. YouTube Go is inspired by India but it will be made available across many markets for Google. The product does touch on many key issues YouTube users face in India starting from poor connectivity to high data cost to language barriers.

M Friday, Nov 18 2016 | Updated at 09:11 AM EST Stay Connected With Us F T R Opinion Academics Students Special Reports Sports Finance Tech Career College Video Sep 28, 2016 10:28 AM EDT By Vinay Patel, UniversityHerald Reporter Huawei Nexus 7 Release Date, Specs, Features & Rumors: Google Gearing Up To Launch Andromeda On Huawei-Made Nexus Tablet & Pixel Laptop? Huawei Nexus 7 Likely To Run Google's New OS Dubbed, Andromeda? (Photo : Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) It looks like Huawei is somehow still working in collaboration with Google on the Nexus project, which reportedly is turning into the "Pixel" project as Google's purported flagship smartphones will be launched under the Pixel moniker. Rampant rumors have previously hinted that Huawei is indeed working on an unrevealed smartphone, but also likely a 7 inch next-gen Nexus 7 model or similar (conceivably under the Pixel 7 brand). Moreover, if recently surfaced rumors are anything to go by, Google is gearing up to announce a new hybrid OS which combines Android and Chrome OS features together. Dubbed as Andromeda, the new OS is slated to land aboard a Pixel 3 laptop late next year. If rumors proved to be true, the Andromeda software could be first rolled out on a different device, most likely a 7 inch Huawei-made tablet. In other words, the search-engine giant is gearing up to launch its impending Andromeda Android/Chrome OS hybrid on a couple of devices including a Huawei Nexus tablet and a purported convertible laptop, 9To5Google reported. The latter device was recently reported on by Android Police, and now several publications including KnowYourMobile are independently confirming that the device is indeed in the works. Multiple sources for the aforesaid publication confirm that a Huawei Nexus is also in the offing. Currently branded internally as Huawei Nexus 7, there's hearsay that the Chinese tech firm was originally roped to develop a new Nexus 7 running on Android OS, which has since shifted to being developed bearing Andromeda in mind. There's a possibility that the branding will catch up towards release and will be unveiled as a Pixel device. Nevertheless, this does seem to be the same Huawei Nexus 7 device that has been leaked earlier. Apparently, there are enough evidences that confirm this device being the same Huawei-made Google tablet that popular tipster Evan Blass tweeted about not too long ago, and possibly related to the trademark filings that surfaced online back in April. Rampant rumors claim that devices capable of running Android OS may also be capable of running Andromeda, as reportedly Andromeda is being tested on the Nexus 9 internally. Meanwhile, Google continues to remain mum regarding the 7 inch Huawei-made tablet's release date, specs and other details; however, rumors are rife about the purported slab launching before the Pixel 3 laptop which is slated to hit the store shelves in Q3 2017. If previously leaked spec details are indeed correct, the device would need to be released sooner rather than later in bid to not become outdated.

Pixel 3 First Device To Get OS? 28 September 2016, 7:50 am EDT By C. de Lacy Mobile & Apps Google Chromebook Pixel (2015)  ( Google Store | Mobile & Apps ) The much-talked about merger between Android and Chrome, two different operating systems from Google, could be happening sooner than expected. Would it be first introduced with the Pixel 3? Advertisement It has been talked about for the longest time now, but as Computer World reported, things could be a bit more interesting this time. In fact, with the recent statement from Google Android and Chrome chief Hiroshi Lockheimer, it may be safe to assume that something extremely surprising will happen soon. Based from his announcement, the first version of Android was founded eight years ago. He foresees that people will remember October 4, 2016 eight years from now as well. This is where "Andromeda" talk kicks in. For some time now, a number of websites have already tracked Andromeda's existence by sifting through Google's open source Android code. What makes this even more interesting is that there are details regarding the Pixel 3 handset, which is planned for a 2017 release. To further solidify the chances of Andromeda happening, even 9to5Google's report stated that Huawei is already in the works on something that would support hybrid Android-Chrome operating system. In a 41-minute long podcast, JR Raphael had a chance to have a chat with Lockheimer himself regarding the news about the Andromeda. Advertisement For some, it may initially make no sense integrating Chrome to Android as there isn't much that the Chrome can do that the Android can't. This could be wrong because the operating systems serve different purposes and feels different, especially if viewed as a desktop and a mobile OS. Another point to look at are the rumors regarding the new Pixel phone, which many believe to be getting a $650 price tag. After what have been with the Nexus 6 way back 2014, Google went back to budget-friendly handsets as the company don't really earn through selling hardware. The $650 price tag may hint something more than just Google trying to test the waters again with high-priced models. Something like an inclusion of an entirely new operating system. Also, judging from the video above, the Google search bar transforms to some sort of shape that represents a phone, but before that happens, it first formed a shape something similar to a tablet or a laptop. It may not be what Google is trying to tell people, but a lot of theories and communities says otherwise. Perhaps, we'll be hearing about Andromeda or something hybrid soon enough. © 2015 - 2016Mobile & Apps, All rights reserved. Do not reproduce without permission.

November 17, 2016 in News // Fuel Your App-etite November 17, 2016 in News // The Emoji Takeover Oh Snap: Snapchat Rebrands, Unveils Spectacles Posted on September 28, 2016 in A&E, Technology, Uncategorized By SELENE SAN FELICE Snapchat rules our generation. If this isn’t obvious from the millennials you see taking dog-face selfies and swiping for geotags everywhere you go, it’s about to be. On Sept. 23 Snapchat’s chief strategy officer Imran Khan announced the company is rebranding to Snap Inc., as they’ve become “bigger than just one app.” To further this point Khan revealed Snap’s newest creation, Spectacles. For $129 a pop, Spectacle users can record up to 10 seconds of circular video from a first person vantage point that they then upload to Snapchat via Wifi or Bluetooth. Pushing a button on the hinge activates the 115 degree angle lens, which is larger than the typical smartphones. The glasses will be available this fall in black, teal or coral. Why spend so much to take circular videos when rectangular ones have always been free? To start, Khan says the Spectacles’ shape and position offer the closest recreation of the human perspective. Rectangular photos that we see and capture with our phones are meant to mimic printing, and that’s so over. Spectacles are also hands-free, allowing the user to participate more in the photo-sharing experience. You can pet your dog while showing everyone how cute it is, hug bae while annoying all your followers and weep into your hands after the glasses slip off your face and get stomped on at Coachella. If you’re getting a sense of déjà vu, you may be thinking of that time way back in 2013 when Google released Glass, one of its few failures. Google Glass(es) also fit snugly on the face and could record first person video, but because of their nerdy appearance and impracticality at the time the product crashed and burned. Production of Glass stopped in early 2015. Snap Spectacles and Google Glass may sound similar, but Spectacles seem to come from a much smarter angle. Part of Google Glass’s downfall was the product’s failed attempt at having an incognito appearance. Using as little material as possible, users were somehow not supposed to be drawing attention to the computer on their face. Consumers also found it creepy that the glasses showed no warning signs of recording to those around the wearer. Snap Spectacles on the other hand, are by no means subtle. Ignoring that they look ominously like an invention straight out of Willy Wonka’s factory, Spectacles are supposed to be cool. The product is being marketed as a “toy” for millennials, and its bright, thick rims are bound to pop up at just about every music festival set this summer. But before you demand Santa put Spectacles in your stocking this Christmas, know they might not be as easily accessible as Google Glass was at first. Snap is testing the waters with a limited release before making the product widely available. “We’re going to take a slow approach to rolling them out,” CEO Evan Spiegel explained at the announcement. “It’s about us figuring out if it fits into people’s lives and seeing how they like it.” The world might not have been ready for Google Glass, but now that constantly sharing pictures and videos is the norm, Spectacles have arrived right on time. By 2019 wearables are predicted to be a $25 billion market, according to research firm CCS Insight. Along with Spectacles and their rebrand, Snap also announced Snap to Unlock, a twist on scannable QR codes that should similarly garner success from an old idea. Companies can now advertise with snap codes like those friends use to add each other on the app. Universal Pictures was the first to test this with mysterious billboards for their new movie, Girl on a Train. As it stands alone, Los Angeles based Snapchat is only five years old and has 150 million daily users, 110 million of which come from the U.S.,Canada and Europe, according to Adweek. Whether that many people will be as eager about Spectacles as they were for Snapchat is unclear, and so is the prospect of Spectacles trapping us in our smartphones and using blueberry face filters to turn us into real blueberries. We’ll just have to wait and see. Selene San Felice can be reached at selene.sanfelice@theminaretonline.com Share this: Twitter Facebook Google Like this: Like Loading...

Photo: Google Google is launching a new YouTube Go app that will finally allow users to download videos for offline playback. You’ll be able to choose the quality of the video you save, and the app will tell you exactly how much storage space is required for each clip. Google has long been fighting against YouTube video downloads for obvious reasons, and it comes down hard on third-party apps and tools that provide this option. However, the company recognizes that there’s a genuine need for it in places. YouTube Go is designed for those who live in areas where data coverage is limited. It gives users the option to download videos they know they’re going to want to watch later, and to share videos to friends’ devices locally without using any data.   YouTube Go builds upon the Smart Offline service that Google launched in India back in June. This downloads the latest videos from your favorite channels automatically overnight when your device is connected to Wi-Fi, allowing you to enjoy them throughout the day while offline. “YouTube Go is a brand new app to help the next generation of users share and enjoy videos,” said YouTube product management VP Johanna Wright. “YouTube Go was designed and built from the ground up with insights from India, in order to bring the power of video to mobile users in a way that is more conscious of their data and connectivity, while still being locally relevant and social.” The new app will be tested in India first before a wider rollout. Users can sign up to test the app now, but there’s currently no word on when it will be available in other countries.

   Are You Ready For the Autonomous Vehicle Revolution? by Jeff Cobb September 27, 2016 Tweet Photos Email Print Go Back Print this page Photo Gallery Sorry there are no photos! Hide For many people, fully autonomous cars may seem still off in an uncertain future, but the radical changes they’re projected to bring are approaching. Their ascendancy into the public arena has meanwhile captured the imagination of people for the good they are promised to bring to society, including mobility for the infirm and non-driving elderly, children, and they hold out other positive benefits besides. At the same time, skeptics of the potential solution dangling before our eyes have said be careful what you wish for, as interlaced with ostensible benefits are a host of major shifts in society and the economy projected to accompany vehicles that drive themselves. SEE ALSO: Coalition Forms to Influence NHTSA on Rules for Self-Driving Cars Certainly the technology is being taken seriously, and financial and engineering resources are being devoted by most major automakers, as well as companies that supply carmakers, and aspiring carmakers as well. Ford’s President and CEO Mark Fields has beaten the band that by 2021 a car better looking than what Google is now parading, but similar in that it has no pedals or steering wheel, will be in limited commercial use. The Dearborn automaker has also said it sees eventual mass-produced autonomous cars as bringing changes to our world as profound as its most treasured heritage and point of company pride. Advocates see a self-driving cars as a reduction in the rising death toll. “We believe that the next decade is going to be defined by the automation of the automobile,” said Fields this month at Ford’s headquarters. “In fact we see autonomous vehicles as having as significant an impact on society as Ford’s moving assembly line did more than 100 years ago.” Other companies racing on parallel development paths towards the same as-yet nebulous goal include Tesla, GM, Daimler/Mercedes-Benz, Volvo, Toyota, Lexus, Honda, Acura, Nissan, Infiniti Audi, Porsche, VW, and BMW, Hyundai, Kia, and more. Several of these entities, as well as Google, have publicly stated timelines for varying degrees of autonomous technology more advanced than Tesla’s semi-autonomous Autopilot as soon as a couple years from now, into early next decade. Beyond these, are reportedly Apple, Chinese-backed startups Faraday Future, LeEco,and more. Also, said Michigan-based green car analyst Alan Baum., suppliers working on their own solutions include Delphi, Denso, Continental, Bosch, ZF/TRW, Mobileye, and Velodyne, In short, everyone who is someone in the auto industry, is racing to get you a car that will pilot you unfettered from distractions like steering, accelerating, and braking. Bullish and Bearish Outlooks Headlines have for a few years now reported cars that may drive autonomously in relatively tame situations. There are a few standards of grading the degrees of autonomous drive capability, and a couple in the U.S. are by the National Highway Transportation Administration, and the SAE. These numerically score from a base level of full driver involvement/zero autonomy, to degrees of autonomy up to fully driverless at level 4 for NHTSA, or level 5 meaning the same basic thing by SAE. Perhaps one of the reasons the public is still standing back is that there have been conflicting projections on true driverless tech being ready for general public use without the use of 3D maps, and geofenced areas such as Ford is starting with by 2021. In October 2014, Tesla head Elon Musk estimated that “five or six years from now we will be able to achieve true autonomous driving where you could literally get in the car, go to sleep and wake up at your destination.” Nissan also has projected a timeline of consumer vehicles by decade’s end, with greater progress into next decade. Other bullish statements have come from various companies, but alternately, in an August 2016 report by MIT Technology Review, the takeaway, focusing on Ford, but with broader implications for the industry, was don’t believe the hype. The article quoted an expert with more than 20 years experience working on the technology, Steven Shladover of the University of California, Berkeley, who expressed doubt about unbridled freedom as soon as others have hoped. “It ain’t going to be five years,” said Shladover. “The hype has gotten totally out of sync with reality.” For all the news value a promised car by 2021 without steering wheel and pedals has garnered Ford, Princeton professor and director of its transportation program Alain Kornhauser, said these will be on a strict leash. “By then we may be able to define [a] ‘fenced’ region of space where we can in fact let cars out there without a driver,” he says. “The challenge will be making that fenced-in area large enough so that it provides a valuable service.” Ford has projected vaguely by mid decade fully autonomous cars we all may buy could be for sale, but it as do others politely refer to “challenges” that must first be overcome. Challenges The gee-whiz demonstrations of cars that can pilot around a closed course in clear, dry weather are about the level of a nursery school student still not able to play with the big kids. Autonomous cars may use overlapping technology to present an image to the computer brain for the vehicle to “see” and make decisions in a nano second. Sensors include cameras, sonar, LIDAR, radar, and GPS. To date, things that can baffle self-driving cars include rain, snow, hail, and sleet. Also being able to recognize hand signals is a an obstacle yet to be perfected. Further, not having the ability as of yet to make eye contact with other drivers (or vehicles) present hurdles before the cars are truly off leash. SEE ALSO: Developers Put the Brakes On Their Autonomous Cars’ Future Another hurdle is, say, if a pedestrian walks across the road, and the car is programmed to stop and yield – but instead the pedestrian offers the car the right of way. Who will settle this standoff in congeniality is another challenge among many. Unintended Consequences In the encyclopedia under Unintended Consequences, there are some who’d just as soon put the photo of an autonomus car as a case example. Like a Trojan horse that looks like a phenomenal gift, skeptics have warned about a dark side or at least radical changes coming. Traditional auto writers have been among those who look at them with suspicion, as they do indeed stand to relegate the driver to chief occupant, undermining their passion for driving. Apart from any self-oriented motives, Car and Driver’s Benjamin Preston documents a scenario that even George Orwell did not as clearly define, but one just as concerning. What happens if all the tech hurdles are worked out and fully autonomous cars start to be sold by the thousands, then millions? Driverless cars still will not be infallible, writes Preston, this will also present a target for hackers and other bad actors to co-opt control of a vehicle you trust with your safety. Whether this is likely, there are other changes on the horizon with greater projected possibility of coming true. For example, the loss of jobs is projected. Citing Oxford University’s Oxford Martin School’s Programme on the Impacts of Future Technology, computerization in general stands to cut half of all U.S. jobs in the next 20 years. Looking at computerized self-driving cars, 200,000 taxi drivers plus 3.4 million truck drivers are standing in the way of the driver-free future, says Preston. A 2014 video by Daimler AG however addresses this concern, saying its Future Truck 2025 would not replace the driver, but concerns remain. Looking at such things as a positive, voices from the industry development side have observed that autonomous cars stand to do for driving jobs what robots have done for manufacturing jobs – displacing humans, while big businesses profit. “If you were to take the ride service model, the most expensive thing in that model is actually the driver,” said Raj Nair, executive vice president for product development, and chief technology officer of autonomous ride sharing cars that cost one-sixth as much per mile to operate as do conventional taxis. “And if you were to automate it – just like a robot were replacing an operator in a factory – automating that, you could reduce the cost per mile to let’s say a buck a mile.” Another mystery is what the emissions impact will be. Preston conjectures a 40-percent decrease in car sales. Others say miles traveled may be higher. “Will self-driving be heaven or hell? Utopia or dystopia?” said Chris Grundler, head of the U.S. EPA’s air-quality and transportation office to Automotive News. “I don’t have the answers. But we’ve certainly concluded there is an environmental public-policy aspect that needs to be considered.” Of course consumers are promised benefit in this scenario, and others, but again, it may not all be as utopian as some imagine. Another kicker for governments, according to research from the Brookings Institute, will be the loss of revenue from parking tickets and speeding and other moving violation citations, as the good citizen autonomous cars will not be scofflaws like their human counterparts. For all the fuss law enforcement might make over infractions against traffic laws, governments count on the law-breaking populace as a form of revenue, and this stands to be eroded. Others might say this is a net positive, but selling new taxes to replace lost revenue streams is never popular, and in any case, is presented as a potential challenge in the next decade or maybe longer. If that is not enough, autonomous cars have also cast a not-so flattering light on humanity. Part of the reason why policymakers and the public are clamoriong for them as of yesterday, say critics in blunt terms, boils down to reasons including laziness, incompetence, and lack of personal accountability. Policymakers have decried a distracted driving “epidemic” as though a new strain of disease has infected society, and the solution, observes Preston, is to relieve drivers of responsibility, not correct their behaviors. Same goes for driver training and expected competence, which once upon a time was the recommended procedure, but instead, we want machines to do it for us. Three modes are promised by Volvo’s Concept 26. Another concern is whether the “freedom” driverless cars afford in due time leads to the removal of the freedom to drive one’s own automobile. Just as the insurance lobby once petitioned Congress for a 55 mph nationwide speed limit, and argued it would save lives and money, so could arguments be brought in time against people driving on public roads. This no doubt is in the back of the mind of auto enthusiasts uneasy about the liberation other see. Volvo’s Concept 26 is a prime example, in which the driver may switch attention from road, seat pushes back away from the controls, and a 25-inch screen comes into view in place of the front windscreen. Here in “Relax” mode, the car of the future can let the comfortable worker use his or her commute time to get started on the work day for the boss, or one may just kick back and watch some content, or otherwise use the time. “As driverless vehicles take root, futurists see autonomy reshaping the country as completely as did the automobile itself,” writes Preston. Citing the director of equity research at Barclays Capital, Brian Johnson, it’s believed that shared ownership of future vehicles could displace privately owned cars. These and other shifts may come along with the most profound technology since the moving assembly line, as Ford says, or automobile itself according to other pundits. Ethics Ethical concerns transcend minor offenses like Mercedes-Benz or Tesla overstating implicit capabilities of present day semi-autonomous cars. Life and death decisions such as society has not yet had to accept could be delegated to our vehicles assuming the futurists’ wildest dreams come true. That a dialogue needs to happen soon if not now has been the not-well-heard refrain of numerous groups, including consumer watchdogs such as the Consumer Federation of America and Consumer Reports. Knowing that the discussion needs to take place, even automakers like Ford have said from the top the public has been too silent on what is predicted to impact the society potentially more than whether Hilary or Donald get elected in November. “I think that’s going to require some very deep and meaningful conversation as a society in terms of how do we want these vehicles to behave, whose lives are they going to save?” said Executive Chairman Bill Ford. “And no one company is going to settle that.” Meanwhile, as the public, policymakers, and the industry are selling the sizzle of autonomous cars, people will have to accept all that comes with them, and this conversation starter barely scratches the surface.

And this week it has made great strides towards fulfilling that promise. ADVERTISEMENT The tech giant has unveiled a slew of new offline features and other products aimed at its second biggest market, India. These features include the new “offline first” YouTube Go app, revealed at a “Google for India” event in New Delhi. Google also announced its free public Wi-Fi Google Station, a Hindi version of Google Assistant available through Allo (by the end of the year) and, perhaps most importantly, a series of measures designed to allow for more offline or low-bandwidth usage of its services. Read more Google is helping Full Fact create an automated, real-time fact-checker Google is helping Full Fact create an automated, real-time fact-checker By Matt Burgess The latter includes: a Chrome for Android update that enables whole webpages to be downloaded; a Play Store update that has a preview mode and is optimised for 2G networks; and the launch of YouTube Go. The video app was built specifically with the Indian market in mind and will work well on low-bandwidth, allow for sharing, and function in ten local languages. It’s now being rolled out, but will be fully launched in early 2017. In a blogpost, YouTube VP of product marketing Johanna Wright spoke about how she travelled to India and saw the same thing wherever she went - users struggling to make the most of YouTube and other services because of the poor connection. “We’ve always believed that connectivity should not be a barrier to watching YouTube,” Wright said. “In 2014 we launched YouTube Offline so you could watch videos without suffering from buffering. A few months ago we rolled out Smart Offline, a feature that allows you to schedule videos to be saved offline later at off-peak times, when there’s more bandwidth so data is faster and cheaper.” ADVERTISEMENT Read more You can now play a Pictionary-style game called Quick Draw against Google's AI You can now play a Pictionary-style game called Quick Draw against Google's AI By Matt Burgess She goes on to explain that Google realised it would have to “reimagine” the YouTube app from “the ground up” if it was to make a real impact in markets like India. The YouTube team tested prototypes in 15 cities before YouTube Go was born. “The app is designed to be offline first and work even when there’s low or no connectivity. It’s also cost-effective, providing transparency and reducing data usage. And finally, it’s a social experience, connecting you with the people and content you care about.” New functions like a preview mode allow for data saving by letting users get a glimpse of a video before they decide to save or play it. Users can also choose their resolution and tailor how much data they want to spend watching a particular video. YouTube Go could get a wider release in the future. Although it’s tailored to the Indian marketplace, other data-saving product features like the popular Google Maps offline were originally built for India. Google Station is also a huge part of the search giant’s push to get more people in India online. So far it has been trialled across the country but it will now expand, and partnerships with other busy hubs beyond stations could be in the works, reports the Verge. ADVERTISEMENT John Giannandrea, Google’s Senior VP of search, also spoke at the Google for India event about the effort the search engine has made to improve its Indian-language options. “Google is now capable of translating 100 languages and 12 of these are Indic,” the Indian Express reports him as saying. This week’s announcement coincides with the publication of an academic study describing an algorithm based on deep learning, which will power Google Translate going forward. The Google Neural Machine Translation system (GNMT) “can still make significant errors that a human translator would never make” the research scientists from the Google Brain Team said. But, they claim, the system reduces Google Translate errors by 60 per cent and is still a “significant milestone”.

It did this by introducing a beta version of Google Play for two laptops - Acer Chromebook R11 and Asus Chromebook Flip. Notably, the Chromebook Pixel (2015) was due to get it soon, and, that day has come. Chrome OS stable channel version 53.0.2785.129 was released last week for the Acer and Asus laptops, and now, the same version has been released for the Chromebook Pixel (2015), bringing the same Google Play beta support. Google has quietly updated its release page to include the third laptop. The news was brought to public attention when a Reddit user shared a screenshot of the Android app support and Google Play beta access on the forum. Note, the Chromebook Pixel (2015) is sometimes also referred to as Chomebook Pixel 2.To recall, it was these three laptops that initially had support for support for Android apps and Google Play in the beta channel. It should be noted that Google Play is disabled by default and requires to be manually enabled from Chrome Settings with the latest update. To recall, Google Play made it to the Dev channel of Chrome OS in June and the Beta channel in August. Now it has finally made its way to the stable channel. The v53.0.2785.129 update also brings bug fixes, security updates, and feature enhancements, apart from a kernel version update. For now, it's still not known when Google will bring Android app support and Google Play access to all other eligible Chrome OS machines.

Google Maps Version 9.38 Brings Upcoming Events Tab It also comes with a new album filled with pictures of food Sep 28, 2016 11:56 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Google Maps is one of the most popular navigation apps out there, with plenty of features for getting around by car or public transportation, and the company has just released a new beta version for Maps with some cool features. Google's new Maps v9.38 comes with fewer features compared to previous releases, but it does add a new tab with a list of upcoming events, bookings and reservations, according to Android Police. The tab is located in the “Your places” section and is entitled “Upcoming”. There aren't many details on the feature right now, but more will be disclosed when it goes live. The upcoming events tab gets information from Calendar and Gmail apps, depending on the accounts that are linked to the Android smartphone. The new beta version comes with another neat feature, an album for pictures of food. Obviously, Instagram comes to mind when referring to pictures of food, but the album will have a very useful functionality on Google Maps. Google added photos of food for each restaurant so that users would know what to expect to find in a specific place, without having to go through the menu online. It's a good way to get an idea of the specific food that a restaurant serves, and when tapping an image, the app opens a list of dishes found in the menu. The APK for the beta version is available on APK Mirror. Recently, Google added speed limits during navigation to the Maps app, so that users would know the legal speed limit in certain areas they go through and get an accurate estimation on the ETA.   CHECK OUT THE GALLERY  (3 Images) #Google#Google Maps#Android#Upcoming events tab#Pictures of food album reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Google Maps v9.38 (3 Images) 01 02 03 Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Google Maps Now Shows Speed Limits During Navigation Google Risks $7.4 Billion Fine for Violating Antitrust Regulations in the EU Google Maps Gets Updated with Catching Pokemon Option Russia Fines Google $6.75 Million over Pre-Installed Android Apps Microsoft Replaces Command Prompt with PowerShell in Latest Windows 10 Build Microsoft Can’t Kill Linux Right Now, The Linux Foundation Director Says iPhone 6 and 6 Plus “Touch Disease” Repairs Cost $149, Apple Says German Police Considering Move to Windows Phones to Fight Traffic Jams The LG V20 Has Been Successfully Rooted Galaxy S6 and S7 Owners Complain About Samsung’s Stock Email App Facebook Is Testing a New Snapchat-like Camera Feature Google Adds Stranger Things Stickers to Allo, New Themes to Arrive Soon 3 photos    New photos for restaurants in Google Maps New Android APKs Google Spotlight Stories APK: Updated November 18th, 13:53 GMT YouTube Kids APK: Updated November 18th, 13:49 GMT WB Movies All Access APK: Updated November 18th, 13:29 GMT WWE SuperCard APK: Updated November 18th, 13:21 GMT The Guardian APK: Updated November 18th, 12:57 GMT Apple Music APK: Updated November 18th, 12:48 GMT Picturesque Lock Screen APK: Updated November 18th, 12:37 GMT Reader comments Samsung Galaxy S7 Explodes in Man's Hands, Causes Him Second-Degree Burns more on: Samsung Galaxy Note 7 i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2016 Softpedia.

Analysts say the one-day availability fits into Google's strategy of trying to correct past missteps as it prepares for a widespread launch. Lily Jamali reports. ▲ Hide Transcript ▶ View Transcript No one said getting a pair of Google Glasses would be cheap. They're 15-00 bucks. But on Tuesday, for one day, anyone in the U.S. willing to plunk down the cash could buy a pair off Google's website. Mashable's Chief Correspondent Lance Ulanoff says the sale comes at a critical moment for Glass, which so far has only been available to a small group of developers and other so-called "Glass Explorers". So why limit the sale to just one day? SOUNDBITE: LANCE ULANOFF, CHIEF CORRESPONDENT/EDITOR-AT-LARGE, MASHABLE (ENGLISH) SAYING: "It generates some excitement. Right now, Google Glass is a really esoteric device that some people have seen, they've heard about it. They haven't had a chance to touch it. They're starting to misunderstand it. I think that's Google big concern." Since it was first unveiled to the public in 2012, Glass has also been plagued by concerns about privacy. That prompted the release of its Glass etiquette guide earlier this year - complete with rules like "Ask for permission" and "Don't be creepy or rude... aka a 'glasshole'". Ulanoff says by broadening the product's user base, even if ever so slightly, Tuesday's sale allows Google to hit the reset button. SOUNDBITE: LANCE ULANOFF, CHIEF CORRESPONDENT/EDITOR-AT-LARGE, MASHABLE (ENGLISH) SAYING: "They really want people in professions and walks of life where maybe they can give people the perspective to someone else that can be useful. It can help other people for training or to tell a story. I think that's what they're looking for. I've run into a lot of people who haven't had access to it before." The company is expected to roll out Glass to the public later this year. It's already forged relationships with the world's largest eyeglass manufacturer Luxottica and the vision insurance provider VSP. IDC research analyst Ramon Llamas says this one-day sale is part of prolonged beta testing, which gives Google time to understand what the consumer wants. SOUNDBITE: RAMON LLAMAS, RESEARCH ANALYST, IDC (ENGLISH) SAYING: "Reaching out to some of the other companies, VSP, Luxottica, to put together a different kind of hardware and different kinds of looks - I think Google is taking not a one-size-fits-all but multiple sizes and multiple styles are going to be more suitable for more people." Llamas expects shipments of wearables to reach about 20 million units by the end of the year. He says Glass is good for all wearables. SOUNDBITE: RAMON LLAMAS, RESEARCH ANALYST, IDC (ENGLISH) SAYING: "I think if anything, at the very least this is going to keep wearables in the common conversation. We already have things like fit bits, Nike fuel bands and jawbone. You got smart watches that go on your other wrist and clip on, what have you. And this is going to help draw attention to that entire category." But some analysts say while the publicity is good, the high cost might still be prohibitive. And they expect Google Glass could go for half its current 15-00 dollar price tag before it hits store shelves.

Industry SEO 28 Sep 16 | Christopher Ratcliff Facebook0 Linkedin346 Google+44 Twitter 390 As you’re no doubt aware, Google finally rolled out its Google 4.0 algorithm update at the end of last week. Penguin is now part of Google’s core algorithm, penalising websites that use various black-hat link schemes to manipulate search rankings. Other important changes include: Penguin data is refreshed in real time, so any changes will be made as soon as the affected page has been recrawled and reindexed. Penguin now devalues spam by adjusting ranking of the offending page, rather than affecting the whole site. So how do these changes affect actual SEO practitioners? I asked a panel of experts and SEW contributors their views on Penguin 4.0, including: Gerald Murphy, Client Service Manager at EMEA at BrightEdge Kevin Gibbons, Managing Director at Blue Glass Nikolay Stoyanov, freelance SEO consultant at niksto.com Do you think the new version of Penguin is fairer? Do you think it’s an adequate deterrent when it comes to spammy link-building? Kevin Gibbons: Yes, being realtime helps to set expectations as you won’t have to wait weeks or months for the next algorithm refresh to assess your link removals. Of course Google’s algorithm is always a moving target – but it is becoming harder to be manipulated at scale. In some verticals it can even be a game of whoever doesn’t have the worst backlinks might win. Perhaps having a new domain with no link reputation isn’t a bad starting point any more! Gerald Murphy: I think the algorithm is fairer. Think about it, you will be awarded for great content, instantly. I also think that, with the rise of AI, Google will soon be able to understand links more. A flower shop on Valentines Day, for example, will get away with more spam-like links but this won’t be the case in September. As links will be linked with behaviours. Nikolay Stoyanov: Yes, I think that the real-time version of the Penguin algorithm will be fairer and will play a very positive role for the whole SEO community. Google Penguin is now a part of the core algorithm and every change (either a negative or positive one) will happen very quickly (maybe not instantly but on a daily or weekly basis). After more than 700 days of waiting we can finally rest assured that whatever SEO mistakes we make we will be able to quickly fix afterwards. This works both ways though. If we use some gray or black hat techniques Google will be able to catch us very quickly and punish us for not following its rules. So this is a double-edged sword. Another great change with Penguin 4.0 is the fact that it became more “granular”. This means that whatever penalties hit our sites from now on they will impact separate pages on the site and not the whole domain in general. I believe that this will be a positive thing as it will give us a better chance to fix those penalized pages and to learn from our mistakes without losing a huge amount of our organic traffic (like before). Ideally, the latest Penguin update will benefit white hat SEO experts like myself and will help us take our SEO to the next level. Same goes with end users who will get better results to answer their search intent properly. Conversely, black hat techniques (especially PBNs) will slowly become obsolete and will eventually stop working which is the ultimate goal. Have you experienced any affect from the Penguin update? Kevin Gibbons: None of our clients have seen any negative shifts in organic traffic. However, in the past we have noticed trends of referral traffic dropping as a knock-on effect from blogs/forums/publishers that have been penalised and as a result of them having less traffic, there are fewer outbound link clicks. The data we have so far is too early to highlight a trend, but it’s certainly one to keep a close eye on… Nikolay Stoyanov: No, I haven’t seen any change on my site or my clients’ sites since Penguin 4.0 was launched. I guess it’s because I’m playing by the rules but also because it’s not been entirely rolled out yet. It’s way too soon to jump to conclusions. How can webmasters best avoid the risk of being affected by Penguin? Kevin Gibbons: Focus on building a brand, not links. If your activity is just for link building, it will leave an SEO footprint. No-one wants that. Aim to tell your story via content, data-driven analysis and knowledge – and amplify to a targeted audience via multiple channels; social media, paid search, digital PR etc… Also monitor the links you have and audit these on a frequent basis. If you’re in a competitive industry, you may have to actively disavow negative links that have been built to your site that someone else has built! Gerald Murphy: Data analysis is even more important to SEO. This most effecient way to analyse this update is to breakdown links by category, sub category, and page level, and then compare this with data, such as, visits, average blended rank, and revenue, for example. Nikolay Stoyanov: Forget about shortcuts in SEO! There aren’t any. The only way to stay on the safe side and secure your brand, visitors and sales is if you do white hat SEO. Write well researched and useful content and build quality links to it. That’s it! Nothing’s changed. Hopefully with the real-time Penguin that’s exactly what’s going to happen. Maybe not at once but eventually. With Hummingbird and RankBrain we’re already seeing lots of positive changes in the SERPs from content perspective. Now’s the time to see the same when it comes to link building.

Kevin Gibbons: The update doesn’t change our process, the only thing it might do is re-affirm the message we have been on the right track by focusing on quality. We’re just hoping it catches some of our clients competitors out! Nikolay Stoyanov: I wouldn’t say that Penguin 4.0 will change my work routine in any way. But I am pretty sure that there will be a much higher demand for quality link building services in the upcoming years due to this huge change in the SEO world. Hopefully, more and more webmasters will start playing by the rules as they should be same for everyone. That’s fair! Gerald Murphy: It won’t. What future algorithm changes do you wish to see? Is there anything Google is ignoring? Kevin Gibbons: There’s always been a gap between what Google says it’s algorithm does and what it actually does. Over recent years they’ve done a much better job at closing these, and most of the tactics that do work are often very short-term, which is enough to keep most brands away from them. I would expect them to be looking at things such as: Spammy link building at high velocity, which can still rewarded by Google. Ecommerce site cloning can be a pain point, where Google starts to rank the phishing/fake site organically with the clients own content. Redirected domains into sites/pages/new domains – some can be for legitimate reasons (re-brands/acquisitions) – but others are purely for short-term SEO boosts. Mass content production, with many companies pumping out X amount of articles a day/week trying to show ‘freshness’ of content but not putting enough effort/resource into the quality of content. Long-term you’d expect panda to go against them, but short term it can work better than expected. Gerald Murphy: AI integration with links to get a deeper analysis of behaviour, such as, seasonality and maybe even social media signals. Remember mobile is going to kill links because of our behaviour. Name me a user, sitting in the front room on their tablet or smartphone, reading another great blog who creates a HTML link. This is not in our behaviour. Nikolay Stoyanov: I want to see all the black hat and grey hat methods dead. Starting with PBNs. I still see multiple sites ranking in top 5 or higher with low quality or PBN links that I can smell from a mile away. It’s high time that Google Penguin starts penalizing these websites like they deserve.

The company is sending out invites to their October 4th event to non-press folks who just happen to be big fans of the big G. One of our very own received an invite to the event in his Twitter DMs, with Google expressing the following: Hi Chris, We love that you love Google, and on October 4th we’re going to introduce something new for you to love (youtu.be/aNnCtmyujLA) at a private event in San Francisco. We’d be honored to have you as our guest. If you’re interested in joining us, please respond to this note and confirm your email address. We’ll then send over the full details. Warm regards, @Google 9to5’s Stephen Hall also received evidence of such happenings, so it sounds like if you happen to be a big fan of Google, Android, or all their things, you might want to keep an eye out on your Twitter DMs. It’s not unheard of for a company to invite fans to events that are intended for press purposes. Samsung regularly does it with their unboxed showcases, and T-Mobile loves having people over for concerts and such. It’d be quite new for Google, though, and if they’re breaking protocol for this October 4th event then the hype that it’s one of their most significant announcements yet certainly seems plausible. local_offer    Google   Auto-load comments: Off On View comments (6) stars Further Reading New Google Live Cases available Google accounts suspended for reselling Pixel phones OnePlus 3T charging proves solid Allo gets themes, emoji suggestions, and more Google and Facebook are challenging bogus websites stars Popular this Weeklaunch 1 more_vertThis may be the Moto X 2017 closeHere’s our first look at the 2017 Moto X The Moto X 2017 may be alive and well as a new image has appeared which shows off the device’s metal body and camera cutout. 2 more_vertZTE wants to step up and fill the Nexus gap closeZTE wants to fill the gap left behind with the end of Nexus devices With the end of the Nexus line, there’s now a void in stock Android devices in the $400 range.

Although they are only ever small, mistranslations do creep in, altering the overall effectiveness of the translation tool. But Google is now hoping to fix this problem, using artificial intelligence.  Scroll down for video The Google Translate tool, which launched ten years ago, has now been updated to use a deep learning model known as neural machine translation. This is a kind of machine learning that takes inspiration from the ways neurons are connected in our brains THE AI IMPROVEMENTS  The Google Translate tool, which launched ten years ago, has now been updated to use a deep learning model known as neural machine translation. This is a kind of machine learning that takes inspiration from the ways neurons are connected in our brains. The Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT) system reduces translation errors by between 55 and 85 per cent, the company says. The Google Translate tool, which launched ten years ago, has now been updated to use a deep learning model known as neural machine translation. This is a kind of machine learning that takes inspiration from the ways neurons are connected in our brains. The Google Neural Machine Translation (GNMT) system reduces translation errors by between 55 and 85 per cent, the company says. 'This … demonstrates like never before the power of neural machine translation,' Yoshua Bengio, a computer scientist at the University of Montreal in Canada, told Science.

Share this article Share 33 shares Data from side-by-side evaluations, where human raters compare the quality of translations for a given source sentence. Scores range from 0 to 6, with 0 meaning 'completely nonsense translation', and 6 meaning 'perfect translation' But the company says there is still work to do.  'Machine translation is by no means solved,' Quoc Le and Mike Schuster, research scientists in the Google Brain Team wrote in a blog post.  'GNMT can still make significant errors that a human translator would never make, like dropping words and mistranslating proper names or rare terms, and translating sentences in isolation rather than considering the context of the paragraph or page.  'There is still a lot of work we can do to serve our users better.  'However, GNMT represents a significant milestone.' WHEN LITTLE DETAILS ARE LOST IN TRANSLATION  English signs and translations are almost a necessity as tourism continues to grow but the difficult task has meant more than a few phrases have been lost in translation. As a result, more than a few humorous signs have been popping up across non-English speaking countries. Whether it’s a fire extinguisher that’s labelled as a ‘hand grenade,’ a bomb sniffing dog wearing a vest labeling him as an ‘explosive dog’ or a sign warning people to ‘slip and fall carefully’, they never fail to impress. Menus appear to take the brunt in failing translations as one meal is labelled as 'Germany sexual harassment', another dish informs you that the meal will consist of 'rotten children' as well as 'fried cat ear.' One translator that appeared to give up on attempting to find an English term for the meal instead chose to inform guests that Google wasn't working but to trust that it was a 'delicious' dish. Google translate appears to have failed miserable translating the names of dishes to include 'cat ear' and a 'rotten child'  The online Encyclopedia 'Wikipedia' appears to be available as an eatable meal on this menu Read more: Google’s new translation software is powered by brainlike artificial intelligence | Science | AAAS Research Blog: A Neural Network for Machine Translation, at Production Scale Share or comment on this article e-mail 33 shares Most watched News videos Autistic boy bursts into tears on stage as teacher snatches microphone Mob storm police station and lynch suspected paedophile Good pup!

The good news is that the internet has made marketing your business a lot easier and more affordable. There are many ways to promote a business online: social media marketing, email marketing, pay-per-click advertising, display advertising and search engine optimisation all have their advantages and disadvantages, depending on your business’ market focus. One problem for small business owners and entrepreneurs is that of budget. I’m the first to recommend that any start-up business seeks the professional advice and services of a good digital marketing agency. The investment in a good agency is worth every penny, but sometimes there is just no budget for professional marketing efforts when a business is in its infancy. Search engine optimisation (SEO) is the online marketing tactic I recommend to small businesses and start-ups. Why? The basics of SEO can be learned and implemented in-house, reducing costs and empowering the business owner. SEO also yields a good ROI and is considered by many to be the best long-term online marketing strategy. In this article I’ll be sharing seven tips that any small business owner or entrepreneur can implement to positively affect their website’s visibility in organic search results, resulting in more traffic, leads and sales. 1. If you are a local business, focus your SEO efforts on ranking locally Traffic from local visitors is ‘intentful’ and often more likely to convert – so it should not be overlooked. Also, the good news is that you’ll often find it much easier to dominate the organic SERPs (search engine results page) for local search queries (plumbers in Durban) than you will do for broad, non-geotargeted queries. Google estimates that over 20% of all search has a local intent, so it’s worth pouncing on the opportunity. To start ranking in your local area, setup a Google My Business profile making sure your business name, address and phone number is accurate and exactly the same on your website and any local directory business listings. Advertisement 2. From an SEO perspective, many claim that 2016 is the ‘year of the influencer’ Partnering with persons, organisations or companies that are somehow related to your field (but not a competitor) is a great way of boosting visibility and leveraging another person or brand’s audience to help promote your business. Reach out and think of ways that you can collaborate to utilise each other’s networks constructively. This can prove a successful way of increasing reach, strengthening brand awareness and building wider audiences. In 2015, Jellyfish ran an influencer marketing campaign as part of our SEO activity for a key e-commerce client. In doing so, we partnered with influencers to produce and promote high-quality and unique niche content across relevant audiences and networks. The enhanced brand reach and engagement for our client had an exceptional impact on performance, with record breaking growth for the business, both in terms of search performance and sales. Results across the year included: • 28% uplift in keyword visibility across high-value search query portfolios in 9 months • 72% YoY increase in SEO traffic • 103% YoY growth in organic product revenue Snapshot of SEO Visibility over time. Searchmetrics Snapshot of organic traffic over time. Google Analytics 3. Know the size of the opportunity A basic task within a good SEO strategy is that of keyword research; a keyword is what search query is typed into Google. A common mistake with SEO is not doing the research needed to understand what potential keywords may be optimised to increase search visibility and website traffic opportunities. Defining a list of well researched keywords is essential to setting realistic expectations, goals and KPIs. Tools such as Google’s Keyword Planner and Google Trends are good starting points for ascertaining the size of the market that you are targeting and will give you invaluable insights into your market’s trends, demands and seasonality. 4. Keep an eye on your competitors Take notice of what your competitors are up to online. In understanding their strategies, wins and losses, you’ll be in a far better position to fine-tune your own approach to SEO. Some great tools that will be able to monitor your competitors’ visibility are Moz, SearchMetrics and SEM Rush. 5. Boast! Don’t be afraid to tell others about the great things you are doing by encouraging happy customers to leave their positive feedback on review platforms such as Google and Facebook. Share testimonials on your website and social media profiles/pages. A great way to get positive sentiment in the SERPs is to utilise Schema mark-up on your business web pages, for example make use of Rich Snippets that allow visitors to be able to leave a star rating on your product pages or blog posts. This will give new prospects the confidence that they need to invest in your brand and increasing your natural click-through rate from search engines. SEO is increasingly being used as a trust building and reputation management channel. 6. Google’s Search Console is an SEO essential for a business of any size It allows you to monitor the well-being of your website easily and effectively, ensuring that technical problems that might affect your SEO visibility are brought to your attention and can be dealt with before becoming harmful. And, the good news is that it’s free! Sign up for Google Search Console. Add your website to GSC. 7. No one-trick ponies In most scenarios, success in SEO is dependent on addressing a wide variety of factors which cumulatively produce positive results. It is unusual for a campaign’s success to be determined by one single factor; an SEO specialist will typically be required to undertake technical, content and syndication tasks to drive success in the organic search results. So be varied in your approach, keep your ideas fresh and always ask yourself whether your work is likely to add value to a user’s experience on the web. If the answer is ‘yes’, you’re probably heading in the right direction! SEO is a process of continued optimisation; you rarely get things 100% right the first time around and, in most cases, there is no distinct finishing line. Learn from your mistakes, be patient, persist and set realistic goals.

Lifestyle Tech Gaming Destiny 2: Sequel is a ‘totally new game’ and will be released for PC, report claims Some had worried that the game might be more like an expansion, and that it would come out just for consoles once again – but both are incorrect, according to a new report Andrew Griffin @_andrew_griffin Wednesday 28 September 2016 11:11 BST Click to follow The Independent Tech Destiny 2 is going to be an entirely game and come to an entirely new platform, according to rumours. Many fans had worried that the sequel to one of the biggest games in recent years would really be just an update, in the same style of the add-ons that developers Bungie have made in the time since the game was released. But it appears that there’ll be at least two huge changes – the game will be fully new, rather than building on the old one, and will come out for PC. The second rumour comes from the NeoGAF forums, through a user that claimed that Destiny’s next game will come out for PC. He said that a friend works at the publisher, and employees had been told in an internal presentation that the company wouldn’t be limiting the game to the Xbox and PlayStation, as it did in its earlier iteration.

The new game is scheduled for release in 2017. As such, it’s likely that Bungie will drop support for older consoles – the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 – and instead make way for playing the game on PC. Read more How Tom Clancy's The Division could top Destiny And the new game will bring a whole host of new changes, according to people familiar with it. “D2 is a completely different game,” a person familiar with development told games website Kotaku. “The Taken King was a reboot for Destiny 1 to fix small things. This is the overhaul to fix big things.” Those will keep the same basic world and mechanics, but will bring with it an entirely new story and new places to explore. As such, it’s unlikely that people will be able to carry over their old games and characters – but that the flipside will be that they’ll get to explore a whole new world.

Credit: IDGNS More like this Oracle takes Java copyright dispute with Google to appeals court Oracle’s API stance would be silly if it weren’t so dangerous Google cleared of infringement in Oracle lawsuit over Java Video Inside Google's Loon and Wing A federal court in California denied Oracle another trial in its longstanding copyright infringement dispute with Google over the use of Java code in the Android operating system. A jury had cleared Google of copyright infringement in May, upholding the company’s stand that its use of 37 Java APIs (application programming interfaces) in its Android mobile operating system was fair use, thus denying Oracle up to $9 billion in damages that it was seeking. A number of developers and scientists backed Google, saying that APIs, which are the specifications that let programs communicate with each other, could not be copyrighted and any bid to change that would stifle innovation. The administration of President Barack Obama had in its opinion sided with Oracle and said that the APIs can be copyrighted like other computer code. Oracle asked the court for a new trial, claiming, among other things, that Google concealed information during discovery on its plans to integrate Android apps with the Chrome OS running on desktops and laptops, thus extending the scope of the infringement beyond smartphones and tablets. District Judge William Alsup of the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California, in an order on Tuesday, denied Oracle’s request for a new trial, which would have been the third in the dispute. In 2015, Google began a new project, which internally was called ARC++. Its aim, according to court records was to “[p]rovide Chrome OS users with Play Android apps on Chrome OS without developer action.” “ARC++ would run an isolated instance of Android (with all of Android’s public APIs, including those reimplemented from Java) in order to allow users to run all Android apps on Chrome OS devices. Google planned to include its 'Play Store' — Google’s app wherein users could purchase and download other Android apps — as part of ARC++ to facilitate access to those apps,” wrote Judge Alsup in his order. The judge did not go along with Oracle’s claim that Google had “stonewalled and had completely concealed the ARC++ project.” Google had produced at least nine documents discussing the goals and technical details of ARC++ in 2015, at least five months before trial, wrote the judge, who added that “Oracle’s failure to review the ARC++ documents is its own fault.” Alsup pointed out that the evidence on ARC++ would not have impacted the trial in May because any evidence relating to implementations of Android on devices other than smartphones and tablets fell outside its scope. “It may well be true that the use of the copyrighted APIs in ARC++ (or any other later use) will not qualify as a fair use, but that will not and does not mean that Google’s argument on transformative use as to the original uses on trial (smartphones and tablets) was improper. That Oracle failed to detect the ARC++ documents in its possession had no consequence within the defined scope of our trial,” Judge Alsup wrote. Oracle had argued in its motion for a new trial that it was a mistake to limit the devices to smartphones and tablets. Google’s launch of the full Android system on the Chrome OS is even now in its preliminary stages and available only to developers and on a limited set of devices, the Judge observed. The judge's order also dismissed Oracle's demand for a new trial because of the exclusion of what the judge described as “minor evidence and testimony” from Stefano Mazzocchi, a member of the board of directors of the Apache Software Foundation in 2008. It also rejected Oracle’s contention that the court had improperly excluded its document containing replies to the European Commission, which had asked for an explanation of the dispute between Google and Sun Microsystems, the company that developed Java and was later acquired by Oracle. Google and Oracle could not be immediately reached for comment on the order. To express your thoughts on Computerworld content, visit Computerworld's Facebook page, LinkedIn page and Twitter stream.

Searching for phrases like “Bahamas vacations” or “California vacations” will return set of search results as shown below: Tapping on the option to display more destinations will return a screen like the one below, with the option to filter results using various parameters: Finally, tapping on a single destination will return a screen like the one below. One tab displays more details about the destination, while the ‘Plan a Trip’ tab allows you to make that plan into a reality After doing a bit of testing with this search command I learned a few intricacies of how it works. It will only work if major states, provinces, or countries are searched for. For example, “London vacations” returns a regular set of search results, while “England vacations” returns the vacation prices carousel. While the examples provided in this post are from a mobile device, the search command is confirmed to work on desktop as well.

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Content Marketing Social Media Paid Search Work Life Events Advertise The Difference Between Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) and Mobile-Friendly Pages Mobile Search September 22, 2016 Mobile Search Bharati AhujaSeptember 22, 2016 772SHARES 2.5KREADS 772SHARES 2.5KREADS Bharati Ahuja 772SHARES 2.5KREADS No business can underestimate the importance of having their website content being displayed correctly and quickly on the mobile devices. But, with variants like the internet speed and different screen sizes, reaching out on the mobile web is a challenging task. Google has always focused on the user, and the user experience has always been the most important ranking factor. The user experience always starts with the page load time . In some countries where the internet speed is not an issue, the page load time totally depends on the technicalities of the page design and development. Every time a web page takes too long to load, the site owner loses a reader/buyer—and also the opportunity to earn revenue through advertising or subscriptions. Some time back, Google had introduced ‘mobile-friendly’ labels in mobile search results. This label was added to sites which ensured a good mobile experience by being responsive. This label has recently been removed because Google says 85% of all pages in the mobile search results now meet the criteria of the mobile-friendly label. The latest development for improving the mobile search results and the mobile user experience further is The Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) Project, which is an open source initiative that embodies the vision that publishers can create mobile optimized content once and have it load instantly everywhere. AMP is a way to build web pages for static content that render fast. The difference between a mobile-friendly page and AMP can be understood by the following questions. What are Mobile-Friendly Pages? Mobile-friendly pages are pages with Responsive Web Design (RWD). RWD is a web design approach aimed at crafting sites to provide an optimal viewing experience across a wide range of devices -from desktop computer monitors, tablets to mobile phones. In particular, reacting to the width of the browser window — not just flowing the text, but often changing aspects of page layout. What are Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP)? AMP or Accelerated Mobile Pages is an open source initiative by Google launched in October 2015. Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) are lightweight pages designed to load quickly on mobile devices. AMP-compliant pages use a subset of HTML with a few extensions. Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP), is a very accessible framework for creating fast-loading mobile web pages. How Can a Website Become Mobile-Friendly? A website can be made responsive or mobile-friendly by adding Media Queries. Media queries let the display of content be according to the user device without having to change the content itself. It is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3. Media queries allow the web page to use different CSS style rules based on the features such as width, height, and color.  A media query is a logical expression that is either true or false. For Example: <!– CSS media query on a link element –> <link rel=”stylesheet” media=”(max-width: 800px)” href=”sample.css” /> <!– CSS media query within a stylesheet –> <style> @media (max-width: 600px) {   .facet_sidebar {     display: none;   } } </style> When a media query is true, the relevant style sheet or style rules are applied, following the normal cascading rules. How Can a Website Become AMP Compliant? A website is made AMP compliant as per instructions on https://www.ampproject.org/docs/get_started/create.html but the AMP pages also have to be made responsive or mobile-friendly. Are There Any Duplicate Content Issues With Responsive Websites? There are no issues related to duplicate content regarding responsive pages. Are There Any Duplicate Content Issues for an AMP Compliant Website? A responsive page or a mobile-friendly page is the same page of the website which is served in a different layout. The pages get displayed according to the device from which they are accessed. AMP pages are served to the user from the Google AMP cache. AMP pages have a different URL. Hence, the duplicate content issue has to be sorted out. The Google AMP Cache is a proxy-based content delivery network for delivering all valid AMP documents. It fetches AMP HTML pages, caches them, and improves page performance automatically. How Can I Solve The Duplicate Content Issue on AMP? If your website is AMP compliant and If you have both AMP and non-AMP versions of your pages, include the following links: On any non-AMP page, reference the AMP version of the page to let Google and other platforms know about it: Add the following to the non-AMP page: <link rel=”amphtml” href=”https://www.example.com/url/to/amp-version.html” />  On the AMP page,  add the following text to reference its non-AMP canonical version: <link rel=”canonical” href=”https://www.example.com/url/to/regular-html-version.html” /> For standalone AMP pages (those that don’t have a non-AMP version) the AMP page should specify itself as the canonical version as follows: <link rel=”canonical” href=”https://www.example.com/url/to/amp-document.html” /> How can I Validate AMP-complaint pages? You can validate AMP on https://validator.ampproject.org/ How Can I Test the Mobile-Friendliness of the Website? You can test how mobile-friendly the page is on https://testmysite.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-in Is Mobile-Friendliness a Ranking Signal? Yes. Since April 21st, 2015, Google started expanding its use of mobile-friendliness as a ranking signal. Mobile-friendliness will continue to remain a ranking factor as AMP also have to be made responsive. Is AMP a Ranking Signal? No, AMP is still not a ranking signal as mentioned by John Mueller, a Google Webmaster Trends Analysts,  in a Google Hangout, at the 15:50 mark into the video. How are Mobile-Friendly Pages and AMP Differentiated and Displayed in Search Results? On November 18th, 2014 Google added a “Mobile-friendly” label to mobile search results. But recently Google announced: To keep search results uncluttered, we’ll be removing the label, although the mobile-friendly criteria will continue to be a ranking signal. Google had introduced AMP as top stories in the carousel for mobile SERPs. In August 2016 Google started sharing an early preview of expanded AMP support across the entire search results page on g.co/ampdemo and not just the “Top stories” section. AMP pages are labeled with the icon  in search results. What About Page Size and Page Load Time? AMP reduces the page size to a great extent as it can be seen in the image below. The number of requests sent to retrieve the page is also less. AMP improves CTR and also shows an increase in the number of repeat visits. The Washington Post’s Jarrod Dicker, head of ad products and technology, said AMP improves click-through rates by up to 50 percent. He also said, The Post publishes over 1,000 articles in AMP every day, and they’re already seeing concrete benefits…We have seen load times average 400 milliseconds, an 88% improvement over our traditional mobile website. This has made readers more likely to tap on Washington Post stories because they know our articles will load consistently fast. AMP has been great for retention as well. Traditionally 51% of mobile search users return to The Washington Post within seven days. For users who read stories published in AMP, this number jumps to 63%. Here’s an example of a performance test conducted of a mobile-friendly version of the page and the AMP page of the same URL: Performance Summary Of a Responsive Page Performance Summary Of the AMP version of the same URL Does Google Give Reports Regarding AMP and Mobile-friendliness in Search Console and Analytics? Yes, Google gives a Mobile Usability Report in the search console for issues regarding mobile-friendliness/responsiveness under Search Traffic. The AMP related issues are also shared in the Search Console under Search Appearance. Google Analytics can also be added to AMP.   Google says since they started working on this mobile experience for users, they have seen an incredible global adoption of AMP that has gone beyond the news industry to include e-commerce, entertainment, travel, recipe sites and so on. To date, there are more than 150 million AMP docs in the Google index, with over 4 million new ones being added every week.  As the number of searches from mobile handsets continues to increase at a massive rate, AMP has become more and more important for search marketers.   Image Credits Featured Image: DepositPhotos.com Screenshots Taken by Author 9/2016 Related Posts Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMPs) Now Indexed in Organic Search Results Accelerated Mobile Pages or Apps?

Allo, an app which Google claims has privacy in mind, keeps all messages indefinitely until they are manually deleted. While that may not matter to some, there are others who aren’t comfortable with their correspondence being saved forever. The reported reason behind Google’s decision to have Allo store messages permanently has to do with the Smart Reply function. It is thought that the technology will work better if it has a longer backlog of conversation history to draw from. Allo’s approach to storing messages actually sets it apart from its competitors. While other messaging apps have privacy functions turned on by default, Allo is instead trasparent about the fact that it’s storing your messages from day one. Users will have full control over how long the data stays on Google servers, with the option to delete entire conversations or just single messages. As another option, people can use Incognito Mode, which offers end-to-end encryption. Over time we’ll see if the trade off of privacy is worth having Smart Reply being able to accurately predict what you’re going to say next.

With AMP pages now being indexed in Google’s regular set of search results, the pressure is on for publishers to adapt. Here are some tips and recommendations from Google on how to do that. Some of these aren’t tips so much as they are general guidelines, but they are no less important to know 1. Getting Started If you’re just getting started with a new website, build one on a content management system that has support for AMP. WordPress, for example, can make content AMP-ready with a simple plugin. 2. Are You Compatible With One Another? Google admits that not all content is suitable for AMP. Pages with static content are a great fit for AMP, while pages with more dynamic or interactive features may not go together. 3. AMP Doesn’t Have to be Sitewide Adopting AMP technology doesn’t mean your whole site has to be AMP-ready right out of the gate. Google recommends starting with a few static content pages first and working your way through the types of pages people would land on from search results. 4. AMP is Open Source and Evolving Everyone can have a hand in developing AMP technology. If your specific use case isn’t currently being supported, you could submit a feature request on GitHub. 5. There May Be Additional Requirements Only valid AMP pages are eligible to be shown in Google’s search results. Learn more about how to validate and debug AMP pages. 6. Don’t Expect a Ranking Change AMP, in and of itself, is not a ranking factor. AMP pages will be labeled with the familiar lightning bolt icon in search results, which may lead to more clicks, but not an automatic increase in search rankings. 7. AMP on Google is Always Expanding AMP search results in Google will soon be rolling out worldwide, while the top stories carousel is available in these countries. 8. Need Help? Just Ask Google reminds that the Webmaster Help Forum, Stack Overflow, and Github are always available to field any questions you may have about AMP. For additional assistance with AMP, here is a complete guide to making content AMP-friendly.

Allo is a smart messaging app, in the sense that it allows you to search for information, make plans, and express yourself in unique ways. Here is an overview of some of the key features launching with Google Allo. Main Features of Google Allo Google Assistant When the idea of Google Allo was first introduced, it was the Google Assistant that caught everyone’s attention. What is it? What will it do? How will it be different from similar apps? Now we have some answers to those questions. A “preview edition” of Google Assistant will be included in the launch version of Allo. With Allo you can have conversations with Google Assistant, asking it questions or telling it to perform tasks. You can chat with the assistant one-on-one, or bring it into chats with others using the ‘@google’ command. Screenshot taken 09/21/16 by Kelsey Jones With Google Assistant, you can: Make plans: By bringing the assistant into chats with friends using that @google command, it can help you make plans by providing suggestions or recommendations. Get Information: Through chatting with the assistant directly, you can ask it for immediate information, or to send you daily updates on the topics you care about. Entertain Yourself: Have fun with the assistant by asking it to send you that viral video everyone is talking about, or invoke the assistant in group chats so you and your friends can play games together. For now, this is just a preview to show you how Google Assistant works and what it can do. Long term plans involve integrating the assistant with more Google products, and having it available in more languages. Smart Reply Smart reply is similar to predictive text messaging on other platforms. When someone sends you a message, Allo provides several suggested responses for you to reply with. Of course, if you don’t like Allo’s suggestions, you can choose to reply by typing in the next message yourself. Smart reply works when people send photos as well, and will even suggest emojis when the situation calls for one. Over time, Allo will learn more about your style of texting and tailor its responses accordingly. Photos, Stickers, Emojis Allo has the option to manipulate certain kinds of messages before sending them. Emojis and text can be enlarged by dragging the send button up or down. Photos can be manipulated by drawing on them before sending. Google sought the expertise of independent artists and studios to create over 25 custom sticker packs just for Allo. Screenshot taken 09/21/16 by Kelsey Jones   Incognito Chats Google Allo messages are encrypted using industry standard technologies like Transport Layer Security (TLS). In addition, the company created an extra layer of privacy within Google Allo called Incognito. Messages have end-to-end encryption while in Incognito mode, with the option to use privacy features like discreet notifications and message expiration. SMS Messaging Google Allo can be used to message other people who do not have Allo. Messages sent to a non-Allo user will be sent via SMS, or app preview messages on Android. However, it is a bit limited Look for Allo worldwide on Android and iOS in the coming days.

And does it have enough to capture the attentions of very loyal whatsapp, facebook messager etc. users? Personally, I’m not sure. I think it will turn out to be a smaller, more niche offering like Google + is to Facebook, Twitter, Linkedin and others. semalaia4n nice post about the android.The Messages have end-to-end encryption.thanks for sharing the post.

Skip to content Fone Arena The Mobile Blog Menu Main Site Phones Gadgets About Media Coverage Advertising Contact Tip Us Twitter FB Youtube Google introduces Neural Machine Translation to enhance Google Translate Google has announced a Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system for improved translation. The NMT is said to reduce translation errors across its Google Translate service by between 55 percent and 85 percent. Google also announced that web and mobile versions of Google Translate are now using a new neural machine translation system for all translations from Chinese into English. According to the company, the app conducts those translations about 18 million times a day. Translating from Chinese to English is one of the more than 10,000 language pairs supported by Google Translate, and the company plans to work on rolling out GNMT to many more of these over the coming months. Quoc V. Le & Mike Schuster, Research Scientists, Google Brain Team, said in a blog post, A few years ago we started using Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) to directly learn the mapping between an input sequence (e.g. a sentence in one language) to an output sequence (that same sentence in another language) . Whereas Phrase-Based Machine Translation (PBMT) breaks an input sentence into words and phrases to be translated largely independently, Neural Machine Translation (NMT) considers the entire input sentence as a unit for translation.The advantage of this approach is that it requires fewer engineering design choices than previous Phrase-Based translation systems. When it first came out, NMT showed equivalent accuracy with existing Phrase-Based translation systems on modest-sized public benchmark data sets.

Read today's eNewspaper Business Google's answer to Amazon Prime launches in Maryland Google competes with Amazon Prime Google is expanding its online shopping and delivery platform into much of the East Coast. Google is expanding its online shopping and delivery platform into much of the East Coast. Sarah GantzContact ReporterThe Baltimore Sun Google's answer to Amazon Prime launches in Maryland. Aiming to muscle into e-commerce giant Amazon's turf, Google is expanding its online shopping and delivery platform into Maryland and much of the East Coast. The expansion is part of a push to make Google Express available nationwide by the end of the year. The service, which launched in select cities in 2013, expanded to 16 states earlier this year and on Wednesday added 13 more. "Our mission, broadly, is to connect customers with merchants they love and vice versa," said Brian Elliott, general manager of Google Express. The move comes as Amazon Prime, with its members-only benefits and same-day delivery, gains popularity and draws away shoppers — and advertisers — from Google, analysts said. "They're trying to protect their ad base, of course, because they're getting crushed by Amazon," said Howard Davidowitz, a retail analyst and founder of Davidowitz & Associates Inc. in New York City. Booze-delivery service to launch in Baltimore Drizly, an online and mobile service that lets users order alcohol for delivery, will launch in Baltimore on Thursday. (Baltimore Sun) Drizly, an online and mobile service that lets users order alcohol for delivery, will launch in Baltimore on Thursday. (Baltimore Sun) See more videos Google's search engine used to be the first stop for people surfing the web for a good deal. But as Amazon Prime solidifies the online retailer's reputation for can't-beat offers, more shoppers are turning directly to Amazon to search for products, he said. With Google Express, Google aims to win back shoppers, though the task won't be easy. "At the end of the day Amazon has many more products to choose from, a much broader selection and they give more perks," Davidowitz said. "I'm not saying people won't use it — of course they will — but I don't think this is going to be a threat to Amazon at all." Amazon adds new level of competition in Baltimore restaurant delivery Sarah Meehan Amazon, the online behemoth that has toppled bookstores and threatened big-box retailers, is trying out its next play — food delivery — on the streets of Baltimore.

Amazon, the online behemoth that has toppled bookstores and threatened big-box retailers, is trying out its next play — food delivery — on the streets of Baltimore. The company announced Thursday that it would begin offering delivery for 59 local restaurants, making Baltimore the fourth market in... (Sarah Meehan) Google Express works with a limited number of retailers — 14 in Maryland and the other states where service expanded Wednesday. Those retailers include Costco, Kohl's, PetSmart and Whole Foods Market. The company plans to add more retailers in the coming months, Elliott said. Similarly to Amazon Prime, Google Express is accessed through a membership — either $10 a month or $95 a year. Members pay nothing more for delivery on orders of at least $15, while smaller orders incur an extra charge. Non-members can shop through a "pay-as-you-go" option that starts at $4.99 per order. The service will be available statewide. Google Express contracts with delivery companies to pick up items from the retailer and deliver them to customers within two days. Same-day service and overnight delivery are possible depending on a retailer's proximity to the delivery address. During the checkout process, shoppers will see which delivery options are available for their specific order and choose. While AmazonFresh will deliver fresh food to your doorstep in some cities, including Baltimore, Google Express is sticking with non-perishable food items. Elliott said Google Express isn't trying to be Amazon. Rather, its approach is to connect shoppers with brands instead of specific products. "We don't think of it as being in competition with anybody," Elliott said. "We think of it as how do we do what we're good at." The service's strength is its technology platform, which is intended to appeal to both shoppers and retailers, Elliott said. Google Express deliberately partnered with retailers with loyal customers. Some, such as Costco, have their own membership programs. The service could be an asset to these companies, by helping them attract new customers and increase sales among existing ones, Elliott said. Google Express may never eclipse Amazon as the go-to place for online shopping, but likely will be popular among retailers regardless, said Dan Kogan, CEO of 1Digital Agency, a Philadelphia consultant for online retailers. "A lot of people don't want to put all their eggs in one basket and are looking for other ways to sell," Kogan said. Merchants pay Amazon hefty referral fees on every product sold through the website — between 6 percent and 20 percent of the sale price for most items, according to Amazon's website. What's more, when a particular product starts selling well, Amazon often starts competing with retailers, selling the product itself, Kogan said. Google Express could help retailers diversify their online sales portfolio and reduce their reliance on Amazon, he said. sarah.gantz@baltsun.com twitter.com/sarahgantz Privacy Policy Copyright © 2016, The Baltimore Sun, a Baltimore Sun Media Group publication | Place an Ad UberEATS food delivery app launches in Baltimore Roughly Speaking podcast: Game of Drones (episode 98) Baltimore Police officer found guilty in shooting to be sentenced Friday Breaking Sports Maryland Opinion Business Jobs Obits Advertising 48°

At long last, users in the country will be able to access Google Play Music to purchase songs as well as upload their desktop music library to the cloud to listen to them from anywhere. While most other countries got access to Play Music since 2011, Indians had to wait a long, long time for Google to finally wade its way through to the country. Google had announced the launch of the Music Store way back in July, but it is only now that we are noticing the update. However, still missing are a lot of features including a Podcast directory, Play Music All Access for unlimited streaming, a family plan and even genre-based charts. But what's there are more than we ever got from Google. It is more than a cross-platform music store. You can see charts listing the top songs, albums and new releases. Broad categories like 'Best of Bollywood', 'Indian Pop Hits', 'For the Kids' and 'International Music'. There are also separate sections for regional languages. Similar to what happens in other countries, you can preview the tracks and pay for them using your Google account credentials or your registered fingerprint through a debit or a credit card. You also have the option of buying Google Play Credits which Google began to sell offline in stores since last year and redeem them with a code. It would be especially useful for those who don't have a debit or credit card. The updated Play Music will let you upload 50,000 songs from your desktop including your iTunes and Windows Media libraries via Chrome which can be accessed from the app on mobiles, tablets and the web. Music streaming services are still at a nascent stage with powerful competitors like Spotify and Pandora still missing out on the action. Yet, Apple Music, Airtel's Wynk, Saavn and Gaana have been there in the Indian markets for quite some time and it will take Google everything they have to offer to gain traction. But considering that Play Music comes pre-installed in most Android devices and with over 97 per cent of the smartphones sold in India being Android devices, the Music Store will at least be accessible to majority of the country. The Google Play Music Store is available on Android, Web and iOS in India. Some users have complained the login for iOS is currently broken, but Google won't take long to fix it with an update. Yesterday, Google also unveiled the YouTube Go app, that lets users share videos offline, a mass-scale public Wi-Fi program and a data-friendly version of Google Chrome.

Google Play Music store has gone live for users across India on Android. Google Music subscription service was launched in 2011, but it has taken a while for it come to India. Google has not yet officially announced the launch of the Music Play Store in India, and for now it doesn’t look like the monthly subscription has gone live yet. Songs are starting at Rs 15, and some are available for free download as well, but there’s no monthly subscription which gives access to the entire library. There’s quite a collection of Bollywood music as well, though we’ve not had a chance to explore the entire Store. Google Play Music with unlimited downloading and streaming service is available for $9.99 in the US per month. There’s also a family plan. Google Play Music Store has gone live on the web and Android in India. The Music catalogue has 35 million songs. Earlier this year screenshots of the service for India were spotted on Reddit. Google Play Music enters a fairly competitive space in India. There are several music streaming services like Saavn, Hungama, Wynk and Apple Music already available in India. Apple Music starts at Rs 120 per month for users, and Rs 190 for the family plan.

 Amazon is eating away at Google's core business Rob Price Sep. 28, 2016, 6:00 AM 12,563 facebook linkedin twitter email print Jeff Bezos, the founder and CEO of Amazon.Alex Wong/Getty Images For more and more people, Amazon is the first port of call when it comes to researching potential purchases — and that's bad news for Google. Over half of Americans now go to Amazon to carry out their first search for products, turning away from search engines and other online retailers, according to a new study from the marketing company BloomReach. (The research was previously reported on by Bloomberg.) Fifty-five percent of those surveyed made their first search on Amazon, up from 44% a year ago. At the same time, just 27% of people began at search engines, down from 34%. Retailers also saw a decline, dropping to 16% from 21%. (The study took place on Labor Day, May 1, and surveyed 2,000 US consumers. There's no word on data from other countries, but it seems reasonable to assume that the data might be similar in Western markets where Amazon has a similar presence as in the US.) It's a yet another sign of how fully Amazon is dominating online shopping — but it's also particularly bad news for Google. Google's original, core business is a search engine. But more and more consumers are now opting to bypass it in favor of heading straight to the ultimate destination. Shopping IRL is so passé.Thomson Reuters The ads Google can serve next to product or shopping searches are especially lucrative (as they can be highly targeted at users clearly intending to spend money), making this trend more damaging than if Google's search market were eroding in a different sector (educational searches, for example). A Google representative declined to comment. There's still no guarantee, however, that people who visit Amazon first will definitely buy from there — something BloomReach acknowledges. "Just because consumers start on Amazon, that doesn't mean they ultimately buy from Amazon," marketing head Jason Seeba said in a statement. "Instead, they're often comparing and researching products on search engines and other retailers." Plus, it's not as if Google is dependent solely on search: Its revenue now comes from everything from its DoubleClick ad network to its Google Play purchases. But even so, Amazon has become the unrivalled go-to destination to start Americans' search for products — and that has to worry the world's largest search engine.

Lifestyle London Life The silicon saviours: how three tech giants are waging war on disease The founders of Google, Microsoft and Facebook are competing in a new sphere: saving the world ROSAMUND URWIN Wednesday 28 September 2016 10:23 BST Social networkers: Mark Zuckerberg and Priscilla Chan AP Tech gurus always claim they’re unfazed by competition. Bill Gates once said of the rivalry between him and the late Steve Jobs: “We spurred each other on.” Now though, the competition is stiffening in a new sphere: saving the world. Three tax-shy tech giants or their founders — Google, Microsoft and Facebook — are all waging war on disease. Here’s how they measure up.  The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative  The goal: Just the small matter of curing, preventing or managing every disease by the end of the century.  The story: Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg, the man who made you hate a quarter of your friends, last week pledged to donate $3 billion to end illness. So we probably have to stop moaning about the baby pics. His wife, paediatrician Priscilla Chan, said they wanted to stop disease within the lifetime of their daughter Max. The plan: The first step will be setting up Biohub, a $600 million facility in San Francisco. Its research will be in partnership with Berkeley, Stanford and the University of California. The Zuck says the focus will be on cancer, heart disease and infectious and neurological diseases — responsible for the majority of deaths. He says: “This is a big goal but we spent the last few years speaking with experts who think it’s possible.” Critics say:  $3 billion isn’t nearly enough moolah to succeed. The National Institutes of Health in the US, which funds similar medical research, has an annual budget of $32 billion.  The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Read more Bill Gates is on a humanitarian mission to end poverty The goal: The foundation, based in a glass cathedral to philanthropy in Seattle, focuses on improving health, eradicating poverty and increasing opportunity. Its motto? “All lives have equal value.” The story: Since the foundation was launched in 2000 by the Microsoft founder and his wife, it has paid out $36.7 billion in grants.   The plan: There are three components to its work: health — fighting diseases including malaria — global development (improving crop yields and access to family-planning) and education in the US. A big success is the campaign to eradicate polio. She says: “When I’m in the developing world my heart absolutely breaks at times,” Melinda told the Standard. “I’ve gone back to my hotel sobbing.”  Critics say: A campaign group, Global Justice Now, alleged that the Gates Foundation’s efforts benefit big business. In response, the foundation says “results are measured in lives saved” and it will continue to work with multinationals.

Google’s top-secret life sciences start-up (which launched in 2013) tries to merge technology and medicine to fight disease. This is one of the search engine’s “moonshoots” — a ground-breaking, risky initiative that may take years to become profitable. The story: Formerly a subsidiary of  Google X, it rebranded as Verily last year and works with pharma giants. The plan: One of its projects (with Johnson & Johnson) is to improve surgical robotics. Others include contact lenses that allow patients with diabetes to check their  glucose levels, and a spoon for tremor-sufferers.  He says: CEO Andy Conrad explained the name change: “Only through truth are we going to defeat Mother Nature.”  Critics say: It may be suffering a brain drain, with a series of staff departures.    More about: Silicon Valley Reuse content Comments Most Popular Video Sponsored Features Follow us: All Topics All Authors Archive Terms of use Contact Us Privacy policy Cookie policy Code of Conduct & Complaints Advertisers Promotion rules Contributors Syndication Business Connections Homes & Property Jobs London Live The Independent This is London Magazine indy100 Install our apps Close We have noticed that you are using an ad blocker.

Go is an amazing choice for a language as it was developed by some of the same individuals who created the C programming language, Unix, and UTF-8 - some of the most influential contributions to computer science. Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson created Go to be a modern language that easily uses multiple cores, easily implements concurrency, easily works in distributed environments, and easily allows the programmer to write programs - it has a very lean and user-friendly syntax. Go was created by luminaries in computer science at one of the best, if not the very best, software engineering firm to have ever existed - Google. The credentials of Go are unsurpassed. But why did Google create a new language? In Google’s words, “Go was born out of frustration with existing languages and environments for systems programming. Programming had become too difficult and the choice of languages was partly to blame. One had to choose either efficient compilation, efficient execution, or ease of programming; all three were not available in the same mainstream language. Programmers who could were choosing ease over safety and efficiency by moving to dynamically typed languages such as Python and JavaScript rather than C++ or, to a lesser extent, Java. Go is an attempt to combine the ease of programming of an interpreted, dynamically typed language with the efficiency and safety of a statically typed, compiled language. It also aims to be modern, with support for networked and multicore computing. Finally, working with Go is intended to be fast: it should take at most a few seconds to build a large executable on a single computer. To meet these goals required addressing a number of linguistic issues: an expressive but lightweight type system; concurrency and garbage collection; rigid dependency specification; and so on. These cannot be addressed well by libraries or tools; a new language was called for.” In my opinion, Go is the best programming language that you can be learning today. I began programming in 1982 with BASIC, I have worked with many languages, and Go is the best language which I have ever used. Come learn about one of the greatest languages ever created. You will leave with resources and code samples to start making all of your software and apps really go. What are the requirements? No prerequisite knowledge is required to take this course. This course starts at the very beginning and will teach you everything you need to know to be an outstanding programmer. What am I going to get from this course? Learn how computers work Learn the fundamentals of programming Learn modern best-practices for programming Learn from a University Professor in Computer Science with over 15 years of experience teaching individuals of all ability levels Understand why the Go programming language is the best programming language you can learn today Acquire additional valuable programming skills including understanding environment variables, using a command line interface (CLI) terminal, understanding SHA-1 checksums, working with GitHub, and increasing your productivity with an integrated development environment (IDE) such as Webstorm or Atom.io What is the target audience? This is a first semester university level programming course. This course is ideal for beginners wanting to learn programming. This course is perfect for experienced programmers wanting a thorough introduction to the Go programming language. This course is perfect for experienced programmers wanting to fill in gaps in their programming knowledge.

A slice type denotes the set of all slices of arrays of its element type. The value of an uninitialized slice is nil. change in size have a length and a capacity multi-dimensional https://golang.org/ref/spec#Slice_types map key / value storage a “dictionary” A map is an unordered group of elements of one type, called the element type, indexed by a set of unique keys of another type, called the key type. The value of an uninitialized map is nil. https://golang.org/ref/spec#Map_types struct a data structure a composite type allows us to collect properties together https://golang.org/ref/spec#Struct_types Lecture 86 Array 08:28 definition An array is a numbered sequence of elements of a single type. The number of elements is called the length and is never negative. The length is part of the array's type; it must evaluate to a non-negative constant representable by a value of type int. The length of an array a can be discovered using the built-in function len. The elements can be addressed by integer indices 0 through len(a)-1. Array types are always one-dimensional but may be composed to form multi-dimensional types. not dynamic does not change in size a basic array len index access assigning a value to an index position in an array Lecture 87 Array Examples 10:45 understanding the difference between index position and the items stored if you’re storing three items in array a, those items will be at index positions 0, 1, 2 len(a)-1 is your last index position eg, 3-1 = 2 → 2 is your last index position for your array, a, which has three items using break in a loop Section 9: Data Structures - Slice Lecture 88 Slices 10:04 definition A slice is a descriptor for a contiguous segment of an underlying array and provides access to a numbered sequence of elements from that array. The value of an uninitialized slice is nil. it is a reference type Like arrays, slices are indexable and have a length. The length of a slice s can be discovered by the built-in function len; Unlike arrays, slices are dynamic their length may change during execution. The elements can be addressed by integer indices 0 through len(s)-1. A slice, once initialized, is always associated with an underlying array that holds its elements. it is a reference type The array underlying a slice may extend past the end of the slice. Capacity is a measure of that extent: it is the sum of the length of the slice and the length of the array beyond the slice; The capacity of a slice a can be discovered using the built-in function cap(a). make A new, initialized slice value for a given element type T is made using the built-in function make, which takes a slice type and parameters specifying the length and optionally the capacity. A slice created with make always allocates a new, hidden array to which the returned slice value refers. make([]T, length, capacity) make([]int, 50, 100) same as this: new([100]int)[0:50] Like arrays, slices are always one-dimensional but may be composed to construct higher-dimensional objects. (multi-dimensional slices) a basic slice Lecture 89 Slice Examples 09:38 length and capacity a great example index out of range errors appending items to slices deleting items from slices Lecture 90 More Slice Examples 06:33 More Slice Examples multidimensional slice incrementing a slice Lecture 91 Creating A Slice 12:43 shorthand var sets slice to zero value which is nil make Full Curriculum Students Who Viewed This Course Also Viewed Loading Loading Loading SHARE Instructor Biography Todd McLeod, Faculty in Computer Science and Computer Information Tech I am passionate about helping others learn and improve their lives.

It’s tried to drain the swamp. In February 2015, for example, it created a kid-safe app that would keep things like, oh, say, racist/anti-Semitic/homophobic comments or zombies from scaring the bejeezus out of young YouTubers. Now, Google’s trying something new: it’s soliciting “YouTube Heroes” to don their mental hazmat suits and dive in to do some cleanup. You work hard to make YouTube better for everyone… and like all heroes, you deserve a place to call home. This video explains the program: As they climb up the ladder, earning points for do-gooderism and advancing to higher levels, the Heroes will get access to a dashboard for online moderation, access to exclusive workshops and “Hero hangouts,” and sneak previews of YouTube product launches and test products before they’re released to the general public. Other perks they can gain along the way include access to “super tools,” such as the ability to mass-flag videos. YouTube announced the program in a post on its help channel on Wednesday. Here’s what it’s asking volunteers to do: Flag inappropriate videos. Here are some details about its Trusted Flagger Program. Add captions and subtitles to videos. Share knowledge with other users on the YouTube Help forum, which is available in English, French, German, Hindi, Japanese, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More Doing those tasks will earn users points that they can use to get the perks in this new crowdsourcing program. To participate, you have to agree to and comply with the YouTube Heroes Program Rules. Google says the program, offered everywhere YouTube is available, is currently in beta and subject to change. Our goal is to have a positive impact on our users, and we look forward to refining the Program as it continues.

Reply misanthropicjoy says: September 23, 2016 at 3:15 pm That’s exactly who will be attracted to the program. The other half will be the sorts that want to watch the world burn.

Reply Anonymous says: September 23, 2016 at 8:01 pm Then the public won’t know the truth about stuff, this stuff needs to be fact checked and then rated accordingly….. Reply Mahhn says: September 26, 2016 at 2:50 pm fact check Fox, then get back to me on that truth stuff. CNN post limited information to get you to draw the conclusions they want you to have. Which isn’t much different than Fox’s blatant lies. Reply Anonymous says: September 23, 2016 at 2:37 pm If they wanted me to do all that, I’d require more compensation than just “points.” Reply Jim says: September 23, 2016 at 3:08 pm Given the vitriolic nature of the people who respond to videos they disagree with, it’s really hard to imagine how this can ever be a good thing. Just because something is unpopular does not mean it’s evil. Reply delayedthoughtengineering says: September 23, 2016 at 3:23 pm There is a lot of mention in the video of flagging content. However, I don’t see the content as the issue. In fact, contentious content begs analysis and counterpoint content. Sometimes counter-arguments miss points, but the bottom line is that I don’t see content as a big problem on YouTube. Popular content naturally bubbles up and bad content is eventually forgotten. The real issue is YouTube comments. The YouTube comment sections are infamous for having some of the worst hate speech on the internet, and therefore, the world. There is hate speech and shaming on even the most benign videos. I would want advanced tools to wipe out entire discussion threads and to search for similar sentence structure to hunt down multiple offensive accounts populated by the same individuals. I want to be able to track down these individuals to report them to guardians and other authorities. Bad actors hide behind anonymity while enjoying blatant ignorance and fury. Google has done some efforts towards identifying users while keeping them safe, but their efforts have either largely irritated the community while reducing the safety of a few vulnerable individuals, or has been completely ineffective. Comments make YouTube relatively unsafe, if only from an emotional point of view. In many cases, I see videos with comments completely disabled, and I’m perfectly fine with that, knowing the comment community’s vitriol. Talented young people are “hushed” by harsh comments, and we are all diminished for it. Reply James says: September 23, 2016 at 5:36 pm I don’t want youtube points but I want google stocks as a reward. How about that. Reply Anonymous says: September 23, 2016 at 5:59 pm Maybe Google should google “hero”. This sounds more like being an unpaid septic tank cleaner. Reply SumGuy says: September 23, 2016 at 6:08 pm RIP Youtube. It’s gonna become a Flagfest. Though there are a ton of misleading titles out there that deserve to be flagged. I somehow think this is not going to fix that. Reply roy jones jr says: September 25, 2016 at 9:33 pm Thats interesting that this is going on. I never see ads when attempting to watch a video about this. I only see ads about donald trump and hillary. So um can youtube do something about that too?

(Uber) An Uber self-driving car. (Uber) Photo: Uber, TNS With self-driving cars, humans still want to steer — sometimes 1 / 4 Back to Gallery Even as automakers race forward on self-driving cars, most Americans aren’t ready to give up the steering wheel just yet. A new survey finds that drivers remain deeply suspicious of fully autonomous vehicles that don’t give them the option of driving — the vision of the future embodied by Google’s bubble-shaped robot car. Instead, they prefer the idea of cars that can drive themselves in all conditions but that still give humans the ability to take control if they want, according to the survey released Wednesday by the Kelley Blue Book auto information service. “That’s the sweet spot,” said Karl Brauer, senior analyst for Kelley Blue Book. “People like the idea that they can have full autonomy and full control in one car. They’re just not as confident when you take away the human-control option.” The survey of 2,264 people also found sharp generational divides in public attitudes toward self-driving cars. The youngest members of Generation Z, who are immersed in technology and cannot yet legally drive, are by far the most comfortable with the idea of cars that allow no human control, followed by older Millennials. Baby Boomers are the least comfortable. “‘I’m indestructible, computers do everything, they already run my life, why not run my transportation?’ — that’s the Gen Zs,” Brauer said. “Once you start driving, maybe you have more awareness of what all’s involved, and you start to get more skeptical about the computer being able to do it for you.” The survey comes as autonomous car research, much of it based in Silicon Valley, accelerates. All of the major automakers are pursuing some version of the technology, while early, limited versions are already hitting the marketplace. Tesla Motors’ Autopilot feature, for example, can steer a car by itself on the freeway, although the company insists drivers continue to pay attention. Debate within the industry has simmered for years over whether humans should still have the option of driving once autonomous technology has matured. Google executives have argued for cars that take driving completely out of human hands, saying humans can’t be trusted to keep at least one eye on the road. Ford Motor Co. recently endorsed the same idea. As a result, Kelley’s survey examines awareness of and interest in different types of automated cars. The industry uses a scale of zero to five to categorize self-driving cars, with zero representing cars in which humans control everything all the time, while five signifies cars that allow no human driving at all. (Tesla’s Autopilot, in this ranking, represents level two — able to steer itself but requiring that the driver stay mentally engaged.) Level five, the survey found, remains a tough sell. Thirty percent of the survey’s respondents said they would never buy a level five car, while 19 percent said they would only buy one if they couldn’t buy a non-autonomous car. And yet, 16 percent of respondents said they would buy a fully-autonomous level five car the moment those vehicles hit the market, while 35 percent said they would wait until they felt more comfortable with the technology. Drivers seem to be much more open, however, to level four — fully autonomous cars that still allow their owners to take over when they want. Asked to rate the appeal of the different levels, 30 percent of respondents picked level four, well above any other level. Level three cars, which can drive by themselves in certain situations without requiring the driver’s attention, were favored by just 18 percent, while level five cars were the choice of 17 percent. “They feel like with three they can’t fully relax — they’re going to have to keep switching in and out of paying attention — and five they have no option to ever take over,” Brauer said. “But with four they get the best of both worlds.” Some groups seem more receptive to the technology than others, according to the survey. For example, people who routinely use ride services such as Uber and Lyft are more comfortable with fully autonomous cars than those who don’t. Fittingly, Uber is already testing autonomous taxis in Pittsburgh. Age clearly plays a role. Among respondents age 12 to 15 — the younger members of Generation Z — 73 percent said they are comfortable with level five cars. Only 20 percent of Baby Boomers gave the same answer. Perhaps most significant: Respondents who reported having some experience driving a level two car such as a Tesla were much more open to fully autonomous cars than others. “Once you start getting exposure to the technology, people’s attitudes change rapidly, for the better,” Brauer said. David R. Baker is a San Francisco Chronicle staff writer. Email: dbaker@sfchronicle.com Twitter: @DavidBakerSF Self-driving car levels explained The federal government and the auto industry have developed ranking systems to describe the different levels of autonomous-car technology. Although there are slight differences among systems, here’s the general outline: Level zero Driver performs all control functions. Level one Driver performs most functions, but a few — such as driver-assist braking — are augmented by automation. Level two At least two of the car’s control functions can work together in automated mode — such as adaptive cruise control combined with lane centering — but the driver still must pay attention. Level three Driver can turn over total control of the car under certain conditions, with the car largely responsible for monitoring for any sudden changes to the environment. Driver must still be available to take control if needed. Level four Car is capable of driving itself but has controls for humans to drive when they choose. Level five Car drives itself, with no option for human driving. Latest from the SFGATE homepage: Click below for the top news from around the Bay Area and beyond.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Chromebook Pixel 2 finally receives more stable Google Play Store support By R Padla - September 28, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter The Chromebook Pixel 2 may no longer be available in the online Google Store but the device is still able to run the Play Store. That means Android mobile apps can run on the Chrome OS-powered laptop. The concept has been available since Google announced that it’s possible. The Pixel 2’s version has been ready but only in beta mode. Good news: the Chromebook Pixel 2 can now run the Google Play Store and allow users to download apps–officially. It’s out of the developer channel which means anyone can download games and apps and use them on the laptop. There are still limits to the apps running but the feature is official and more stable now. There may still be issues but that’s normal. Google has released that the Play Store for three Chromebooks so far. We noted last week that Chrome OS Stable channel is receiving the Google Play Store. True enough, it’s ready out of beta for those with Chromebooks supported. No word yet when other models will receive the Google Play Store feature so let’s just wait and see. Google is scheduled to deliver Android apps to the laptop via the Play Store but it’s only a matter of time so be patient. Google will keep its promises. VIA: SlashGear Story Timeline Chrome OS to run Android apps, Google Play Store soon Google ready to bring Android apps and the Play Store to Chrome OS Chromebook Pixel 2015, Acer R11 to get Play Store support and run Android apps Chromebook Pixel 2 not available anymore in Google store Chrome OS Stable channel finally receives Google Play Store TAGS Android Apps Chrome Beta Chromebook Pixel Google Chrome OS Google Play Store Must Read Google Home Review: Feeling at home with Google Assistant This is the Huawei Mate 9 and its Porsche Design twin Huawei Fit hands-on: fitness tracker in smartwatch clothing Stay Connected 883,798FansLike 136,413FollowersFollow 102,861FollowersFollow 469,474FollowersFollow 59,555SubscribersSubscribe About Contact Terms of Use Privacy Policy Advertise © 2016 Android Community - Part of R3 Media LLC

Home FEATURED Cellphones Notebooks Gaming Tablets Software Google Hangouts Update Adds Chrome Custom Tabs September 28, 2016, By Sanjeev Ramachandran Share This Related Posts Chrome Not Backing In-Built Ad-Blocking; Plans to Better Ads Instead Sphericam 3: Beast Certainly, But Not an Enchanting Beauty Google wants to remind its users that despite the launch of consumer focused apps like Google Duo and Google Allo, it’s still keeping focused with the enterprise-focused works for Google Hangouts. A new update has now been rolled out by Google for Hangouts, which adds some new tweak to make sure that the app gets unhitched from the consumer-centric approach. Version 13.0 of Google Hangouts is adding some major improvements, which include the addition of Chrome custom tabs to the messenger service. With the Chrome custom tabs feature, Hangouts will now let users browse links within the app instead of leaving the app for an external browser. The option can be now seen under the settings, where it’s turned on by default. The app also pops up the option of opening the page in Chrome browser, along with a share button that will pop up the share sheet. A new message can also be viewed when opening the settings tab that reads ‘Conversation merging is no longer available’. Google removed the merged conversation feature in its version 11 update. With this feature, users were able to merge conversations from Hangouts and SMS, letting them interact to different chats under a single window. The message comes as just an official reminder after taking it down in the previous version. Google says that the feature was dropped due to lack of popularity of the feature among the users, adding that it made users more confused. Besides, Google Hangouts also now enjoys some of the Android features it has been lacking until now, like having Direct Share on Marshmallow devices, and Quick Reply on Nougat devices. Hangouts also now supports transfer of videos and group invite sharing via links.

At the second "Google for India" event in New Delhi which coincided with the search giant's 18th birthday, the company announced that "Google Station" will connect public places like malls, railway stations, bus stops and hangouts like cafes and universities. Its artificial intelligence-powered Google Assistant will be available in Hindi by the end of the year via newly-launched mobile messaging app Allo, the company announced as its launched a slew of products in three categories -- Access, Platform and Products -- covering services like Google Play, Chrome, YouTube Go and Google Duo. "Every second, three Indians come online and we have to ensure that the experience is wonderful and relevant for them. But the next billion is very different from the first billion and by building products for these users we are preparing for how the world will use tech in the coming years," Caesar Sengupta, Vice-President, Next Billion Users at Google, told reporters here. With an aim to encourage women to get online, the company launched "Internet Saathi" programme in 2015 and a 10-times growth in local language queries has been registered since then. Under the Google-Tata Trust initiative, 25,000 villages now have internet saathis and one million women across 10 states have been trained so far. Talking about Google's collaboration with Indian Railways and RailTel to bring high-speed Internet at railway stations, Sengupta said Wi-Fi is now available at 52 stations with Mumbai CST the latest addition. "Nearly 3.5 million users are now using Railways Wi-Fi and 15,000 users are now coming online every day," he noted. Sengupta also announced a new Google Play store which can now load on slower 2G connections, have options to schedule and preload downloads and install apps only over Wi-Fi. According to John Giannardrea, Senior Vice President (Search), the company has been making progress in localising Google Search with the introduction of machine learning. "Google is now capable of translating 100 languages and 12 of these are from India," he added. Amit Fulay, Product Lead for communication apps Google Duo and Google Allo, said India and the US have most number of Duo users and Allo has seen a tremendous response in India. Google Allo is a new smart messaging app that helps users make plans, find information as well as express with ease, all within the chat and it works on all type of connections. Packed with innovative features including smart reply, options for sharing photos, emojis and stickers specially designed for India, Google Allo makes it easier for users to respond quickly and keep the conversation moving, even when one is on the go. Announcing new features in Chrome, Rahul Roy Chowdhury, VP (Chrome), said that new product now saves data, has offline capabilities and has more accurate content discovery. Chrome can now work on 2G data connection and can save loads of data. People have saved over 337 TB of data, including 138 TB of video data that is equivalent to Rs 7 crore savings each week, Roy-Chowdhury informed. "Chrome data saver can save up to 67 per cent of data while watching videos. The optimised pages have a similar look to the heavy pages and they can now load five times faster than before saving up to 90 per cent of the data," Roy-Chowdhury added. Johanna Wright, Vice President (Product Management) at YouTube, announced YouTube Go which has an easy user interface, works on low connectivity, cuts cost in data usage and offers personalised suggestions to the users. With a tagline of "Mazze Udao, Data Nahi", YouTube Go now allows a user to preview and choose the size of the video. Users can now save, watch and share videos even when the connection is poor. Based on browsing history, patterns and languages, the new app will also serve 10 new videos every week.

Photograph: Marcio Jose Sanchez/AP Richard Lea @richardlea Wednesday 28 September 2016 05.00 EDT Last modified on Thursday 13 October 2016 16.04 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close This article is 1 month old When the writer Rebecca Forster first heard how Google was using her work, it felt like she was trapped in a science fiction novel. “Is this any different than someone using one of my books to start a fire? I have no idea,” she says. “I have no idea what their objective is. Certainly it is not to bring me readers.” After a 25-year writing career, during which she has published 29 novels ranging from contemporary romance to police procedurals, the first instalment of her Josie Bates series, Hostile Witness, has found a new reader: Google’s artificial intelligence. “My imagination just didn’t go as far as it being used for something like this,” Forster says. “Perhaps that’s my failure.” Forster’s thriller is just one of 11,000 novels that researchers including Oriol Vinyals and Andrew M Dai at Google Brain have been using to improve the technology giant’s conversational style. After feeding these books into a neural network, the system was able to generate fluent, natural-sounding sentences. According to a Google spokesman – who didn’t want to be named – products such as the Google app will be “much more useful if they can capture the nuance of language better”. For the moment, the research is just a “proof of concept”, the spokesman continues via email, but these methods “could help Google understand and produce a broader, more nuanced range of text for any given task”. “We could have used many different sets of data for this kind of training, and we have used many different ones for different research projects,” he adds. “But in this case, it was particularly useful to have language that frequently repeated the same ideas, so the model could learn many ways to say the same thing – the language, phrasing and grammar in fiction books tends to be much more varied and rich than in most nonfiction books.” I’m still thinking in the old way, that a reader will read my book – it didn’t even occur to me that a machine could. Rebecca Forster, author The only problem is that they didn’t ask. The Google paper [PDF] says that the novels used in this research were taken from “the Books Corpus”, citing a 2015 paper by Ryan Kiros and others [PDF] which describes how the authors “collected a corpus of 11,038 books from the web”, describing them as “free books written by [as] yet unpublished authors”. It’s a collection that has been used by other researchers working in artificial intelligence and which is currently available for download in its entirety from the University of Toronto. Forster says that she “always appreciates an interesting use of words”, but while Hostile Witness is available to download for free, no one asked her permission to use her novel as raw material to train a computer. “Perhaps I’m still thinking in the old way, that a reader will read my book – it didn’t even occur to me that a machine could read my book. What I found curious was that these were referred to as ‘free books written by as yet unpublished authors’ because my state is very different,” she says. Like many of the novels in the Book Corpus collection, the edition of Hostile Witness used in the research was published on Smashwords and includes a copyright declaration that reserves “all rights”, specifies that the ebook is “licensed for your personal enjoyment only”, and offers the reader thanks for “respecting the hard work of this author”. While Forster says she’s no lawyer, the “spirit of this declaration is clear – you hope that your work would be respected by readers”. “I take great pride in my craft, and perhaps it was chosen because of that. Which would be great. Or perhaps it was chosen because it was there, because it was free?” Another writer whose work has been used in the Google Brain research is Erin McCarthy, the author of more than 28 novels. The first volume of her Fast Track series, published by Penguin Random House’s Berkley Books imprint, is also available for free online, but McCarthy says that Google didn’t get in touch with her or ask for permission to use Jacked Up in their research into AI. She’s fascinated to hear that romance novels are being used to improve the search conglomerate’s ability to speak. “There is a reason they are the bestselling genre in the US and I believe it’s because they feel conversational themselves,” McCarthy says. “It’s real life turned up a notch. Realism overlying a fantasy.” The flow of the dialogue is very important, she continues. “I am very cognizant of using modern diction and age-appropriate word choices. If my female character is 24 she’s not going to speak in a formal manner. Conversations between the hero and heroine have realistic word choices, but there is additionally an element of fantasy there. What they want a hero to say, but what might not actually occur in real life. That’s what readers want and expect from a romance novel.” McCarthy isn’t sure how to respond to the idea that her work has been used for an entirely different purpose to the one she intended, a purpose that may result in services to make the tech giant a lot of money. “It’s hard to gauge the use of my work and the exact purpose for its use without having seen it in action,” she says. “My assumption would be they purchased a copy of the book originally. If they haven’t, then I would imagine the source of the content, as intellectual property, should be properly attributed and compensated for the general health of the creative community.” Far from offering proper attribution or any compensation, the Google paper avoids any suggestion that the novels used in the research were written by real people, describing the books only as “a collection of text from 12k ebooks, mostly fiction”. Forster is equally adamant that writers whose work has been used to gain a commercial advantage should reap a portion of the rewards, but isn’t holding her breath for any payment. “If there’s one thing that’s niggling at me it’s that I would have liked to have known,” she says. “With all the technology at their fingertips, then it wouldn’t have been too hard to let everyone know.” Authors Guild denied appeal to stop Google scanning books Read more According to Mary Rasenberger, executive director of the Authors Guild, this “blatantly commercial use of expressive authorship” comes as no surprise. “We’ve seen this movie before.” The Guild has been in dispute with Google since 2005, arguing that the company’s project to digitise library books was a “plain and brazen violation of copyright law”. Google Books won in 2013, with the district court ruling that “all society benefits” from the project, a decision that the supreme court declined to review earlier this year. “Why shouldn’t authors be asked permission, or even informed – not to mention compensated – before their work is used in this manner?” Rasenberger asks. “There’s no doubt the company has the means to do so.” It doesn’t harm the authors and is done for a very different purpose from the authors’, so it’s fair use under US law. Google spokesman Google wouldn’t say whether getting hold of 11,000 authors was beyond their capacities, or if they have any plans to reward the writers, or if the people whose expertise was harvested to train their network were ever considered as individuals. While attribution “isn’t required”, the spokesman says via email, “the researchers clearly identify where they got the data”. “The machine learning community has long published open research with these kinds of datasets, including many academic researchers with this set of free ebooks – it doesn’t harm the authors and is done for a very different purpose from the authors’, so it’s fair use under US law.” But Rasenberger isn’t convinced. “The research in question uses these novels for the exact purpose intended by their authors – to be read,” she argues. “It shouldn’t matter whether it’s a machine or a human doing the copying and reading, especially when behind the machine stands a multi-billion dollar corporation which has time and again bent over backwards devising ways to monetise creative content without compensating the creators of that content.” Rasenberger adds that nobody knows how books will be read or used in the future, which is why the Authors Guild is proposing that digital uses should be allowed under a licensing system. But for the moment, “Google is extracting immense value from the creative efforts of thousands of authors and looking the other way”. For Forster, the lack of any proper attribution speaks volumes. “If they’re not mentioning the authors,” she says, “then maybe they’re not thinking of it in terms of it being someone’s work.” She never imagined her work would wind up as being part of someone else’s dataset, as raw ingredients to satisfy a machine’s hunger for information, but she’s “been around long enough to know that what you hope for isn’t always what you get”. “I would have loved to have been part of the discussion of this project, and to have known how it was going to be used,” she says. “But I’d also like to be thought of as intelligent enough to be able to make a decision about the end product.” More features Topics Publishing Google Self-publishing Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Reuse this content View all comments > Order by newest oldest recommendations Show 25 25 50 100 All Threads collapsed expanded unthreaded Loading comments… Trouble loading?

The new private browsing feature apes Incognito mode from the company's Chrome browser, along with its dark window theme, but adds an extra layer of privacy, too. Like Chrome, search and browse history are not saved when the mode is enabled, but Google app users can also enable Touch ID for the feature, allowing them to re-enter an existing Incognito session after exiting the app. Additionally, the Google app gets inline support for YouTube videos, allowing for instant playback within search results, instead of being switched to another browser window or the YouTube app. The update also renames Google Now to "the feed", and brings increased stability for iOS 10 users as well as performance improvements that promise to reduce crashes by half. The new Incognito mode does not appear to have rolled out to all users yet, but once it does, the mode can be enabled by tapping into the app's account settings screen and selecting "Turn on incognito". A hard press of the Google app icon from the home screen also turns up a 3D Touch option to enter the mode on compatible devices. The Touch ID feature can be configured in Incognito settings. Google Search can be downloaded from the App Store for free. [Direct Link] Tag: Google 20 comments Top Rated Comments (View all) hanser 7 weeks ago Google don't sell your data.

Okay, I understand Learn more Latest UK Retailers Facing One Million Fraud Attempts Per Day ‘We'll Always Have Paris’ – Highlights from ISSE Conference 2016 US Government Releases New IoT Security Guidance Three Arrested After Suspected Insider Breach at Three IT Decentralization Has Deep Security Impact   News Topics Features Webinars White Papers Events & Conferences Directory Search Infosecurity Magazine Home » News » Google Launches All-Out War on XSS 28 Sep 2016 News Google Launches All-Out War on XSS Phil Muncaster UK / EMEA News Reporter , Infosecurity Magazine Email Phil Follow @philmuncaster Google has released a new set of tools designed to help firms better fortify their web systems against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks using the Content Security Policy (CSP) mechanism. After more than a decade at the top, XSS is still one of the most popular bugs affecting organizations across the globe and even Google has ended up paying out over $1 million over the past two years in related bug bounties. CSP was designed to mitigate the risk of XSS vulnerabilities, allowing developers to set policies to restrict which scripts can execute, so that even if attackers can inject HTML into a vulnerable page, they shouldn’t be able to load malicious scripts and other resources, Google explained. However, it doesn’t always work. Google claimed it analyzed over one million domains and found 95% of CSP policies are ineffective. “One of the underlying reasons is that out of the 15 domains most commonly whitelisted by developers for loading external scripts as many as 14 expose patterns which allow attackers to bypass CSP protections,” Google explained in a blog post. “We believe it's important to improve this, and help the web ecosystem make full use of the potential of CSP.” To help out, Google has released CSP Evaluator, a new tool designed to detect misconfigurations, ensure policies provide meaningful security benefit and make sure they can’t be subverted by hackers. However, the tool might fall short because of the number of popular domains which allow the CSP to be bypassed. In those instances a “nonce-based” CSP policy is best. “Instead of whitelisting all allowed script locations, it’s often simpler to modify the application to prove that a script is trusted by the developer by giving it a nonce – an unpredictable, single-use token which has to match a value set in the policy,” Google explained. A new “strict dynamic” feature in the upcoming CSP3 specification apparently makes adopting the above much simpler, even in complex modern apps. Google also announced the release of the CSP Mitigator – a Chrome extension designed to help developers review an application for compatibility with nonce-based CSP. CSP adoption will be in its Patch Reward Program to reward any efforts that make popular open-source web frameworks compatible with nonce-based CSP. Gareth O’Sullivan, EMEA director of solutions architecture at WhiteHat Security, revealed that 86% of the 30,000 sites his firm reviewed last year had at least one serious vulnerability where an attacker could compromise the system. “You might be surprised to hear that it takes an average of 193 days to remediate website vulnerabilities that are fixed, ­not to mention that 39% of flaws are never closed,” he added. “Remediation is a major problem and it is not enough for anyone just to find problems if they are never going to get fixed for whatever reason. We have to make remediation easier and cheaper, otherwise the web is just not going to get more secure."

One fixes bugs so that the app is twice as reliable, Google said. Another allows in-search YouTube videos. And then there's the new incognito mode. Incognito mode, first introduced in Google Chrome, allows users to browse in private without their viewing history, downloads, cookies, accounts and passwords being saved. One use is looking at questionable content. Incognito mode also can help users shop for surprise gifts and avoid paywall limits, and serve as a browser that's already logged out of all accounts. The secret browsing feature is common across browsers, but hasn't been prominent for search apps. As an additional security measure -- if you really don't want people knowing what you're looking up -- Google's incognito mode for its app can be enabled with Touch ID, ensuring that only your fingerprints can allow access to your secret sessions. Along with adding secret searches to its iOS app, Google has integrated YouTube video playback from within the app, instead of opening a separate app to watch clips. "Skip the extra step before you break into dance to your favorite music video or before you learn a thing or two in the latest how-to," Google wrote on its blog. The updates for iOS come a week before Google's Oct. 4 media event, where the tech giant is expected to reveal a new phone, Google Home, a digital voice assistant and an update to its Chromecast, a digital media player. A source familiar with the update said the changes were not a preview of what's to come for Google's new phones.

(Same Love (Remix) by Art Attack) Share Written by Lily Kuo September 28, 2016 Quartz africa The United States will soon be welcoming one of Kenya’s most outspoken anti-gay rights campaigners to attend a Google conference on digital literacy and safety. Ezekiel Mutua, head of the Kenya Film Classification Board (KFCB), who has been on a crusade to ban any content that “promotes homosexuality” bragged on Facebook that he had no trouble getting a US visa to attend Google’s Web Rangers global summit at its headquarters in Mountain View, California. In contrast to the Kenyan entrepreneurs, students, children, and others who are often refused visas, Mutua’s was delivered promptly and free of charge, according to his post: Ezekiel Mutua is the King of Petty 😂 pic.twitter.com/0tFAT3yM7n — Masaku (@masaku_) September 26, 2016 On Twitter and Facebook, Kenyans called Mutua a petty and dangerous religious zealot. Others asked if the US could keep him. In response, Mutua called one of his detractors a “bloody fool” and took down his Facebook post. Dear, @POTUS Is it possible to retain this person @EzekielMutua there forever? Sincerely, All Kenyans. https://t.co/PQqyCl4f4T — So Nice. (@Ninanyce) September 26, 2016 As head of the government agency that regulates all visual content in the country, Mutua is best known for demanding that Youtube take down a music video celebrating gay love. (Youtube kept it online but flagged it for “potentially inappropriate” content.) Homosexuality is a criminal offense in Kenya, punishable with up to 14 years in prison. Mutua also banned a film made by the arts collective Nest, Stories of Our Lives, based the Kenya’s LGBT community; a podcast hosted by a lesbian actor and singer duo; and a gay speed-dating event in Nairobi. When Netflix first launched in Kenya, Mutua called it a threat to the country’s “moral values and national security.” Earlier this month, Mutua also described atheism as a form of radicalization. “The crusade on moral values is gathering momentum,” he said. Google confirmed that Mutua has been invited to the summit, an internal event for policymakers and advocates for online safety around the world. “Politicians have many questions about the internet and Google. To help answer these questions Google has a team that engages with and responds to queries from politicians and sometimes we invite them to events so they can get an understanding of the work we do,” a representative for Google Kenya said.

 Google says its AI software is now almost as good at translating Chinese as a human Rob Price Sep. 28, 2016, 4:22 AM 2,227 facebook linkedin twitter email print Kevin Frayer/Getty Images Google is super-charging its translation software with artificial intelligence (AI). The Californian tech giant has announced that it is implementing its neural networking AI tech into Google Translate — with radically improved results. Simply put, neural networks are AI modelled on connections in the human brain, capable of learning and improving over time. Google has been aggressively introducing the tech into its core products in attempts to improve efficiency. It has been used for everything from reducing the power bill of the company's enormous data centres, to defeating the human world champion of ancient Chinese board game Go in a highly publicised bout. It's now being used in Google Translate, starting with Chinese-to-English translations, with plans for other language pairs in the works. The Google Neural Machine Translation system (or GMNT, as Google is catchily calling it) is reducing translation errors by between 55 and 85%, the company says. And according to its research, its translations score only just below those of human translations. Take a look at the chart below: A theoretical perfect translation scores a 6, but these basically never happen, even with human translators. But humans still translate much more effectively than traditional phrase-based translation software. GMNT manages to close the gap considerably. Google That said, it's definitely not perfect, and Google admits as much. "GNMT can still make significant errors that a human translator would never make," two research scientists for the Google Brain Team wrote in a blog post, "like dropping words and mistranslating proper names or rare terms, and translating sentences in isolation rather than considering the context of the paragraph or page." The GMNT software is live now on all Chinese-to-English translations — of which Google says it processes 18 million a day.

Translation image: Lemontree Images/Shutterstock Advances in neural machine translation system are behind new web and mobile versions of Google Translate that can now translate Chinese into English in entire sentences. Google is intent on winning the war for leadership in the world of artificial intelligence, and one of the most coherent ways of doing this is by breaking the language barrier. The Google Neural Machine Translation system (GNMT) take on a sentence as a whole and translates this into another language. Evolution of Google Translate The company said since it first launched Google Translate 10 years ago, rapid advances in machine intelligence have improved its speech recognition and image recognition capabilities. Google said that GNMT achieves the largest improvements to date for machine translation quality. In a new technical paper, Google research scientists Quoc V. Le and Mike Schuster from the Google Brain Team chart the move from phase-based machine translation to neural machine translation, which considers entire input sentences as a unit for translation. “Using human-rated side-by-side comparison as a metric, the GNMT system produces translations that are vastly improved compared to the previous phrase-based production system,” the researchers said. “GNMT reduces translation errors by more than 55pc-85pc on several major language pairs measured on sampled sentences from Wikipedia and news websites, with the help of bilingual human raters,” the researchers said.

By Charlie Osborne for Zero Day | September 28, 2016 -- 07:59 GMT (00:59 PDT) | Topic: Developer CNET Google has released two new tools for developers looking to protect web domains against XSS scripting security flaws. Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a common security issue web developers face today. The attack, which relies on vulnerabilities which allow the injection of malicious codes into trusted websites and applications, can lead to malvertising campaigns, watering hole attacks, and drive-by attacks which do not need victims, visiting a trusted site, to do anything more than open a page. Content Security Policy (CSP) is often the answer for web developers to stay clear of such attacks. CSP, support by all major browsers, can be used to restrict programming input and scripts and prevent them executing, even if attackers are able to inject malicious code into vulnerable web pages. This week, the Mountain View, California-based firm said in a blog post that in a recent study, Google found that 95 percent of deployed CSP policies deployed in over one billion domains were "ineffective" as a protection against XSS-based exploits and attacks. "One of the underlying reasons is that out of the 15 domains most commonly whitelisted by developers for loading external scripts as many as 14 expose patterns which allow attackers to bypass CSP protections," Google says. "We believe it's important to improve this, and help the web ecosystem make full use of the potential of CSP." In order to ramp up CSP policy protections, Google has released the CSP Evaluator, a tool used by Google engineers which gives developers a visual glance into the effect of setting a policy. The tool also alerts the user when subtle, small misconfigurations could lead to the far more wide-reaching issue of XSS vulnerabilities. The company also recommends that developers consider setting a "nonce" -- an unpredictable, single-used token which has to match a value set in CSP policies -- to further enhance web security. The second tool Google has now released is the CSP Mitigator, a Chrome extension which helps developers review compatibility applications with nonce-based CSP. The extension can be configured to collect data on any programming patterns which need an overhaul to support CSP, including scripts with incorrect nonce attributes, JavaScript, and inline event handlers. CSP Mitigator can be enabled for any URL prefix. Google commented: "We hope that increased attention to this area will also encourage researchers to find new, creative ways to circumvent CSP restrictions, and help us further improve the mechanism so that we can better protect Internet users from web threats."

You’re probably aware of the Google Allo SMS app as well, and it looks like Mr. Snowden is not a fan for the reasons you would expect… privacy. Once you post anything online, it’s there to stay. While you can remove traces of posts, tweets, and other information on the net, you will never get it all — especially in the day and age of screen shots. Anytime a new company drops a major messaging app or assistant, it’s big news as is the case with the Google Allo release. Several privacy concerns have already been brought to light, and now Edward Snowden is giving his opinion as well. If you’re wondering what Allo is, it’s basically a messenger and personal assistant all-in-one. It’s Google’s version of Whatsapp to a degree, and as it’s Google, it is bound to get millions of downloads. Not everyone is a fan as you can clearly see by the tweet sent from Edward Snowden below… Free for download today: Google Mail, Google Maps, and Google Surveillance. That’s #Allo. Don’t use Allo. https://t.co/EdPRC0G7Py – Edward Snowden (@Snowden) September 21, 2016 While many may not agree with Snowden’s stance on certain things, there is a bit of cause for alarm. At launch, the Google Allo privacy features were changed as it was supposed to only keep your information for a set amount of time. Well, that changed as it doesn’t use end-to-end encryption, which opens the doors for warrants from the police and big brother. For some folks, that isn’t going to be an issue although unscrupulous individuals or those concerned about their privacy would obviously have big problems with the Google Allo app. Not to mention, it’s also just a little creepy considering most of us expect our communications to stay private when we’re sending out SMS messages. You can bet the Google Allo privacy concerns are far from over as we expect to hear more about things in the weeks to come. That said, the app was just released and Google has never been one to shy away from changing things, so it may not be an issue at all down the road.
