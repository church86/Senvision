The police released an alert on social media on Wednesday after a representative from the Nottinghamshire-based company Local Exposure Ltd visited businesses in the town to promote their Google Street View photography service. The service allows potential customers to view the inside of a business as well as the outside on the Google service Street View. However, the police quickly retracted the message they had posted on Twitter and subsequently published an apology the following day. Market Rasen Police wrote on Facebook: “We would like to extend our apologies to Local Exposure Limited. “Yesterday we incorrectly stated their Google-based Street View company was conducting a scam, however we would like to confirm this is a genuine company and we apologise for any loss of business they may have suffered as a result of this error.” One Market Rasen business owner said her confidence in the local policing team had been ‘knocked’ as a result of the Twitter alert. Jenny Brown, of the Ministry of Happiness soap shop, in Queen Street, said: “I had just invested nearly £250 in Local Exposure services – which is a lot of money for a small business like mine to invest in advertising – when I saw Market Rasen police’s alert. “After I saw the alert I tried to get in contact with the local police but couldn’t get through, so I contacted Local Exposure to cancel my purchase. “They assured me they were a legitimate company, but I took the police’s alert very seriously as, generally, they don’t put out many alerts of this nature. “To me, it was the local police’s word against the company’s – and one assumes the local police has your best interests at heart – so I cancelled my payment. “When it comes from the police, the alert carries a lot of weight. “It has certainly knocked my confidence in social media posts from the police.” A spokesman for Local Exposure said: “Someone got the wrong end of the stick and the matter was quickly resolved. “We may have lost a couple of customers, but everything as far as we know is smoothed over. “We have been assured that the policing team have changed their social media policy.” ○ Anyone who believes they have been a victim of a scam or someone may be trying to scam them should contact police on the 101 number. Police declined to make any further comment about the incident.

Browse Full Report Visit – http://www.acutemarketreports.com/report/sea-change-series Scale is a vital part of the technology used to support next generation data centers.  The study is targeted to C-level executives that need to move quickly and surely to improve IT.  Automation of IT depends on understanding the business market opportunity from an independent perspective.  Vendors are smart but they are committed to the technology they are pushing, the Sea Change Series from WinterGreen Research is able to provide a perspective not available anywhere else. Extreme scale is what brings enough pathways inside a Mega data center to create a non-blocking (CLOS) networked server architecture.  Non-blocking network architecture benefits the business because it permits launching thousands of virtual severs on demand at the application layer.  In this manner, innovation can be made to happen quickly. Using a mega data center, DevOps and/or automated processes can request and deploy additional resource without backing the Dell truck up to the data center every week to provide on-demand capacity.  Automated deprovisioning handles freeing of surplus resources, while being virtual means not having stacks of surplus hardware to dispose of as underutilized capital assets. Modern data centers are organized into processing nodes that manage different applications at a layer above infrastructure.     Data is stored permanently and operated on in place.  These are the two technologies to check for when choosing a data center.  These architectural features provide economies of scale that greatly reduce the IT spend while offering better quality IT. Once scale is in place, then the economies of scale kick in.  When negotiating for cloud capability, managers need to check to see that sufficient multiple pathways are available to reach any node in a non-blocking manner.  Non-blocking architecture is more efficient than other IT infrastructure and supports better innovation for apps and smart digitization.  Not all cloud architectures offer this business benefit. The Cloud 2.0 mega data center platform fabric technologies support the digital economy by creating scale with a network internal to the mega data center system image.  Without scale, there are not enough pathways inside the data center to enable elimination of bottlenecks.  Access to every node in the fabric, and multiple duplicate pathways to every node are needed to enable real time application connectivity.  With sufficient scale, if one pathway is blocked, there are enough other pathways to get to the desired node resources. To Get Complete Report @ http://www.acutemarketreports.com/report/sea-change-series The theme of this study is that scale matters. Scale can be implemented by IT, but the executive needs to understand that there is a difference between different technologies.  In a mega data center, the system is implemented as a fabric:  servers are linked to top of rack switches, which are made from merchant silicon chips, mostly Broadcom, some switch ASICs.  A pod of server racks are linked to each other through an edge aggregation switch.  A pod of server racks is based on the same ASICs as in the top of rack switches. The importance of nonblocking architecture is compelling.  Aggregation switches are lashed together through a set of non-blocking spine switches.  All switches are based on the same chip.   This is precisely the way Facebook is building its own Wedge and 6-pack open switches– nine years after Google did it.  The amazing thing is that Facebook had not done this already. The four superstar companies that are able to leverage IT to achieve growth, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and the leader AWS all use Clos architecture.  What is significant is that systems have to hit a certain scale before Clos networks work   Clos networks are what work now for flexibility and supporting innovation in an affordable manner.  There is no dipping your toe in to try the system to see if it will work, it will not and then the IT says, “We tried that, we failed,” but what the executive needs to understand is that scale matters.  A little mega data center does not exist.  Only scale works. Maybe scale is not the only answer, maybe in 20 years, Quantum computing will bring a new data center system, but for now, Clos architecture and scale dominate those IT centers that have the strongest growth engine. Business leaders are challenged to move their enterprises to the next level of competition.  An effective digital business player, transformer, and disruptor position depends on the effectiveness of employing digital technologies and leveraging connected digital systems.  Organizational, operational, and business model innovation are needed to create ways of operating and growing the business using mega data center cloud technologies, systems are evolving.  It is a journey to achieve the connected enterprise, ultimately connecting all employees and a trillion connected devices. Many companies are using digital technology to create market disruption.  Amazon, Uber, Google, IBM, and Microsoft represent companies using effective disruptive strategic positioning.  As entire industries shift to the digital world, once buoyant companies are threatened with disappearing.  A digital transformation represents an approach that enables organizations to drive changes in their business models and ecosystems leveraging cloud computing, and not just hyperscale systems but leveraging mega data centers.  Just as robots make work more automated, so also cloud based communications systems implement the IoT digital connectivity transformation. Disruption in the business markets represents major opportunity for vendors with cloud offerings.  This is part of a larger digital transformation, a digital approach to interconnecting everything that enables organizations to drive changes in their business models and ecosystems. Disruptive cloud systems are provided by Amazon (AWS), Microsoft, Google, and Facebook.  Data centers are in a class by themselves, they have functioning fully automatic, self-healing, networked mega datacenters that operate at fiber optic speeds to create a fabric that can access any node in any particular data center because there are multiple pathways to every node.   In this manner, they automate applications integration for any data in the mega data center. By leveraging digital competencies, businesses can grow faster than they would otherwise.  A digital strategy, in conjunction with the appropriate unified communications solution permits the implementation of innovative communications services.  Digital connectivity with combined voice, video and file transfer can help organizations and their end users innovate and compete more effectively.  It is imperative that organizations have a digital communications strategy in place. Browse All Reports of This Category – http://www.acutemarketreports.com/category/agriculture-market This is an era where the distinction between the technologies and processes that businesses deploy is tightly linked.  Digital technology directly impacts customers and markets.  The boundary between internal operations of the enterprise and its external ecosystem is rapidly disappearing.  Customers, markets, competitors, partners, and regulators are inextricably linked. According to Susan Eustis, lead author of the team that prepared the study, “Mega data centers need to be understood by all senior executives whether they move in that direction or not.  These are the IT used by the fastest growing organizations Google, AWS, Microsoft, and Facebook.  There are 25 Sea Change Data Center study modules describing different aspects of the move to mega data centers.  The Scale module describes that it is not sufficient just to try certain cloud techniques. “Scale is an essential aspect of the data center positioning for these leading companies.  These companies use Clos networks as their data center implementations.    This module addresses how and why scale in the mega data center is important.  The market shift to non-blocking network inside data center building means companies have to hit a certain scale before Clos networks work.” WinterGreen Research is an independent research organization funded by the sale of market research studies all over the world and by the implementation of ROI models that are used to calculate the total cost of ownership of equipment, services, and software.  The company has 35 distributors worldwide, including Global Information Info Shop, Market Research.com, Research and Markets, electronics.ca, and Thompson Financial.  It conducts its business with integrity.

Google sends them out when it detects a "government-backed attacker" has attempted to hack an account through phishing or malware. Last time I saw one, I added two-factor authentication to many of my accounts. This time it prompted me to ask: Can I do even better? [ Further reading: How the new age of antivirus software will protect your PC ] Martyn Williams/IDGNS A security warning message displayed by Google. It turns out I can. Google suggests a security key as a more secure alternative. These are little USB devices that generate one-time tokens in place of the six-digit codes from authenticator apps. Google supports a format called FIDO Universal 2nd Factor (U2F), which it helped develop. Keys are available that work over USB, Bluetooth, and NFC, so they can be used with a smartphone or tablet in addition to a PC. Martyn Williams/IDGNS Hardware security keys from Feitian (left) and Yubico. They are really easy to use. First, once you've bought a key, it needs to be registered with the site. When subsequently logging in, a prompt appears after a username and password have been entered. Authenticating with the key is simply a matter of plugging it into a USB socket and pressing the small gold disc. MARTYN WILLIAMS/IDGNS A dialog box greets users signing into a Facebook account protected by a security key. The disc triggers the key to transmit a 44-character code to confirm the login. The first 12 characters of the code are the public key of the device being used and the remaining 32 are a unique passcode for the login attempt. On a smartphone, an NFC key can simply be placed against the back of the phone to send the codes. And that's all there is to it. It's much easier than juggling a smartphone and authentication codes. Before you commit U2F is currently only supported by two browsers, Google Chrome and Opera. Together, they account for about two-thirds of desktop browsing and are available on Windows, macOS, and Linux, so a good portion of the market is covered, but if you prefer Firefox, Safari, or another browser, you'll need to switch. And U2F only works on a handful of sites and services at present, but they do include some major ones like Google, Facebook, Salesforce, GitHub, and DropBox. Simply securing your Google and Facebook accounts might be compelling enough to add a security key to your key ring because both sites are prime targets for cyberattacks and identify theft. But, if you use an iPhone or iPad, bad news. The keys don't properly work with these devices. You should have no problem with Android. Martyn Williams/IDGNS Yubico's smallest key can slip into a wallet or remain in an USB socket. Also consider logistics. With an authenticator app, the codes are wherever your phone is, and your phone is usually with you. With a security key, you'll need to carry it around. The good news is that it's small, very sturdy and easily sits on a keyring. Know your standards The security key can also be used to protect access to a password manager. The Dashlane password manager supports FIDO U2F, while several other competitors, including LastPass, support OTP, a similar but incompatible standard, so you need to be careful while shopping as not all keys will generate both U2F and OTP codes. Some of the most popular keys come from Yubico and most support both U2F and OTP, but the cheapest of the company's line-up isn't compatible with OTP. One step forward, two steps back While Google and Facebook both promote security keys as a better way to keep your account safe, both companies have a potential hole in their implementations. If you set a recovery phone number to receive security codes via SMS, that phone number remains active until you disable it. That's a problem because SMS is not a secure transmission channel. Hackers have already managed to attack bank accounts protected with SMS-based authentication codes due to weaknesses in the protocol. So, you need to disable phone backup. The security settings pages in both Google and Facebook will allow you to do that. While you're in there, it's a good idea to set up account login alerts, so you if someone does manage to get into your account by no matter what means, you'll know about it. Google and Facebook wouldn't comment on their use of security keys. Where can you use security keys? Yubico has a helpful matrix on its site detailing compatibility, and there are a couple of listings of sites that support security keys and the standards they use. One is maintained by Yubico, but the most exhaustive I found was from Germany's Nitrokey, which also sells security keys.

Google. Amazon. EU Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has challenged them all. Vestager and other Danish ministers on their way to meet Queen Margrethe, 2011. Photographer: Linda Henriksen/Scanpix/Sipa USA by Samanth Subramanian More stories by Samanth Subramanian May 10, 2017, 12:01 AM EDT From Subscribe Reprints The Black Diamond library sits at a slight forward slant on Copenhagen’s riverfront, resembling a pair of Borg spaceships peering into the water. On the morning of a European Commission citizens’ dialogue in early February, the building’s coal-dark facades were slicked with rain and mist, but more than 100 people had trooped into its auditorium. The event was an episode in a traveling roadshow in which the 28 European Union commissioners—one per member state, each with a portfolio such as trade or transport—take turns fielding questions and explaining their policies. This was the 131st such dialogue since late 2014, and it was genteel in a typically EU way: fruit and water before, wine and finger food after, and an evident faith throughout that civil, measured discussion can resolve any problem. One of the two commissioners anchoring the dialogue was Margrethe Vestager, the Danish politician who has found a heated celebrity as head of the EU’s directorate general for competition. Her job as chief sleuth requires her to protect the union’s vision of a fair market, and she’s set about it with gusto. Last August, Vestager announced that Ireland had granted Apple Inc. illegal tax benefits, and she directed the company to pay more than $14 billion in back taxes and interest. It was a rare boulder slung at a Goliath, and it drew cheers in many quarters in the U.S. and overseas. Vestager’s entire tenure has been laced with an instinctive mistrust of big corporations. She’s driven investigations of Amazon.com, Fiat, Gazprom, Google, McDonald’s, and Starbucks—and she still has two and a half years remaining in her term. Rulings on McDonald’s and Amazon, both under scrutiny for their tax deals with Luxembourg, are imminent. If Vestager levies a multibillion-dollar fine against Google—a distinct possibility because the company is fighting three separate European antitrust cases—she will truly set headlines aflame. Google came under review for allegedly forcing Android phone manufacturers to pre-install its suite of apps, favoring its own comparison-shopping services in its search results, and preventing third-party websites from sourcing ads from its competitors. As with Apple and Amazon, these cases were bequeathed to Vestager by her predecessor, but she’s accelerated them to their finish lines. Large American multinationals aren’t used to being stymied overseas, and Vestager’s consistent readiness to face off against them has provoked a startled fury. Tim Cook, Apple’s chief executive officer, called the tax decision against his company “total political crap.” And a group of 185 American CEOs appealed directly to European heads of government to reverse the ruling, describing it as “a grievous self-inflicted wound.” Even the U.S. government has felt the need to speak out. A white paper released by the Department of the Treasury last August criticized Vestager’s office for acting like a “supranational tax authority” and setting “an undesirable precedent.” In late March the office of the U.S. Trade Representative reiterated its opinion, as part of a broader report, that Vestager is deviating too far from prior case law. One former Treasury official from the Obama administration said Vestager’s staff resembled “a bunch of plumbers doing electrical work.” Vestager. Photographer: Tine Claerhout for Bloomberg Businessweek None of this has dissuaded Vestager, who continues to defend one of the EU’s foundational philosophies: that a well-policed economy yields the largest and most widespread benefits for society. At a moment when the EU is convulsing with fresh doubt—impelled by Brexit, various species of populist nationalism, Greek frailty, Russian meddling, and a disenchantment with euro zone debt—Vestager has become one of the most visible, vocal champions of the union. This year she made Time magazine’s list of the world’s 100 most influential people. “I think she’s tough and serious,” Anthony Gardner, the U.S. ambassador to the EU from 2014 to 2017, says. “I would even call her a superstar.” At the Black Diamond, she appeared from the wings with her Latvian colleague, Financial Stability Commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis, and a moderator. A year shy of 50, Vestager radiates efficiency and self-control. She never slouches; her clothes—here a mustard-yellow dress, olive jacket, and boots—appear polished but comfortable, picked out for long working hours; not one movement is superfluous. Even her hair, dusted with more gray than black now, has been cropped short for years, as if to give her one less thing to do every morning. During the event, she was the picture of diligence. When the panelists sat down, she uncapped water bottles for them; when the moderator conducted a set of quick audience polls, she took photos of upraised hands; when Dombrovskis talked about Europe’s wind-power industry, she twisted in her chair to listen to every word, not looking away from him once. In speaking about her work, Vestager is always fluently, adhesively on message. Even cursory attendance at her speeches and press events is enough to become familiar with her talking points. She frequently invokes the Treaty of Rome, which founded the European Economic Community 60 years ago, as a way of situating her office and its mission in the very headwaters of the EU. She likes to say Europe welcomes business of all kinds. “If you win on the market, that’s fair—we’ll congratulate you,” she said at the library. “But if you cheat on the way up, then that’s for us to look at.” Why wouldn’t companies want to be in Europe after all? “Europe is the best place to live on Earth, in history. Especially if you’re a woman.” “If you want to do business in Europe, you play by the European rule book” A tall man rose and introduced himself as a banker. The EU has had trouble inspiring much affection among its citizens, he said. “But here in Denmark, since Margrethe Vestager took over, the competition commission has become very close to people’s hearts.” Shouldn’t the EU reach out more, to become similarly beloved? “It’s not in explaining the details or showing the process that you find acceptance,” Vestager said. “It’s in showing results, showing that it works. You don’t want to follow the baker in every step he’s taking. You just want to eat the pastry. We’re not asking people to love everything—just to love the big thing.” Someone asked her if she’ll be warier of acting against American companies now that Donald Trump is president. The audience tittered uneasily, as Europeans tend to do at such events whenever Trump is mentioned. Nothing would change, she replied. “We’re not going hard at U.S. companies specifically. It’s not your flag that matters to us. What really matters is: If you want to do business in Europe, you play by the European rule book.” This was another of her well-worn aphorisms, but it masked the latest international wrinkles. Trump has already shown himself to be volatile on trade policy, reflexively defensive of U.S. interests, and an intermittent advocate of the collapse of the EU. His protectionist swagger has rattled Brussels; in March, Jean-Claude Juncker, the chief of the European Commission, warned that relations with Washington “have entered into a sort of estrangement,” and that any American tariffs on European products will trigger swift reciprocal action. If this happens, Vestager’s office will become even more politically charged, liable to be deployed in retaliation and to attract even more American anger. By pursuing her cases with near-moralistic zeal, “Vestager has stuck her neck out quite a lot,” a lobbyist in Brussels says. “If there is a trade war with the U.S., she will be in the eye of the storm.” Of course, boldness can reap political profit as well. One day in June 2008, when Vestager was the leader of a small Danish party called Radikale Venstre, she was stopped by a journalist in the corridors of the Parliament in Copenhagen. A suicide bomber had recently attacked the Danish embassy in Pakistan, and another politician had just observed that Denmark had now joined the ranks of the U.S. and Israel in being targeted by Islamic fundamentalists. Did she agree? “Margrethe said, ‘If that’s correct, we need to change our foreign policy,’ ” Henrik Kjerrumgaard, her communications adviser at the time, recalls. “Before she came back to her office, it was all over the news.” It wasn’t just that she’d suggested distancing Denmark from putative allies, but that she’d considered altering policy in response to terrorism. Kjerrumgaard’s advice was to either apologize or defend her opinion. She defended, unwilling to admit she’d misspoken. “In Danish, we have a word, aerekaer. You’re concerned about your honor, about how people will see you,” Kjerrumgaard says. Vestager’s aerekaer makes her a formidable opponent—meticulous in preparation; so polite and reserved in conversation that it’s easy to underestimate how doggedly she’ll pursue her vision of right and wrong. At the time of the embassy bombing, she had been leading Radikale Venstre for a year, during which the party was riven with infighting and invisible to the electorate. Her stance on the attack won her a lectern from which to expound her party’s other positions. Vestager had to grow into a comfort with boldness, though. “If your position is kind of blurry, and you don’t really know how to be approached, it’s very tricky to find a common position where you realize the compromises that you can make,” she says. It’s a paradox: “To make a good compromise, you have to have a strong starting position for people to know who they’re dealing with.” Speaking at Radikale Venstre, 1994. Photographer: Annelise Fibaek /Polfoto/Ritzau Vestager began her political career in 1988, at 20, working for Radikale Venstre—in direct translation, the “Radical Left,” though the party is habitually cast as the Social Liberals. Its principles are centrist, leaning toward economic conservatism. It’s small, more than a century old, happiest when playing kingmaker in parliamentary coalitions and indulging in policy wonkery. Vestager’s maternal great-grandfather helped found the party, and her parents were members. Her mother ran unsuccessfully for Parliament, and her father served in the municipal council in Varde, out on the peat bogs of the Jutland peninsula. Lutheran pastors both, the doors of their house were open to anyone who wanted to drop by for advice or spiritual succor. “They were very engaged in local society,” Vestager says. “That was the message I got and brought with me.” Her parents’ stature in their town drew Vestager out of her natural reserve. “You grow up as kind of a public person,” says Elisabet Svane, her biographer. “In the summer, all the people from church would come home for coffee, and they’d be sitting in the garden—nearly 200 people. She was supposed to sit and talk to people. She didn’t like it. She hated it. But she liked to bring the coffee, do practical things.” Even today she has slim patience with chitchat, says Lars Nielsen, one of her friends. Vestager rapidly shinned up the party’s ranks. When she was 29, she was put in charge of two ministries, education and ecclesiastical affairs, and served on several government committees; Radikale Venstre was transparently grooming her to lead it. Her reputation as a thorough but prickly—even callous—politician grew. Almost inevitably, she acquired the label “ice queen.” Nielsen describes Vestager’s fondness for applying her personal rule book to every sphere of politics and for the binary worldview that came of it: “We cannot negotiate here. Is it black or white? Is it A or B? Right or wrong?” He recalls the tale of a cabinet minister who thought he was approaching the end of a negotiation with Vestager when she decided that he had the wrong interpretation of a particular document page. She dressed him down as a teacher might an indolent student. “He thought it was part of her strategy. No, no—it was because he hadn’t done his homework,” Nielsen says. Vestager with Thomas Steen Jensen at their 1994 wedding. Photographer: Nordfoto/Scanpix/Sipa USA In the fall of 2011, Vestager’s career reached a fulcrum. A conservative government, convinced it made fiscal sense to cut unemployment and early retirement benefits, staked its survival on the issues by calling fresh elections. Vestager supported the reforms, but she befuddled everyone by declaring her allegiance to an electoral alliance of left-leaning parties that were promising to roll back the austerity measures. When the coalition won, Vestager and the leaders of her allied parties hunkered down in a hotel on the outskirts of Copenhagen to wrangle over policy details and cabinet positions. On the question of cutting welfare, she refused to back down—part of the reason the negotiations lasted three weeks. Everyone would get there at 8 a.m. or 9 a.m., Kjerrumgaard remembers, and spend the day bickering and confabulating, leaving for home only around midnight. He describes Vestager as a formidable negotiator. “She won’t ask ‘Is your coffee warm?’ or anything like that. She doesn’t care. She’ll just shut down and look at you.” She cleaves, he says, to the advice of one of her mentors: “Politics is about taking, not about giving.” Vestager’s determination to slash welfare benefits might seem at odds with her current enthusiasm for challenging capitalism’s giants, and it’s tempting to conclude that her thinking shifted. But her nimbleness on economic policy reflects her party’s tradition of pragmatism—and, perhaps, her parents’ crisp ministering to their congregants’ difficulties. At one point during those weeks in the hotel, Vestager realized she was in control of the parleys, and she made an audacious demand: the finance ministry for herself. As she expected, Helle Thorning-Schmidt, the prime minister-elect, declined. Vestager called the marriage off. “We went into our room, emptied it, packed our bags, and left the hotel,” Kjerrumgaard says. After a day, he recalls, Vestager invited Thorning-Schmidt to her house. “She was controlling the venue—‘Come to me, have some pizza, let’s find a solution.’ ” Thorning-Schmidt offered Vestager a troika of titles—deputy prime minister, minister of the economy, minister of the interior—amalgamated into a single job just for her. The austerity measures remained in place. Four years after taking over a small, flailing party, the minister’s daughter had become the second-most powerful person in Denmark Vestager’s Biggest Cases APPLE Investigation: State aid from Ireland Status: Apple ordered to pay €13 billion ($14.3 billion) plus interest; appeal under way GOOGLE Investigation: Three antitrust cases Status: Decision pending AMAZON.COM Investigation: State aid from Luxembourg Status: Decision pending McDONALD’S Investigation: State aid from Luxembourg Status: Decision pending FIAT Investigation: State aid from Luxembourg Status: Fiat ordered to pay €20 million to €30 million; appeal under way GAZPROM Investigation: Antitrust Status: EU member states ­evaluating a deal involving changes to Gazprom’s practices and no fine STARBUCKS Investigation: State aid from the Netherlands Status: Starbucks ordered to pay €30 million; appeal under way Vestager’s European Commission office in the Berlaymont building in Brussels is large, comfortable, and awash with light. Her desk faces a window; she prefers to conduct meetings across a long table that bisects the room. Atop a side cabinet are dozens of framed photographs of her family: her husband, who teaches high school mathematics, and their three daughters. A cloud of cloth butterflies—made, she says, by Tibetan orphans—is pinned to the back wall. Her Fuck Finger is the centerpiece of a low coffee table. The Finger—a fist with an upraised middle digit, cast in white plaster—is one of many aspects about Vestager that have become totemic during her rise to fame, known widely but also imprecisely. It’s commonly believed to have been sent to her by an infuriated Danish union when, as minister of the economy, she was pushing for austerity. The unionists actually gave it to her in a little ceremony of passive-aggressive respect at her office. She thanked them for participating in democracy, and they all drank beers and Cokes. Incidents of this sort helped turn Vestager from a politician into a personality—a distinctive voice within the otherwise milquetoast chorus of Danish politics. The lead character in the televised Danish political drama Borgen—a dynamic prime minister, adept at navigating coalitions—is based on her, though she says she’s never seen the resemblance. Her relentless energy once worried her staff. “People feel stressed when they get updates about how you went out and ran 6 kilometers, baked buns, packed the kids’ lunchboxes, and went to an early meeting at 7:45 fresh,” Kjerrumgaard once told her. “Why don’t you say you fell in a puddle? Something that makes you human?” With one of her three daughters, 1999. Photographer: Jens Noergaard/Nordfoto/Scanpix/Sipa USA Through the thick of the recession, Vestager struggled to revive Denmark’s economy. She presented two growth packages in two years and pared away welfare expenditures, never a warmly received move in her country. In 2012, trying to explain the inevitability of austerity, she let slip a stray remark—“That’s how it is”—that went viral; she was eviscerated for being uncaring and out of touch. That same year she chaired meetings of Europe’s economic and finance ministers. Relying in part on that experience, Thorning-Schmidt named Vestager to the European Commission in 2014, where Juncker put her in charge of competition. Within the EU, the DG Comp—the directorate general for competition—considers itself an enforcement agency, wedded only to the rule of law and above the politicking that riddles the bureaucracy elsewhere. With the research capacities of a 900-strong staff, Vestager makes decisions related to cartelization and antitrust, approves or rejects mergers, and investigates state aid cases, in which member countries single out companies for unfair advantages such as tax breaks. In the U.S., state aid by way of targeted tax incentives is a legitimate strategy to lure investment; in Europe, it’s a forbidden tactic. That aside, the spirit of competition laws in the EU and the U.S. is identical; in its reckoning of what will impair the free market, though, the EU tends to exercise more caution than the U.S. “What you find is basically the same as Adam and Eve. It’s about greed. … Or sometimes fear” Commissioners come into their offices with varying objectives. “Vestager has made the tax investigations a very big priority indeed,” says Gert-Jan Koopman, a deputy director general in DG Comp. He disagrees with the perception that Vestager nurses a vendetta against American companies. The splashiest cases of her tenure—Amazon, Apple, and Starbucks—were all opened by Joaquín Almunia of Spain. “It’s very unreasonable to claim that she proactively decided to go after these companies,” Koopman says. The numbers bear this out. Of the 276 companies involved in antitrust cases opened by Almunia, 39 were American; in Vestager’s term, the breakdown is 11 of 81. Since state aid and tax cases technically concern EU member states, DG Comp doesn’t record the nationality of the companies involved. But over the past 15 years, of the 150 or so cases in which countries were directed to recover state aid they’d illegally doled out, fewer than 5 percent of the beneficiary companies have been American. The friction between corporate America and DG Comp is in some manner cultural. American executives are often flummoxed when Vestager discusses competition law in the severe moral terms of a Biblical patriarch. “When we have a case and you take away the specifics and the technicalities of the law, what you find is basically the same as Adam and Eve,” she says. “It’s about greed—wanting to have something and taking a shortcut to get it. Or sometimes fear—fear of being driven out of the market if your competitors are growing into a strong position.” Vestager makes it a point to abstain from glad-handing. She doesn’t, for instance, go to Davos, which transforms into Schmooze Central every year during the World Economic Forum. “In this portfolio, Davos is a little tricky,” she says. “People are more than welcome—CEOs if there is any issue—to come here for a meeting. In Davos, it’s something else.” She also refuses to meet lobbyists. Her office works best, she explains, when the consumer believes it to be fair—believes “that they haven’t decided the prices in the back office, they have not divided the market in some Gulf hotel over drinks.” Meetings between American CEOs and competition commissioners can go badly. When Anthony Gardner worked for GE Capital in the early 2000s, the then-competition commissioner, Mario Monti, spiked GE’s merger with Honeywell International Inc. “Jack Welch had thought this was a political decision—he could slam his fist on the table and threaten retaliation. It’s counterproductive. It doesn’t work,” Gardner says. As ambassador to the EU, Gardner met often with visiting CEOs on their way to meet Vestager and gave them an informal lay of the land. “I was very clear with them. Don’t go in and lecture. It won’t work with her,” he says. “And what they should not do is engage in a public-relations campaign of slamming the commission, which has unfortunately happened in a few cases.” When Apple’s Cook visited Vestager in her office in January 2016, she was at her steely best, one witness to the meeting says. “I think Mr. Cook was more in a lecturing mode, and somehow they didn’t really connect terribly well.” (Apple declined to comment for this story.) Being introduced as minister of ecclesiastical affairs, 1998. Photographer: Scanpix/Sipa USA Vestager says the Apple case is, in its principles, no different from any other state aid investigation. Her declaration of Apple’s $14 billion-plus-interest tax bill flared brightly, she says, “because it’s a big number, and because it’s a company that everyone knows.” No state aid ruling has ever resulted in a recovery so enormous. In a March 2016 letter to Vestager, Cook wrote that he was concerned “about the fairness of these proceedings”; when the decision was announced, Apple and Ireland promptly appealed it. The money will be placed in escrow until European courts deliver a final decision, a process that’s likely to take years. In the meantime, there will be other cases, other rulings. DG Comp is determining if Bayer AG’s $66 billion purchase of Monsanto Co. will make the EU’s agrochemical market anticompetitive. Vestager is also readying her decision on Luxembourg’s tax relationship with McDonald’s Corp., which could be ready before the European Commission breaks for the summer in August. Her investigation may already have forced McDonald’s to react; in December, the company announced it will shift its tax base to the U.K. However insistent Vestager might be that her job involves a pure application of the law, it’s also inarguably informed by politics. It is, for example, a political virtue to demonstrate to euroskeptics—as she does—Brussels’s supervision of its member states and its resolve to protect the welfare of Europe’s citizens. Despite recent wins for Europhilic leaders in France, Austria, and the Netherlands, populists have found growing audiences in calling for their countries to follow the U.K. out of the EU. “Apple shows how you fight against populism,” a senior EU official told Reuters last September. Vestager’s tenure and the Apple investigation have also coincided with a prolonged moment of discontent with the ethics of large corporations. “In general, there is a different sort of awareness and a legislative momentum on tax cases,” she says, attributing this attentiveness to the financial crisis and the tax-evasion revelations contained in the Luxembourg Leaks and Panama Papers episodes. “People have felt that benefits were cut in some member states, public salaries were cut maybe 10 to 15 percent—very hard-core decisions to get in control of your spending. And then, when people see that not all businesses contribute, I think the frustration and the anger about this have been largely underestimated.” The EU’s best response to all this instability, particularly across the Atlantic, Vestager says, is to double down on its core values. “I don’t think Europe should be defined by the U.S. administration. We have so much going for us. This is a great place. It’s a wonderful place to do business.” In the choppy new world order, if the U.S. abandons its post at the tiller and retreats into itself, Vestager says, “Europe can step forward to fill whatever vacuum might appear.” There is no room for worry, no time to fret. “I think it’s more an obligation to be an optimist. Pessimism will never get anything done.”   —With Aoife White   Terms of Service Trademarks Privacy Policy ©2017 Bloomberg L.P.

But they have all mistaken the threat: the AI we have let loose is already evolving for its own benefit. It’s easy to imagine that humans will build ever more clever computers; machines that will end up smarter than we are. Once they pass this point and achieve “superintelligence”, whether trapped inside boxes or installed in roving robots, they can either help or turn against us. To avoid this nightmare, the Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom says we must instil the superintelligence with goals that are compatible with our own survival and wellbeing. Hassabis, too, talks about getting “a better understanding of how these goal systems should be built, what values should the machines have”. They may not be dealing with threatening robots, but they are still talking about actual “machines” having values. But this is not where the threat lies. The fact is that all intelligence emerges in highly interconnected information processing systems; and through the internet we are providing just such a system in which a new kind of intelligence can evolve. Our future role in this machine? We might be like the humble mitochondrion, which supplies energy to our body’s cells This way of looking at AI rests on the principle of universal Darwinism – the idea that whenever information (a replicator) is copied, with variation and selection, a new evolutionary process begins. The first successful replicator on earth was genes. Their evolution produced all living things, including animals, whose intelligence emerged from brains consisting of interconnected neurons. The second replicator was memes, let loose when humans began to imitate each other. Imitation may seem a trivial ability, but it is very far from that. An animal that can imitate another brings a new level of evolution into being because habits, skills, stories and technologies (memes) are copied, varied and selected. Our brains had to quickly expand to handle the rapidly evolving memes, leading to a new kind of emergent intelligence. The third replicator is, I suggest, already here, but we are not seeing its true nature. We have built machines that can copy, combine, vary and select enormous quantities of information with high fidelity far beyond the capacity of the human brain. With all these three essential processes in place, this information must now evolve. Google is a prime example. Google consults countless sources to select material copied from servers all over the world almost instantly. We may think we are still in control because humans designed the software and we put in the search terms, but other software can use Google too, copying the selected information before passing it on to yet others. Some programs can take parts of other programs and mix them up in new ways. Just as in biological evolution, most new variants will fizzle out, but if any arise that are successful at getting themselves copied, by whatever means, they will spread through the wonderfully interconnected systems of machines that we have made. Replicators are selfish by nature. They get copied whenever and however they can, regardless of the consequences for us, for other species or for our planet. You cannot give human values to a massive system of evolving information based on machinery that is being expanded and improved every day. They do not care because they cannot care. I refer to this third replicator as techno-memes, or temes, and I believe they are already evolving way beyond our control. Human intelligence emerged from biological brains with billions of interconnected neurons. AI is emerging in the gazillions of interconnections we have provided through our computers, servers, phones, tablets and every other piece of machinery that copies, varies and selects an ever-increasing amount of information. The scale of this new evolution is almost incomparably greater. Hassabis urges us to debate the ethics of AI “now, decades before there’s anything that’s actually of any potential consequence or power that we need to worry about, so we have the answers in place well ahead of time”. I say we need to worry right now and worry about the right things. AI is already evolving for its own benefit – not ours. That’s just Darwinism in action. AI: will the machines ever rise up? At the moment we create most of the temes out there – uploading photos, videos, and blog posts, sending emails, and creating web pages. And we demand ever more hardware to handle it all. The danger comes, and may already have come, when much of the software and data are evolving on their own. We wouldn’t even know this was happening until we found we were building ever more machines without getting the expected increases in capacity. Could such a system become artificially intelligent? Given that the natural intelligence we know about emerged from highly interconnected evolving systems, it seems likely if not inevitable. This system is now busy acquiring the equivalent of eyes and ears in the millions of CCTV cameras, listening devices and drones that we are happily supplying. We do all this so willingly, apparently oblivious to the evolutionary implications. So what might we expect of our future role in this vast machine? We might be like the humble mitochondrion, which supplies energy to all our body’s cells. Mitochondria were once free-living bacteria that became absorbed into larger cells in the process known as endosymbiosis; a deal that benefited both sides. As we continue to supply the great teme machine with all it needs to grow could we end up like this, willingly going on feeding it because we cannot give up all the digital goodies we have become used to? It’s not a superintelligent machine that we should worry about but the hardware, software and data we willingly add to every day.

Mostly, we see that in India products that come are a cut-down version of what is available abroad. But with the Samsung Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8+ it is the other way round. Consumers in India who have bought a Galaxy S8 or the Galaxy S8 have got a phone that clicks better photos than what the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8+ sold in the US manage. Why is it so? The difference is apparently because the camera hardware in the Galaxy S8 devices powered with Exynos processor is different from the S8 that uses Qualcomm 835 processor. Recently when Samsung launched the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8+ it didn't talk much about the two cameras in these phones. Although it did say the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8+ are pretty adapt shooters when it comes to clicking photos. Now, that when these phones are out in the market and their cameras have been tested, some strange results have come out. Although everyone who has reviewed these phones, including us here at the India Today Tech, agrees that these phones click fantastic photos, not everyone is on the same page when it comes to comparing these two Samsung phones with the Google Pixel, which is widely considered the phone with the best camera. The reason is that not everyone is testing the same Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus. In fact, almost all these comparisons you have read have been made between the Galaxy S8 powered by Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 and the Google Pixel. This is the reason why most people have called the Pixel a better shooter than the Galaxy S8. But over here at India Today Tech we tested the Exynos version of the Galaxy S8 and we found something different. We found that the Galaxy S8 actually matches or beats Pixel, unless it is extremely low light we are talking about. Two different image sensorThe reason why two variants of Galaxy S8 seem to have different camera performance is due to the image sensors they have. The image sensor in the Galaxy S8 (Snapdragon variant) is the Sony-made IMX 333. This is a very good image sensor and is fairly large with the size of around 7mm. This is similar in size to the Sony-made IMX260 that Samsung used last year with the Galaxy S7. But the Exynos variant of the Galaxy S8 comes with a different image sensor. This variant, which is sold in India, comes with Samsung's own ISOCELL technology S5K2L2 image sensor. Now, this one is 1/2.3 format image sensor, with size of around 7.8mm. Relatively speaking, this is a much bigger image sensor than what is inside the Snapdragon variant of the Galaxy S8. The result is that the image sensor in the Exynos Galaxy S8 has a similar size when compared to what Google has used in the Pixel camera. No wonder the performance too is very similar. Also Read: Galaxy S8 vs Google Pixel camera: Samsung's best matches the absolute best In comparison, when the Pixel competes with the Snapdragon Galaxy S8, it wins because in low light Pixel is just so much better due to its large image sensor. The large image sensor leads to bigger pixels in a phone and they capture more light, retain more data, produce better colours and show more details. But this advantage of Pixel goes away when it competes with the Exynos Galaxy S8. This is something India Today Tech found when it compared the cameras in the Google Pixel and the Exynos Galaxy S8. In most conditions the Galaxy S8 came ahead. It was only in extreme low light where Pixel produced more balanced photos but that was only because of the way these two phones expose the images. Nothing official about itAlthough now we know that the cameras in the Galaxy S8 powered by Snapdragon and the Galaxy S8 that uses Exynos behave differently, there is nothing official about it. Samsung has largely remained tight-lipped about the cameras in its new phones. And possibly because it knows that the image sensors in these two variants are very different. It is not that the US version of Galaxy S8 is a shoddy shooter. It too clicks good photos. After all, rest of the hardware -- lens, image processing, focus speed etc -- are all same. It's just that the Exynos Galaxy S8 is better, especially in the low light. So for a change, consumers in India are getting a special edition of the phone. Even if inadvertently they are getting the Galaxy S8 and the Galaxy S8 Plus that come with a better camera than the Galaxy S8 phones that Samsung is selling in the US.

Starting this summer, owners of Matterport Spaces will be able to directly publish to Google Street View with the click of a button through the newly-launched Street View Publish API. The 3D scans will appear and be accessible almost instantaneously on Google Maps and in Google Search results, driving additional traffic to businesses' websites. "Matterport is excited to partner with Google to enhance the way business owners market to customers around the world," said Bill Brown, CEO of Matterport. "Our all-in-one solution helps businesses promote their venues and provide a preview of what customers can expect. Because the Matterport solution uses 3D data to automate the capture and content creation process, our customers are able to very easily produce a superior consumer experience on Google Street View and the web. This will help drive online consumer engagement and generate site visits for businesses." Matterport's large and growing customer base spans a range of industries from residential and commercial real estate to hotels, restaurants, multifamily, vacation rentals, and scenic points of interest. With each capture, venue owners can get 2D photos, 3D and virtual reality (VR) models, video, and other digital media assets. What further sets Matterport apart is that it is the most immersive customer experience available on the web and in Google Street View, in terms of consistency, image quality, and 3D transitions. "Street View is a beloved brand because it helps prospective travelers/guests/customers gain the confidence of being there – before they go. In our quest to help people remotely navigate places, a sense of immersion has been key, so we're always keeping tabs on companies that take immersion to the next level. Matterport offers one of the most impressively realistic consumer experiences I've seen," said Charles Armstrong, Street View product manager. "Bringing the Matterport experience to Google Street View will be a game changer for businesses looking to better market themselves, and for the photographers who serve them." "Since Matterport is completely automated, photographers and service providers like myself can publish direct to Google Street View instead of stitching together disparate 360 photos and linking constellations," said Chris Petracco, President of TrustedPhoto DC, a Google Street View trusted contributor and Matterport Service Partner. "That, combined with Matterport's ability to deliver realistic captures in a variety of formats, means I can give my customers more assets in less time. All of this translates into better value and faster turnaround for the venue owner, less time on site to do the scan, and ultimately lower costs for me to deliver my service. This can be a real advantage for venues, both large and small, as well as service providers." Google Street View supports 2.5D transitions using just the sort of geometry that Matterport generates. By connecting Google Street View to Matterport's publishing service, a best-in-class authoring service and best-in-class discovery platform have come together to provide the definitive business virtual tour pairing. Starting this summer, customers will be able to access the new Publish to Google Street View capability through Matterport's beta program. Venue owners can get a Matterport scan today, via a service provider, and publish it to Google Street View once the publish capability is live. Interested customers can sign up for Matterport's beta program, and will be contacted when the beta program is available. Founded in 2011, Matterport has revolutionized the way businesses in real estate, hospitality, travel, entertainment, construction, and other sectors generate revenue. Matterport's easy-to-use device captures immersive 3D tours, virtual reality experiences, Google Street View inside view tours, 3D and 2D floor plans, guided tours and more. The all-in-one technology requires little to no training and a 2,000 square foot space can be captured in an hour. To date, over 500,000 spaces have been captured, generating more than 150 million "visits" across 80 countries. Since VR was offered for all models in Q4 2016, Matterport has seen VR usage explode, clocking over 3 million pano views. To view more Matterport Spaces, please visit the Matterport Gallery.

The 7-inch screen on the new Echo Show enables the speaker to supplement voice responses with visuals and other information displays, similar to the Echolike features on the Fire tablets and Fire TV streaming devices. Amazon’s Echo Show has touch screen and video-calling capabilities as it competes with Google's efforts at bringing ‘smarts’ to the home. The device goes on sale June 28. AMAZON.COM Enlarge That could mean extended weather forecasts or music lyrics to go with the song to which you’re listening. You can also call up cooking tutorials on YouTube, hands-free, while making dinner. You can make video calls with other Echo Show devices or the Alexa app for iPhones and Android phones. Two previous models, the original Echo and the smaller Echo Dot, will get audio-calling only, as they lack screens and cameras. Video and audio calls will be free. The Echo Show, which goes on sale on June 28 for $230, is the priciest Echo yet. The market for voice-assisted speakers is small but growing. The research firm eMarketer expects usage of such speakers to more than double this year, with nearly 36 million Americans using such a device at least once a month by year’s end. Amazon’s Echo is expected to continue its dominance, with a share of nearly 71 percent, though eMarketer expects Google’s Home speaker to cut into that share over time. A few weeks ago, Google Home got the ability to recognize individuals within a family by voice, allowing for more precise recommendations and ad targeting. So far, Amazon doesn’t have a comparable voice-recognition feature. On the other hand, Google Home doesn’t have a screen or video calling. All Echo devices can respond to voice requests for weather, news, music, and other tasks. The original device, simply called Echo, is on sale for $150. The speaker on the $50 Echo Dot isn’t as good, as it’s meant to be used with speakers you may already own. The $130 Amazon Tap is a battery-powered version. Two weeks ago, Amazon unveiled the Echo Look, a device focused on offering fashion advice. It’s available by invitation only for $200. Neither the Look nor the Tap will handle calls.

(PA Wire) Previous Next Show Grid Previous Next Hide Grid Previous Next Image 1/ Video 1/ Audio The ABC, Google, Facebook and the major mastheads are likely to give evidence at a Senate inquiry into public interest journalism looking into how fake news and click-bait is affecting the media industry. By Rashida Yosufzai 10 May 2017 - 2:10 PM  UPDATED 41 MINS AGO Tweet The impact of fake news and “click-bait” articles will be scrutinised by a proposed Senate inquiry that will compel Australia’s public broadcaster the ABC, Google, Facebook and the major mastheads to give evidence. The inquiry, which is expected to pass with majority support when it goes to a vote in the Senate on Wednesday, will look at the state of public interest journalist in Australia and around the world. It will scrutinise the laws around the market power of search engines such as Google and social media services promoting fake news as well as click-bait generators. The purpose of calling in Google and Facebook is to look at changes in their search algorithms that may have impacted the online models for struggling news outlets. Fairfax Media journalists returned to work on Wednesday after a week-long strike that affected its coverage of the Budget. It followed Fairfax's announcement it would make another 125 journalists redundant as part of a $30 million cost saving drive. Labor Senator Sam Dastyari is to chair the committee with Greens Senator Scott Ludlam as deputy and includes Independent Senator Nick Xenophon. Xenophon on proposed fake news inquiry Senator Dastyari told SBS World News the inquiry was necessary because changes in the media landscape could no longer be ignored. “The Senate will now have the opportunity to examine the appropriate response to the erosion of Australia’s major news organisations,” he said. “Australia’s public interest journalism is being eroded by online companies who pay no tax in Australia, and who are increasingly determining what we read every day.” READ MORE Facebook launches fake news ad blitz in UK Facebook is taking out ads in a British newspapers containing tips on how to spot fake news ahead of the national election.

Three female pioneers of space exploration are the subjects of a new short film from Google. And the experiences the women had and how they describe it all has led the tech giant to offer new Google Artworks Live Case designs for Pixel and Nexus smartphones. The 10-minute film, called “Dot of Light,” mixes historic footage with video and photography captured by Pixel, and features interviews with astronauts Kathryn D. Sullivan, Nicole Stott and Anousheh Ansari. The film was written and directed by Eliza McNitt, in collaboration with Google, and she helped design the new space-themed cases, which are $40 in the Google Store. The Google Artworks Live Case designs inspired by space. (Google Photo) Sullivan, who spent 22 days in orbit and traveled on three Space Shuttle missions, was the first American woman to walk in space when she stepped out of Challenger on Oct. 11, 1984. “Seeing Earth from orbit the first time, it is stunning enough it will literally pull the breath out of you,” Sullivan says in the film. As brief as it is, the film offers an inspiring look at the travels of these women, and some chills-inducing views of the place we call home.

HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) uses encryption and authentication to protect the integrity and confidentiality of data shared between two Internet devices. Google's pushing hard for website owners to migrate from HTTP to HTTPS, but as with any conversion, there comes a risk of messing up your Google search rankings. A successful HTTP to HTTPS migration involves more than just installing an SSL certificate. There are lots of details that can trip you up along the way.  This post will give you an outline of the process, along with an easy-to-use Excel HTTP to HTTPS conversion checklist, which you can use to walk through the key steps and make sure nothing falls through the cracks.  You'll save time, energy, and frustration - and importantly, you'll maintain your SEO rankings.  A Bit of Background To encourage website owners to switch from HTTP to HTTPS, Google announced in August 2014 that it was starting to use HTTPS as a “lightweight ranking signal”. The problem was, while they were dangling the lightweight ranking signal carrot, they were, at the same time, penalizing converters. When you choose to convert from HTTP to HTTPS, you effectively change your Internet address. That means you should give Google (and other search engines) a permanent change of address in the form of a 301 redirect. Image compliments of Deney Terrio on Flickr 301 redirects, until recently, came with a 10-15%-of-your-SEO-equity (also known as PageRank) penalty. That deterred a lot of SEOs and website owners from wanting to convert. eCommerce website owners had to choose – lose SEO equity and its associated ranking potential, or risk the loss of customers because they might fear the loss of identity or transaction tampering. Most eCommerce site owners have chosen to convert. Most informational website owners have not. What Changed Recognizing that everyone wasn’t jumping on the bandwagon as quickly as perhaps Google would have liked, in September 2016 they announced they would soon start red flagging sites that had not yet converted to HTTPS. To sweeten the blow, they also let it be known that there would be no loss of PageRank when you provide the redirect (change of address) that tells Google you've converted. John Meuller, Webmaster Trends Analyst at Google, was asked if "link juice" would be lost on one of Google's hangouts, and he answered: "No, for 301 or 302 redirects from HTTP to HTTPS no PageRank is lost." Therefore, the time to convert is now. Not a Job For Laypeople It is however, not a job for laypeople. You're going to be making changes to your website database and file names - it's easy to make mistakes and it can be hard to recover. If you're not comfortable working with databases and files, bring in an experienced technician to help you and instead and spend your time doing other things to help grow your business. It would be a far better investment of your time.  How long and complicated a process is it? The implementation process itself ranges from short and simple to long and complicated. It can take an hour, or days and weeks of effort and elapsed time. Large and complicated website owners have been known to convert their sites over in phases spanning months, and even years.  An Outline of the Checklist The HTTPS conversion checklist below combines steps gathered from a from a variety of reputable sources including, but not limited to: Search Console Help – Site Moves With URL Changes (Google); Complete Guide - How To Migrate From HTTP to HTTPS (KeyCDN); HTTP To HTTPS: An SEO’s Guide To Securing a Website (Search Engine Land); and The Big List of SEO Tips and Tricks For Using HTTPS on Your Website (Moz). The checklist has 4 tabs: The first tab is a log for document version control and keeping track of the site you’re working on (in case you’re working multiples). The second tab contains the list of tasks to be performed, 36 items progressing from setup through to testing. On the right are columns where you can note who performed the task, when, it's status, and comments. At the bottom, there's a short list of reference articles and tools you can use to ease the conversion and confirm nothing was missed. The third tab has instructions for setting up redirects on Linux and cPanel, Windows & Plesk. (source – Godaddy) The fourth is a placeholder where you can create a list of external files that may need conversion. If post-conversion tests fail, the culprit is often in this list of external files. The Details  You can download an Excel version of the complete HTTPS conversion checklist here. If you run into problems or have questions, please note them for discussion in the comments below.

Nintendo Switch With the Street View ready program, Google wants to reduce the barrier to “high-quality, interactive imagery” to just buying a compatible camera and downloading the Street View mobile app for Android or iOS. There are four tiers, with the standards providing users with the “flexibility to choose the best way to upload imagery based on your interests.” Street View mobile ready: 360 cameras that can publish Street View directly from a mobile app—without requiring a desktop workflow Street View auto ready: 360 cameras tailored for vehicle-based collection with the highest accuracy Street View vr ready: 360 cameras or systems that collect geometry in addition to generating sets of connected 360 photos Street View workflow ready: Publishing tools (sometimes bundled with cameras) that can upload to Street View accounts At the moment, 18 major brands like GoPro and Samsung are set to release 20 devices throughout 2017. The full hardware and data specification needed for certification are listed on Google’s developer site, with a form available for interested manufacturers.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: YouTube Google isn’t fixing a serious Android security flaw for months Chris Smith @chris_writes May 9th, 2017 at 11:04 PM Share Tweet Google acknowledged that there’s a serious security flaw in Android that would allow attackers to target unsuspecting users with malicious software, but it’s only be fixed in the next major release of Android. Don't Miss: Amazon just discounted the Echo for the first time in 2017 Found by CheckPoint, the flaw takes advantage of the way Android works to expose users to certain types of malware attacks, including “ransomware, banking malware and adware.” Google already confirmed to the security company that the issue is already being dealt with in Android O. That’s good but also bad news. Not all Android devices that might be susceptible to such attacks will be upgradeable to Android O, and even if they are, these upgrades never arrive in a timely manner. However, the flaw exposed by CheckPoint only works with the apps installed directly from the Google Play store. That means hackers must find a way to bypass Google’s Play store anti-malware security before taking advantage of the flaw. Starting with Android 6.0 Marshmallow, Google made changes to the way app permissions work, dividing the permissions that apps require in various categories. Some of them are labeled as “dangerous,” and they’re granted only during runtime. Users then have to approve these permissions the first time a dangerous resource is required. CheckPoint explains there’s also a permissions category that contains only one permission called SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW, which the user needs to manually grant it — or at least that’s how it was supposed to work. The permission would let an app display over any other app without notifying the user. But Google soon realized that some apps will need such a functionality enabled after being installed, such as Facebook’s Messenger chat heads feature. So Google made it so that the SYSTEM_ALERT_WINDOW permission is enabled by default on apps that come from the Play store. Here lies the problem: This entails a significant potential for several malicious techniques, such as displaying fraudulent ads, phishing scams, click-jacking, and overlay windows, which are common with banking Trojans. It can also be used by ransomware to create a persistent on-top screen that will prevent non-technical users from accessing their devices. CheckPoint says that 74% of ransomware, 57% of adware, and 14% of banker malware abuses the feature. “This is clearly not a minor threat, but an actual tactic used in the wild,” the company explains. In Android O, Google will block apps from abusing the permission by adding a new restrictive permission that will prevent any app from being position on top of any critical system windows.

Server-side tests have broken Google Now and the Play Store for some users Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 5:53pm PDTMay 6, 2017 42 Plus 1 on G+ 99 Share on Facebook 81 Share on Twitter Total Shares222 Applications Google News Google regularly conducts server-side tests - showing new features and UI changes to only a handful of users at a time. Unfortunately, sometimes these have adverse affects on users. In this case, Google has broken the Play Store and Google Now for some users, as a result of two independent server-side tests. The Play Store test, according to one report on the Google Play Help Forum, removes everything from the app's home page. Apps can still be searched for and installed, and updating applications works fine, but the front page is completely blank. There does not appear to be any fix for this right now - if you have it, you're stuck with it until Google figures it out. Another test completely breaks Google Now cards, with the main Now screen showing a generic error message. Luckily, there is a way to fix this one. Simply open your Settings app, go to the Application Manager, find the Google app, tap 'Manage Storage,' and finally press 'Clear Google Search Data.' Between this, the recent Google Drive for Windows mishap, and the dogfood update that was pushed to normal users, I think Google is forgetting that most people don't want to be beta (or alpha) testers.

Scofabear Is anyone having issues with Google now weather cards showing the wrong location? Amit_N Seriously.. on weekend? Why are Googlers working on weekends? Nick Felker Maybe it's because nobody works weekends that everything stops working. Perhaps the person who answers everyone's search queries got sick. Corbin Davenport Or someone pushed to production on Friday. Amit_N Well someone from QA did not do his/her job correctly. mvilcis Oh please. QA and Google. Ridiculous. grizzlyjon83 Google search itself was also broken for me. I just assumed it's because I was using the beta, so I switched to stable and everything was fixed. Lildebbie My Google cards stopped working earlier today luckily I figured out clearing the app data on my own. Smh. Averix I had to leave the Google Play Services beta because several apps were crashing with a null pointer error. It stems from a native ad call in Google Play Services. Reverted to current non-beta version and all is well. Michael Petkov I had the same issue with Cards not showing in the last 48 hours, I've just uninstalled the App and installed again and now have cards. Ramon I was wondering why my battery was suddenly better. Ha. Google now was disabled. Gjorgi Lazarovski good ol google back at it again EMcTx I was getting the blank play store page. I ended up deleting my account associated with the play store, rebooting, and adding my account again. After that, my play store came back. AQ somewhat related: I wish I could disable the google app on my tablet, it always wants to run & can't be force stopped :( Rafy286 Thanks for reporting this AP, once again I thought it was my phone acting up due to the beta Google app. What a mess Google become in the last few weeks. TedPhillips wish you could opt into beta for certain devices... just pulled the trigger on the google app beta so i could poke around on certain form factors, don't really need/want it on my daily driver mobile. JD You can but control is an illusion with Google Carson Saldanha The one time I'm glad I never get server-side tests first. Lord Argyris "I think Google is forgetting that most people don't want to be beta (or alpha) testers." These days I'm having trouble remembering the time when Google hadn't forgotten this. JD Google's thinking is youre using our stuff on Android you're a willing beta tester otherwise you'd use our services on iOS. Sukigu Meanwhile, those of us who do sign up for alpha and beta tests for Google apps more often than not don't see any actual differences because they didn't get lucky on the A/B lottery. Vlado Repeated restart with switch on 4G network helped me to fix issue with failed to load Google Now cards (on Friday evening). AintaDamnThingFunny It's definitely broke for me M Gordon It broke for me on Friday for a couple hours (Google now) Dean Selinger I had the Google Now error and found my way, with help from a google search, to the above solution. Earlier I briefly had a new recent searches tab in Google Now. I liked the idea and the implementation was easy enough to navigate. Next time I opened Now it was gone. I got the Failed to load cards error sometime afterwards​. Kaan Sentürk Google Now on Android Wear 2.0 is also broken. It doesn't refresh my feed anymore and many cards aren't displaying. Google should finally fix this Roh_Mish Ugh! Google and it's server side tests. Just this week I got the white YouTube UI. Then I got the white UI + Bottom bar. Then I got a different top bar. Then all of them went away, including the pull up suggestion in landscape. And now youtube crashes after every few minutes. Clearing data didn't help. Marcell Lévai Oh, now that you mention it, I don't have the bottom bar anymore. I didn't even notice it. To me if it works as expected, it's not a big deal I guess. Roh_Mish Generally even I don't notice but the red to white one was a Big one. Plus all the other changes happened within a day. Lee Lee (JINOLEE) It's just happened to m, what's hell Disqusser Is that interface new? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/a4b23eecd4d9dff74d9eed8d4df4e78600e7edc45b89d96ea7d78711140fc08c.png PVL_93_RU are those tags under the search bar? Disqusser Yes WesleySmalls Maybe it was part of the test? ahnafm Google: "It's not a bug, it's a feature!" ro964 I don't want to jinx myself, but Play Store is fine on my Project Fi Nexus 5X - for now. Abhishek Maurya And I am from those people, Google now shows "failed to load cards" Jordan L My Google Now cards broke. The fix worked for me. I'm on the beta Google App, if this server side test was only for beta users then we can't get so pissed. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Today's "Google Screwup of the Day". Maxime MARAIS Is there something to do with sudent "Google Play Services stopped working" is see several times a day since yesterday? Does anyone faces this kind of issue too (on good old Nexus 5, for example)? Ron johnson Broken on my phone, but works on my tablet. deckhanddave Mines been off for days and I find out why in an online article? Google are starting to p*ss me off. What this article didn't say was that you also have to reinstall google after clearing the memory. NavyVeteran And the Google app itself. Dracinn I thing Android in general has been broken lately wether it be hardware or software. Rob DeMillo Had this problem on my Sony Xperia Z3c tablet. Tried the recommended fix, rebooted, and.... Google now no longer appears when I swipe right. It act as though that screen no longer exists. The step missing from the article is: go to your app, select the Google app and restart it by selecting "Get Started." Google Now will then restart and recover your data. Diego Well thank you for this. I did the steps and had no Google now. But after this it's back Rob DeMillo Glad it worked! CommentatusMaximus Was wondering what happened to Google Now. Figured out the memory reset trick myself, all's good now. Sergiu I see is a very common thing to test on production. Even Google does it. :) Bill M Push test on Friday so nobody is in house to fix it ;) It would be nice if they would test in-house -before- they subject customers to the results. I believe (from experience) that the play store server side test may be over... or they just removed my account from it as a band-aid. balcobomber25 Pretty soon there will be no more Google Now. lomsha I thought it was because I'm running O. Bill M I spoke too soon. I can now see content but the feature carousel isn't there. It shows up if I use an alternate google account to access the play store. This leads me to think I'm still stuck with a half fixed test version for my account. I guess maybe if you opt in for any apps beta you get put on googles lab rat list for any of their product updates? Idk, how they decided who got it but unlike any app beta in the store there isn't any way to leave. kerrhome Google Play Music was down for me as well. My Huawei Watch play store wanted me to re-buy several apps. Also, weather card was not the right city for me. All is back to normal now, but wow, lots of screw ups. Bill Perrotta Uh Edgar this happened a day ago.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Matterport Partners with Google to Help Businesses Better Market Their Venues SUNNYVALE, Calif., May 9, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Immersive media technology company Matterport today announced a partnership with Google to enable the publication of immersive Matterport content to Google Street View. Starting this summer, owners of Matterport Spaces will be able to directly publish to Google Street View with the click of a button through the newly-launched Street View Publish API. The 3D scans will appear and be accessible almost instantaneously on Google Maps and in Google Search results, driving additional traffic to businesses' websites. "Matterport is excited to partner with Google to enhance the way business owners market to customers around the world," said Bill Brown, CEO of Matterport. "Our all-in-one solution helps businesses promote their venues and provide a preview of what customers can expect. Because the Matterport solution uses 3D data to automate the capture and content creation process, our customers are able to very easily produce a superior consumer experience on Google Street View and the web. This will help drive online consumer engagement and generate site visits for businesses." Matterport's large and growing customer base spans a range of industries from residential and commercial real estate to hotels, restaurants, multifamily, vacation rentals, and scenic points of interest. With each capture, venue owners can get 2D photos, 3D and virtual reality (VR) models, video, and other digital media assets. What further sets Matterport apart is that it is the most immersive customer experience available on the web and in Google Street View, in terms of consistency, image quality, and 3D transitions. "Street View is a beloved brand because it helps prospective travelers/guests/customers gain the confidence of being there – before they go. In our quest to help people remotely navigate places, a sense of immersion has been key, so we're always keeping tabs on companies that take immersion to the next level. Matterport offers one of the most impressively realistic consumer experiences I've seen," said Charles Armstrong, Street View product manager. "Bringing the Matterport experience to Google Street View will be a game changer for businesses looking to better market themselves, and for the photographers who serve them." "Since Matterport is completely automated, photographers and service providers like myself can publish direct to Google Street View instead of stitching together disparate 360 photos and linking constellations," said Chris Petracco, President of TrustedPhoto DC, a Google Street View trusted contributor and Matterport Service Partner. "That, combined with Matterport's ability to deliver realistic captures in a variety of formats, means I can give my customers more assets in less time. All of this translates into better value and faster turnaround for the venue owner, less time on site to do the scan, and ultimately lower costs for me to deliver my service. This can be a real advantage for venues, both large and small, as well as service providers." Google Street View supports 2.5D transitions using just the sort of geometry that Matterport generates. By connecting Google Street View to Matterport's publishing service, a best-in-class authoring service and best-in-class discovery platform have come together to provide the definitive business virtual tour pairing. Starting this summer, customers will be able to access the new Publish to Google Street View capability through Matterport's beta program. Venue owners can get a Matterport scan today, via a service provider, and publish it to Google Street View once the publish capability is live. Interested customers can sign up for Matterport's beta program, and will be contacted when the beta program is available. Founded in 2011, Matterport has revolutionized the way businesses in real estate, hospitality, travel, entertainment, construction, and other sectors generate revenue. Matterport's easy-to-use device captures immersive 3D tours, virtual reality experiences, Google Street View inside view tours, 3D and 2D floor plans, guided tours and more. The all-in-one technology requires little to no training and a 2,000 square foot space can be captured in an hour. To date, over 500,000 spaces have been captured, generating more than 150 million "visits" across 80 countries. Since VR was offered for all models in Q4 2016, Matterport has seen VR usage explode, clocking over 3 million pano views. To view more Matterport Spaces, please visit the Matterport Gallery.

Photosani/shutterstock.com Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn WhatsApp Messenger In early 2017, Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel announced a new initiative in the city’s ongoing battle with violent crime. The most common solutions to this sort of problem involve hiring more police officers or working more closely with community members. But Emanuel declared that the Chicago Police Department would expand its use of software, enabling what is called “predictive policing,” particularly in neighborhoods on the city’s south side. The Chicago police will use data and computer analysis to identify neighborhoods that are more likely to experience violent crime, assigning additional police patrols in those areas. In addition, the software will identify individual people who are expected to become – but have yet to be – victims or perpetrators of violent crimes. Officers may even be assigned to visit those people to warn them against committing a violent crime. Any attempt to curb the alarming rate of homicides in Chicago is laudable. But the city’s new effort seems to ignore evidence, including recent research from members of our policing study team at the Human Rights Data Analysis Group, that predictive policing tools reinforce, rather than reimagine, existing police practices. Their expanded use could lead to further targeting of communities or people of color. Working with available data At its core, any predictive model or algorithm is a combination of data and a statistical process that seeks to identify patterns in the numbers. This can include looking at police data in hopes of learning about crime trends or recidivism. But a useful outcome depends not only on good mathematical analysis: It also needs good data. That’s where predictive policing often falls short. Machine-learning algorithms learn to make predictions by analyzing patterns in an initial training data set and then look for similar patterns in new data as they come in. If they learn the wrong signals from the data, the subsequent analysis will be lacking. This happened with a Google initiative called “Flu Trends,” which was launched in 2008 in hopes of using information about people’s online searches to spot disease outbreaks. Google’s systems would monitor users’ searches and identify locations where many people were researching various flu symptoms. In those places, the program would alert public health authorities that more people were about to come down with the flu. But the project failed to account for the potential for periodic changes in Google’s own search algorithm. In an early 2012 update, Google modified its search tool to suggest a diagnosis when users searched for terms like “cough” or “fever.” On its own, this change increased the number of searches for flu-related terms. But Google Flu Trends interpreted the data as predicting a flu outbreak twice as big as federal public health officials expected and far larger than what actually happened. Criminal justice data are biased The failure of the Google Flu Trends system was a result of one kind of flawed data – information biased by factors other than what was being measured. It’s much harder to identify bias in criminal justice prediction models. In part, this is because police data aren’t collected uniformly, and in part it’s because what data police track reflect longstanding institutional biases along income, race and gender lines. While police data often are described as representing “crime,” that’s not quite accurate. Crime itself is a largely hidden social phenomenon that happens anywhere a person violates a law. What are called “crime data” usually tabulate specific events that aren’t necessarily lawbreaking – like a 911 call – or that are influenced by existing police priorities, like arrests of people suspected of particular types of crime, or reports of incidents seen when patrolling a particular neighborhood. Neighborhoods with lots of police calls aren’t necessarily the same places the most crime is happening. They are, rather, where the most police attention is – though where that attention focuses can often be biased by gender and racial factors. It’s not possible to remove the bias Some researchers have argued that machine learning algorithms can address systemic biases by designing “neutral” models that don’t take into account sensitive variables like race or gender. But while it may seem possible in hypothetical situations, it doesn’t appear to be the case in real life. Our recent study, by Human Rights Data Analysis Group’s Kristian Lum and William Isaac, found that predictive policing vendor PredPol’s purportedly race-neutral algorithm targeted black neighborhoods at roughly twice the rate of white neighborhoods when trained on historical drug crime data from Oakland, California. We found similar results when analyzing the data by income group, with low-income communities targeted at disproportionately higher rates compared to high-income neighborhoods. But estimates – created from public health surveys and population models – suggest illicit drug use in Oakland is roughly equal across racial and income groups. If the algorithm were truly race-neutral, it would spread drug-fighting police attention evenly across the city. Similar evidence of racial bias was found by ProPublica’s investigative reporters when they looked at COMPAS, an algorithm predicting a person’s risk of committing a crime, used in bail and sentencing decisions in Broward County, Florida, and elsewhere around the country. These systems learn only what they are presented with; if those data are biased, their learning can’t help but be biased too. Fixing this problem is not a matter of just doing more advanced mathematical or statistical calculations. Rather, it will require rethinking how police agencies collect and analyze data, and how they train their staff to use data on the job. Understanding the biases to improve the data Using predictive analytics in the real world is challenging, particularly when trying to craft government policies to minimize harm to vulnerable populations. We do not believe that police departments should stop using analytics or data-driven approaches to reducing crime. Rather, police should work to understand the biases and limitations inherent in their data. In our view, police departments – and all agencies that use predictive algorithms – should make their systems transparent to public scrutiny. This should start with community members and police departments discussing policing priorities and measures of police performance. That way any software the police use can be programmed to reflect the community’s values and concerns. Ensuring transparency It is not enough to claim or assume an algorithm is unbiased just because it is computerized and uses data: A lack of bias must be proven by evaluating the algorithm’s performance itself. Police agencies should get independent experts or human rights groups to perform regular audits of the algorithms and the data they process. Much like the annual financial reviews large companies do, these examinations can ensure the input data are valid and are analyzed properly to avoid discrimination. If a company wants to claim its algorithm is proprietary and should be kept secret, it should still be required to offer robust testing environments so outside experts can examine its performance. Further, police departments that use algorithms to make predictions about individuals, like Chicago’s Strategic Subject List does, should have policies similar to a new European Union regulation requiring human-understandable explanations of computer algorithms’ decisions. And no agency or company should be allowed to discriminate against people who have been identified by predictive policing. Used correctly, predictive policing can be used to address the complex factors underlying crime trends. For example, rather than stepping up patrols, Toronto and other cities in Canada are using predictive modeling to connect residents to local social services. By improving the quality of data cities collect, and analyzing the information with more transparent and inclusive processes, cities can build safer communities, rather than cracking down harder on areas that are already struggling.

By: Abhinaya Prabhu Published: Wednesday, May 10, 2017, 7:00 [IST] Google is all set to host the annual Google I/O developer's conference on May 17. At the conference, the company is expected to release the Developer Preview of the next iteration of Android dubbed Android O. The first Android O build offers an insight of what is coming to the platform soon. However, the Android Beta site doesn't have the update as yet. Lately, Google ended the Android Nougat beta programme and is expected to make the Android O beta available soon. This makes us believe that we can get to know the details of the upcoming iteration at the Google I/O next week. Also read: Sony contributed in Android O by improving wireless audio quality Stay tuned to GizBot for more updates! Is it the Android Oreo? Ever since the Android Cupcake came into existence, Google has been naming the Android OS after sweet treats in the alphabetical order. Apparently, the next iteration is believed to be Android O. There are many guesses for the name of Android O, but going by a tweet posted by Hiroshi Lockheimer of Google, Android Oreo seems to be the upcoming one. Google I/O The 11th Google I/O conference is all set to happen between May 17 and May 19. Usually, Google announces the update to the Android OS at the annual conference. This time, the event is all set to happen next week at the Shoreline Amphitheatre in California. Android O new features The Android O Developer Preview is already out confirming a slew of new features as mentioned below. Customizable Notifications Android O will bring user-customizable notification channels wherein alerts can be grouped by type. Users can snooze the notifications and developers can set time limits for the notifications to appear. The background color of notifications and the messaging style can be adjusted. Background Limits Android O brings improvements to the ability to restrict some app activities in the background that was introduced by Android Nougat. The recent update places priority on extending the battery life without the user input. Also read: Android Malware types you really need to be aware of Enhanced Autofill Users who opt in to this service will find it easier to fill the login and credit card details on forms with not many mistakes and less repetition. Improved keyboard control Android O may not be restricted only to smartphones. It is believed to arrive with improved arrow and tab key navigation that can be used along with a physical keyboard. Picture-in-Picture mode This feature is already available on Android TV. Now, it looks like the same is coming to the upcoming Android O as well. The picture-in-picture mode can be used for video playback. Adaptive icons The Android O app icons are said to support visual effects. The icons are likely to be displayed in different shapes on different devices. Copy Less The copy less feature is expected to make the process of copying text from an app to the other easy by giving suggestions in the second app based on the user was typing on the first one.

Elyse Betters10 May 2017Speakers Apple-made, Echo-like smart speaker likely coming Reportedly now being tested in Apple employees' homes Will feature support for Siri voice commands Might also have built-in facial recognition tech Expected to be announced at WWDC in June 2017 Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Apple is working on its own Amazon Echo or Google Home-like device, according to several reports from the last few months. These reports have claimed that Apple is already testing the product inside Apple employees' homes, and that we may see the device, which is expected to come loaded with support for Siri voice commands, introduced at WWDC 2017 in June. Here's everything you need to know about the speaker so far, including how it might look and what it might feature. Just bear in mind that nothing is confirmed as of yet. Apple's Siri speaker: What could it be? 64 ways to get a giggle out of Siri Apple has been rumoured to be working on an Amazon Echo or Google Home-like smart speaker since early 2016, around the same time Google introduced its Home speaker and around two years after Amazon launched its popular Echo. Although there has been no confirmation from the company, several reports have surfaced in recent months about the device and how it might differ from rival products. Apple employees have reportedly been testing the speaker inside their homes for several months, according to Bloomberg. The publication also reported last September that Apple engineers had begun in-home testing of prototypes. In other words, if this is true, we're likely getting closer to an actual unveiling of the product. And many reports are pointing to WWDC 2017 as the perfect venue to announce it. Apple's Siri speaker: What can you expect? Apple finalising plans for Amazon Echo-like device to control your home Siri voice commands The Information first reported in May 2016 that Apple is working on Echo-like device that could obey voice commands through Siri. The report, which was published prior to WWDC 2016, also explained that Apple planned to open up its Siri assistant to outside app developers by releasing an SDK. The company, of course, did just that, in June 2016, allowing app developers to make their apps accessible through Siri. Facial recognition CNET also reported in May 2016 that Apple is working on Echo-like device, but it said the device could know who you are just by looking at you. The device will feature a built-in camera and will come in the form of a smart speaker. It'll be "self aware" and detect who is in the room using facial recognition technology. Doing so would allow it to automatically pull up a person's preferences, like music. Early prototypes of Apple's upcoming speaker, the so-called Siri speaker, for lack of a better name, are said to have included facial recognition sensors, using technology Apple acquired when it bought both Faceshift and Emotient in the last couple of years. It's also been suggested that Apple's speaker could trump the Amazon Echo by featuring more advanced microphone and speaker technologies. Touchscreen It’s unclear if Apple’s Siri speaker will feature a display - sort of like Amazon’s new Echo Show. It might just be all about audio - like the regular, cylindrical Echo speaker or Google Home. However, Apple executive Phil Schiller recently talked about gadgets with screens rather favourably: “The idea of not having a screen, I don't think suits many situations,” Schiller said in an interview with Gadgets 360 in May 2017. He noted voice-only assistants can’t show you photos posted to social media, and if you’re asking for directions, you can’t see them on map. “I think voice assistants are incredibly powerful. Their intelligence is going to grow. They're gonna do more for us, but the role of the screen is gonna remain very important to all of this,” he explained, while also making it clear he is unimpressed by existing smart speakers. “My mother used to have a saying that if you don't have something nice to say, say nothing at all,” Schiller said. Airplay product In April 2017, it was reported that Apple's Siri speaker designs were in the final stages. According to Sonny Dickson, who has hit the nail on the head many times in the past when it comes to leaking Apple news, the company is "finalising designs" for its Echo competitor after two years of development. Posting on Twitter, he added that any device will be marketed as a Siri/Airplay product. Homekit It's also been reported that Apple's Siri speaker will allow you to control your smarthome kit through Siri voice control. Mark Gurman at Bloomberg originally said that the device will be able to control appliances, locks, lights and curtains via voice activation. Apple's Siri speaker: What's it look like? Amazingly, there hasn't been one leak yet to indicate what the device might look like when it launches. Apple's Siri speaker: When will it launch? Apple's Echo-like smart speaker with Siri could debut at WWDC 2017 According to reliable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple will announce this Siri smart speaker at its annual developer conference this June and will likely market it as a high-end speaker with built-in Siri, plus superior sound quality and computing power when compared to Echo and Google Home. The Siri speaker should go on sale by Christmas time, even if it's not announced at WWDC 2017. Apple's Siri speaker: What will it cost? There's no word yet on US/UK pricing or availability.

One of which was the Android app compatibility gained by Chromebooks. Speaking of which, one of the sessions listed on this year’s Google I/O schedule seems to suggest apps designed with Chromebooks and large screen devices in mind, will be one of the aspects that Google would like developers to focus on going forward. Specifically, it seems as though this session is going to place a greater emphasis on apps that are almost purpose-designed for “larger screens.” While tablets would be considered large (compared to smartphones), they are not often in the same size league as Chromebooks. Which does mean that Android apps are most often encountered on devices that even at the largest scale, are at the foot end of the Chromebook device size spectrum. And it seems Google sees some real value here with apps that are designed for larger screens, as the description for the session clearly states that as well as being an “early adopter,” developers who focus on creating these larger screen-focused apps will have the “opportunity to lead and influence the ecosystem in setting the standard for apps on larger screens.” So while last year’s Google I/O was all about Android apps coming to Chromebooks, this year’s event might be much more focused on Android apps designed specifically for Chromebooks. In some respects this is probably not that surprising. Chromebooks have been on the up and up over the last couple of years and seem to be doing extremely well in certain markets, like the business and education sectors. So it stands to reason that if developers can create apps which are better designed to perform on larger screens, and with larger screen-associated peripherals – as the Google I/O description notes “trackpad, mouse, keyboard, and stylus” – then those apps could very well find themselves instantly being used on a large number of devices almost overnight. Especially considering that unlike Android apps on Android phones and tablets, there seems to be far less competition when it comes to Chromebook-optimized apps. Something Google seems intent on talking about and dealing with at Google I/O 2017.

Google Home now works with smart home products from iDevices, NuBryte, and more Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/09 12:28pm PDTMay 9, 2017 8 Plus 1 on G+ 12 Share on Facebook 38 Share on Twitter Total Shares58 Google Google Home News The Google Home only worked with a handful of services at launch, but over the past few months, we've seen more and more services start to work with it. Starting today, select products from iDevices, NuBryte, Universal Devices, and MobiLinc will be compatible with the Google Home (and anything else with Google Assistant). iDevices sells a variety of smart home products, including light switches, wall outlets, and lights. All of iDevices' products are rather expensive, but at least you don't need a hub for them. Two of the company's products stand out as pretty cool - a rain-tight outdoor smart plug, and an adapter to make any light bulb 'smart' (but buying Hue light bulbs would probably work better in most cases). NuBryte's main product is the TouchPoint, which replaces the light switch in a room with a touchscreen display. The TouchPoint can control lighting, view camera feeds, work as an intercom, and display weather and calendar information. However, it hasn't received great reviews. Universal Devices sells INSTEON lighting controllers, like this one, primarily for business or enthusiast use. Finally, MobiLinc offers apps for controlling specific smart home systems, such as ones using Universal Devices controllers.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 10 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman VMware and Google Expand Partnership to Accelerate the Adoption of Chromebooks /EINPresswire.com/ — LAS VEGAS, NV–(Marketwired – May 09, 2017) – DELL EMC WORLD 2017 ­- VMware, Inc. (NYSE: VMW), a global leader in cloud infrastructure and business mobility, today announced an expanded partnership with Google to accelerate the adoption of Chromebooks. Enhancing existing application accessibility of the devices, VMware Workspace ONE™ will enable one-click secure authentication and management of applications — cloud, web and virtual — for organizations deploying Chromebooks. Workspace ONE is a platform that unifies endpoint management for IT and delivers a unified access experience for end users to help organizations evolve away from silo-ed application and device management strategies to better embrace digital transformation. „VMware has been working with Google since 2015 to offer secure Android devices and applications, most recently with advanced support for Android Enterprise,” said Sumit Dhawan, senior vice president and general manager, End-User Computing, VMware. „This partnership shows our commitment to giving customers the flexibility to pick the device of their choice and enabling the delivery of any application on any device to end users.” Chrome OS provides multiple layers of protection including security modules, like TPM chips specialized for encryption, verified boot to check for compromises, sandboxing for containing threats and full disk encryption for data protection. Together with Workspace ONE on Chromebooks, IT administrators benefit from additional security capabilities to help deploy, configure and secure, web and SaaS applications. We are also collaborating on advancements to unify native Android applications. Windows applications can also be delivered through VMware Horizon 7 and VMware Horizon Cloud virtual applications and desktops, that can be quickly accessed through dynamic contextual decision-making, secured in the data center and provisioned through Workspace ONE. And end users will enjoy simple single sign-on (SSO) to a digital workspace that includes a catalogue of all the business and productivity applications they need, while IT benefits from improved data security and centralized management and delivery of applications. „With Chrome OS we continue to see momentum in the enterprise given our efforts to deliver speed, security, simplicity and shareability to customers,” said Rajen Sheth, director of product management for Chrome OS at Google. „From Windows to web to mobile apps, this partnership with VMware and the integration with VMware Workspace One will allow our customers to easily and securely deploy applications on Chrome OS devices.” „Application ecosystems are a major factor in the success of an endpoint operating system,” said Phil Hochmuth, program director, Enterprise Mobility at IDC. „Growth in the Chrome OS application ecosystem has improved the quality of the user experience with the platform. Adding VMware Workspace ONE to further support the management and delivery of business applications to Chrome OS devices is a logical move forward.” Availability Workspace ONE with VMware AirWatch and Horizon support for Chromebook is available immediately.

This search engine also comes in handy whenever someone gets injured or sick and despite the sometimes questionable results (all symptoms tend to point to cancer!), many parents can't help but check in, and often multiple times, with Dr. Google when their little one gets sick before visiting their own pediatrician. However, experts are now warning parents about the problem with googling their child's symptoms - aside from becoming overly alarmed thanks to incorrect online diagnoses. According to a new study from the American Academy of Pediatrics, parents searching the internet after the child becomes sick not only reduces their trust in trained medical professionals but it also causes a delay in treatment if parents don't trust their doctor's diagnosis because of what they read online. "The internet is a powerful information tool, but it is limited by its inability to reason and think," the study's lead author, Ruth Milanaik, said. "Simply entering a collection of symptoms in a search engine may not reflect the actual medical situation at hand. These computer-generated diagnoses may mislead patients or parents and cause them to question their doctors' medical abilities and seek a second opinion, thereby delaying treatment." In the study, 1,374 parents were given the scenario where their child was sick for the past three days with a rash and a fever that was getting worse. They were then divided into three groups: the first group was given screen shots from online diagnosis of scarlet fever and strep throat; the second group was given screen shots diagnosing Kawasaki disease; and the third group didn't receive any screen shots. When everyone was told that the doctor diagnosed their child with scarlet fever, 81 percent of parents in the control group trusted the doctor's diagnosis, 61.3 percent who read about Kawasaki diseases trusted the diagnosis, and only 64.2 percent who read about scarlet fever wanted a second opinion before believing the conclusion. "Parents who still have doubts should absolutely seek a second opinion," Ruth said. "But they shouldn't be afraid to discuss the result of internet information with the physician."

[Update: Confirmed] Google Assistant in Allo is learning Spanish and French Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/09 9:40am PDTMay 9, 2017 39 Plus 1 on G+ 68 Share on Facebook 86 Share on Twitter Total Shares193 Applications Google News Update 1: 2017/05/09 9:43am PDT Confirmed Google rolled out Assistant first in Allo, but it only supported English at launch. Google has been slowly but steadily adding more languages to the Allo version, as well as the voice-activated version on phones. The company has quietly rolled out support for Spanish and French to Assistant in Allo, but it looks to still be in beta. Google has not updated its list of officially supported Assistant languages yet. It currently includes English, German, Hindi, Japanese, and Portuguese. However, we've gotten multiple tips that Assistant has started popping up in conversations happening in French and Spanish. Specifically, users are seeing smart replies in those languages, and they can ask the Assistant bot to use those languages. This appears to be a very recent change. When asked if is spoke French or Spanish before, Assistant would say it was still learning. Now, it offers to set those as the default language in Allo. It sounds like the new languages are a bit rougher around the edges than the "official" ones. Google's head of conversational search, Behshad Behzadi has reportedly said Spanish will be working completely later this year. French might be on the same track, but at least there's progress. Update 1: 2017/05/09 9:43am PDT Confirmed These languages are now confirmed. Google's head of product for Allo has tweeted that Spanish is rolling out. As for French, Google's Canadian blog says French is a go. End of Update Thanks: Roberto and Mikaël Tags allo assistant Google languages subscribe ...

I live in Quebec and my main language is french Canada so I would appreciate interacting with the assistant in French but do not wish to change my default language to French. I want to keep my device setup in English same as I always had my windows in English or any other tech devices.. TVs etc. And depending who I text it can be in English or French so unless it can switch easily it's useless currently. When I tried speaking french it would come up with gibersih words. It works better to just switch my keyboard language and use the mic. That way I am positive it understands what I am saying the first time whether it's French or English. roberto.elena At least in Allo, you don't have to do any changes. My phone has English US as the main system language for UI and Spanish (Spain) as secondary language for speech recognition. In Allo I can chat via text with the Assistant in English, Spanish and German and it understands all 3 without a problem. What I find weird is that the Assistant always replies using the same language, until you explicitly tell it to change to another one, so if I tell it to speak Spanish, it will always reply in Spanish even if I ask questions in English or German. EowynCarter Saying the assistant "speak french" should do that from what i tested. Keept talking english (device language is french), And it wasn't understanding anything before, expecting me to speak english. Then, it got the french sentance alright. Misanthrope Unfortunately, it still speaks English after that. I am in the same situation and don't want to put my device in French. I want to keep it in English and speak French which is impossible EowynCarter Mmm. I can tell the assistant to speak English despite my phone being in French. But I'm using the allo assistant. Girouf Yeah I remember when I was testing the assistant ...although it was using "French France" then cause french Canada was still not a "learned language, it would never switch to French on the fly if I tried dictating an SMS. As I mentioned my system was set as English default and I want it to stay that way. The best solution for me was to turn everything off and just use the mic in the keyboard, switch my language from there and I could easily create a French or English sms that way with the first try. I haven't used it since though so I don't know how it is now if any better. Marc ¡Hola! Omelette du fromage. Arthur J. Means nothing Bru [971] Seems to be out of beta as Google France's facebook page is asking us to try Assistant in French. With no mention of beta. This is how i saw it roberto.elena I think Google still considers it a beta, even when there is no mention of it. Maybe I'm wrong, but the same happened when the Assistant was launched in English in Allo, before the Pixel launch. JD Has it learned french? Or has it learned Quebecois? Qbancelli Gracias, Google! Daniel D’Oleo ¡Por fin, ya habla español! 😃 Can confirm it works in Spanish (Spain/Latin America). https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/737f7c20cd24f2fc2ad7d8dee390630046978e4c2f455b8f88277ae7afa1fcbf.png Diego S. Spanish yesss Petr Kuchyňka And few commands in Czech (like setting an alarm etc.) Gerardo Sarabia this should come to the rest of the Assistant ecosystem, instead of being limited to Allo. Leonardo Baez Thanks for the heads up. I will change my language to spanish now. 👍 cvm And here, I'm trying to learn French... Stefan There is so much to do in the field of bi-lingual and tri-lingual users.. the OS should know when I chat with a specific person what language I use and the keyboard and Assistant should adopt to contacts across the device.. I use three languages on a daily basis and it's a nightmare to say the least. EnerJi Do you use Gboard as your keyboard? Supposedly it auto-detects languages automatically, but I haven't tested it extensively and I'm not sure whether it works well. Stefan yes nexus 5x with clean android and Gboard.. it seems to work every now and then, and only integrates with native android apps. my iPad seems to work better with remembering which language was previously used in the chat.. but that's iMessage ... siri is one language only and that's a BIG reason why I switched to android because google Now understood which language I was speaking in.. google assistant is FAR behind Rod Swiftkey is your friend. VAVAMk_2 ¿Cuándo podemos esperar que Google Allo aprenda soporte SMS además de nuevos idiomas? YuCMi Proof that Allo is still in beta... it's literally Google's testing ground.

A new group from the U.K. is pushing for transparency in online political advertising. Why it matters to Canada, too Colin Horgan May 9, 2017 Twitter Facebook Google+ Share LinkedIn Reddit Email   (Dado Ruvic/Reuters) In the 12 months before the 2015 U.K. election, the Conservative party spent around £1.2 million (CAD $2.13 million) on Facebook advertising, and a further £312,033 (CAD $553,000) on Google ads. The figures from the Labour party were much different. According to BuzzFeed, Labour spent anywhere from as little as £16,400 (CAD $29,000) on Facebook ads to as much as around £130,000—along with just £371 (CAD $658) on Google ads. Did that influence the surprise Conservative majority government? Facebook was quick to suggest it might have, citing the Conservative 2015 win as a “success story” whilst promoting the site’s ability to target ads to voters. “In a tightly contested election, the U.K. political party combined powerful creative with Facebook’s targeting tools to achieve what the pollsters and media had universally predicted to be impossible: a win by outright majority.” Whether that’s just keen self-promotion, or whether those Facebook ads really were what won it, is perhaps up for debate. But one thing remains clear, two years later: the regulations governing political ads online in the U.K. haven’t changed much in the interim. As in 2015, political parties in the U.K. will eventually have to disclose how much they spent on ads, but they still won’t have to say how they targeted that spending, including on whom, where, and with what information. RELATED: Can Facebook’s misinformation problem be fixed? “You can pay Facebook to target users with messaging, and no one is monitoring what that messaging is,” Damian Collins, the head of the U.K.’s parliamentary committee on culture, media, and sport (and a Conservative MP) told the Guardianin April. Britain’s election watchdog, the Electoral Commission, “can adjudicate on whether disinformation has been deliberately spread by a mainstream political party, but a lot of this campaign activity will go relatively unseen. Nobody at Facebook is checking what information is being put out there,” Collins said. Sam Jeffers, a former employee of Blue State Digital, the digital strategy and fundraising firm that worked on Barack Obama’s 2008 and 2012 campaigns, and which helped Labour in that 2015 election, says the unregulated nature of political ads on Facebook is indeed troubling. “Facebook is new money in British elections,” Jeffers says. “Here we have this completely new source of communication, paid communication … where the parties have essentially an unlimited amount of money they can spend to target people in what certain way they feel like. And no one has ever really talked about it. There is no discussion as to whether this is something we want to have happen or not.” Jeffers teamed up with Louis Knight-Webb, product manager at a site called Represent.me, an online voting platform that—among other things—helps show voters how they align with parties on issues, to bring some clarity to political ad buying. Together, they founded WhoTargetsMe. WhoTargetsMe is a Chrome extension (which users download as an add-on to the Google-based browser). Once downloaded, WhoTargetsMe works like an ad blocker, only rather than blocking the ad, it collects information about it and classifies the ad by party. When users click on the WhoTargetsMe icon at the top of their browser, they see that information—and thus have a better idea of which parties are targeting them throughout the campaign. (Users can also fill out a form if they don’t want to install the extension.) While WhoTargetsMe doesn’t automatically collect users’ data, the developers behind it do ask a few questions about age demographic, gender, and the location of its volunteers to gain a better understanding of why they saw the ad they did. “It won’t be as sophisticated by asking those three questions as the parties are likely to target, but we’ll be able to get some broad trends about which types of ads are being used to reach which groups, the general volume of advertising we’re seeing from the parties,” says Jeffers. “And then obviously, because we’ll have the specific ads, we’ll also be able to review the content of those ads and look at things that, again, are fairly new in British politics—things like really negative attack ads.” RELATED: The problem with Facebook’s plan to teach you how to read news Sophisticated political ads are becoming a significant part of modern elections—perhaps more important an influencing factor on voters than so-called “fake news”, the misinformation posts that garnered so much attention both before and after Donald Trump’s presidential victory in November 2016. We may think that we could clearly recognize a political ad on Facebook, as it would carry a party logo; but even if we did, we may not be aware of the volume advertising. Given the nature of Facebook’s News Feed—an ever-updating, endless scroll of posts tailored to what the site’s algorithm thinks we’ll enjoy seeing—people may not notice that, over time, they start to see more ads from one party than another. Facebook does, for the record, make it possible to discover why ads have shown up in a user’s feed; one simply has to click on a little arrow in the top right corner of the ad. But, Jeffers says, “it’s not obvious.” And in some instances, it might also not be immediately obvious who placed the ad. In Canada, for example, Elections Canada stipulates that election advertising online must include a statement of authorization “in or on the message” from the party’s chief agent (the person in charge of any party’s financial transactions). However, in the event that it “cannot be included on the advertising message itself … because of its size,” Elections Canada still considers the requirement met if that authorization statement “is made immediately apparent to the viewer by following the link” in the ad. In other words, if a user doesn’t click through from Facebook—perhaps only scanning the post—they might not be totally certain where the ad came from. It raises another issue that Collins, the U.K. MP, alluded to. He wondered what might happen if the information voters are seeing on Facebook is being placed “not by political parties but by proxy organizations using these tools to spread disinformation and to sway voters?” Similarly to Elections Canada, the U.K.’s Electoral Commission requires third parties to register and track what they spend while promoting a particular party or candidate. But again, the details of those ads—both how they were targeted and the content itself—is not something either electoral governing body collects, nor publishes. Could a foreign entity, not registered in either country, place political-styled ads on Facebook, targeted to voters? It is not obvious that they could not. (Elections Canada did not answer that question directly, providing instead the rules surrounding third-party spending during elections, which apply only to groups or people registered in Canada.) However, it’s possible that if an ad made defamatory or inaccurate claims – the kind of things normally in contravention of election advertising guidelines – it might be investigated. RELATED: Until A.I. replaces us, we all work for Facebook Would Facebook allow such a thing? Again, it’s not entirely clear. Facebook’s general advertising guidelines state only that ads “must not contain content that exploits controversial political or social issues for commercial purposes.” Jeffers and others have suggested that Facebook (and Google) could proactively take on the same task that WhoTargetsMe is currently trying to fulfill—that is, they could provide users with more transparency for political ads. An email to a spokesperson from Facebook Canada that asked if Facebook is considering releasing data on how political parties target their ads went unanswered. The issue of targeted ads, Jeffers says, “opens up really interesting questions about what’s free and fair and what the influence of money is in elections here.” “These campaigns are meant to be open and transparent and a fair fight in terms of debate for our vote and our mind, and here we have things where one very small part of the population might be seeing something very specific,” he says. “You can’t get a national message out there and miss all people under 30. On Facebook, you just set that as a parameter, and no one under 30 will see your ads. That’s the question, right?” Jeffers asks, rhetorically. “How can a party govern without trying to persuade some group of people—young people, men, women whatever it is, whoever they think is [not] going to vote for them. I think that stuff is problematic.” Twitter Facebook Google+ Share LinkedIn Reddit Email   Filed under: Editor's Picks facebook Theresa May U.K. election 2017 Advertisement Advertisement    Post navigation Previous Donald Trump’s firing of James Comey is ‘breathtakingly unwise’ Next In B.C. election 2017, the Green Party could be kingmakers Leave a comment Hide comments Comments are closed.

Microsoft apparantly took it very serious, as it likely was one of the biggest exploits ever. Right now they are patching Windows. The flaw is inside Windows Defender. Microsoft's speed in issuing an automatic patch is impressive for a change. The vulnerability in Windows that could allow people to run malicious  unauthorized code. The vulnerability located in the malware protection software of Windows, Defender. The vulnerability was discovered by two Google Project Zero employees. They called the vulnerability the worst in a long time, because the vunerability was in the Microsoft's Malware Protection Engine, the software used as the basis for various Windows security programs, including Windows Defender. Tavis Ormandy, one of the Google Project Zero researchers who discovered the flaw, warned exploits were "wormable," meaning they could lead to a self-replicating chain of attacks that moved from vulnerable machine to vulnerable machine. Windows Defender has far-reaching access to the files and processes on your computer. Unauthorized code could be executed via the vulnerability, without the user even having to open say an infected email attachment. Microsoft's malware protection automatically scans all files on the hard disk, including temporary files, which means that receiving an email or viewing a web page would already be enough to infect a computer. Therefore, Google's security staff were concerned about vulnerability because they could be remotely run and also very easily distributed. This Vulnerability is located in Windows 7, 8, 8.1, RT, 10, and in various business versions of the operating system. The update that Microsoft has released today corrects the issue and will be automatically installed by all users of the affected versions within two days. Rate this story Rating: 1 ... Bad 2 ...

Thats not entirely clear. Windows Defender in Windows 7 still gets updated, so it may have been caused by a change somewhere down the line, and not been present from day 1. Without testing a large variety of versions, its impossible to know - but also not all that interesting to spend much time on to find out.

Even when it is disabled you still have the ability to use it as a manual backup and that's a good thing. Post New Comment Click here to post a comment for this news story on the message forum.

Using these software, you can easily find unknown devices on your PC that you have installed recently. These software scan all the devices connected to your PC and list the names of unknown devices that won’t show in the device manager of Windows. Not only detect the unknown device, most of these software also lets you download device drivers for that. And in the following list, I have added 5 such software that can do this very easily. Sometimes, Windows is unable to recognize some devices, especially the old ones like web cameras, old disk drives, graphic cards, etc. And to find the correct drivers for them becomes difficult. That’s where these free unknown device identifier come in handy. All you have to do is just run them and sit back. They will only require your interaction to download the drives for your device. Sponsored Links So, now let’s see more about these free unknown device identifier software for Windows. 5 Free Unknown Device Identifier Software for Windows Hardware Identify Hardware Identify is one of the best free unknown device identifier software for Windows. First, it scans your PC, takes some time for that and then lists all the devices available on your PC. In the scan list, you will see some devices listed as “Unknown”. It will show the name of the devices and the hardware ID in further details, that will help you download the drivers for that device. Though, the software doesn’t download the drivers nor updates them for you, but it will allow you to search the drivers on Google by the device name or its hardware ID. Hardware Identify comes as a standalone installer and a portable software. So, depending on what suits your needs, you can download it from the above link. After that, open it up and it will automatically start scanning your computer for detecting unknown hardware. When the scan completes, it will list all the devices according to their category. And one of the category in the list is Unknown. When you double-click the Unknown node, it will open a pop-up window where you will see the details like hardware ID, name, etc of the device. You can then search for the drivers for your device using the “Search Google For Drivers” button from the pop-up window. See the above screenshot. DriverIdentifier DriverIdentifier is another very powerful tool to identify unknown devices on your PC. The software is actually an official freeware client from “Driveridentifier.com” and a very good software to detect an unknown device and download the corresponding drivers. The software first scans all the devices connected to your PC and then it uploads the results to its main website and then shows you the details about the devices of your PC. It shows you the name and hardware Id of the device in the report and the link to download the drivers for it. Identifying an unknown device using DriverIdentifier is very simple. Just download and install it from the above link and then open it up. After that, you will see the Scan now button that you have to click in order to start the device scan. Do note that for working of this software an internet connection is required. And if your PC isn’t connected to internet, then you can check the “I don’t have internet connection” option. And in that case, it will create an HTML file that you can open on any other PC which has the internet connection. The HTML file that it create will redirect you directly to its website where you will see the report about the devices of your PC. If your PC is connected to the internet, then it will open your browser and will load its website where it will show you the scan result of your PC. In the result, there is a section Unknown device, which has the details about the unknown device. And when you click on the download link which is given in front of “Unknown device”, it will show you the name of the device, its hardware id and link to the corresponding drivers if there is any. After that, you can download the drives for your device if you want to. You can see the above screenshot. Unknown device Identifier Unknown device Identifier is a free software to identify unknown devices on your PC. The software is very simple to use and can easily find the details about the unknown device. It scans your PC to detect all the hardware and then list them. But, the software works differently as it doesn’t categorize the unknown devices but adds the device in the list with its name. So, you will have to manually identify it, if you know what kind of device you have inserted in your PC. For example, I have an old webcam from Creative labs and the software has listed its name in the result, rather than categorizing in the separate list. Additionally, you can search for the drivers for the device by searching on Google. Also, the software allows you to export the device list to a file. Download and install this software from above link and then open it up. As you open it, it will start scanning your computer and will take some time to complete the scan. After completion of the scan, it will show you the list of all detected devices and unknown devices will also be there. You will see that it organizes them by their name. The software doesn’t update the device drivers automatically, but allows you to search the drivers on Google. And you can do that by right clicking on the device name. See the above screenshot. Unknown Devices Unknown Devices is another free unknown device identifier software for Windows. The software comes as a portable software and is quite helpful in identifying a particular unknown device in your system. It lists the devices according to the type and places the unknown devices in Other devices section. You can then see the details about those devices by expanding the Other devices tree node. However, the software didn’t show the name of the device in my case, but was able to show vendor name. It also shows other information such as hardware id, class, id, enumerator, etc. And this information is enough to find the name and drivers of the device. You don’t really have to install the software in order to make it work. Just grab its executable using the above URL and then launch it. After running the application, it will start searching the devices on your PC. And when the scan completes, it will list all the devices on its interface according to their type. And the unknown devices are listed under the Other devices section. Expand the Other devices section and click on the unknown device, and it will show the vendor name of the device. When you double-click on the device entry, it will show you more details like hardware ID, enumerator, etc. You can search the hardware id directly on the internet to get to know the device name, drivers, etc. Device Manager of Windows Apart from using the third-party software as device identifier software, you can also use the Device Manager of Windows to do the same. This method will not be able to show you the name of the device, but can help you getting the name. Actually, we can use the hardware properties such as hardware id of the device to identify it. And it is very easy. Open the Device Manger of Windows by typing “devmgmt.msc” in the run dialog. Or, you can also open it by searching in the Start. When you have opened it, you will see the list of all devices connected to your PC. Navigate to the Other devices type and right-click on the “Unknown device”. Now, choose the properties and then the properties window will open; navigate to the Details tab. Now, from the property drop down, select “Hardware Ids” and the corresponding values will be displayed. You can copy any value by right-clicking on it and then directly search it on Google. After that, you will be able to see the corresponding name for the hardware id. See the above screenshot. Final Words These were some very good unknown device identifier software that I have found. All of these worked fine for me and were able to give me the name of the unknown device. Also, I was able to download the correct version of drivers for my device. And that’s what I like most about some of these software that they help you find correct drivers for your device. So, if you are looking for some free unknown device identifier software, this list will be helpful.

Google Home now works with smart home products from iDevices, NuBryte, and more Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/09 12:28pm PDTMay 9, 2017 8 Plus 1 on G+ 12 Share on Facebook 38 Share on Twitter Total Shares58 Google Google Home News The Google Home only worked with a handful of services at launch, but over the past few months, we've seen more and more services start to work with it. Starting today, select products from iDevices, NuBryte, Universal Devices, and MobiLinc will be compatible with the Google Home (and anything else with Google Assistant). iDevices sells a variety of smart home products, including light switches, wall outlets, and lights. All of iDevices' products are rather expensive, but at least you don't need a hub for them. Two of the company's products stand out as pretty cool - a rain-tight outdoor smart plug, and an adapter to make any light bulb 'smart' (but buying Hue light bulbs would probably work better in most cases). NuBryte's main product is the TouchPoint, which replaces the light switch in a room with a touchscreen display. The TouchPoint can control lighting, view camera feeds, work as an intercom, and display weather and calendar information. However, it hasn't received great reviews. Universal Devices sells INSTEON lighting controllers, like this one, primarily for business or enthusiast use. Finally, MobiLinc offers apps for controlling specific smart home systems, such as ones using Universal Devices controllers.

Google is rolling out support for iHeartRadio for the Google Home Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/02/28 11:52am PDTFeb 28, 2017 8 Plus 1 on G+ 37 Share on Facebook 35 Share on Twitter Total Shares80 Google Google Home News Google Home has supported playing radio through TuneIn since launch. Simply ask it to play a local AM/FM or internet station, and it will start streaming in seconds. Now it looks like Google is in the early stages of rolling out support for iHeartRadio. Earlier today, Google updated its list of supported services on the Home to include iHeartRadio. Asking it to play most stations seems to result in the standard "It isn't available or can't be played right now" message. I was only able to get one local FM station to actually play, but you can try it for yourself by asking "Play [station] on iHeartRadio." I expect this will be officially announced and rolled out sometime in the next few days. In the meantime, you can always cast to the Home from the iHeartRadio app or use TuneIn.

Robert LoPinto I use IFTTT.com to integrate Google Home with my LIFX bulbs and Harmony Hub. I just say 'Watch TV' and my Samsung TV turns on, FireTV stick launches my Playstation Vue channel, and my lights dim if it is after sunset. Robert Can you reach out to me on facebook at fb.com/adkins147. I need help using IFTTT.com with the Harmony Hub. I have the harmony hub setup for my TV, but something is wierd. Phalkon30 Over the weekend we noticed our home saying it was playing music from iHeartRadio, but couldn't specifically request it to come from them. This was the big thing my wife felt she was missing from our home Randothecomando Whenever I try to cast iHeart Radio to my Google home, I get any error message. It won't cast. ObotNot Working perfectly for me in the D.C. metro area. Asked GH to play WASH-FM (ugh) and WMZQ on iHeart, and it fired right up. Thanks for the heads-up on this! RJ Works great for most stations but if I ask about a station that's not live like on demand (for example The 15 minute morning show) it is not found. I'm glad they are adding most stations but I'm hoping it's available for all soon...

Does that mean that Google Home becomes useless when you just want to relax? It seems that Google wants to ensure that Google Home is used at all times, which is why the device can now playback relaxing ambient sounds. For those who are looking to enjoy some relaxing ambient sounds after a long day at work or at school, not to worry as all you’d have to do is tell Google Home to either “Help me relax” or “Play ambient noise”.

If this sounds like something you might be be interested in, then fire up Google Home and take those sounds for a spin which should already be live and available. Filed in Gadgets >Home.

Google sends them out when it detects a "government-backed attacker" has attempted to hack an account through phishing or malware. Last time I saw one, I added two-factor authentication to many of my accounts. This time it prompted me to ask: Can I do even better? [ Further reading: How the new age of antivirus software will protect your PC ] Martyn Williams/IDGNS A security warning message displayed by Google. It turns out I can. Google suggests a security key as a more secure alternative. These are little USB devices that generate one-time tokens in place of the six-digit codes from authenticator apps. Google supports a format called FIDO Universal 2nd Factor (U2F), which it helped develop. Keys are available that work over USB, Bluetooth, and NFC, so they can be used with a smartphone or tablet in addition to a PC. Martyn Williams/IDGNS Hardware security keys from Feitian (left) and Yubico. They are really easy to use. First, once you've bought a key, it needs to be registered with the site. When subsequently logging in, a prompt appears after a username and password have been entered. Authenticating with the key is simply a matter of plugging it into a USB socket and pressing the small gold disc. MARTYN WILLIAMS/IDGNS A dialog box greets users signing into a Facebook account protected by a security key. The disc triggers the key to transmit a 44-character code to confirm the login. The first 12 characters of the code are the public key of the device being used and the remaining 32 are a unique passcode for the login attempt. On a smartphone, an NFC key can simply be placed against the back of the phone to send the codes. And that's all there is to it. It's much easier than juggling a smartphone and authentication codes. Before you commit U2F is currently only supported by two browsers, Google Chrome and Opera. Together, they account for about two-thirds of desktop browsing and are available on Windows, macOS, and Linux, so a good portion of the market is covered, but if you prefer Firefox, Safari, or another browser, you'll need to switch. And U2F only works on a handful of sites and services at present, but they do include some major ones like Google, Facebook, Salesforce, GitHub, and DropBox. Simply securing your Google and Facebook accounts might be compelling enough to add a security key to your key ring because both sites are prime targets for cyberattacks and identify theft. But, if you use an iPhone or iPad, bad news. The keys don't properly work with these devices. You should have no problem with Android. Martyn Williams/IDGNS Yubico's smallest key can slip into a wallet or remain in an USB socket. Also consider logistics. With an authenticator app, the codes are wherever your phone is, and your phone is usually with you. With a security key, you'll need to carry it around. The good news is that it's small, very sturdy and easily sits on a keyring. Know your standards The security key can also be used to protect access to a password manager. The Dashlane password manager supports FIDO U2F, while several other competitors, including LastPass, support OTP, a similar but incompatible standard, so you need to be careful while shopping as not all keys will generate both U2F and OTP codes. Some of the most popular keys come from Yubico and most support both U2F and OTP, but the cheapest of the company's line-up isn't compatible with OTP. One step forward, two steps back While Google and Facebook both promote security keys as a better way to keep your account safe, both companies have a potential hole in their implementations. If you set a recovery phone number to receive security codes via SMS, that phone number remains active until you disable it. That's a problem because SMS is not a secure transmission channel. Hackers have already managed to attack bank accounts protected with SMS-based authentication codes due to weaknesses in the protocol. So, you need to disable phone backup. The security settings pages in both Google and Facebook will allow you to do that. While you're in there, it's a good idea to set up account login alerts, so you if someone does manage to get into your account by no matter what means, you'll know about it. Google and Facebook wouldn't comment on their use of security keys. Where can you use security keys? Yubico has a helpful matrix on its site detailing compatibility, and there are a couple of listings of sites that support security keys and the standards they use. One is maintained by Yubico, but the most exhaustive I found was from Germany's Nitrokey, which also sells security keys.

The software would allow Microsoft to take on Amazon's Echo and Google's Home smart speaker. It will also turn the computer or laptop screen into a 'digital pinboard' to show everything from messages to pictures and weather forecasts when the machine is not in use. Scroll down for video  The app will turn the millions of Windows PCs, laptops and tablets already in homes into a 'home hub' that can do everything from control lights to answer questions. HOW IT WILL WORK  Software will be able to do everything the Amazon Echo and Google Home devices can. It will use Microsoft's Cortana as a smart AI assistant.  Will also be a shared 'family account' for calendars and reminders. The new software will also be able to control smart home devices, including lights, doors, locks and more.    The Verge obtained internal concepts of exactly how Microsoft hopes HomeHub will work. 'The major addition is a new welcome screen that includes an 'always on' digital corkboard to let families use to-do lists, calendars, and notes,' The Verge said. 'Microsoft appears to be readying Windows 10 for future devices that are similar to Amazon's new Echo Show hardware, with easy access to voice search, calling, and smart device control.'  Microsoft is also developing a Home app for Windows to allow consumers to easily control connected gadget, and is planning to support Hue, Nest, Insteon, Wink, and SmartThings devices.  It will also make it far easier to share Windows machines, according to previous reports from Windows Central.  'Home Hub isn't a dedicated device that's designed to take on the likes of the Amazon Echo and Google Home, as in the end, Home Hub is just the software,' it said. However, the software will be able to do everything the Amazon Echo and Google Home devices can - and more.  AMAZON'S ECHO SHOW  After weeks of anticipation, Amazon has finally launched its new Echo Show smart assistant. The voice-controlled speaker features a 7-inch touchscreen display, which can be used to make video calls After weeks of anticipation, Amazon has finally launched its new Echo Show smart assistant.  The voice-controlled speaker features a 7-inch touchscreen display, which can be used to make video calls and playback video content. It will be available in white or black, and officially launches in the US on June 28 at a retail price of $229.99 (£179). On its website, Amazon said: 'Echo Show brings you everything you love about Alexa, and now she can show you things.  'Watch video flash briefings and YouTube, see music lyrics, security cameras, photos, weather forecasts, to-do and shopping lists, and more.  'All hands-free - just ask.'  The device weighs 2.6 pounds (1.1 kilograms), which suggests it won't be seen as a mobile phone replacement.  The new device is the fourth Echo-branded product, and comes three years after the first Amazon Echo launched in 2014.      'Home Hub is designed to run on Windows 10 PCs, mainly All-In-Ones and 2-in-1's with touch screens, but can work on any Windows 10 machine.,' it is claimed. As well as giving access to Microsoft's Cortana AI assistant, it will allow families to more easily create share accounts.  'There will also be a 'family account' that is always logged in,' Windows Central says. That account can see everything the 'family' is supposed to see, such as specific apps, calendar appointments, to-do's, and more. The new software will also be able to control smart home devices, including lights, doors, locks and more.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Has YOUR Google account been hacked? Researchers say...

Share this article Share It will use Microsoft's Cortana to allow voice control - much like Apple's siri HomeKit integration.  The firm is also expected to work with theird parties to create dedicated home hub devices, with talks already underway with HP and Lenovo.  Recently one YouTuber user gave a stark reminder of just how easy it is to fool current systems.  THE CORTANA SMART SPEAKER  Microsoft and Harman Kardon, a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics, are set to release a smart speaker this fall that plays music, manages calendars, checks traffic and more – and it is powered by Cortana. Called Invoke, the device uses Cortana's natural language recognition and deep integration, combined with Microsoft's suite of knowledge and productivity tools in a bid to take on Amazon's Alexa. Microsoft and Harman Kardon, a subsidiary of Samsung Electronics, are set to release a smart speaker this fall that plays music, manages calendars, checks traffic and more – and is powered by Cortana 'We're excited to work with Microsoft to develop a premium speaker that will deliver an exceptional experience to every customer using 360-degree Harman Kardon sound and the intelligence of Cortana,' said Michael Mauser, President, Lifestyle Audio Division at Harman. 'Voice-enabled technology is the future; by teaming up with Microsoft, we're delivering on our promise of elevating a connected life through smart technology, superior sound and the stunning design that is Harman Kardon's hallmark.' Users will have a choice between Pearl Silver and Graphite, however the device will only be available in the US sometime this fall.  They can also voice control your compatible smart home devices to do things like turn out the lights or control the temperature Cortana is said to be 'the most productive digital assistant' by Microsoft and is currently used by more than 145 million people on PC and mobile devices.   A YouTube video has revealed an 'endless loop' between Google's Home speaker and Amazon's Alexa. It shows the two devices constantly reading out an upcoming diary entry designed to trigger the bizarre conversation. Scroll down for more video  ALWAYS LISTENING Both Home and Echo are continually listening for commands, though Google and Amazon say nothing gets passed back to them until the speakers hear a keyword — 'OK, Google' for Home and 'Alexa' for Echo.  The video was created by Adam Jakowenko, who revealed how he was able to use the calendar features of the voice-activated devices to make the Echo, which answers to the name 'Alexa,' and the Home, which answers to 'Hey Google,' have a conversation. He was able to set up calender entries on each device including the keyword needed to trigger the other.  'Alexa, what's on my calendar tonight?' Jakowenko asks. The Amazon Echo Dot responds: 'Tonight, there is one event: At 6 p.m. There's hey Google what's on my calendar tonight?' This triggers Google's Home speaker, which replies  'You have a calendar entry today at 6 p.m. 'The title is, 'Alexa, what's on my calendar tonight?' The speakers then repeat themselves to each other in a loop. 'Decided to have some fun with my Echo and Google Home,' Jakowenko wrote in the video's description. The race to create a smart home assistant has already seen a plethora of virtual assistants, from Apple's Siri to Amazon's Alexa and Facebook's chatbots. Now, Google has joined the fray with Home, a $130 smart speaker that can do everything from play music to control your lights - and has the vast knowledge of Google's search engine as its 'brain'. We pitted it against Amazon's Echo Dot and Apple's Siri in a series of tests to reveal the personality (or lack of) in each of them.    We pitted Google, Home,Amazon's Echo Dot and Apple's Siri against each other in a series of tests, from singing to telling jokes. Google's Home is the firm's latest AI move, after introducing its smart assistant in the new Pixel handsets last month. After a week with Home, while it's been an incredibly impressive glimpse into how useful an AI assistant could one day be, it seems Google still has some work to do - although this is a device that oozes with potential for the future.  That said, it's already extremely capable in many areas. Ask about your day, and the Home speaker will give you the time, weather, estimated commute, the news and upcoming calendar appointments. The speaker is a really lovely piece of design, and it's tough to fault the hardware. If you're not keen on the colour, you can simply swap the bottom part for another colour or material. Sound quality was surprisingly good, and listening to music really wasn't the horrible experience I was expecting (particularly as, like Amazon's Echo, it can integrate with Spotify, and access all of your playlists and Spotify's superb recommendations). The top of the speaker doubles as a touch sensitive control surface, although I found it was mainly used to control the volume. Useful LEDs swirl as it is working, so you know when it is thinking.  The voice recognition is also astonishingly good - I can barely recall it not hearing something over my week with it, whether it was my British accent or my wife's American one asking the questions. However, that does bring up one problem - it will answer anyone, and can only be linked to one Google account at the moment - so a couple can't both have their diaries available, for instance.  AMAZON ECHO VS GOOGLE HOME  Google's $1230 Home speaker is triggered by the phrase 'Hey Google' while Amazon's Echo uses A'Alexa. Amazon's smart speaker is available in two versions - the full sized $180 Echo shown here, and a smaller, $50 version called the Echo Dot.  Google Home AI speaker (left) shows the incredible potential of a smart home assistant - but still has a little bit of learning to do before it become indispensable. Amazon's Echo (right) is far better at using other services at the moment, known as skills. The obvious competitor at the moment is Amazon's Echo, with its Alexa assistant. It has a major head start on Google, and can do a lot more at the moment. However, even with its early incarnation of a Google digital companion called Assistant, Home actually seems the smarter of the two - and most of that is down to how much Google already knows about you. For instance, it knows about upcoming trips, based on reservations in Gmail, and also really nicely integrates commute times, complete with delays, based on data in Maps. Echo, on the other hand, can direct you to work - and that seems about it. However, the Echo does have the upper hand when it comes to partnerships, and can integrate with a Fitbit, order pizza and even call an Uber. Amazon has more than a thousand of these partnerships, known as skills. Google's integrations are initially limited to calling for Ubers, changing news or music providers and controlling smart lights from Phillips, SmartThings and the temperature of your home - if you're using Google's Nest. The speaker will come in six different colors, and be available from November 4th It's also possible to control your TV with home, up to a point.  Home supports Google's Chromecast but so far the support seems a little patchy, and I found it doesn't always work.  However, with a 4K version hitting the market soon, expect this to be another thing about Home that gets better very quickly. Both devices work as alarm clocks or timers — and are great in the kitchen.  GOOGLE'S AI AMBITIONS: SMART ASSISTANTS EVERYWHERE The firm also revealed its Google Home smart speaker will go on sale in November. At the unveiling of Home in May, Google boss Sundar Pichai said:  'We think of the assistant as an ambient experience that goes across devices - this is more than just phones, it will be on devices they wear, in their car and in their living rooms.' The leading tech companies are all competing to assist consumers in their online activities such as shopping, since that gives the companies a better chance of selling advertising or other services. Home-based systems like the Echo are taking on more importance with the advent of improved voice technology, according to Julie Ask, an analyst at Forrester Research. Home really excels here though - you can ask it recipes, and it'll read out cooking instructions to you.  It's also a lot more fun if you have kids - for instance, it can play sound games if you ask it what sounds animals makes (although my dog was unimpressed by its cow impression).  However, using a smart speaker, be in the Echo Dot or Home, does require a big change in the behaviour of owners. It really does take a while before you automatically remember you can ask Google for things - and I must confess, a week in with Home, I often still whip out my phone to do things I could simply have asked for. But given time, it seems having the might of Google's search engine behind is will give Home a much smarter brain than anyone else - and could see Google making a smart home assistant a reality.    Read more: Microsoft's Home Hub ambitions aim to crush Google Home and Amazon Echo [exclusive] | Windows Central Microsoft is planning to turn Windows 10 PCs into Amazon Echo competitors - The Verge Share or comment on this article e-mail 10 shares Most watched News videos China holds live-fire drill with 'Flying Leopard' fighter jets Legally blind student surprised with gift of sight for his birthday Excited puppy buries his own head first day at the beach Teenager shockingly punches woman after she rejects his advances Graphic videos shows Pittsburgh cops punching man on street Terrified schoolgirl repeatedly passes out during catapult ride Iowa congressman Rod Blum storms out of a local TV interview Soccer coach reveals he is a transgender man to his team Helicopter battles wildfire at Okefenokee Wildlife Refuge Bee-ardyman: Thousands of bees swarm around man's face and beard Baby has hilarious salon talk with mom as she brushes her hair Un-bear-evable!

MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe. It features 24 hours of battery life and claims to be a 'mini-disco on the move'. But does it live up to the claim? Samsung's Galaxy S8: A hefty price tag and a dumb personal assistant Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning, but its $100 price hike is hard to swallow. Overall the S8 is for those who want elegance - and are willing to pay for it. Affordable, robust and surprisingly responsive: Samsung's Galaxy A5 With the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 having been pushed back, South Korea-based Samsung has plugged the gap with the Samsung Galaxy A5, a high-end device with a mid-range price tag.

Google Home can now order you groceries from Tesco in the UK, via IFTTT Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/05/09 11:09am PDTMay 9, 2017 8 Plus 1 on G+ 23 Share on Facebook 44 Share on Twitter Total Shares75 Applications Downloads Google Home News For a couple of months now, Google Home users in the US have been able to easily order shopping from a range of US retailers through the Google Express service. Now, those in the UK are going to be treated to a similar luxury, with supermarket Tesco adding support for ordering with the Google Assitant via a clever little workaround — using a special IFTTT recipe. Following a recent update to Tesco's IFTTT channel, it's now possible to make use recipes such as "OK Google, add [something] to my basket" to include items in your next order. You can edit the phrase to be anything you want, too. So you could say "buy more milk" or "procure another kilo of caviar," and the integration will do the rest. The service will be particularly useful if you've been using Tesco home delivery for some time as it will default to favorites you already have on your account and otherwise try to give preference to items you've previously purchased. Another rather helpful feature is that when adding something once you've already finalized an order, the app will automatically amend it to include the recent addition, so long as it's not already out for delivery. Tesco is the biggest supermarket chain in the UK and it's great to see its support for technology still in its infancy. It's also especially impressive that rather than wait for Google to roll out Express in the UK (which could be a way off) it's found another way to make use of Google Assistant and compete with Amazon's Alexa in the process. To give it a try you'll need to live in the UK and have a tesco.com account. And you'll also need the IFTTT app, which you can grab using the link below or from APKMirror.

The graphics processing unit (GPU) company announced its first quarter earnings today with revenue of $1.94 billion, a 48% gain year over year. While gaming drives most of the company’s sales, its largest area of growth over the past year was selling GPUs that power the artificial intelligence and graphics processing in datacenters. That sector of business saw 186% growth year over year, just a dip below last quarter’s 205% growth. Nvidia has built itself into a leader in this space, selling enterprise GPUs to Google, Microsoft, Amazon, IBM, Tencent, and Baidu. But at least half of that list (Google, Microsoft, and IBM) are working on chips that are custom-built to be better at artificial intelligence tasks than GPUs or any other competing hardware. The others are also undoubtedly searching for more efficient ways of powering AI, already an industry-wide technology. Just last month, Google published a blog post opining on the value of their custom chip, the tensor processing unit. The company claimed its technology ran 15 to 30 times faster than comparably GPUs from the time of initial development (2015), while using 30 to 80 times less energy. The company has since built new versions of the chip, but haven’t released more current stats. Though Google is still buying GPUs as it works out how to build and scale its own hardware, the paper shows that Nvidia’s current position as a leader in AI hardware doesn’t ensure future success in the space. Nvidia has also pushed heavily to enter the automotive space, setting itself up for growth in a area that holds technology relationships for longer than the typical Silicon Valley company. Most recently, it has partnered with Bosch to build an entire computer system for autonomous cars. Nvidia CEO Jen-Hsun Huang said in March that the company’s hardware would be able to completely drive a car, 100% of the time, by the end of 2018.

That's a contrast to a previous ruling involving Microsoft, and highlights the complexity of applying national laws to Internet issues. The case involves an FBI search warrant that applies to a criminal suspect. Google had refused to comply with the warrant on two grounds: that there wasn't enough evidence for a seizure to overcome the restrictions placed by the constitution, and that the emails were physically stored outside of the US and thus couldn't be covered by a domestic warrant. Email Search Not Classed as 'Seizure' A federal court rejected both arguments. Judge Thomas Rueter said the FBI getting hold of the emails would not count as a seizure because "there is no meaningful interference" with the person's "possessory interest" in the data. In other words, the fact that the FBI could see the emails wouldn't stop the suspect continuing to "possess" the data themselves. (Source: reuters.com) Rueter also noted that Google regularly moves the physical location of customer emails from one place to another without it being a legal issue for the customer. On the second point, in which Google noted that the emails were stored outside the US - Rueter ruled that the location issue wasn't relevant because when the FBI views the emails, the "search" will take place in the US, and thus domestic law applies. Microsoft Received Opposing Verdict The ruling is something of a surprise, as an appeals court previously threw out a similar court order on Microsoft involving emails it had physically stored on a server in the Republic of Ireland. One possible reason for the difference is that Google said in its evidence that the data which makes up a user's email account is sometimes split and stored in different locations to improve performance, which means it's not always simple to say which country particular messages are stored in. (Source: computerworld.com) In both cases, the confusion is partly because the warrants relied on the Stored Communications Act, which lay down exceptions to the Fourth Amendment when it comes to electronic data. The fourth amendment roughly translates to: "the right of the people to be secure in their persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated." The problem is that the Stored Communications Act was written in 1986, and thus doesn't pay much attention to the possibilities of data moving across national borders, especially in regard to the Internet.

In this case, the judge uses the phrase "possessory interest" as it applies to digital media. One could easily apply this "theory" of possession to other things, such as banking information or GPS - and voila, the police and government now have rights to everything you do on your phone, computer, car, etc. Yes, the data hasn't physically moved, but the idea of having the government being able to gain access to said data based on technical wording such as this, and further actions as a result of similar rulings will surely be rejected by most. Log in or register to post comments What about other locations data protection & privacy regulation Permalink Submitted by jamies on Tue, 02/07/2017 - 15:46 What about other locations data protection and privacy, security regulations, laws and requirements. As in for an organisation to acquire data within the EU the organisation has to affirm that they will hold the data in a secure and safe manner and location, such that the data is held in as secure, safe and private manner as it would be if it was held in the country where it was acquired. Now, I accept this case deals with email rather than data specifically held about individual persons. But does the ruling not actually void any organisations affirmation that they will protect the privacy of data. Consequently, as this ruling seems (to me) to indicate that data held by any organisation subject to USA law, courts, or their enforcement agents, is NOT protected. Consequently: No such organisation can believe they can conform to the data protection requirements applicable in such locations as the EU Indeed, I suspect that ruling may mean the Russian requirements provide better protection for their residents than are possible in the USA Note - I say residents not Citizens because the USA law applies to data held, or accessible to any person or organisation subject to the USA courts, and ... if you are an 'official Resident' of almost any other country, then those laws cannot (except under treaties) be applied to foreign residents. Residents in the UK - note extradition to the USA is pretty much they just have to ask and give a reason, not any actual evidence. Sort of like - He accessed the FBI computers using the master administrator id and password the is printed in the manufacturer's publically available, and dispatched to any requestor regardless of what country of their postal address OK - there is a warning that a different id and password should be set within the computer systems - but that's far too much effort for our FBI technical staff to manage. - what - who RTFM? Log in or register to post comments I don't get it. What makes a Permalink Submitted by matt_2058 on Tue, 02/07/2017 - 19:37 I don't get it. What makes a judge think his ruling applies to all the world? Is he only giving the FBI a ruling to use as support for an extradition of sorts? I agree with the 'resident' vs 'citizen' difference. It should make a difference. But as we all know, crimes are location dependent. And the hosting country is the law, or should be. Log in or register to post comments Matt 2058, Permalink Submitted by jamies on Wed, 02/08/2017 - 15:24 Matt 2058, Not sure from your response that I made the point clearly: In a country within the EU and within Russia, the laws are pretty much that: If you collect data on or from people, then You may NOT pass that data to a location where the laws that applied to it on collection no longer apply. So If the USA legislation does NOT require data be kept private and securely so, then any organisation moving data from the EU, or Russia to the USA is breaking the law. Now the courts in the USA seem to be stating that any data held anywhere, inside, or outside the USA is subject to the USA courts control and can be distributed as they specify, regardless of the laws that applied to the data when it was collected. This ruling effectively states that, all data held by the organisation, regardless of where it is held, is subject to the USA regulations, and they override the regulations that applied to the collection of that data. So - if the Chinese, Russian, Afghanistan, and North Korean courts all take the same attitude - then should the USA take the same stance - and say OK - all data held by any organisation operating within the borders of those countries is to be made available to the agencies of those governments. As in - USA power distribution companies may operate in China etc. so all the details of the power supply infrastructure in the USA is, under the USA legislation now legally required to be made available to their government agencies.

It follows several major brands and the British government dropping Google advertising over the affair. The Times newspaper reported that videos from extremist groups had appeared beside advertising from many a host of big businesses and government agencies. That not only meant embarrassment but could mean that the advertisers were unwittingly -- if indirectly -- contributing to extremist groups. Content Classification Confusing Google's Matt Brittin told a conference that he wanted to "apologize to our partners and advertisers who might have been affected by their ads appearing on controversial content. We take our responsibilities to these industry issues very seriously." The British government has suspended its advertising on any Google service until the matter is resolved. This includes promotional campaigns to recruit blood donors and military staff. They are joined in that step by Havas, one of Europe's biggest advertising agencies. (Source: bbc.co.uk) The controversy is somewhat confusing because there are three different issues. One is whether the YouTube video is legal to show at all; another is whether the YouTube video breaches Google's content standards, which covers matters such as: violence, mature content, threatening behavior and content that is deceptive as part of a scam. However, it's the third issue that's causing the problems. That's the category of YouTube videos which are inherently legal and meets Google's content rules, but which is controversial enough that Google decides not to put advertising beside it. Google Revenues Could Take A Hit Advertisers say they need to be able to rely on Google's classification for this category so that their message or brand is not associated with unsuitable videos. Google's problem is developing clear enough guidelines for this category - not just for the benefit of advertisers, but also to make sure video creators who want to benefit from ad revenue can make sure their content is suitable. The controversy is serious enough that one stock analyst has downgraded Google from a 'buy' to a 'hold' recommendation because he believes the advertising boycotts could significantly harm revenue. (Source: cnn.com) What's Your Opinion? Are the advertisers right to boycott Google? Is it practical for Google to vet every video that might carry ads? Should Google go further in blocking extremist material from appearing on the site at all, whether or not it carries ads?

While I was led to believe that my ad would appear on a 'free ipod giveway' site, I was later informed that some of the customers that were acquired for me were through a number of porn sites. I was quite upset, to say the least. The agent that handled my account assured me that "in terms of acquiring a customer that is interested in your offer, those who visit a porn site are no different than someone visiting a site for a free ipod". Her argument was plausible but I disagreed and did not continue to advertise with that company. I hate to say it - but in the same respect, I see this being the same case. Not everyone viewing an extremist video is an extremist, and whether they are interested in your offer (advertisement) and proceed to click on your ad should not really make any difference. On the other hand, if Google gives this as a choice to advertisers (whether or not their ad appears next to controversial content), then they certainly need to stick to those guidelines. Also to be considered is that the person publishing the extremist video on YouTube profits from any clicks from advertisements - this is likely the bigger issue at hand.

Log in or register to post comments It is not one world Permalink Submitted by bern on Tue, 03/21/2017 - 16:18 In the UK and Europe there are strict controls on advertising in TV. It is not just terrorist and other extremist content, Government (national and local) along with major companies are castigated for the promotion through advertising of activities such as the anorexia, racism, sexism and a plethora of other dubious content. Adverts are seen by the public as specifically condoning and supporting the content they are shown along side. There are other cultural differences, the UK is far less troubled by non sexual nudity than the US, but much stricter on violence and its portrayal. Brest feeding is considered normal, healthy and should be promoted. There was outrage when Facebook censored even decorous photographs women brest feeding their own babies. Social media will have to learn that their content policies and advertising controls will have to become culturally sensitive and country specific. One size does not fit all and individual countries do not want to be either necessarily exposed to US norms or limited by them. There was an interesting article in the Times the other day about new technology. Initially it flourishes in an uncontrolled manner and the as the effects become evident, then controls are introduced. The automobile was a classic example. Initially anyone could just get in a car and drive, then as numbers grew it was taxed and you had to buy a license. In 1934 (in the UK) a driving test was introduced to reduce the growing number of accidents and deaths. Video content providers (Google, Amazon, and Social Media etc) will gradually have to meet country by country broadcasting standards or face large fines and blocking (even the US is having problems about 'Fake' news and Russian interference). Companies such as Uber will have to accept that they have to meet local employment legislation and local controls to protect both the travelling public, other road users and pedestrians (yes there are far more of those in the UK, it is also considered a healthy activity). Public safety has a cost, if you live in middle England why would you have confidence in the controls of a gung-ho company in California, who's only aim is to make big bucks from an enormous investment, that is struggling to be economic. Log in or register to post comments The Customer is Always Right Permalink Submitted by scowei on Tue, 03/21/2017 - 16:48 ...and the customer wants to choose their ad placement, just like they use to do with newspapers and TV shows. Google may take a revenue hit initially, but they'll make it up over time. Eventually, sites that want to be ad supported will alter their content. Meaning, if they are in it for the money, they'll avoid stuff (radical, etc.) that doesn't provide a high CPC. Pushing an agenda will become more of an (unpaid) hobby, rather than a revenue source. There are only so many companies that want to attract the types of people who watch radical content, so that content will become more niche. And it's happening all over, not just in England. See all the companies that have been the target of social media shaming for their ad placements in America and how they have taken steps to remove themselves from the likes of Breitbart, etc. It's already affecting the revenue of these types of sites, and when Amazon (currently being pressured) eventually updates their ad placement guidelines, revenue will drop further. An interesting point was made after this announcement by the Stratechery blog: what the heck are ad agencies getting 15% for? Aside from a little creativity, they are only placing ads on two networks: Google or Facebook. And then obviously not monitoring those ads in any way to make sure their clients are happy. If ad agencies had jumped on this with their own technology, they could have remained relevant. As it is, they are likely to fade away, just like travel agents before them.

The AIY Voice Kit includes hardware for audio capture and playback, connectors for the dual mike daughterboard and speaker, GPIO pins to connect low-voltage components such as micro servos and sensors, and an optional barrel connector for a dedicated power supply. The Voice Kit can use cloud services such as the recently released Google Assistant SDK, which is enabled by default, or it can use the Cloud Speech API or run completely on-device. The kit was designed and tested with the Raspberry Pi 3 Model B. No Limits Developers can run Android Things on the Voice Kit with full functionality, said Billy Rutledge, director of AIY Projects. That makes it easy to prototype IoT devices and scale to full commercial products with various available turnkey hardware solutions, including the Raspberry Pi 3, the Intel Edison and the NXP Pico. The Voice Kit can replace physical buttons and digital displays on household appliances and consumer electronics, replace smartphone apps to control connected devices, and add voice recognition to assistive robotics, for example. Applications for the kit are unlimited, according to Michael Jude, a program manager at Stratecast/Frost & Sullivan. "If the IoT is going to take off, it has to be easy to use," he told LinuxInsider. "A voice interface achieves this by making intelligent devices able to interact naturally with humans." AIY has published a parts list, assembly instructions, source code and suggested extensions. The kit began shipping to subscribers to The MagPi Magazine earlier this month. It's also available for sale at more than 500 Barnes & Nobles stores in the United States, as well as at UK retailers WH Smith, Tesco, Sainsburys and Asda. The Voice Kit's Limitations "It's a great teaching and development tool, but we need to understand its limitations," observed Jim McGregor, principal analyst at Tirias Research. "With limited processing performance, you will only be able to perform certain functions on the device," he told LinuxInsider. "Don't expect it to be able to replace Alexa or Siri." The Voice Kit might complement Google Home or Google Voice "by providing the electronics designer a platform to develop certain functions on before porting that model to a device," McGregor suggested. "I wouldn't use it for production," said Rob Enderle, principal analyst at the Enderle Group. It's "too expensive," he told LinuxInsider, "but short of that, it could be very useful." Google's AI Strategy "In 20 years, just about every new piece of electronics you come in contact with will be using some form of AI," Tirias' McGregor predicted. "Google's looking to establish market share as the segment grows, and to find opportunities for new business models around AI, which is wise." There are very few experts in AI today, and platforms like the Voice Kit "will help the next generation of engineers develop the expertise the industry needs," he added. The AIY Voice Kit represents Google's first collaboration on a hobbyist project. There are three reasons Google might find that market attractive, suggested Enderle: The technology will get into the educational field "and will help drive kids to become engineers, which Google desperately needs"; It will get more people comfortable with AI technology, "thus helping create both a market and the people who can service it"; and It will help create more products that will build out the Google Home ecosystem. "Natural language processing is the future of consumer electronics," Frost's Jude said. "By getting the maker community interested in this technology, consumers will be introduced to voice interfaces more quickly." Richard Adhikari has been an ECT News Network reporter since 2008.

Google's "Fuchsia" operating system is taking shape with a new design Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/08 10:01am PDTMay 8, 2017 36 Plus 1 on G+ 285 Share on Facebook 93 Share on Twitter Total Shares414 Development Google News We first talked about Fuchsia, a new operating system being developed at Google, back in August (in fact, it was my first post here). At the time, there wasn't much to get excited about besides the potential - it only had a command-line interface. Now the project has a snazzy new, but clearly unfinished, interface. Summary of Fuchsia First, it's worth going over exactly what Fuchsia is, because it's been quite a while since we talked about it. As opposed to all of Google's other OSes, such as Android and Chrome OS, Fuchsia uses the company's new 'Magenta' kernel instead of Linux. According to the project's documentation, Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Magenta's apps and the system interface are written with Google's Flutter SDK, which was initially designed to create cross-platform apps for iOS and Android. Flutter applications are written in Dart, the company's home-grown programming language. All of the system and apps are rendered by 'Escher,' which uses OpenGL or Vulkan to display everything. The 'Armadillo' interface So, on to the new stuff. Fuchsia's system UI has a new name - 'Armadillo.' Ars Technica was able to compile Armadillo into an Android APK, since it is written with the above-mentioned Flutter SDK. The interface doesn't really do anything besides looking pretty, but it does give us an idea of what the finished product could look like. The home screen is a vertical list, with a profile picture, the time, and a battery indicator in the center. Tapping the profile picture brings up something similar to Android's Quick Settings, with toggles for auto-rotate, do not disturb, Airplane Mode, and so on. Above the profile picture is the 'Story,' which the documentation describes as "a set of apps and/or modules that work together for the user to achieve a goal." Currently, this works similarly to Android's Recents screen. Users will also be able to combine stories into a 'Story Cluster.' This is what dragging a Story card into split-screen looks like. Dragging a Story card onto another one triggers a split-screen mode. The user can split an app 50/50 vertically or horizontally, drag in another app for a 33/33/33 split, or even have a tab bar appear for using all the open apps in full-screen. You can even have two apps split vertically next to two other split apps, seen below. This is far more flexible than Android's current multi-tasking functionality, but whether or not it will stay this way is uncertain. Below the profile picture is a panel resembling Google Now, with a placeholder search bar and suggestion cards. Armadillo's documentation says, "a suggestion is a representation of an action the user can take to augment an existing story or to start a new one. [The] suggestion contains enough information to create the visual representation of that concept." So maybe they will work more like an app launcher? It's hard to tell at this point. The Google Now panel, showing Fuchsia's keyboard. Keep in mind that all of this is subject to change, as the Armadillo interface (and the rest of Fuchsia OS) is still under heavy development. It's also hard to tell what Google's plans are for the operating system. Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware, or will it some day replace Android altogether? We'll have to wait and see.

Suicide_Note Because Google can. Corbin Davenport Ron from Ars Technica put it best: "Fuchsia really seems like a project that asks 'how would we design Android today, if we could start over?' It's a brand-new, Google-developed kernel running a brand-new, Google-developed SDK that uses a brand-new, Google-developed programming language and it's all geared to run Google's Material Design interface as quickly as possible. Google gets to dump Linux and the GPL, it can dump Java and the problems it caused with Oracle, and Google can basically insulate itself from all of Android's upstream projects and bring all the development in-house. Doing such a thing on the scale of Android today would be a massive project." makapav Would it still be open source? Also, what would happen to all the existing APKs? Corbin Davenport Fuchisa is completely open source right now. As for running Android apps, maybe Google will add some kind of stop-gap compatibility layer for running Android apps, like Chrome OS has. destinyhud read the article Suicide_Note Perhaps instead of replacing Android, this will *become* Android, as in Android P or Q? Or be the merger of Android/Chrome? m477 I could see that as Android 10. Definitely too early for P. morteum I wonder if the reason it is called "Armadillo" is because they're starting from A again, but this time they're using animals instead of desserts. Christopher Bement I think it's a smart plan, based on the guess that there's more animals to pick from in the world than tasty desserts. teolinux Ubuntu docet Paul "Tasty treats," not necessarily desserts. That said, armadillos could be a tasty treat. I won't judge. MJ I have heard desserts and candy used before which are wrong but "tasty treats" is a new one for me. To be more accurate, Android names are actually all confectionery foods. A "tasty treat" could be a slice of pizza (aka Android S). LOL Randy Gindy Armadillo is the name of the UI not the OS build itself. Matt74UK Smooth on the inside, crunchy on the outside. Armadillo ! (a few UK people of a certain age may get that). Russell Brown That bloke's a nutter... Edit: nope, that was Dime Bar. :( Nomaan Shouldnt we compare armadillo to holo/material and not to dessert names? Or am i missing something. morteum I don't think so, those are design languages and while this is a redesign of layout and function, it is still pretty much using Material Design. I could be wrong but I don't think this is closer to a build version. John Doe Idk this is a whole new OS with a new kernel, I doubt this will be done with an OTA update for Android. Mantas Pakėnas Even nowadays, some of Android's new functionality cannot be done via OTA updates (like dual system partitions, forced encryption I believe, etc). To make a completely hard cut sometime when this is ready, and if it's meant to replace Android, is not completely unimaginable. As is updating via OTA. If apple was able to change their file system via OTA, I don't see why changing most of the parts would not be possible. However, nobody aside from Google would do it, almost guaranteed :) Suicide_Note It could likely be done for Pixel devices, and possibly for future devices released after this new version of the OS rolls out. Adrian Meredith quite possibly, after all there no reason it couldn't also run android apps jonathan What they need to do is make this googles very own os for their pixel line and leave android for the oems Suicide_Note Not a chance. To much name recognition with Android for Google to drop it in favor of something else specific to the Pixel lineup. Dallas King Android Z confirmed! Suicide_Note More like Android A for Armadillo. m477 APK plz (no, really, I want a compiled apk the demo) Maxwell “Max” Weinbach https://github.com/fuchsia-mirror/sysui MJ Your link wasn't what the OP asked for... Maxwell “Max” Weinbach the only way to get the APK is to compile it yourself, so I linked to the Github page to a place to download the files to compile. The closest they will get. MJ Than you should have replied there is no known APK or not at all. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach It does not matter that much. I am building the APK right now. Once it is done I will post it. Here is the link on how to compile it. http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo MJ Don't waste your time... They updated that article with an download of the APK. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach thanks. they just did that. I still compiled it myself though. I will try to get more out of it while I have the Sysui downloaded. Michel R. https://www.androidfilehost.com/?w=files&flid=178684 there you go MJ http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo Latex beats nudity More of Proprietary code ? No thank you, we already had enough with this Pixel crud. I hope this OS dies quicker or become a chromebook OS. m477 It's open source. Latex beats nudity It's OSS but just like Android It'll be more heavily dependent on the google APIs to make it work. Look at the Pixel SysUI, Just being OSS doesn't make it open source... It's Google's OS not a Linux Based one. If this is going to replace Android It's doomsday on multiple levels. destinyhud billions of people dont care if its running linux kernel or not. maybe very few like u might. do iphone users care why kernel it runs. none of them care. u r just noise tbh Latex beats nudity Billions of people don't code. You are being a kool-aid joke tbh. destinyhud exaclt only few code and even on that few many dont care if it runs linux or not. look at iphone there are more dev there and yet they dont care for kernel. u r delusional in ur own world m477 Android it's already been on a Google-dependent road for years. I don't think this is going to change either way. An Angry Chihuahua https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/magenta/+/master/docs/getting_started.md heres the source code. do some research my dude WitnessG Imagining this running on a Google made processor is exciting. Badouken If this was the OS for the Pixel 2 alongside a Google made processor I think id cry! WitnessG Yeah I don't see this coming out for at least another 2-3 years. Badouken Indeed, but we can dream! ha Suicide_Note Maybe the Pixel 3 or 4 will see the dream become reality. Suicide_Note I'm betting this is what we'll see in a couple years time. As another commenter stated, starting with Armadillo could be Google's way of starting from the beginning (letter A codename), since there's more animal babes to use for each letter than there are dessert names to use. Timothy Vreeland You are getting the furries excited. Evelynmtalley Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Nomaan Armadillo should be compared to holo/material and not to dessert names. nachofrand What makes you think Google would be good at making SoCs? They're a software company and don't have the hardware expertise for hardcore ASIC development like that. Granted they can hire people, but in the end, does it matter? They're going to use ARM either way. UnlikeABoss Google fanboyism. The same reason he's excited over a brand new OS. He knows absolutely nothing about it, short of the fact that it will create more fragmentation not only in the OS space, but also the kernel space. So all we know are negative things so far. This is what we call exciting now is it? Why? Just because Google is doing it? If Microsoft made this exact same announcement, would we all be excited? Oh dear. Zsolt V No, because essentially everybody loathes Microsoft. Almost nobody's life would be worse if Microsoft vanished. marcusmarcus2 Don't they design and build their own servers to use for all their websites? Seems like those hardware work well for them. Sergii Pylypenko It's one thing to assemble the server using off-the-shelf components, or even to order a custom motherboard. It's a very different thing to design and manufacture your own chips. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying it is the same, just that they are not only software experts. Them designing and building the servers show they do have hardware expertise that could assist them in doing the same to chips. Zsolt V Except Google's servers are not assembled from off the shelf components. Haven't been for a few years now. Roy What about TPU? Owais Lone They DO design their own chips as well especially chips meant to run specialized AI (tensoflow) code Adrian Vovk Samsung Exynos devices are faster than Snapdragon, iPhones seem underpowered but are extremely snappy, etc. The point is that making both the software and hardware leads to a very fast ecosystem. Also, Google are making the TPU for neural networks nachofrand Yes, as expected. Exynos is faster than Snapdragon on the Galaxy phones, but put an Exynos in another phone...oh wait, you can't. That's the whole entire point. Snapdragon SoCs are general purpose SoCs and can be used for a multitude of phones so they're not custom tuned to every phone individually. Exynos have very specific power rails and the chip is made specifically for that phone. The thing is, sure this is better, but it's marginal and hardly worth talking about. They both use the same ARM architecture so performance gains are pretty negligible. Besides that, this is how Samsung makes money....off of device sales. Google doesn't make money that way. That isn't their business model so at this point it doesn't make sense for them to build their own SoCs when they could just work closer with hardware companies. They make their own TPUs because it aligns with their business model. Adrian Vovk The instruction set doesn't really matter? I can have a 6700k and a 6500k and the 6700k will perform much better even though they are both amd64. With what Google is doing with the Pixels (still as snappy as day one here) I'm pretty sure they can optimize it further than Samsung does. They have made it run smoother in some cases on a chip that they didn't manufacture. If they made their own chip it would allow them many freedoms that they otherwise don't have = easier design of the device. I brought up the TPUs because that is experience in chip manufacturing Jason What makes you say iPhones are under powered ? Apples chips are some of the fastest around and are extremely powerful. Adrian Vovk Specs wise. They have much worse specs on paper and it would lead to a slower experience, except Apple can optimize it because they make both the chip and the OS SHunter On their Own hardware running their software in their own eco system. You cant really fairly compare it to anything else. Stephen Sharp They could use Risc-V and have to pay to license absolutely nothing, while being able to make processors purpose built for their OS Randy Gindy That would be an interesting move. Stephen Sharp Indeed, I really want Risc-V to succeed as an open ISA nachofrand They could. But in my opinion, it's unlikely. Google isn't trying to compete with Samsung and Apple in device sales and that isn't their business model. People using their services so they can show ads is their business model. It doesn't make sense for Google to make their own SoC when others are already doing a good job. Plus, if they went to RISC-V then what? What about the modem? They have to buy a standalone modem from Qualcomm or Intel. Now you have to hire system integration and test engineers to make sure the modem is working with your SoC. Oh and then you need a whole firmware team to control the modem. At that point, buy a full blown SoC with the modem on chip. Stephen Sharp Eh you lost me at "Pixel phone" and all the other hardware they sell. Google also is a Platinum member of the Risc-V foundation, and if there is a direction they are going, more control or less control, I would guess it's "more". But that's just a guess nachofrand Hardware isn't even close to the same thing as asic development. IC design is a different world. Granted they do some custom hardware, but SoCs are a much much larger feat. It's still a possibility they do so, but it doesn't make sense with their current business model imo. Randy Gindy He said nothing about ASIC he is talking about RISC-V Randy Gindy I disagree with you completely. They are penetrating the IoT market, auto market, healthcare, phones, robotics, self driving, networking, etc. Them making in house chips could really benefit every project they have. Also building an OS from the ground up to work with in house chips would be smart. Look at Apple as an example. They also may let manufacturers to use the designs. If Android One isn't evidence for them to want to standardize their platforms I don't know what is. Captain On! 1 - Google has stated that they're going to make their own silicon for the Pixels in time. 2 - Google actually owns/operates the world's most powerful quantum computer. They know how to make chips. Randy Gindy That quantum computer was built by DWave though Angel I read (somewhere don’t remember) that they have three different quantum computers systems. One from DWave and two home-produced. From those two, one was made by engineers and not that disimilar from DWave in its operations. The other was made by physicists and uses a different approach. nachofrand 1. I could be wrong, but I've only read that they plan on working closer with chip manufacturers. 2. Google didn't make that computer. Even if they did, quantum is so different those skills don't even translate. Romario Maxwell Google made their own custom ASIC called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) for their AI/Machine Learning needs on their cloud platform. See https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/05/Google-supercharges-machine-learning-tasks-with-custom-chip.html and https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/04/quantifying-the-performance-of-the-TPU-our-first-machine-learning-chip.html nachofrand Sure, although a TPU is just an accelerator. Think of it as the hexagon DSP inside of the Snapdragon SoC. That's like 1/10 of the entire chip. SoC design is much larger. Timothy Vreeland How many examples of hardware design do people have to point out before you stop? Sure the hardware they worked on previously isn't exactly the same... But before they started the hardware they are currently working on, they worked on previous hardware that wasn't the same as what they are doing now. They have shown they are competent in designing many kinds of hardware. Or do you suggest a company can only build one kind of hardware and nothing else for all eternity? How did Samsung make it's current in-house chips? Did they go to ARM college? Have they been making ARM chips since the dawn of time? No. They put together some teams and got to work, so stop blabbing and being negative. sweenish Their AI that finally beat the world's top Go players was running on custom Google chips. It's not like they don't know how. theProffer They have enough liquid assets to do whatever they want, abandon it, and then do it again without even noticing they spent the money. (Which is actually the source of a few of their problems, I think.) Matt Is that why they gave up on fiber? Pixelexel Imagine a Google Pixel with a Google made processor, with Fuschia, with Project Fi with Google WiFi powered by Google fiber. If I'd have this, my life would be complete. Owais Lone and all our data with it :( needa At least it is only one company getting it. Iamsecond Ha, no. A Google processor? Supported for 18 months, then replaced with a new processor that performs half as well (but has stickers.) Does not fully process Android code, because at Google one hand doesn't even know the other hand is there, let alone talk to it. Has 20 cores (only 2 enabled outside US for 'reasons.') Has a dedicated co-processor to enable ads in every app, even those that previously didn't have them. the.cyber.trekker I spit my coffee out on my monitor reading this!! ROFLMFAO! Jason Google can't even get a phone out the door without issues and you want them to make the chips too...lol. I'll pass. UnlikeABoss "In house kernel instead of Linux". Yeah, hopefully this dies in a thousand pits of fire. "Hey Linux guys, you know how you've helped us make billions over the years with a free open source kernel? Well, we were just using you to get the "nerd" userbase. Now we own the market thanks to you guys promoting its use of Linux, we will gradually phase you out." .... m477 I hope not. Linux is not really a kernel made with smartphone in minds. I don't care for being a fan of a kernel over another. UnlikeABoss Yeah. I'd much rather use a brand new untested kernel (and all the teething issues that will come with it) in my smartphone than a mature, stable one that's hacked on by hundreds and thousands of people every month. I mean, it's just a smartphone, we don't need it to be a secure environment, right? Let's just make a nice obscure kernel that no one else will use, and just say "but but it's open source!!! love us because we are Google kk". ... ihsan ışık I'm sorry but it just looks like you are a huge Linux fan and are just against change to me. UnlikeABoss Looks can be deceiving. If you're going to fling around the Linux fanboy term, i'll fling around the Google fanboy term, and that will surely be a nice constructive argument that we will both want to continue. m477 So, in 10 years we should still be using an unoptimised kernel like Linux, because anything newer is, well, newer? UnlikeABoss Yeah, because Linux hasn't changed at all in 10 years... m477 Yes, it changed a lot, and it still has many of the same problems, which are intrinsically bound to its structure. It's not a kernel well suited for mobile devices. UnlikeABoss You think the solution is to throw it out the window and start from scratch? I disagree. I'd much rather continue improving the Linux kernel, simply because of all the eyes it will always have on its code. jonathan Play nice ladies lol m477 With this mentality we wouldn't have Linux at all. Why start anything, while we can continue this other thing which purpose was completely different? A mircokenel is more well suited than a monolitic kernel to a mobile devices, both in terms of performance and security. No matter how much you improve Linux, it will never be a microkernel. UnlikeABoss Smartphones don't need a micro kernel in 2017. You could make that argument 7 years ago. Linux can be compiled with the required drivers just like it always could. m477 I made that argument 7 years ago. They always needed something different from Linux. The fact that specific, even proprietary drivers have to be integrated in the kernel (since Android lacks an abstraction layer) is on of the problems of the interaction Android-Linux. destinyhud why havent the nerds made linux on pc's a bigger market share if they were the one who made android a global leader UnlikeABoss No nerd is promoting Linux on the desktop. All social media used to be full of people promoting Android over iOS, these days there's no need to. destinyhud why havent they promoted desktop?? just wondering why they did for android but not for desktop.. linux on desktop was an underdog for decades. android was not popular because of kernal. android became popular because it was opensource and was the only viable competition to ios. people dont care what kernel it runs. UnlikeABoss No nerd worth their salt would promote an environment that would be a downgrade from Windows. Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time, it had a very equal playing field. There's a difference between promoting a good solid FOSS kernel where possible, and promoting an agenda. m477 Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time By this, I get that you never used Android and iOS side by side in 2009-10. UnlikeABoss You clearly value different things. The hackability alone made it an upgrade through its lifetime. m477 The same can be said for GNU/Linux on desktop. UnlikeABoss No it can't, because hackability =/= app availability. i.e. The hackability on Linux desktop doesn't make it win over it's lack of apps, where that isn't an issue on Android. m477 App availability was horrible in the early days, compared to iOS. Even Symbian had more apps. UnlikeABoss That was fine since the early days didn't consist of using your smartphone for very much, due to under powered hardware. Techies didn't go around saying "use iOS because we can all take selfies and stick filters on it". m477 iOS devices didn't have front cameras until mid 2010. The system was better, faster, smoother, the interface was coesive, there were many more apps, and the jailbreak community, to address the techie audience you like to go on about so much, was very, very good. There were tweaks and modifications that even the wildest Android custom ROM didn't have at the time. Android was objectively a downgrade, as much as Linux was on desktop. UnlikeABoss Calling jailbraik an advantage over a FOSS OS is pretty hilarious. iOS wasn't popular because it was better, it was popular because of the amount of people getting their advice from paid employees in store. "Buy iOS so we get a commission". m477 iPhone was more popular for various reasons: marketing, having 2 years of advantage, and, yes, more marketing. But it was also better than Android, as an OS. What benefit did Android bring, with it being opensource, compared to iOS, even to a "techie"? The dev community was laughable in the early days. Why GNU/Linux on desktop was not promoted by "techies" (which is false) and Android was, even if their shortcomings were identical? destinyhud u live in a dream world. even most dev dont care about kernel. what they care about the dev platform. I am a dev and i dont care for the kernel UnlikeABoss If you're talking from the perspective of an app developer then ofcourse you don't care about the kernel, you care about which platform will make you the most money... destinyhud exactly. no one care what kernel it runs.. all dev care is what platform make money. so who is this nerd who care about kernel if most dont care about the kernel.. yeah very very few.. infact rare like u UnlikeABoss Techie == Technology Enthusiast. You can sit here and tell me that you would use the best dev environment all you want but the truth is if the iOS dev environment was awful you'd still suck it up and use it to make your money. I'm not sure how you can class yourself as an enthusiast at that point. destinyhud ever wonder why no one is up voting u and upvoting many of my comments? because what u say is BS. its that simple. I am up for ditching outdated linux if the new kernal is modern and build for modern devices. most dont care for this very few techies.. i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die.. UnlikeABoss "Ever wonder why Google fanboys upvote pro Google content and not anti-Google content?" No, no I don't wonder that. How dare someone critique a pointless change by Google, causing unnecessary fragmentation. Burn them! destinyhud u must be new here.. look at anti google comments here when they make stupid changes but if they make welcome changes people tend to agree UnlikeABoss No, I've been here a long time and made many anti-Google comments as well as pro-Google. No one in the right mind would cheer on kernel fragmentation other than those that think Google can do no wrong. destinyhud open up ur comments history and let me see if u made pro google comments. i have a feeling u r a troll UnlikeABoss Yeah, this discussion is going no where. You are not the authority here and the idea that you want to browse my history to make sure I fall in line is creepy as hell. Bye. destinyhud lol i see u dont want to open ur comments history. obvious troll m477 outdated linux i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die Woah, wait a second here. Linux is not outdated, and its death would be terrible for everyone. It's just that it's not the most apt kernel for a mobile device. destinyhud maybe not outdated but not the right fit for mobile devices. destinyhud android sucked when compared to ios.. it was a downgrade compared to ios. why did dev promote android and not desktop linux? u reasoning dont even make sense. UnlikeABoss No, it wasn't a downgrade. destinyhud yes, it was back in android initial release. iOS was better and much more polished at that time. but things changed now. UnlikeABoss "Polished" is not a factor that is used to judge a better OS. There are Linux environments that are much more polished than Windows 10, but that doesn't make desktop Linux better. destinyhud it was both polished and runs better than android at that time. polished was not the only one. it was also polished. android only got better later.. i have used android at that time and it sucked big time. UnlikeABoss You are using today's standards to judge it. If you do that, they both sucked. It worked perfectly fine for the basic things people were using it for at the time. destinyhud they both sucked at that time but android sucked more than iOS at that time. SVem26 I like to think I am in the nerd userbase and I don't care what kernel is used.. can you help me understand why it matters? UnlikeABoss Do you want a brand new obscure kernel in thing that holds most of your sensitive details? TipTop I don't want something that dates back to 90s, is full of zero-days and horrible code contributed by nobodies. UnlikeABoss The idea that it is full of zero days is hilarious. You do realize that the majority of Linux exploits are local, right? Unlike Windows. Yes there is obviously code from the 90s, but very, very little of it. Not to mention that age is not a factor in deciding bad code. The idea that old code is bad code shows your inexperience. By that standard, should we dismiss Chrome because of all the exploits being found in code that was written when it first started? Are we going to create brand new software every few years to purge "old code"? Do you have any idea whatsoever how much Linux has actually changed? Do you have any idea how much of this change is because it's considered a "universal" kernel everyone can use and is focusing on? Do you really think splitting the community over onto another kernel will increase security for either of those kernels? There's a little something called code maturity. There's a reason Microsoft has way less exploits in its kernel today than 10 years ago. They didn't write a new kernel from scratch. TipTop But it is. You can be in denial all you want. Linux is the OS that is used by botnets for DDoSing websites not Windows. UnlikeABoss No sorry, come back to reality. Botnets consist of all types of OS, including Linux ofc. It is not the majority of bots in a botnet, that statement alone shows how clueless you are. Also, do you understand what Linux is? It's a kernel. The majority of Linux hosts in a botnet have been hacked through exploits in outdated software, not the kernel. The same cannot be said for Windows. Again, read the statistics for the severity of Linux exploits versus Windows. More exploits are found in Linux overall because it is open source, however, that doesn't make it worse. More critical and high severity exploits are found in Windows. That speaks a lot for the secure design of Linux. Hopefully you'll do some reading and learn. Sir_Brizz All OSes are full of vulnerabilities and horrible code written by nobodies. If that is your requirement then you must have gone full luddite by now. TipTop Windows is written by paid professionals and has QA/QC. Linux is written by fat nerds for free and has no quality control but nice try. Don't gve me the top contributors crap. Sir_Brizz Yes, tell me again how many zero day vulnerabilities are found in Windows and how long they take to get fixed. Even worse, tell me that with macOS. Being paid doesn't guarantee quality, just as being unpaid doesn't guarantee garbage. Windows and macOS have some of the crappiest insecure code. And there is nothing special about having QA or being paid to write code. Some of the worst programmers I have ever met worked at places like Microsoft and Apple. https://mobile.twitter.com/taviso/status/860681252034142208 Please continue trying to tell me how infallible paid programmers are! UnlikeABoss They are totally da bestest eva! UnlikeABoss Obviously paid products will always be better than unpaid products... right!?!? /s Oh wait we have tons of real life examples of free products being better than paid, shocking how that works. It's almost as if the best products are made by the most passionate people, and like, being paid doesn't guarantee being passionate about your creation. What a crazy crazy world! ihsan ışık Are you implying that Android got popular because of "nerds" who heard it uses the Linux kernel? UnlikeABoss If you are old enough to know the early days of android you'll know that having every single nerd on the internet promoting Android over iOS most certainly helped get the ball rolling. Once it was pushed, it snowballed into what it is today. m477 Sure. It was the nerds on the internet, not the manufacturers with ads everywhere. Most people still don't know their Galaxy runs Android. UnlikeABoss The giant billboards came YEARS afterwards, cmon. m477 Yes, and that's why Android was so unpopular in the early days. UnlikeABoss What? It was massively popular among all techies for being the open source iOS alternative. m477 You are overestimating the "techies" crowd. Even BlackBerryOS was more popular at the time. Only after the Galaxy S it started to grow, and became popular among normal people. UnlikeABoss Not really. We are talking over a decade ago now, there were far less people on the internet and it was far easier for techies to promote products because everyone was asking their "techie" friend what is best. But these days everyone is an "expert" so that's not as much of a thing. m477 Again, you overestimate how many techies there actually were. Your personal experience is anecdotal. Market shares and sell data are objective. Also, over a decade ago Android was still a camera os, and it wasn't public. UnlikeABoss No, I do not. The further back in time you go, the higher the proportion of techies there were using the internet versus others. People were only just starting to look at buying a smartphone, and asking techies what they should buy. m477 Yes, the concentration on the internet of "techies" on the internet was greater. And? What normal user at the time went to the internet, looked at reviews and said "Oh, look! The HTC magic has Linux! This random guy says its good, so I'm gonna buy it!"? You really think that a bunch of "techies">marketing? A guy saying that his toy-looking HTC G1 is better than the iPhone is more effective than billboards and tv ads? Come on, even Windows Mobile was more popular. It took Samsung's aggressive marketing to make Android popular. UnlikeABoss Windows Mobile and BlackBerry were more popular in the enterprise, that's it. The entire discussion is home users. Also I think there's been some confusion. I wasn't implying that techies on the internet were promoting Android on the internet like a marketing department. I was implying that the internet was very much a "social media" platform for techies to communicate where the majority of them would use Android and mocked the use of iOS. The actual "marketing" happened offline when a normal user would ask their "techie" friend for first time buying advice. It is nothing like that today, and the internet is nothing like the techie community it once was. m477 So, what you're saying is that the internet was a circlejerk of Android users. Ok, and? It didn't affected normal users the slightest, iOS was still more popular until Samsung took Android more seriously. The techie friend thing its only your anecdotal experience, it bears no influence on the market, in the grand scheme of things. I'd even argue that Google's very light marketing did much, much more. Also, the mindless techies that recommended half backed devices instead of better alternatives because "Uh, Linux!!" did more harm than good, both to the users and to Android. UnlikeABoss If you read my OP you'll see my original point was that Google has rode the "Android circlejerk" to popularity, and you can debate how much popularity that added as much as you want. The fact remains, it got the ball rolling. Samsung didn't pick it up "just because", it saw that a lot of people were pushing it. There were several OS at the time it could have used, including sticking to its own. Why bother with Android? Maybe because it wanted to see how much market it could take by appealing to techies? However, if you stand back and look at it, how is this any different from "embrace, extend, extinguish"? Google used that "free marketing" and has now decided to use it's massive popularity to push a different product. (Which has failed in the past and will hopefully fail again). Why hate Microsoft for doing that in the past, but we praise Google for doing it? Why are we excited for something we know nothing about that is creating fragmentation? m477 Samsung had used several OSes, it had Windows Mobile and Phone devices, Symbian devices, and proprietary devices, even Palm OS devices IIRC. They used them all. Android had was the easiest to personalise for them, and create a copy of the best selling product, which was the iPhone, and there was an app market, so they tried to release and market their flagship with it, and market it as broadly as Apple. The first Galaxy (the "non S") was was vastly ignored, because it was as little marketed as all their other devices. The techies crowd was insignificant. The free marketing is just as much as Windows 10 gets for incorporating Ubuntu's bash terminal. What you saw is not really important. I saw lots and lots of Windows Phones in 2010 and 11. Many more than Android devices. Every one I knew had one, and if I had to say which OS was the most popular only based on my personal experience, in my smallish city, I'd obviously would say Windows Phone. Why are you so attached to Linux, excluding all possibilities of giving a possibly better solution a try? The community will just fork the AOSP and continue the development of the Linux branch. UnlikeABoss Cmon, we both know Android was not easier for them to customize than simply using their own OS. No one was recommending it, techie or not, no matter how much they marketed. It's only now they are popular they are trying to slip in their own OS, and still failing. I am not attached to Linux despite people using it as an easy scapegoat to dismiss a discussion critiquing almighty Google. We currently have a situation where most kernel developers focus entirely on Linux, making it virtually the universal kernel. Why are we creating pointless fragmentation there? Why divide that community? Do we honestly believe that a divided community can produce a better kernel, or do we love it because Google is doing it? Would we love it if Microsoft did this? m477 The proprietary OS they used at the time was a Java based thing with a flash interface. Hardly able to compete against iOS. It was easier for them to use the "next Symbian" that they could customise as they wanted, and that also had an app market. If they made, say, Bada, before Android become established and popular, and marketed it as much as they did with their Galaxy S, the market would be very different today. The normal user doesn't care what OS their shiny phone runs, as long as there's facebook. I am a GNU/Linux user since the first half of the 2000s, and I've always critiqued Google for using Linux as a kernel on phones. Linux might be the universal kernel, but smartphones need a more streamlined solution. I don't care if it's Google, the MIT, or Richard Stallman in person to do it. I liked WP8 architecture. Fragmentation is not pointless if it brings benefits to the user. TipTop Nobody cares about your FSF agenda. John Q I think the chief reason Google is not using Linux is that they want a real-time OS (RTOS). Linux is at best a "soft" RTOS, possessing a real-time scheduler but this is still not nearly as real-time as an actual RTOS should be. It would take a very large effort to do that for Linux so it makes sense that Google would want to make their own kernel that they can have full control over. UnlikeABoss Let's ignore the fact that Linux is used in real time car systems for a moment. Could you elaborate on why you think Google would want/need a RTOS on their smartphones? M6 The kernel they're using, 'magenta', is opened source. So who cares if they're using linux or not? Does everyone have to use linux? UnlikeABoss No it doesn't have to be Linux. But who else will use Magenta? Probably no one. So why are we fragmenting the kernel space further? Why would you choose an immature kernel for something as valuable (your data) as your smartphone. Would you trust that? I would much rather developers continue focusing on a single kernel. WesleySmalls But wouldn't Magenta be this single kernel? UnlikeABoss If everyone decided to ditch Linux and focus purely on Magenta as the universal kernel, yes. Will that happen? WesleySmalls Could be, just not overnight. The market was already fairly well developed when Linux arrived in 1991, yet it still managed to become a very, if not the most, important player in the market. It's certainly possible, it will just require proper investment(and neglect of their alternate platforms) and patience to make it work M6 That's some straight up communist shit right there. Let's just work on one thing, because we only need one thing, everything else is redundant! Let's not allow other people to do the same thing in a different way, because competition totally doesn't spur innovation at all. WORPspeed So Andromeda definitely dead or still happening? sleepinlight Pretty sure this IS Andromeda, or at least a part of it. Andromeda was never an official name for anything, it was just the internal project name for some sort of new and/or merged OS. WORPspeed I thought Andromeda specifically referred to merging Android and Chrome OS. So is that specific merger dead or on life-support? John Q Nah, the Android/Chrome merger was just speculation from what Andromeda seemed to be. There was never any concrete evidence to imply that Andromeda was a merger. WORPspeed To quote Androidpolice : "So please, when you see Fuchsia mentioned, or speculation that it "is" Andromeda, know that it is just that: speculation. Last we heard from sources we consider extremely reliable, Android was the basis of Andromeda, and Andromeda would see its commercial debut on a new Pixel laptop later this year. It is possible Google has changed plans around Andromeda, that the initiative itself may have even been scrapped. Though, we have no reason to think so - it's more that we don't know, and haven't heard anything about Andromeda in quite some time." http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ WORPspeed http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ That makes them seem very separate Srujan https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e7fda716dfcfdca76e200e51a9c9144c72e183c7e76d36b910c20ee0931aee79.gif destinyhud if this replaces android rather than having 2 separate codebase, I am all up for it. splitting the android community is dangerous senor_heisenberg Well if this does end up being what replaces Android or what Android evolves into, I just hope my apps and whatnot are compatible. Ain't got the time or money to be investing into another ecosystem. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman That's a tricky, double-edged sword. I can't fathom they would not support the old apps, or at least the vast majority of them, for exactly that reason. But in doing so it will likely be held back at least slightly from what it can/should be. Backward-compatibility tends to hold everything back. What I'd wager is we won't see this until hardware's powerful enough to make emulating the old system in a VM relatively cheap and easy, with back-end Play Store penalties to developers who don't shift to the new app models, and then slow phase-outs in stages of the older functionality and support until the new OS is running exclusively its own setup. senor_heisenberg That sounds good. Randy Gindy I think Google porting the Android Run-time to Chrome OS was to see if they could do it. morteum This is old news, I'm waiting for Fuchsia 2.0 Barracuda. /s marcusmarcus2 What if they aren't going by Animal names in general but by mammal names.

Suicide_Note There is no update problem. Nexus/Pixels run the latest and greatest. OEMs who mess with the OS give their customers severely delayed updates. pfmiller Nexus and Pixels run the latest and greatest for two years. Nobody would accept this OS update situation if it was on a desktop OS. MJ Thank God it's phones we are talking about and not a desktop PC. marcusmarcus2 That is exactly why Windows XP lasted only a couple years before all computers updated to Windows 7... Seriously though. I'm fine with only getting Android version upgrades phones for 2 years. But they really need to extend out security updates beyond 3 years. Suicide_Note This isn't a desktop OS, not to mention people tend to change phones much more often than their desktops. pfmiller Sure it's not a desktop OS, but no sense pretending that what we have leaves nothing to be desired. And sure people change their phones more often that their desktops, but there's absolutely no reason to change every 2 years. Suicide_Note I change phones at least once a year, and sometimes two or three times. I couldn't imagine going two years or more on the same phone. pfmiller You can do what you look like, but there's absolutely no reason why that would be necessary. Suicide_Note It's only necessary if you want the latest and greatest, which i like to have, because phone tech is still evolving and improving at a good clip. For example, had i skipped the Pixel, I'd still be using my 6P or N6, both of which have cameras that are vastly inferior to that in the Pixel. I've taken some incredible shots with the Pixel, some of which would be literally impossible to duplicate using the camera in the 6P/N6. That alone is reason enough for me to upgrade on a yearly basis. Doby Gillis Which is a problem, Einstein. Suicide_Note Not if you're a Nexus/Pixel owner, Dilbert. Randy Gindy I would generally say there is. Android phones are not supported for nearly as long as an iPhone. The reason being that the chip set manufacturers do not release new drivers. Shelly-Man Vol 2 It's looks pretty neat for a development stage. Rami Well Android has to reach Z someday. In the case, Hello Fuchsia! marcusmarcus2 Those split-screens will be really useful for running of of Google's different messaging apps. Hopefully OS's aren't the new messaging apps of Google.

Neither, this is just a side project many developers use to test and work out the feasability of a variety of things. Android is a very well developed environment, and replacing it whole is simply a no-go. Things will just gradually evolve, as they have already done with Dalvik being replaced by ART, for example. Sir_Brizz I don't think you're wrong, but it would be in Google's best interest to start building a non-JVM runtime that apps can run inside with a native language that Google has 100% full control over like Go or Dart.

Darth Vader 3rd* JG Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Modern personal computers huh? I've been interested in Google packing ChromeOS into a LiveCD type set up we could test/install on our own computers... (*Yes, I know of Chromium, haven't tried it yet... But I would prefer it coming direct from Google, faster updates and all that). It could be interesting to try out another of Google's OSs without having to fork over several hundred for new hardware... The only problem would be drivers to support the various hardware. If not modified too much, ChromeOS could possibly use the original Gentoo Linux drivers. But with Fuchsia using its own unique kernel... That might throw things off a bit... I know a few less tech-savey individuals who would probably be more comfortable if the same OS powered their phone, tablet and desktop (should Google opt to replace Android with Fuchsia).

[New York Times] SAN FRANCISCO — With an Amazon Echo speaker today, you can talk to Alexa, the virtual assistant that powers the device, and ask it to play songs, order diapers and even turn on your air-conditioner. Related News/Archive Starbucks launches voice ordering via app, Amazon's Alexa 3 Months Ago You don't always save with Amazon's Subscribe & Save program 8 Months Ago If you're a senior citizen or disabled, and in debt, you need this phone number 7 Months Ago Now Amazon wants you to do more than talk to Alexa. It also wants you to call friends and family through Echo speakers — and it is even putting a screen on one of the devices so you can see them while talking to them. On Tuesday, Amazon introduced the latest model in its expanding family of Echo products, the Echo Show, which has a 7-inch touch screen and a video camera that let people place video or voice calls to each other over a Wi-Fi connection. In a move that could have broader impact, Amazon also said it would release a free software update this week that brings voice-calling features to existing Echo devices. The changes, which thrust Amazon into the crowded landscape of internet communications tools like Microsoft's Skype, Apple's FaceTime and Google's Hangouts, underline the company's ambitions for the Echo. In a way, the new communications functions turn the speaker into something like a traditional landline telephone, which many people have given up in favor of smartphones. Rather than pulling a phone out of their pockets, people will be able to simply command their Echoes to call someone. The goal is to make the Echo, and Alexa, even more of a fixture inside people's homes — a system that can help you shop online, control your home's temperature and now, converse. And it allows Amazon to once again chart a path ahead of others with how it is using the speaker. "Amazon now has a huge first-mover advantage," said Werner Goertz, an analyst at Gartner, the technology research firm. Amazon said it plans to release the Echo Show in late June, with a starting price of about $230 for a single device, or two for $360. The Echo was an oddity when Amazon released it in late 2014, a time when smartphones and touch-screen devices seemed to be elbowing other devices out of the way. But since then, the products have remained top sellers on Amazon's site, though the company would not say how many it has sold. Rivals have scrambled to come up with their own smart home devices that have voice controls at their core. Google released its Home device last year. On Monday, Harman International, the audio gear maker owned by Samsung, announced the release of its own smart speaker, Invoke, powered by Microsoft's Cortana intelligent assistant. Still, many have struggled to catch up to Amazon. The company is projected to have 70 percent of the voice-enabled speaker market in the United States this year, according to an eMarketer study published Monday. Google Home is estimated to have about 24 percent of the market, with the rest split between smaller players. According to eMarketer, more than 35 million Americans will use a voice-activated assistant device at least once a month this year, more than double the number from last year. All of this is a turnabout for Amazon from a few years ago. At the time, the company was floundering in the market for devices, battered by the failure of a smartphone that never made a dent against Apple's iPhone and Samsung's family of devices. Amazon's breakthrough came when it figured out a way to package technologies like voice recognition and artificial intelligence in a device for the home that could be commanded without having to look at a screen. Dave Limp, Amazon's senior vice president for devices, said its Echo products were part of a category of "ambient computing" — devices that can be controlled in a communal setting, like inside a home or a car, primarily with voice. "You shouldn't be compelled to go and interact with the screen — you should be able to do it with your voice," Limp said in a product briefing. "It's very different from traditional computing as we've known it for the last three decades." Yet there are obvious limitations to devices that rely entirely on voice interfaces, which the Echo Show is intended to address. The screen on the device adds the ability to stream videos, show lyrics while playing music, and display calendar events and voice-dictated text messages to other Echo users. Displaying movie showtimes and other lists on a screen, as the Echo Show can, is more convenient for users than Alexa reading them. "I think Echo Show fits very well in the kitchen," said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Creative Strategies. The catch is that for now, the only people an Echo user can call are other Echo owners, or anyone with an Alexa app on an iPhone or Android device. Limp said there was no technical limitation that would prevent Amazon from connecting a phone number to an Echo device that would allow them to be reached by people with telephones. But he declined to say whether Amazon intended to offer that capability. Because the Echo can be used only as a speakerphone, it also is not likely to be used for private calls when others are present in a room. Milanesi said she was skeptical about whether Echo could supplant smartphones for voice calling. "We're so used to using our phones," she said. "Finding a reason to use Alexa for that is harder. They need to give you something more specific and interesting and different than other platforms we're engaged with."

provided by Research and Markets 09 May, 2017, 16:45 ET Share this article DUBLIN, May 9, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Research and Markets has announced the addition of the "AR & VR Smartglasses and Functional Contact Lenses 2017-2027" report to their offering. This new report is focused on how the market for AR and VR headsets is going to evolve in the next decade, based on the exciting research and developments efforts of recent years along with the high visibility some projects and collaborations have enjoyed. The amount of visibility this space is experiencing is exciting developers of a range of allied technologies into fast-tracking/focusing their efforts, as well as creating devices and components designed specifically to serve this emerging industry: microdisplays, optical engines and haptic feedback components are some of the main components that are seeing significant growth alongside the growth in interest in augmented and virtual reality. Some of the newest headsets that have ignited interest in smart eyewear are going above and beyond the conventional definition of a smart object; they are in effect, portable, wearable computers with a host of functionalities, specially designed apps etc. that add new ways for the wearer to interact with the world along with smartphone capabilities, health tracking options and many other features. The features of some of the more advanced devices have been based on and have sparked worldwide innovation efforts aiming to create an ecosystem of components that will enable what is bound to be a revolution in form factor for wearables. Wearable sensors, innovative user interfaces, but also near-eye displays and optics as well as energy storage devices that represent some of the examples of technology tool kits that are evolving and improving in performance. They are hence constituting the pieces that are falling into place in order to enable new functionalities and form factors, both necessary to create products as innovative as near-eye and on-eye computers. The report includes insight into how different entities are addressing these challenges: developments such as foveated rendering and focus tunable displays, efforts in increasing FOV while keeping display resolution high in order to improve the immersiveness of the VR experience or the seamless integration of an AR layer of information. In addition, company and research activities in the space for smart glasses as well as company profiles of players actively involved in this space, concluding with market forecasts for both AR and VR headsets for the next decade.

Today, the banks are hitting back at the government over the $6bn tax hike unveiled in the budget. Banks are suggesting they will pass on costs, just like every other business does. Scott Morrison pleaded with them not to pass on costs to ordinary customers, given people don’t like them much already. Meantime, Derryn Hinch has referred to share value wiped off the banks three hours before the measure was announced. He alleges it looks like insider trading and has referred the matter to the federal police. Despite a number of commentators calling the Coalition’s budget Labor-lite, Bill Shorten said meh. Labor would never cut corporate tax or give higher income earners a tax cut by dumping the temporary deficit levy. The zombie savings measures from the 2014 Budget of Doom were finally dumped in the house. Labor applauded. The treasurer declined to say whether he would have preferred to bank those savings or bank the extra revenue from the increased Medicare levy. He said it was a moot point. The Greens and Jacqui Lambie called for drug testing of politicians, in line with a trial for drug testing 5000 new welfare recipients. Barnaby Joyce said it would go down well in his constituency and you can’t turn up to work smashed or drugged out. That’s it for tonight. Tomorrow, we have Bill Shorten’s budget in reply speech at 7.30pm so I hope you will join me for that. I will be here from the usual time, for politics in full stereo. Thanks to my brains trust Katharine Murphy, Paul Karp and Gareth Hutchens. Mike Bowers has gone above and beyond to bring you the visuals. Good night.

Those with us yesterday will remember Bowers reported that Abbott gave the treasurer a very slow clap. 2GB’s interviewer Ben Fordham says his lack of applause was noticed. I gave the treasurer the applause I thought he deserved. Abbott says there were things to applaud in the budget, including: $20,000 instant asset write off for small business inland rail increase in defence spending. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.36am EDT 02:36 Self-explanatory statement from senator Derryn Hinch. Senator Hinch has today written to the Australian federal police, seeking an investigation into the leaking of confidential budget measures. Measures in the 2017 budget included a levy on the major banks. It appears this budget measure was leaked, leading to a massive drop in the value of share prices for the major banks. Shares in the major banks began to plummet three hours before the budget lock-up. This drop saw a reduction of $14bn in the value of shares in the major banks. “This appears to be a classic case of criminal insider trading, possibly involving a federal government employee, or even a politician. I would like to know who the short-sellers are and did they have links at Parliament House?” Hinch said.

The Labor-led government, elected in August, has been particularly unhappy about the new proposed GST redistribution, which the NT says would strip $2bn from the NT’s budget over the next four years, and which were confirmed on Tuesday. Morrison has previously said he didn’t know where the NT government got its figure from, but did admit the NT faced large cuts. On Wednesday Gunner claimed the budget confirmed “the biggest GST cuts in the history of the Northern Territory”. The NT government was hoping for some help in the federal budget, including further federal investment in agricultural and resource sector infrastructure, and initiatives geared towards closing the gap in Indigenous health. The NT has the country’s highest proportion of Indigenous residents, with many living in remote communities in poor living conditions and low levels of service delivery. Tonight was a test of whether or not Canberra is serious about developing the north and Closing the Gap – it failed that test. The federal government has turned its back on us – which makes our record investment in jobs, infrastructure and housing even more important to the economic future of the Territory. The Territory has the most disadvantaged people in Australia and tonight’s budget did little to improve their lives. This morning the Coalition senator Nigel Scullion dubbed Gunner’s complaints as “crocodile tears” and said the Territory was well supported. He highlighted a number of previously announced federal investments in the NT contained in the budget, including road upgrades for remote communities and the cattle industry. It is not up to the commonwealth to meet the costs of Territory Labor’s unfunded election promises.

The reference is to the end of the temporary deficit levy imposed under the Abbott government. Turnbull: We have ensured right across the system that burdens are born equitably. We have imposed a levy on the major banks. We have ensured that we are giving support to people seeking support disabilities, parents of a disabled child will know it is fully funded. We are asking all Australians from 2019 to share in that burden just as members opposite did.

Convergence, Patient Engagement Verily’s mental health leader Thomas Insel departs By Stephanie Baum Post a comment / May 9, 2017 at 4:27 PM Shares2 Thomas Insel joined what is now known as Verily less than two years ago from the National Institute of Mental Health to head up an initiative to develop new technology to combat anxiety and depression. The hire was regarded as a coup for the life science arm of Alphabet, Google’s parent company. But now he is leaving, which Verily confirmed in a blog post. In an interview with MedCity News in 2015 in the run up to working for Verily, Insel called for a paradigm shift in mental health. “If we want to see an impact on morbidity and mortality for mental health, we have to do it in a different way. And that could be through digital technology.” The company credited Insel with building a team of mental health clinical researchers, data scientists, product designers, and software engineers. Verily told CNBC that although its work in the mental health arena will continue, it’s too soon to say whether his role will be replaced. In the interview, Insel’s enthusiasm for the potential of digital health technology for behavioral health was tempered with privacy concerns. When you think about Google and data, people begin to wonder – is my search information going to be used as a mental health biomarker? Or to make a diagnosis? I don’t think that’s ever likely going to happen. What’s more likely is that providers, or a third party entity, will use the metadata of people in treatment. But it’ll always be through some sort of informed consent which you could pull back at any moment. Privacy is a huge issue here, in mental healthcare. Remember, right now – everything you do now is being collected by someone online. But they’re using it to sell you shoes and clothes. It’s being used for marketing, but not to manage your own health. I think this is a really important conversation people will have: Are we going to get to a point where we would use your online information to let others know when you’re suicidal? Or homicidal? Or severely depressed and need emergency care? It’s a tough area, and I don’t know where we’ll end up there. Just last month, Verily launched Project Baseline, an ambitious four-year study seeking to recruit 10,000 participants with the goal of developing a 21st century approach to personalized healthcare. As part of the project, participants were expected to take a battery of tests such as a chest X-ray, electrocardiogram, and psychological assessment. They would also have their sleep, heart rate, sweat, and steps measured over the course of the study. Health records, telephone, and social media activity may also be measured.

Health IT, Hospitals, Events Mayo Clinic CIO on AI and when the machines will take over By Erin Dietsche Post a comment / May 9, 2017 at 4:39 PM Shares2 Machine learning is coming to healthcare. From assisting with research to helping patients at the bedside, it is undoubtedly making its mark in the space. Via email, Mayo Clinic CIO Christopher Ross corresponded with MedCity News to answer questions about the future of machine learning and when artificial intelligence will move past the toddler phase. Ross will deliver a keynote address, titled “Machine Learning, from Discovery to Action,” at MedCity INVEST on May 18 in Chicago. Advertisement What is Mayo Clinic doing in the healthcare AI space that’s unique and different from competitors? I’m not sure if we’re doing much that’s unique and different. We have a number of projects underway, most of them early stage and exploratory, with a number of different partners. We have been working hard on Clinical Trials Matching with IBM Watson, and we’re encouraged by the results so far. When is the last time you were blown away by what you saw machine learning could do? I think we’ve all been impressed with examples outside healthcare, like autonomous vehicles and robotics. Watson winning Jeopardy was remarkable, and Google DeepMind mastering Go is similarly impressive. Consumer products like Amazon Echo and Google Home and Apple Siri have the potential to be effective in healthcare. When I get into my car, my phone increasingly offers route guidance that is highly accurate, even though I don’t drive to the same places at the same times. If the hyper-scale cloud companies can learn to predict and guide commutes for a couple billion people, one hopes that could be applied to various health management and maintenance tasks. Specifically to healthcare, there’s been a number of recent published studies in which machine learning and various methods of discrimination have been applied to interpretation of radiology images and other complex domains. It’s pretty clear that machines will or have outpaced the ability of the human eye and brain to evaluate complex multi-dimensional types of data. Mayo has been working on natural language processing for many years, and the ability to extract real clinical meaning from sometimes imprecise text is getting better and better. Earlier this year, you endorsed AI but also said it’s “like a two-year-old.” How long do you think it will be until AI moves out of the toddler phase? Most AI today learns through a process called “supervised learning” in which an algorithm is exposed to many, many examples of a thing, and the algorithm adapts. If you show an image analysis algorithm a lot of pictures of cats, pretty soon it can distinguish a cat from a dog, and then a lion, and maybe Fluffy from Snowball. Facebook usually gets the tagging of images right, and Google’s photo tagging and sorting means I can actually find pictures I want. And this can be applied to hard things like radiological images for diagnosis. But that “supervised learning” sure reminds me of what it was like to chase a curious two-year-old around the house. I can’t predict when AI adolescence will arrive. Right now supervised learning allows algorithms to build semantic models. So we can discriminate cats from lions, and we can relate the image of a cat to words: “cat” and “feline” and “felis catus.” One important next stage will occur when ontological models become involved. When most AI instances start, they have no ontological model of what a “doctor,” “patient” or “hospital” are, and how they relate to each other.  Most AI uses mountains of data and millions of repetitions, after which an algorithm can create a kind of web of connections between ideas based on probabilities. What’s missing are ontological models, the kind of “mental models” we human beings carry around all the time in our heads. Once we understand the concept of a doctor and a patient, we can predict and generalize many of the things that a doctor and patient can do. Today, AI largely lacks that ability to abstract. How can healthcare organizations work to ensure their focus is on the outcomes and not the technology? Perhaps by staying focused on the goal. Mayo Clinic is focused on the needs of the patient, and the treatment of serious and complex conditions. If we aren’t advancing that, we are not doing the right things. When — if ever — will the machines take over? Well, when I’m in a plane, I’m grateful for our new overlords. Because each engine is streaming megabytes of data per minute to support predictive maintenance means engines don’t fail, and planes are less likely to be delayed for maintenance at the gate. Machines have outpaced people at various discrete tasks for many generations. Manufacturing, retail, distribution and similar industries have already been changed forever by automation and AI. A decade ago the idea of an autonomous vehicle was science fiction. These technologies are in use in many industries, and healthcare shouldn’t ignore it. But I think healthcare is particularly complex, and depends more on human connection than almost any other human activity. So I’m optimistic we’ll see “augmented intelligence” where the computer and person pair to do better. What is your vision for the future of machine learning in healthcare? For now we see through a glass, darkly. Predictions or visions are unlikely to be very reliable at this stage. I think we all hope it will be one of several tools and investments which help improve health and treat disease.

Chen and Nick Wingfield Updated 2:13 pm, Tuesday, May 9, 2017 According to CNet, voice calling and messaging is coming soon to the Amazon Echo. Echo-to-Echo calling will be hands-free and straightforward. On Tuesday Amazon also announced the Echo Show, a new speaker with a screen that will allow for video chats. However the voice calling feature should work for anyone with an existing Echo device. The feature essentially includes two abilities: You can either call or receive calls from other Alexa users; and you can send and receive voice messages. Media: WochIt Media With an Amazon Echo speaker today, you can talk to Alexa, the virtual assistant that powers the device, and ask it to play songs, order diapers and even turn on your air conditioner. Now Amazon wants you to do more than talk to Alexa. It also wants you to call friends and family through Echo speakers — and it is even putting a screen on one of the devices so you can see them while talking to them. On Tuesday, Amazon introduced the latest model in its expanding family of Echo products, the Echo Show, which has a 7-inch touch-screen and a video camera that let people place video or voice calls to each other over a Wi-Fi connection. In a move that could have broader impact, Amazon also said it would release a free software update this week that brings voice-calling features to existing Echo devices.

In a way, the new communications functions turn the speaker into something like a traditional landline telephone, which many people have given up in favor of smartphones. Rather than pulling a phone out of their pockets, people will be able to simply command their Echoes to call someone. The goal is to make the Echo, and Alexa, even more of a fixture inside people’s homes — a system that can help you shop online, control your home’s temperature and now, converse. And it allows Amazon to once again chart a path ahead of others with how it is using the speaker. “Amazon now has a huge first-mover advantage,” said Werner Goertz, an analyst at Gartner, the technology research firm. Latest business videos Amazon said it plans to release the Echo Show in late June, with a starting price of about $230 for a single device, or two for $360. The Echo was an oddity when Amazon released it in late 2014, a time when smartphones and touch-screen devices seemed to be elbowing other devices out of the way. But since then, the products have remained top sellers on Amazon’s site, though the company would not say how many it has sold. Rivals have scrambled to come up with their own smart home devices that have voice controls at their core. Google released its Home device last year. On Monday, Harman International, the audio gear maker owned by Samsung, announced the release of its smart speaker, Invoke, powered by Microsoft’s Cortana intelligent assistant. Still, many have struggled to catch up to Amazon. The company is projected to have 70 percent of the voice-enabled speaker market in the United States this year, according to an eMarketer study published Monday. Google Home is estimated to have about 24 percent of the market, with the rest split between smaller companies. According to eMarketer, more than 35 million Americans will use a voice-activated assistant device at least once a month this year, more than double the number from last year. All of this is a turnabout for Amazon from a few years ago. At the time, the company was floundering in the market for devices, battered by the failure of a smartphone that never made a dent against Apple’s iPhone and Samsung’s family of devices. Amazon’s breakthrough came when it figured out a way to package technologies like voice recognition and artificial intelligence in a device for the home that could be commanded without having to look at a screen. Dave Limp, Amazon’s senior vice president for devices, said its Echo products were part of a category of “ambient computing” — devices that can be controlled in a communal setting, like inside a home or a car, primarily with voice. “You shouldn’t be compelled to go and interact with the screen — you should be able to do it with your voice,” Limp said in a product briefing. “It’s very different from traditional computing as we’ve known it for the last three decades.” Yet there are obvious limitations to devices that rely entirely on voice interfaces, which the Echo Show is intended to address. The screen on the device adds the ability to stream videos, show lyrics while playing music, and display calendar events and voice-dictated text messages to other Echo users. Displaying movie showtimes and other lists on a screen, as the Echo Show can, is more convenient for users than Alexa reading them. “I think Echo Show fits very well in the kitchen,” said Carolina Milanesi, an analyst at Creative Strategies. The catch is that for now, the only people an Echo user can call are other Echo owners, or anyone with an Alexa app on an iPhone or Android device. Limp said there is no technical limitation that would prevent Amazon from connecting a phone number to an Echo device that would allow them to be reached by people with telephones. But he declined to say whether Amazon intended to offer that capability. Because the Echo can be used only as a speakerphone, it also is not likely to be used for private calls when others are present in a room. Milanesi said she is skeptical about whether Echo could supplant smartphones for voice calling. “We’re so used to using our phones,” she said. “Finding a reason to use Alexa for that is harder. They need to give you something more specific and interesting and different than other platforms we’re engaged with.” Brian X. Chen and Nick Wingfield are New York Times writers.

Facebook, the social media giant, now boasts 1.86 billion weekly users, with over 150 million in Africa. More than 65% of these customers use the medium every single day, mostly from their mobile devices. Google’s video platform YouTube holds the attention of over a billion users worldwide, who watch hundreds of millions of hours of content every day. When you create communities this large, you are also bound to attract the darker elements of society. Therein lies the root of reputational damage to Facebook and Google. Increasingly they contain posts that range from highly influential ‘fake news’ to downright incitement to mass murder courtesy of politico-religious extremists. And on continents where people have more time on their hands than we do in Africa, the old saying has come true. The devil has made work for idle hands, in the proliferation of the most appalling child pornography, sado-masochistic torture and (Lord help us) even cannibalistic communities. Young people, disconnected from reality by their excessive time on screens, are even being incited to kill themselves. Police in Europe are trying to combat a ‘challenge’ called Blue Whale which encourages suicide and sets members’ daily tasks towards this goal that must be completed within 50 days. The inventor of the game was arrested in Russia last year and said this about his victims: “…they died happy. I gave them what they do not have in real life: comprehension, communication and warmth.” Facebook and Google are both under increasing pressure to do something about dangerous content. But even though their reputations are being tarnished, they seem strangely reluctant to act like brand leaders. Initial criticism came from advertisers, dismayed to find their advertising appearing alongside extremist content. Commercial pressure alerted governments – whose primary role is protection of the people they represent. In the UK, a parliamentary sub-committee has been examining ‘fake news’ and other aspects of unregulated social media content. Facebook this week removed thousands of bogus accounts and began a national advertising campaign to “help consumer spot fake news”. But much of the advice is fatuous: “If no other news source is reporting the story it may indicate that the story is fake.” Paul Armstrong, author of ‘Disruptive Technologies’ says: “There’s a lot more Facebook could be doing. They are in complete control of the algorithms … and could limit sources.” As Kenya swings into full election mode, the region should keep its eyes open for the darker side of the social media phenomenon.

Starting today, select products from iDevices, NuBryte, Universal Devices, and MobiLinc will be compatible with the Google Home (and anything else with Google Assistant). iDevices sells a variety of smart home products, including light switches, wall outlets, and lights. All of iDevices' products are rather expensive, but at least you don't need a hub for them. Two of the company's products stand out as pretty cool - a rain-tight outdoor smart plug, and an adapter to make any light bulb 'smart' (but buying Hue light bulbs would probably work better in most cases). NuBryte's main product is the TouchPoint, which replaces the light switch in a room with a touchscreen display. The TouchPoint can control lighting, view camera feeds, work as an intercom, and display weather and calendar information. However, it hasn't received great reviews. Universal Devices sells INSTEON lighting controllers, like this one, primarily for business or enthusiast use. Finally, MobiLinc offers apps for controlling specific smart home systems, such as ones using Universal Devices controllers.

[Update: Confirmed] Google Assistant in Allo is learning Spanish and French Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/09 9:40am PDTMay 9, 2017 39 Plus 1 on G+ 68 Share on Facebook 86 Share on Twitter Total Shares193 Applications Google News Update 1: 2017/05/09 9:43am PDT Confirmed Google rolled out Assistant first in Allo, but it only supported English at launch. Google has been slowly but steadily adding more languages to the Allo version, as well as the voice-activated version on phones. The company has quietly rolled out support for Spanish and French to Assistant in Allo, but it looks to still be in beta. Google has not updated its list of officially supported Assistant languages yet. It currently includes English, German, Hindi, Japanese, and Portuguese. However, we've gotten multiple tips that Assistant has started popping up in conversations happening in French and Spanish. Specifically, users are seeing smart replies in those languages, and they can ask the Assistant bot to use those languages. This appears to be a very recent change. When asked if is spoke French or Spanish before, Assistant would say it was still learning. Now, it offers to set those as the default language in Allo. It sounds like the new languages are a bit rougher around the edges than the "official" ones. Google's head of conversational search, Behshad Behzadi has reportedly said Spanish will be working completely later this year. French might be on the same track, but at least there's progress. Update 1: 2017/05/09 9:43am PDT Confirmed These languages are now confirmed. Google's head of product for Allo has tweeted that Spanish is rolling out. As for French, Google's Canadian blog says French is a go. End of Update Thanks: Roberto and Mikaël Tags allo assistant Google languages subscribe ...

I live in Quebec and my main language is french Canada so I would appreciate interacting with the assistant in French but do not wish to change my default language to French. I want to keep my device setup in English same as I always had my windows in English or any other tech devices.. TVs etc. And depending who I text it can be in English or French so unless it can switch easily it's useless currently. When I tried speaking french it would come up with gibersih words. It works better to just switch my keyboard language and use the mic. That way I am positive it understands what I am saying the first time whether it's French or English. roberto.elena At least in Allo, you don't have to do any changes. My phone has English US as the main system language for UI and Spanish (Spain) as secondary language for speech recognition. In Allo I can chat via text with the Assistant in English, Spanish and German and it understands all 3 without a problem. What I find weird is that the Assistant always replies using the same language, until you explicitly tell it to change to another one, so if I tell it to speak Spanish, it will always reply in Spanish even if I ask questions in English or German. EowynCarter Saying the assistant "speak french" should do that from what i tested. Keept talking english (device language is french), And it wasn't understanding anything before, expecting me to speak english. Then, it got the french sentance alright. Misanthrope Unfortunately, it still speaks English after that. I am in the same situation and don't want to put my device in French. I want to keep it in English and speak French which is impossible EowynCarter Mmm. I can tell the assistant to speak English despite my phone being in French. But I'm using the allo assistant. Girouf Yeah I remember when I was testing the assistant ...although it was using "French France" then cause french Canada was still not a "learned language, it would never switch to French on the fly if I tried dictating an SMS. As I mentioned my system was set as English default and I want it to stay that way. The best solution for me was to turn everything off and just use the mic in the keyboard, switch my language from there and I could easily create a French or English sms that way with the first try. I haven't used it since though so I don't know how it is now if any better. Marc ¡Hola! Omelette du fromage. Arthur J. Means nothing Bru [971] Seems to be out of beta as Google France's facebook page is asking us to try Assistant in French. With no mention of beta. This is how i saw it roberto.elena I think Google still considers it a beta, even when there is no mention of it. Maybe I'm wrong, but the same happened when the Assistant was launched in English in Allo, before the Pixel launch. JD Has it learned french? Or has it learned Quebecois? Qbancelli Gracias, Google! Daniel D’Oleo ¡Por fin, ya habla español! 😃 Can confirm it works in Spanish (Spain/Latin America). https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/737f7c20cd24f2fc2ad7d8dee390630046978e4c2f455b8f88277ae7afa1fcbf.png Diego S. Spanish yesss Petr Kuchyňka And few commands in Czech (like setting an alarm etc.) Gerardo Sarabia this should come to the rest of the Assistant ecosystem, instead of being limited to Allo. Leonardo Baez Thanks for the heads up. I will change my language to spanish now. 👍 cvm And here, I'm trying to learn French... Stefan There is so much to do in the field of bi-lingual and tri-lingual users.. the OS should know when I chat with a specific person what language I use and the keyboard and Assistant should adopt to contacts across the device.. I use three languages on a daily basis and it's a nightmare to say the least. EnerJi Do you use Gboard as your keyboard? Supposedly it auto-detects languages automatically, but I haven't tested it extensively and I'm not sure whether it works well. Stefan yes nexus 5x with clean android and Gboard.. it seems to work every now and then, and only integrates with native android apps. my iPad seems to work better with remembering which language was previously used in the chat.. but that's iMessage ... siri is one language only and that's a BIG reason why I switched to android because google Now understood which language I was speaking in.. google assistant is FAR behind Rod Swiftkey is your friend. VAVAMk_2 ¿Cuándo podemos esperar que Google Allo aprenda soporte SMS además de nuevos idiomas? YuCMi Proof that Allo is still in beta... it's literally Google's testing ground.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 9 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Boys & Girls Clubs of America with Google and AmeriCorps Teaches 10,000 Kids to Code Representative Ro Khanna visits Boys & Girls Clubs of Silicon Valley to see 'Code Corps' in action SAN JOSE, Calif., May 9, 2017 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Since first launching their partnership in 2014, Boys & Girls Clubs of America, Google and Corporation for National and Community Service (CNCS), the federal agency that oversees AmeriCorps, have supported more than 10,000 youth to complete over 80,000 hours of coding at Boys & Girls Clubs across the country. As the 'Code Corps' program celebrates its second anniversary, Congressman Ro Khanna made a special visit to the Boys & Girls Clubs of Silicon Valley. "Experience with computer coding programs are important skills for students to possess, and a child's ability to learn these skills should not be limited by her ethnicity or income level," said Rep. Ro Khanna (California District 17). "As our country increasingly moves towards a digital and technology-centric economy, we need to ensure that every child has equal opportunities. The Google Code Corps program will inspire a new class of digital leaders and entrepreneurs with the help and support of AmeriCorps members, who will instill the core knowledge, skills, and inspiration today's young people need to be successful. It was a joy to see this unique partnership between Google, Boys & Girls Clubs of America, and AmeriCorps provide an opportunity – through national service – for America's young people to usher in the next generation of creative, innovative young leaders." The organizations came together to develop the Code Corps program using computer science expertise and curriculum from Google, AmeriCorps VISTA members from CNCS and a positive after-school learning environment through local Boys & Girls Clubs. The resulting Code Corps program is designed to inspire and train the next generation of computer scientists and to increase access to computer science education across the United States. Congressman Ro Khanna visited the Boys & Girls Clubs of Silicon Valley to experience the Code Corps Classroom firsthand and participate in a roundtable discussion about the importance of computer science education and national service. CNCS, the federal agency that administers AmeriCorps VISTA and other national service programs, provides Americans opportunities to serve their country through innovative, locally-led solutions that tackle tough challenges, such as expanding access to high-quality STEM education in a time of tight budget constraints.   Boys & Girls Clubs of Silicon Valley is situated in the heart of computer science innovation, and it is also alma mater to the 2017 National Youth of the Year, Jocelyn Woods. Jocelyn learned computer coding skills at the Club, which helped her secure internships and even led her to code a photo-sharing app. "As the leading youth advocacy organization, we know that private and public partnerships help to advance our goal to help today's youth achieve great futures," said Jim Clark, president & CEO of Boys & Girls Clubs of America. "Our relationship with Google and CNCS is a wonderful example of the possibilities that come to life when likeminded organizations share their complementary skillsets and offerings. After two very successful years of Code Corps, we are looking forward to empowering even more kids and teens with computer science education, an important competency for 21st century jobs." The AmeriCorps VISTA Code Corps program recruits and trains a group of AmeriCorps VISTA members to facilitate Google's CS First curriculum and other technology experiences for Boys & Girls Club members. The CS First curriculum from Google aims to make computer science accessible and inspiring. The lessons draw upon relatable topics from music to politics, demonstrating that computer science can tap into students' interests. About Boys & Girls Clubs of America For more than 150 years, Boys & Girls Clubs of America (BGCA.org) has enabled young people most in need to achieve great futures as productive, caring, responsible citizens. Today, more than 4,300 Clubs serve nearly 4 million young people through Club membership and community outreach.

If you own a Samsung Galaxy S8, Galaxy S7, Galaxy S6, Galaxy Note 5, or a Galaxy Tab, you should start preparing for your Android Nougat update. Google’s Android 7.0 Nougat update has been out since August and it’s slowly making its way to popular Samsung Galaxy smartphones and tablets. The company’s Android Nougat roll out is currently limited but it will gain steam in the first half of the year with more roll outs planned for Galaxy-branded devices. The Android Nougat update is moving out for Galaxy S7, Galaxy S7 Edge, Galaxy S6, Galaxy S6 Edge, Galaxy Note 5 and the Galaxy Tab S2. The company is also pushing new Nougat builds to its Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+. These Android Nougat updates are based on Android 7.0 (Samsung might be planning Android 7.1 upgrades) and they deliver some important changes to Samsung’s stable of Galaxy devices. The Nougat upgrade and Nougat bug fix updates are expected to hit more devices in the not-so-distant future so now would be a good time to start taking some steps to prepare your device for the upgrade. This includes Galaxy S8 and Galaxy S8+ users. These are important updates but your Nougat update could cause problems for many of you. This is why it’s important to do some prep work ahead of your installation. It’s impossible to predict what kind of problems you might run into after you install Nougat or a bug fix update and a little prep work will help you avoid major issues. Get Familiar with Android 7.0 Nougat   1 / 10 There are a several steps to take before the Android Nougat update arrives for your device. One of the first steps is to get familiar with Android Nougat and more specifically, Samsung's version of Android Nougat. It's different than Google's.  Samsung's version of Nougat incorporates some of the features Google introduced to its Nexus line of devices last year. We recommend getting familiar with the base version of Android Nougat. To do that, take a look at our Android Marshmallow vs. Android Nougat walkthrough. The walkthrough will take you through the key differences between Nougat and Marshmallow and that will help you get familiar with the changes coming aboard your Nougat update. The more comfortable you are ahead of your release the better.  You'll also want to get familiar with Samsung's version of Nougat because it comes with some major tweaks to the user interface, some new modes, and a whole lot more.  To help you do that, take a look at Samsung's updated consumer guide for the Galaxy S7 and the guide for Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge. There's also a Nougat guide available for the Galaxy S6. We've also put together a list of the most prominent features in our Samsung Android Nougat roundup and it's worth a look if you didn't follow Samsung's Nougat beta for the Galaxy S7 and Galaxy S7 Edge.  Furthermore, if you own a Galaxy S7 or Galaxy S7 Edge you'll want to take a look at our list of reasons to and not to install Nougat on your device.  If you own a Galaxy S6 or Galaxy S6 Edge, take a peek at our list of reasons to and not to install Android Nougat. If you own a Galaxy Note 5 you'll want to check the reasons to, and not to, install your version of Android Nougat.  And if you own a Samsung Galaxy Tab S2, check out our reasons to and not to install its version of Android 7.0 Nougat.    1 / 10 5 Responses 03/31/2017 Doris Bennett Reply After update the text message background is not the same I need a black background as it’s easier to see the messages How do I get them back 04/01/2017 fotbollströjor Reply I go to see daily a few web pages and websites to read articles or reviews, except this blog presents quality based posts. fotbollströjor 04/06/2017 Longchamp Homme Sac Reply Have you ever considered creating an ebook or guest authoring on other websites?

(Pixabay) Follow > Click here to add Instagram as an alert Click here to remove the Instagram alert Disable alert for Instagram Days ahead of its annual developer conference Google I/O to be held in San Francisco, Google has announced that it will end the Android Nougat Beta and soon launch its new version Android O Beta. How To Use Your Apple Airpods On Android, Windows Devices  The company is also expected to throw light on its plans for Android O features and functionality at the conference. "Thank you for your interest in the Android Beta Programme. The beta for Android Nougat has concluded, and all devices that were opted in have been updated to the current public version," Google said in an update to the Android beta website. "If you are still running a beta version of Nougat you may download the latest full OTA image for your device and sideload it. This will not wipe your device. We'll update this site when the Android O Beta Programme begins," the update added. To date, Google had been providing Beta versions of Android Nougat (versions 7.x) alongside early "Developer Preview" versions of Android O which is touted as the next major Android version. "But many Pixel and Nexus users are waiting for the Android O beta as the developer preview is not really intended for public consumption," BetaNews reported on Monday. A previous report by VentureBeat claims that Google will  announce the new Android at I/O conference that starts on May 17, 2017 and will end on May 20, 2017. The report also states that the new Android could come with features to match up with Apple's software. The two companies have shared features with each other in the past. Snapchat Makers Developing Android Smartphone That Keeps Your Selfies Secure Apple's recent seriousness for its voice assistant comes after Google introduced its Google Assistant. The report also talks about a text-copy feature built by Google which can be expected in the new Android. The feature is called Copy Less and will allow user to copy text from one app and the phone will automatically offer the suggestion to paste it at the next place you start typing in. The new Android O is also expected to come with better sharing features. Reportedly, the feature will integrate the message text with relevant apps. For example: If you share or say any address in a message, it can be also opened in Google Maps. Also expected are some tweaks in the Notification bar, native support for app badges and settings menu.  Join Albawaba Business Follow Albawaba Business Copyright © 2017 India Today Group.

Apple sends out invites for June 5th event expected to see its Siri smart home speaker unveiled (and maybe even a sneak peek of the iPhone 8) Analyst claims speaker will be Apple's 'first home AI product' Could be marketed as a 'Siri/AirPlay device' and boast Beats technology Some say Apple could unveil the device at its Worldwide Developers Conference By Mark Prigg For Dailymail.com Published: 16:23 EDT, 9 May 2017 | Updated: 16:46 EDT, 9 May 2017 e-mail 3 View comments Apple has sent out invites to key press for the keynote of its Worldwide Developers Conference in San Jose on June 5th. The firm is rumoured to be unveiling a smart speaker using its Siri assistant at the event to take on Amazon's Echo range and  Google Home. The firm is also expected to unveil the next version of its iOS software, with some analysts claiming it may even give a sneak peek of the next iPhone. Scroll down for video The keynote address will take place on June 5th in San Jose, and Apple is rumoured to be unveiling a smart speaker using its Siri assistant at the event to take on Amazon's Echo range and Google Home. A JP Morgan analyst has suggested there is a 'high likelihood' that the tech giant will preview the iPhone 8 at the World Developers Conference in June – a move that breaks five years of tradition. However, the New York-based financial firm has not supported its prediction with any real evidence.  RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next How you can stop your job being taken by a robot:... Would a free pair of AirPods ease the pain of the iPhone 8¿s... Amazon's $230 Echo Show is unveiled with video calling and a... Amazon launches exclusive music concerts for its Prime... Share this article Share KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo is one of those who says the firm will unveil the Siri speaker at WWDC. The product is believed to be aimed at bringing Appl'e AI into the home, and will have a higher price tag that the Amazon range, which begins at $49 for the Echo Dot.  AMAZON'S ECHO SHOW  After weeks of anticipation, Amazon has finally launched its new Echo Show smart assistant. The voice-controlled speaker features a 7-inch touchscreen display, which can be used to make video calls After weeks of anticipation, Amazon has finally launched its new Echo Show smart assistant.  The voice-controlled speaker features a 7-inch touchscreen display, which can be used to make video calls and playback video content. It will be available in white or black, and officially launches in the US on June 28 at a retail price of $229.99 (£179). On its website, Amazon said: 'Echo Show brings you everything you love about Alexa, and now she can show you things.  'Watch video flash briefings and YouTube, see music lyrics, security cameras, photos, weather forecasts, to-do and shopping lists, and more.  'All hands-free - just ask.'  The device weighs 2.6 pounds (1.1 kilograms), which suggests it won't be seen as a mobile phone replacement.  The new device is the fourth Echo-branded product, and comes three years after the first Amazon Echo launched in 2014.      According to 9to5 Mac, Kuo calls it ‘Apple’s first home AI product’, and says it will feature ‘excellent’ sound with seven tweeters and a subwoofer. 'It will be positioned as a more premium product than the Echo … with a higher price tag to match, the site says. According to Kuo, Apple hopes to ship around 10 million of these as-yet-unannounced devices in the first year, and it will be made by Inventec, the same company that made  Apple’s AirPods.  A recent leak has revealed the Cupertino company is 'currently finalizing' its own smart speaker, which is said to be marketed as a 'Siri/AirPlay device'. The latest news also noted that the Siri-driven device could 'carry some form of Beats technology and is expected to run on variant iOS'.  Apple is getting closer to unleashing its secret weapon to take on Amazon's Echo. A new leak has revealed that the Cupertino company is 'currently finalizing' its own smart speaker, which is said to be marketed as a 'Siri/AirPlay device' APPLE'S SIRI-DRIVEN SMART SPEAKER Sonny Dickson, who is known for sharing inside information in the tech world, revealed that Apple is 'currently finalizing' its smart speaker that will be marketed as a 'Siri/AirPlay device'. Adding Airplay support to the device would let users push music, radio, and podcasts to the Apple hardware over Wi-Fi, which typically offers better quality than Bluetooth.  He also revealed details that it could 'carry some form of Beats technology and is expected to run on variant iOS'. Dickson also told Mashable that it would have a 'concave top' with the controls, 'Mac Pro style.' Although it is not clear if the rumors are true, if Apple's smart speaker does hit the market 'it would be Apple's most significant piece of new hardware' since debuting the Apple Watch in 2014'. The latest rumor regarding Apple's secretive smart speaker was shared to Twitter by Sonny Dickson, who is known for sharing inside information in the tech world. Not only did he mention the device is near completion, but he also revealed details that it could 'carry some form of Beats technology and is expected to run on variant iOS'. Dickson also told Mashable that it would have a 'concave top' with the controls, 'Mac Pro style.' But that is all of the information the well-known leaker had to share. Adding Airplay support to the device would let users 'push music, radio, and podcasts to the Apple hardware over Wi-Fi, which typically offers better quality than Bluetooth,' Apple Insider reported. According to 9to5 Mac, KGI analyst Ming-Chi Kuo calls it ‘Apple’s first home AI product’, and says it will feature ‘excellent’ sound with seven tweeters and a subwoofer. However, Apple has yet to make an official announcement regarding their Siri-enabled smart speaker, so it is not clear when  or if it will be released.  But the tech giant is known for unveiling new  technologies at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June, which has some speculating the firm could show off the smart speaker then - with a possible fall release.  The latest rumor regarding Apple's secretive smart speaker was shared to Twitter by Sonny Dickson, who is known for sharing inside information in the tech world. It could also 'carry some form of Beats technology and is expected to run on variant iOS' Dickson's news is not the first time Apple's smart speaker has made its way to the masses. Last September, two people familiar with the matter told Bloomberg that Apple is attempting to differentiate itself from the other firms with more advanced microphone and speaker technology. And some of the technology in the prototype includes facial recognition sensors, another source revealed. These tips coincides with Apple's purchase of the facial recognition startups Faceshift and Emotient over the past two years.  However, Apple has yet to make an official announcement regarding their Siri-enabled smart speaker, so it is not clear when or if it will be released. But the tech giant is known for unveiling new technologies at its Worldwide Developers Conference in June, which has some speculating the firm could show off the smart speaker then The two firms appear to play key roles in creating a device that adapts to a room or a person's emotional state. Users would also have the ability to use the same Siri features with the device that they enjoy with their iPhone. Apple has also considered integrating mapping information into the speaker, another person said, which could notify users when it is time to leave their house for an appointment. News about a 'Siri speaker' was first brought to light in May by Amir Efrati of The Information who wrote, 'Apple is upping its game in the field of intelligent assistants'. Dickson's news is not the first time Apple's smart speaker has made its way to the masses - reports surfaced last year that suggested Apple has a secret weapon to take on Amazon's Echo (pictured) 'After years of internal debate and discussion about how to do so, the company is preparing to open up Siri to apps made by others. 'And it is working on an Amazon Echo-like device with a speaker and microphone that people can use to turn on music, get news headlines or set a timer.' Apple showed its interested in the smart-home space with the launch of HomeKit in 2014, which lets third-party smart-home accessory makers integrate with Siri. This was also the same year Apple began its work with the Siri-powered speakers.

MailOnline puts Sony's XB40 to the test Sony SRS-XB40 has a built-in multi-coloured line light, speaker lights and a flashing strobe. It features 24 hours of battery life and claims to be a 'mini-disco on the move'. But does it live up to the claim? Samsung's Galaxy S8: A hefty price tag and a dumb personal assistant Samsung's new Galaxy S8 phone is stunning, but its $100 price hike is hard to swallow. Overall the S8 is for those who want elegance - and are willing to pay for it. Affordable, robust and surprisingly responsive: Samsung's Galaxy A5 With the eagerly awaited Galaxy S8 having been pushed back, South Korea-based Samsung has plugged the gap with the Samsung Galaxy A5, a high-end device with a mid-range price tag. Is it really worth paying £280 for Nintendo's Switch? MailOnline's verdict While the design is impressive and easy to use, the game line up is disappointing. Google's Daydream: The $79 headset that could bring VR to the masses Google's $79 headset is superb in terms of hardware - but is currently let down by a lack of apps. However, it has absolutely huge potential to finally bring VR to the masses. Welcome Home: Google's $130 smart speaker Google's smart Home speaker still has a lot of learning to do, and loses out to Amazon's Echo in some areas - but has incredible potential 'Not quite an iPhone replacement': Google's Pixel phone Google's Pixel handset is good, and boasts an amazing camera and smart assistant. It's the king of the Android handsets - but still not great. Xbox One S review: Console that will make your 4K TV shine Microsoft's Xbox One S has shrunk the giant console by 40%, and is stunningly designed console with 4K HDR capabilities - but comes with some caveats. The $1,000 wireless speaker that really IS worth the price: Naim Mu-so Qb review Naim's incredible Mu-So Qb takes you back to the good old days - where the music captivates and enthralls, rather that simply being something in the background. The hi-tech $2,000 spin bike that really could change your life Peloton's hi-tech bike lets you stream live and on demand rides to your home - and it's one of the best examples of fitness technology out there - at a price. Apple's new 9.7inch iPad Pro is a powerhouse you can take anywhere Apple has added a few improvements to the smaller version, creating a tablet that is astonishingly powerful, but, unlike its big brother, is something you'll be able to carry everywhere. Speaker that looks as good as its sounds: B&W Zeppelin Wireless review It's not cheap, but the $699 (£500) Zeppelin Wireless is perfect for the design conscious music fan. The best all in one wireless speaker you'll ever hear: Naim Mu-so review It might not be a name familiar to the US market, but Naim is a legendary British brand hoping to make a splash with the American launch of its $1499 Mu:So speaker.

Google Home now works with smart home products from iDevices, NuBryte, and more Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/09 12:28pm PDTMay 9, 2017 8 Plus 1 on G+ 12 Share on Facebook 38 Share on Twitter Total Shares58 Google Google Home News The Google Home only worked with a handful of services at launch, but over the past few months, we've seen more and more services start to work with it. Starting today, select products from iDevices, NuBryte, Universal Devices, and MobiLinc will be compatible with the Google Home (and anything else with Google Assistant). iDevices sells a variety of smart home products, including light switches, wall outlets, and lights. All of iDevices' products are rather expensive, but at least you don't need a hub for them. Two of the company's products stand out as pretty cool - a rain-tight outdoor smart plug, and an adapter to make any light bulb 'smart' (but buying Hue light bulbs would probably work better in most cases). NuBryte's main product is the TouchPoint, which replaces the light switch in a room with a touchscreen display. The TouchPoint can control lighting, view camera feeds, work as an intercom, and display weather and calendar information. However, it hasn't received great reviews. Universal Devices sells INSTEON lighting controllers, like this one, primarily for business or enthusiast use. Finally, MobiLinc offers apps for controlling specific smart home systems, such as ones using Universal Devices controllers.

Google is "currently exploring solutions" for connecting existing Google accounts to Family Link Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/06 7:09pm PDTMay 6, 2017 38 Plus 1 on G+ 79 Share on Facebook 78 Share on Twitter Total Shares195 Google News Back in March, Google launched 'Family Link,' a way for parents to create and manage Google accounts for their children (13 or younger). The feature ended up being very impressive, but had two huge limitations - it only worked on Android 7.0 or higher, and you couldn't use existing Google accounts for your kids. Thankfully, Google is working on a possible solution for the second problem. The company has updated a support page for Family Link with the below message: You can only use Family Link's parental supervision features with Google Accounts created using Family Link. We've heard from many people that they'd like to use an existing Google Account with Family Link, and we're currently exploring solutions. That's better than nothing, I suppose. I can understand why it might take more time to make that functionality work - in addition to the possible technical issues, Google has to follow all government guidelines related to online accounts for minors.

I'm glad Google is trying to help this out but what it's really doing is trying to help people out who didn't​ follow Google's guidelines in the first place. Corbin Davenport Yeah, that's a valid point. xeratun There are plenty of ages 13+ that are still minors. What if your kid is currently 15 and has used their account for years now but you want to bring them in? There's at least a 5 year phase in period based on that alone. But also, even if everyone follows the 13 rule, what if your kid makes it on their 13th birthday, but you just aren't aware of this yet then want to add it in. The option to roll that account into it is definitely handy. Cédric B It could also be an account 100% managed by the parent. For now my daughter uses my account when she plays, watches YouTube,... I think I should instead open another account for such purposes (and family link is not yet available in france). Even Google made a tv ad where a dad created an account for his newborn, then added in it emails,... that the daughter would get later. Jay In my case, I created the account for my kid just to reserve the name so that by the time he's old enough he doesn't have to have [email protected] I also use it to write to him so he's got emails from me throughout his whole life that he can go back and read one day. Finally, though the email address is his name, it's *my* account until I choose to hand it over, therefore it's not violating any guidelines or terms since I'm over 13 and the other info on the account is mine. Rather than add "his" Google Account to my family account, what I'm hoping Google will do is allow me to transfer "my" other, existing Google account to him now under the family account. You're using semantics to make it seem like he's using an account he shouldn't have against the rules, and that's not the case in my situation. SBBH I've done the exact same thing and also wish Google would make this work with existing emails. Violet There's also the fact that in order for an Android phone to work, you have to have a Google account. So, if your kids get phones before they're thirteen, there's going to be some fudging of birth years during setup. SBBH Yep, not sure why they've waited so long to address this when for years now every kid has had a phone and because of that an email address. I know there are administrator and guest accounts or something like that (can't remember the exact names) in Android but I've found it often doesn't work as advertised or the older phones simply don't support it. I think the government also needs to update the laws a bit when it comes to this. IMHO My1 iirc you dont need a google acc just so that the phone works, just to use Google stuff, like the playstore, yes people like to treat that as the same thing but it's slightly different. AQ Good, I made an account for my niece not long ago & would like her mom to have more parental type control over it when I un-block some google apps on her tablet/she gets a smartphone & ofc for the account to be more legit.

Ben_13 Same boat as me! I got my last name as a domain forever ago and set it up with google apps for domains. It has my account and sons and we've had it so long I don't want to find another email solution so that I can use a family plan...very unfortunate and annoying. James Carnley It's no longer for families. If you intend to keep your account for your family use instead of switching to a normal Google account then you will have to accept that new non-corporate/education features will not work for your account. Chris Except Google has no way to transfer your account to a regular Google account. I'm not willing to throw away all of the apps that I've spent money on using my current account. Chris Or be able to use it with my brand new Google Home (Which is being returned because it's not compatible with my account), or Google TV (Which I briefly subscribed to, then cancelled and stayed with Sling because the account sharing wasn't available for my account), or the family plan on Google Play Music (Which I tried to sign up for, but switched to Spotify so my kids can be on the family plan, since it wasn't available with my account). I typically love Google's services, but they screwed the pooch with the custom domain. I can't even switch to a regular gmail account at this point, because I've got so much invested in my custom domain account. Infamous_Elsa It still needs app restrictions and website blocking like iOS Tired_Guy I have maybe an unusual situation but likely not and I did bring it to Google's attention but... My son is 25 but IDD and is like a big 5 year old. He does not yet have a legal guardian, but seriously, he will forever be a minor. I set him up a gmail account for his tablet and because many social services ask for one and it's nice to let him have one of his "own". The mail comes to me anyway. He gets music off the family plan google play and Red and we can keep his music and video choices separate from ours. Having an account means we can set him up on a new device pretty quickly at least as his favorite stuff goes. But a lot of what FL offers is stuff I'd love to be able to do in one place rather than doing it all ad hoc. Trust me, if I die, his mom isn't going to deal with the hows and whys of managing his account, access, email, browsing etc. And yes, app restrictions would be such a bonus as the existing stuff out there really sucks and I'm constantly getting the kid off the password screes and back to his video because he his something he shouldn't have. But beyond COPA and age 13, tere are a ton of parents like me with adult children who are disabled who'd love to be able to allow their kids internet access while managing it for them. John Stacy Please Google, let those of us who are using the Apps for Domains accounts, that were billed as great for families, be used for family sharing and family library. J.

Google's latest operating system shed some of its mystery this week with the revelation that intrepid programmers can get a glimpse of the open-source user interface by running it as an Android app. The new OS, codenamed "Fuscia" and in development since at least August 2016, now has a partially built user interface available for download on Github, ExtremeTech reports. To get it up and running, however, you'll need to compile it as an Android APK and install it on a phone or emulator, a great weekend project for someone with the required set of skills, but not something casual Android enthusiasts will probably take on. Fuscia's user interface is code-named Armadillo, and if you do manage to get it up and running, you'll notice several similarities between it and Google's two main existing OSes (Chrome and Android), according to Ars Technica. The home screen, which scrolls vertically to display its content, includes a profile picture in the center with the date, a city name, and a battery icon. Tapping on the picture will bring up an Android-style quick settings menu. Armadillo's main departure from Android is the home screen scrolling feature. Instead of recently used apps, you'll see "story cards" that can include apps and other "modules" grouped around common themes, Ars reports. Armadillo is still in its infancy, and many of its features are mere placeholders that don't actually do anything in the Android APK. Google's plans for the OS are unclear, although it can reportedly run on 32- and 64-bit ARM CPUs, as well as 64-bit Intel CPUs. That versatility means it could one day be integrated into everything from car dashboard displays to desktop PCs. Meanwhile, for some context into what Fuscia's developers are thinking without actually having to compile the software into an app yourself, it's worth perusing the readme file, also available on Github. You'll even find a rudimentary hand-drawn Armadillo logo, which almost certainly will not show up in the finished product.

There's A Shareholders' Revolt At Bombardier Previous Story Next Story Sidewalk Labs, Google Sibling Company, May Build Futuristic Mini-City In Toronto HuffPost Canada  |  By Emma Paling Email Posted: 05/09/2017 3:39 pm EDT Updated: 05/09/2017 3:39 pm EDT Share Tweet 0 Email Comment tumblr stumble reddit ADVERTISEMENT A Google offshoot company — which aims to reimagine cities “from the internet up” — has reportedly applied to co-develop a 12-acre piece of land in downtown Toronto. Sidewalk Labs applied for a downtown Toronto space that fits with its purpose to create a high-tech, futuristic city from scratch, sources told Bloomberg. An aerial view of the Toronto city skyline on May 3, 2017. Google formed Sidewalk Labs in 2015 to “accelerate the process of urban innovation.” “What would a city look like if you started from scratch in the internet era — if you built a city ‘from the internet up?’” asks the company’s CEO Daniel Doctoroff. “What I mean by that is a place where ubiquitous connectivity is truly built into the foundation of the city, and where people use the data that’s generated to enhance quality of life.” Earlier this year, Waterfront Toronto put out a request for proposals to find a funding partner for “Quayside,” a 12-acre plot of land that spans from Lake Shore Boulevard to the water. Waterfront Toronto is a organization formed by the federal, provincial, and municipal governments. Waterfront Toronto sought proposals for this 12-acre span of land called 'Quayside.' “Our long-term aspiration for this vast area is to create vibrant, connected, climate positive, resilient and prosperous communities,” Waterfront Toronto said in the call for proposals. Doctoroff has talked openly about creating a “large-scale district” to test new ideas. “I’m sure many of you are thinking this is a crazy idea: building a city new — the most innovative, urban district in the world, something at scale that can actually have the catalytic impact among cities around the world,” Doctoroff said at a recent conference. “We don’t think it’s crazy at all.” To date, Sidewalk Labs is most well known for its LinkNYC project, which installed hundreds of Internet kiosks around New York City. The Wi-Fi feature had to be disabled after there were reports of users watching pornography and masturbating on the street. Follow HuffPost Canada on Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram Also on HuffPost: Close  What Toronto's Average House Price Will Buy You Around The World of   Located on a lush, narrow street that looks like a Caribbean jungle, this four-bedroom, three-bath house in ritzy Coconut Grove proves the average Toronto homeowner could live like a monarch in south Florida. The listing asks US$1.2 million (C$1.61 million). This seven-bedroom, seven-bath behemoth is located in Naperville, the U.S. Midwest’s richest municipality, about a 40-minute drive from downtown Chicago. For Toronto money, you can live like a Chicago one-percenter. The listing asks US$1.15 million (C$1.54 million). This five-bedroom, four-bath house in Provence comes with a separate caretaker’s home that includes three apartments, as well as a separate warehouse. But forget all that, look at the view. The listing asks 1.1 million euro (C$1.56 million). This terraced house, as it’s known in England, is located on an elegant street in the lively and ethnically diverse Brixton area of south London. Want to be north of the Thames? It’ll cost ya. But this place is within walking distance of two tube stations, so at 950,000 pounds (C$1.57 million), it’s nothing short of a London bargain. This house is located in one of Asia’s top vacation destinations, has views of lush rolling hills and the ocean, and offers nearly 3,800 sq. ft. of living space. Not a bad trade-in for a retired Torontonian. The listing asks 45 million Thai baht (C$1.74 million). OK, so there are still places in the world where housing is more expensive than Toronto. Central Paris is one of them, and here the average Toronto house price will get you a one-bedroom apartment. Granted, this place is in a completely renovated 18th-century building next to the Place de Furstenberg. The listing asks one million euro (C$1.42 million). Manhattan is another place that is still more expensive than Toronto (though the same cannot be said for New York as a whole anymore), but here the average Toronto house price will at least get you into a really good location. This apartment on Central Park South is steps from Columbus Circle and is walking distance to Times Square. The listing asks US$1.25 million (C$1.67 million). The world’s least affordable housing market will not get you much for your Toronto dollars. For the equivalent of around C$1.5 million, you can get apartment in the 350 sq. ft. to 500 sq. ft. range. So yes, things could be worse than they are in Toronto. Let’s just hope Toronto’s housing bubble never reaches Hong Kong proportions.  Share  Tweet  ✖ Advertisement Share this ✖ close Current Slide More: video business video Sidewalk Labs google alphabet futuristic city google city sidewalk labs city sidewalk labs Toronto Waterfront Toronto Quayside Toronto Suggest a correction   Click here to view Conversations Conversations Suggested For You FOLLOW HUFFPOST Email Email Address Please check the checkbox to indicate your consent Options HuffPost Daily Brief Business Get top stories and blog posts emailed to me each day..

Hi, it's the future calling. Got a minute? That's the message Amazon is sending to the world this week with the launch of its new Echo Show, a $230 voice assistant that comes with a touchscreen and the ability to make and receive video calls. Well, sort of. Yes, the Echo Show lets you talk and message with other people -- but with one major caveat: You can communicate only with people who are also using a compatible Echo device or the Amazon Alexa app. In other words, it's Yet Another Proprietary Messaging Service. Like so many other services in that position, it's useful only if the people you want to chat with are also committed to the platform. Amazon "Hello, Stock-Image Laughing Lady? This is Stock-Image Casual Business Man calling. How are ya?" Don't get me wrong: Having calling capabilities on a smart speaker is certainly a neat idea -- and limitations or not, there could obviously be some valid uses for that in both the home and the business realms. But Amazon's dipping its toes into an area where a certain other company has the potential to do so much more. Earlier this year, we heard rumors that both Amazon and Google were looking at adding calling capabilities to their respective smart speaker devices. For now, at least, this appears to be Amazon's implementation -- which raises the question of what Google might still have hiding up its sleeve. Despite a late start into the standalone personal assistant market, Google's been pushing hard to make its Google Home speaker a hit. And with the company's I/O developers' conference just over a week away -- a seeming coincidence that makes me raise an inquisitive eyebrow at Amazon's choice of timing with this Echo Show announcement -- the Google crew has a major opportunity to outdo Amazon's effort and position its product as the smart speaker to buy. How? It's simple: Google has essentially run its own virtual phone service for years -- first with Google Voice and now with the expanded Project Fi wireless service. Google already has the ability to issue new phone numbers and connect existing Voice and Fi numbers to supplementary devices and services. It has a robust setup for video conferencing calls as well, thanks to Duo, Hangouts, and the zillion other Google messaging products that are lounging around Google's hallways. See where this is going? Google could make Amazon's effort look like child's play If the rumors are true and Google is, in fact, working on a way to turn its Home device into a speakerphone and/or videophone, Google could do it with a reach that'd make Amazon's effort look like child's play. An extra-connected Home speaker could let you make and take actual calls with a real phone number -- theoretically your own number or a new one that you select specifically for your Home device -- and involving anyone else with a functioning phone number. If video were involved, the calls could connect to one of Google's existing platforms and thus have less of an out-of-the-way requirement for participation. A Google Home speaker could effectively become an extension of your Google account and Android phone, with a massive array of possibilities for how it could work. For personal users, such a setup could serve as a convenient way to supplement a smartphone and have a modern "landline"-style device in the house, without any ongoing fees. For business users, it could be a versatile and powerful way to conduct conference calls and stay in touch with associates. Think about Google's recent Hangouts enterprise push and how easily that might fit in with a business-targeted take on this concept (just don't let it be called Google Home For Business -- please). Right now, no one knows for sure what Google is or isn't planning to unveil with its Home product in the coming days, weeks, or months. What we do know, however, is that Home and the broader notion of bringing an intelligent and consistent experience across all of our connected devices have been major focuses for the company as of late -- and that getting one step ahead of Amazon in the fledgling smart speaker space has been an obvious goal for Google ever since the Echo started to show promise. We also know that Google recently added the ability for Home to detect and support multiple users via voice identification -- a feature that one could imagine having plenty of practical value if account-connected calling were added into the mix. We know that after years of neglect, Google suddenly relaunched Google Voice earlier this year for reasons that aren't yet entirely clear. We know that Google is trying to find a way to make its visual-oriented ad business fit into the audio-centric Home domain -- a challenge the addition of a touchscreen could conceivably solve. And generally speaking, we know that the company has big ambitions for its still-young hardware division. Will all of this add up to something significant? Time will tell. With the launch of the Echo Show, though, Amazon has absolutely raised the stakes -- and there's little question Google is taking notice. With I/O around the corner and a hardware-specific event likely to follow later in the fall, things on this front could sure get interesting fast.

Win a trip to Amsterdam! We've teamed up with Product Hunt to offer you the chance to win an all expense paid trip to TNW Conference 2017! CHECK IT OUT The creator, Arduino Guy, describes the whole process with detailed instructions, and shows a shortened version in the video above. To make this bad boy, you need Google’s new Voice Kit with the Assistant SDK, a Raspberry Pi 3, and a Particle Photon. The setup instructions list a soldering iron and 3D printer, meaning this isn’t for the faint-of-heart. Considering the candy is dispensed through a relatively narrow tube, it looks like small pieces of candy, like the M&Ms the creator uses, are ideal. In its completed form, the machine responds to claps and voice. The dispensing apparatus works via an IFTTT applet connecting Assistant’s Voice Kit with the Photon receiver. You can program different responses to the question “How much candy?” That seems a little pointless, though, because the correct answer is always “A LOT.” A sensor detects when a cup is under the spout and will dispense the candy. Creating something to automatically dispense tasty treats is undoubtedly the most important use of this sophisticated technology. I’m only surprised it took a whole two weeks to appear.

Support was initially limited to English, but it has since been updated with more languages. Starting today, a number of Allo’s smart features will work in two new languages. French speakers in Canada and France, as well as Spanish speakers in Spain will now have access to the Assistant in Allo. Other features like Smart Reply for text messages are beginning to rollout in French, with images replies coming later. Similarly the Spain rollout will also take place in several weeks. Google Assistant allows you to quickly search, play games, and have a conversation. Meanwhile, Smart Reply uses machine learning to provide a quick automatic responses. Back in September, Google Assistant in Allo was released in English, and later German. By December, it was released for Hindi and Portuguese, as well as Japanese days after. Last week, Allo’s head of product Amit Fulay announced new features like chat backup/restore in Allo. Meanwhile, the messaging app is also working on selfie-generated sticker pack feature for an upcoming release. To make Google Assistant talk in your language, just say “Talk to me in [language]” or ask it to “Speak in [language]”.

David Pierce Gear Date of Publication: 05.09.17. 05.09.17 Time of Publication: 3:15 pm. 3:15 pm Microsoft Build 2017: What to Expect at the Big Developer Bash CEO Satya Nadella speaking at a Microsoft launch event on May 2, 2017, in New York. Drew Angerer/Getty Images It’s been a few years since Microsoft’s then-CEO Steve Ballmer danced across the stage screaming “DEVELOPERS DEVELOPERS DEVELOPERS,” but those are still the three words you’d use to explain this week’s Build conference. Like Google’s I/O or Apple’s WWDC, the annual event is partly a state of the union, partly a product unveiling, but mostly a time to bring the developer community together and pitch them on a vision of the future. The conference lasts two days, with keynote addresses starting at 8 am on both Wednesday and Thursday. You can watch on Microsoft’s site, and you should definitely hang out with us while we liveblog. Microsoft seemingly hasn’t left itself much to unveil this time. CEO Satya Nadella and his team already announced the Surface Laptop and the education-focused Windows 10 S software that powers it. They’ve also scheduled another hardware event for later this month. Meanwhile, Harman Kardon showed off the new Invoke speaker, with the Cortana voice assistant inside. The world knows all about HoloLens, and Microsoft’s basically out of the phone game. So what’s left? Apps and AI For Microsoft, what’s most interesting and important is the spaces between all those devices. Under Nadella, it has spent the last few years making sure anyone can use Microsoft products, no matter where they are. Expect to hear countless versions of the pitch for Microsoft’s universal apps, which let developers write a single block of code that will work on computers, phones, tablets, Xboxes, even augmented-reality devices. So far, the pitch hasn’t captured anyone’s imagination—the Windows Store is still woefully underpopulated. Since Windows 10 S only runs Store apps, and the company’s many new platforms will rely on them as well, it needs a full store. If the Microsoft team could get away with grounding the thousands of developers in attendance in Seattle until their apps work on Windows, you have to wonder if they’d try. The conference lasts two days, with keynote addresses starting at 8am on both Wednesday and Thursday. Another of Nadella’s biggest focuses has been on Microsoft’s artificial intelligence services—he’s particularly interested in figuring out how to apply big-data learning and algorithms outside of huge data centers and in smaller devices and applications, a field known as “edge computing.” Azure, the company’s cloud-service program that compete’s with Google Cloud and Amazon Web Services, is an important part of the company’s finances. AI and cloud-computing services are both huge money-makers and fuel a wildly competitive market, so expect Microsoft to forcefully make its own case. As Microsoft continues to remake itself as a productivity company, AI is starting to touch everything it does. Cortana should play a starring role in the keynote, as Microsoft tries to fend off Alexa and Google Assistant in order to be the virtual assistant you choose to trust with your life. The same technology goes into the bots Microsoft won’t stop making, no matter how badly it goes. Ultimately, bots could make most mundane tasks easier on the internet—Microsoft’s building them for Bing, Skype, Office, and more. Right now they’re still just racist. Windows Dressing The Build schedule, always a good barometer for Microsoft’s thinking ahead of the conference, indicates that now that the Windows 10 Creators’ Update is out, developers will get a first look at an all-new Windows design language. Office is a constant at Build, too, and should feature prominently this year as Microsoft tries to prove it’s just as collaborative and internet-y as Google Docs. Likewise, you can bet your breakfast that someone will get on stage and show off a bunch of mind-blowing HoloLens demos that are nowhere near ready for launch. A real product timeline for HoloLens would be the biggest Build news in years. More than anything, you should expect to spend a lot of time in the deep, deep developer weeds. There will probably be people coding on stage, and people clapping at people coding on stage. As the company preps for the next battles in tech—voice, AI, augmented reality, cloud computing—Microsoft’s executives will be in front of a crowd they desperately need, and in fact can’t win without. The team has to convince everyone that what’s coming next won’t be like it was with smartphones. It has to show developers, and the world, that what Microsoft does next is win. Go Back to Top.

Brian Jackson @brianjjackson Published: May 9th, 2017 Google Assistant has finished its Canadian French lessons and is ready to graduate to consumer chat app Allo, according to Google. The search giant announced the new language support for Allo on Tuesday, saying French will be available to all Android and iOS users in the next few days. With Google Assistant now supporting Canadian French language, its possible that Google Home, the voice-activated smart home assistant that is a competitor to Amazon’s Alexa, is closer to launch in Canada. Google Assistant shows off its French language skills in Allo. A Google representative at one of its BestBuy stores said that meeting language compliance standards were one reason that Google Home hasn’t been launched in Canada yet. A Toronto Star article on the topic of voice assistant availability in Canada also cited language as reason it’s not available in Canada. While Canadians have been able to order Google Home online and have it shipped here from various retailers, it hasn’t been officially supported yet. As we previously covered, many of Google’s localized features still seem to work fine for those Canadians braving the grey market space with the product. Related Google Home appears to be available in Canada Google Home hasn't been officially launched in Canada yet, but its availability on two major e-commerce sites suggest an announcement is imminent. While Google's competitor to the Amazon Alexa devices has been available Published on: April 30th, 2017 Brian Jackson @brianjjackson While Canada’s market is small compared to the U.S. and the U.K., where Google Home has been officially launched so far, it could be one strategic area where it could still claim dominant market share for voice assistant devices. According to eMarketer, Amazon controls 70 per cent of the voice-enabled speaker device market. The number of Americans using such a device at least once a month rose to 35.6 million in 2017, a 130 per cent increase over last year. Amazon’s early entry into the marketplace in 2014 has resulted in a dominant market position there, with Google Home trailing at 23.8 per cent of the market. Meanwhile Microsoft Corp. doesn’t want to miss out on the voice-first device market either. On Monday it announced with Harman International that its Cortana smart assistant will be embedded in the new Harman Kardon Invoke speaker. That device is to be released in the U.S. this Fall, with no stated timeline for a Canadian release. If Google Home could make it to the Canadian market ahead of Amazon and Microsoft, it’d stand a good chance of earning its foothold as Canucks’ voice-first device of choice.

Browse Full Report Visit – http://www.acutemarketreports.com/report/sea-change-series Scale is a vital part of the technology used to support next generation data centers.  The study is targeted to C-level executives that need to move quickly and surely to improve IT.  Automation of IT depends on understanding the business market opportunity from an independent perspective.  Vendors are smart but they are committed to the technology they are pushing, the Sea Change Series from WinterGreen Research is able to provide a perspective not available anywhere else.   Extreme scale is what brings enough pathways inside a Mega data center to create a non-blocking (CLOS) networked server architecture.  Non-blocking network architecture benefits the business because it permits launching thousands of virtual severs on demand at the application layer.  In this manner, innovation can be made to happen quickly.   Using a mega data center, DevOps and/or automated processes can request and deploy additional resource without backing the Dell truck up to the data center every week to provide on-demand capacity.  Automated deprovisioning handles freeing of surplus resources, while being virtual means not having stacks of surplus hardware to dispose of as underutilized capital assets. Modern data centers are organized into processing nodes that manage different applications at a layer above infrastructure.     Data is stored permanently and operated on in place.  These are the two technologies to check for when choosing a data center.  These architectural features provide economies of scale that greatly reduce the IT spend while offering better quality IT. Once scale is in place, then the economies of scale kick in.  When negotiating for cloud capability, managers need to check to see that sufficient multiple pathways are available to reach any node in a non-blocking manner.  Non-blocking architecture is more efficient than other IT infrastructure and supports better innovation for apps and smart digitization.  Not all cloud architectures offer this business benefit.   The Cloud 2.0 mega data center platform fabric technologies support the digital economy by creating scale with a network internal to the mega data center system image.  Without scale, there are not enough pathways inside the data center to enable elimination of bottlenecks.  Access to every node in the fabric, and multiple duplicate pathways to every node are needed to enable real time application connectivity.  With sufficient scale, if one pathway is blocked, there are enough other pathways to get to the desired node resources. To Get Complete Report @ http://www.acutemarketreports.com/report/sea-change-series The theme of this study is that scale matters. Scale can be implemented by IT, but the executive needs to understand that there is a difference between different technologies.  In a mega data center, the system is implemented as a fabric:  servers are linked to top of rack switches, which are made from merchant silicon chips, mostly Broadcom, some switch ASICs.  A pod of server racks are linked to each other through an edge aggregation switch.  A pod of server racks is based on the same ASICs as in the top of rack switches.   The importance of nonblocking architecture is compelling.  Aggregation switches are lashed together through a set of non-blocking spine switches.  All switches are based on the same chip.   This is precisely the way Facebook is building its own Wedge and 6-pack open switches– nine years after Google did it.  The amazing thing is that Facebook had not done this already.   The four superstar companies that are able to leverage IT to achieve growth, Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and the leader AWS all use Clos architecture.  What is significant is that systems have to hit a certain scale before Clos networks work   Clos networks are what work now for flexibility and supporting innovation in an affordable manner.  There is no dipping your toe in to try the system to see if it will work, it will not and then the IT says, “We tried that, we failed,” but what the executive needs to understand is that scale matters.  A little mega data center does not exist.  Only scale works.   Maybe scale is not the only answer, maybe in 20 years, Quantum computing will bring a new data center system, but for now, Clos architecture and scale dominate those IT centers that have the strongest growth engine.   Business leaders are challenged to move their enterprises to the next level of competition.  An effective digital business player, transformer, and disruptor position depends on the effectiveness of employing digital technologies and leveraging connected digital systems.  Organizational, operational, and business model innovation are needed to create ways of operating and growing the business using mega data center cloud technologies, systems are evolving.  It is a journey to achieve the connected enterprise, ultimately connecting all employees and a trillion connected devices. Many companies are using digital technology to create market disruption.  Amazon, Uber, Google, IBM, and Microsoft represent companies using effective disruptive strategic positioning.  As entire industries shift to the digital world, once buoyant companies are threatened with disappearing.  A digital transformation represents an approach that enables organizations to drive changes in their business models and ecosystems leveraging cloud computing, and not just hyperscale systems but leveraging mega data centers.  Just as robots make work more automated, so also cloud based communications systems implement the IoT digital connectivity transformation.   Disruption in the business markets represents major opportunity for vendors with cloud offerings.  This is part of a larger digital transformation, a digital approach to interconnecting everything that enables organizations to drive changes in their business models and ecosystems. Disruptive cloud systems are provided by Amazon (AWS), Microsoft, Google, and Facebook.  Data centers are in a class by themselves, they have functioning fully automatic, self-healing, networked mega datacenters that operate at fiber optic speeds to create a fabric that can access any node in any particular data center because there are multiple pathways to every node.   In this manner, they automate applications integration for any data in the mega data center.   By leveraging digital competencies, businesses can grow faster than they would otherwise.  A digital strategy, in conjunction with the appropriate unified communications solution permits the implementation of innovative communications services.  Digital connectivity with combined voice, video and file transfer can help organizations and their end users innovate and compete more effectively.  It is imperative that organizations have a digital communications strategy in place. This is an era where the distinction between the technologies and processes that businesses deploy is tightly linked.  Digital technology directly impacts customers and markets.  The boundary between internal operations of the enterprise and its external ecosystem is rapidly disappearing.  Customers, markets, competitors, partners, and regulators are inextricably linked. According to Susan Eustis, lead author of the team that prepared the study, “Mega data centers need to be understood by all senior executives whether they move in that direction or not.  These are the IT used by the fastest growing organizations Google, AWS, Microsoft, and Facebook.  There are 25 Sea Change Data Center study modules describing different aspects of the move to mega data centers.  The Scale module describes that it is not sufficient just to try certain cloud techniques.   “Scale is an essential aspect of the data center positioning for these leading companies.  These companies use Clos networks as their data center implementations.    This module addresses how and why scale in the mega data center is important.  The market shift to non-blocking network inside data center building means companies have to hit a certain scale before Clos networks work.”    WinterGreen Research is an independent research organization funded by the sale of market research studies all over the world and by the implementation of ROI models that are used to calculate the total cost of ownership of equipment, services, and software.  The company has 35 distributors worldwide, including Global Information Info Shop, Market Research.com, Research and Markets, electronics.ca, and Thompson Financial.  It conducts its business with integrity.   The increasingly global nature of science, technology and engineering is a reflection of the implementation of the globally integrated enterprise.  Customers trust wintergreen research to work alongside them to ensure the success of the participation in a particular market segment.

[Update: Confirmed] Google Assistant in Allo is learning Spanish and French Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/09 9:40am PDTMay 9, 2017 39 Plus 1 on G+ 68 Share on Facebook 86 Share on Twitter Total Shares193 Applications Google News Update 1: 2017/05/09 9:43am PDT Confirmed Google rolled out Assistant first in Allo, but it only supported English at launch. Google has been slowly but steadily adding more languages to the Allo version, as well as the voice-activated version on phones. The company has quietly rolled out support for Spanish and French to Assistant in Allo, but it looks to still be in beta. Google has not updated its list of officially supported Assistant languages yet. It currently includes English, German, Hindi, Japanese, and Portuguese. However, we've gotten multiple tips that Assistant has started popping up in conversations happening in French and Spanish. Specifically, users are seeing smart replies in those languages, and they can ask the Assistant bot to use those languages. This appears to be a very recent change. When asked if is spoke French or Spanish before, Assistant would say it was still learning. Now, it offers to set those as the default language in Allo. It sounds like the new languages are a bit rougher around the edges than the "official" ones. Google's head of conversational search, Behshad Behzadi has reportedly said Spanish will be working completely later this year. French might be on the same track, but at least there's progress. Update 1: 2017/05/09 9:43am PDT Confirmed These languages are now confirmed. Google's head of product for Allo has tweeted that Spanish is rolling out. As for French, Google's Canadian blog says French is a go. End of Update Thanks: Roberto and Mikaël Tags allo assistant Google languages subscribe ...

I live in Quebec and my main language is french Canada so I would appreciate interacting with the assistant in French but do not wish to change my default language to French. I want to keep my device setup in English same as I always had my windows in English or any other tech devices.. TVs etc. And depending who I text it can be in English or French so unless it can switch easily it's useless currently. When I tried speaking french it would come up with gibersih words. It works better to just switch my keyboard language and use the mic. That way I am positive it understands what I am saying the first time whether it's French or English. roberto.elena At least in Allo, you don't have to do any changes. My phone has English US as the main system language for UI and Spanish (Spain) as secondary language for speech recognition. In Allo I can chat via text with the Assistant in English, Spanish and German and it understands all 3 without a problem. What I find weird is that the Assistant always replies using the same language, until you explicitly tell it to change to another one, so if I tell it to speak Spanish, it will always reply in Spanish even if I ask questions in English or German. EowynCarter Saying the assistant "speak french" should do that from what i tested. Keept talking english (device language is french), And it wasn't understanding anything before, expecting me to speak english. Then, it got the french sentance alright. Misanthrope Unfortunately, it still speaks English after that. I am in the same situation and don't want to put my device in French. I want to keep it in English and speak French which is impossible EowynCarter Mmm. I can tell the assistant to speak English despite my phone being in French. But I'm using the allo assistant. Girouf Yeah I remember when I was testing the assistant ...although it was using "French France" then cause french Canada was still not a "learned language, it would never switch to French on the fly if I tried dictating an SMS. As I mentioned my system was set as English default and I want it to stay that way. The best solution for me was to turn everything off and just use the mic in the keyboard, switch my language from there and I could easily create a French or English sms that way with the first try. I haven't used it since though so I don't know how it is now if any better. Marc ¡Hola! Omelette du fromage. Arthur J. Means nothing Bru [971] Seems to be out of beta as Google France's facebook page is asking us to try Assistant in French. With no mention of beta. This is how i saw it roberto.elena I think Google still considers it a beta, even when there is no mention of it. Maybe I'm wrong, but the same happened when the Assistant was launched in English in Allo, before the Pixel launch. JD Has it learned french? Or has it learned Quebecois? Qbancelli Gracias, Google! Daniel D’Oleo ¡Por fin, ya habla español! 😃 Can confirm it works in Spanish (Spain/Latin America). https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/737f7c20cd24f2fc2ad7d8dee390630046978e4c2f455b8f88277ae7afa1fcbf.png Diego S. Spanish yesss Petr Kuchyňka And few commands in Czech (like setting an alarm etc.) Gerardo Sarabia this should come to the rest of the Assistant ecosystem, instead of being limited to Allo. Leonardo Baez Thanks for the heads up. I will change my language to spanish now. 👍 cvm And here, I'm trying to learn French... Stefan There is so much to do in the field of bi-lingual and tri-lingual users.. the OS should know when I chat with a specific person what language I use and the keyboard and Assistant should adopt to contacts across the device.. I use three languages on a daily basis and it's a nightmare to say the least. EnerJi Do you use Gboard as your keyboard? Supposedly it auto-detects languages automatically, but I haven't tested it extensively and I'm not sure whether it works well. Stefan yes nexus 5x with clean android and Gboard.. it seems to work every now and then, and only integrates with native android apps. my iPad seems to work better with remembering which language was previously used in the chat.. but that's iMessage ... siri is one language only and that's a BIG reason why I switched to android because google Now understood which language I was speaking in.. google assistant is FAR behind Rod Swiftkey is your friend. VAVAMk_2 ¿Cuándo podemos esperar que Google Allo aprenda soporte SMS además de nuevos idiomas? YuCMi Proof that Allo is still in beta... it's literally Google's testing ground.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 9 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman ACCUSTREAM RESEARCH ANALYSIS OF 85 BILLION DIGITAL VIDEO VIEWING HOURS ACROSS PLATFORMS IN 2016: AUDIENCES CHOOSE AND DISRUPTERS RULE SEASIDE, CA – 9 May, 2017 – Digital video clocked in at 85.6 billion total viewing hours in 2016, yielding a 14.6% time spent equivalency to its 24/7 linear counterpart. On a going forward basis, AccuStream Research will shift its digital video viewing analytics focus to increments/aggregates of time. Digital viewing hour tallies exclude OTT device access (i.e.; Apple TV, Amazon Fire TV, Google’s Chromecast device, Roku and Sling), as well as estimated duplicated/syndicated usage generated by media brands hosted primarily on Facebook, Twitter, YouTube or other audience platforms. Digital video viewing access hours enabled by OTT platforms are, however, also accounted for inside this research study and form an integral component to the multiple data-driven market share analytics models contained. This research report, Digital Video Viewing Hours 2016: Audiences Choose and Disrupters Rule, indicates one of the most valuable outcomes for any producer/programmer today, brand loyalty, is rotating in and around the orbits of internet giants, from Netflix, Facebook, Instagram and Amazon, to Google/YouTube. A key to this stage of the medium’s leap to recognition is a hefty slice of viewing audiences embrace the internet for video entertainment–despite shortcomings (i.e.; library depth/choice, fragmented device compatibility, ad insertion bottlenecks, balky navigation and connectivity issues)—because it delivers better value per dollar. Against the backdrop of declining multi-channel TV subscribers, the internet matches up well against linear TV counterparts, whether on price, ability to produce hit programming and offer slimmed down, customized programming packages that target more precisely viewer preferences to pay for what they actually use. There may be a recurring generational wave of acceptance regarding internet as a primary viewing platform, however. As younger audiences age and raise families, their entertainment choices may also evolve toward–or at least include–linear TV take-up, assuming a wholesale paradigm shift in way video programming is offered, priced and delivered doesn’t of necessity take hold over the next decade.   Internet pure-plays Netflix and YouTube, combined, capture a 53.7% share of viewing hours. By contrast, cross-platform programmer Hulu owns a 4.8% share. Internet-centric social audience platforms Facebook, Instagram, Snapchat and Twitter roll up another 24.7% share, with the remainder divvied up across some 200 internet sites, broadcast, cable TV and print brand extensions online. Analyzed another way, aligning all internet TV-like (i.e.; with long-form content) services, destinations and channels generated 50.7 billion hours of viewing in 2016, while social media added another 29.7 billion hours of combined viewing. While relevant advertiser concerns about what constitutes a “view,” or length of view (occurring anywhere from 3 seconds to hours), measurement in and buying against hours offers technology vendors (from media players to integrated viewing platforms) along with producers, publishers and advertising brands an opportunity to recast their solutions and unify their monetization formulae. When factoring in user activity and volume associated with social video delivery, monetization models must account for short-form nature of social platform UGC content that nevertheless drives big viewing share in the aggregate.   Ongoing advertiser concerns over objectionable content also remain across platforms, though the current share strength seen on social/audience services by has compelled publishers to migrate their digital presence inside those environments. Moreover, there are examples of publishers reducing destination-based brand building, and moving toward a syndication model where audience platforms form a primary point of ad-supported access for content outside of authenticated sign-in. Ad-supported hours equal 54% of the total, while subscription makes up a 46% share. That ratio could change over the next couple of years, perhaps significantly, if YouTube’s planned YouTube TV subscription video service (i.e.; live streaming TV) gets off the ground and offers an appealing option. YouTube is the largest ad-supported programmer in digital video, with a weighty 45.6% of total ad-supported viewing hours. This research package includes a full year 2016 database listing of sites, destinations, services, devices, total video views, minutes/hours of viewing, accesses by device type (desktop, mobile/tablet/OTT box). Also included in the annual percentage share of viewing hours by each service, site, destination and channel; those that are ad-supported, subscription based, internet only and cross-platform in nature.

Just yesterday we were rummaging through the files provided by Google developers on Github – and inside we found a bunch of bits and pieces that make for a rather awesome look at the future. Today with the help of HotFix Computer Repair maestro Kyle Bradshaw, we’ve got a path to the APK to get a feel for Armadillo on a smartphone. Inside this APK is a sort-of preview for a launcher. While the final build will be a full-fledged operating system, this file is meant to take advantage of its small size and act as a demonstration. The demonstration shows the first Alpha look at what Google’s next OS will be – codename Armadillo, codename Fuchsia. As discussed briefly yesterday, Fuchsia is the codename for the OS, while Armadillo is essentially the 1.0 name, not unlike Google’s dessert names for Android releases. Inside Fuchsia Armadillo is a user interface that’s based on Material Design. This UI has a center panel which shows a few basic details about the user supposedly using the device, the time and the date. The basic module includes the day, time, and location, as well as a battery level icon. Tapping that – or the icon of the user in the center – brings up additional info and options. Pulling up or down brings the user to either a set of Story panels or to a new edition of what’s essentially Google Assistant. This assistant, however, seems to be developed to make use of Google Now’s onscreen content detection powers. That was originally called Google Now On Tap. Mentioned throughout the software is bits and pieces for the developers to keep on developing. While some notes are entirely apparent, we need to go back to the original Git-hosted files to see the full expanse of what’s being built. If we want to get down into the guts, that is to say. For now, most users should be pleased to see this extremely basic and very alpha-build version of what’s to come. Here’s how to access the Fuchsia “OS” APK To download the APK – the most recent build compiled by Bradshaw, that is – head over to HotFixIt or direct your attention to the following APK Link (updated May 9th, 2017). This APK SHOULD be safe to use on most modern Android devices, but SlashGear takes no responsibility for any mishaps. The user downloading the file takes full responsibility for their actions from that point forward.

This time it’s a book recommendation and some brief ruminations on the topic of tech monopolies. The book is Move Fast and Break Things by Jon Taplin. (Description here, buy it here.) It’s a big look at the monopoly age but specifically the topic of tech monopolies, or what are properly called platform monopolies. Who are we talking about? Facebook, Amazon, Google and a few others. There’s a lot here but the big picture is how the rise of platform monopolies has led to a staggering concentration of wealth, corporate power and now political power. It is also the story of how platform monopolies have engineered the massive engrossment of wealth and income from creative industries like music, books, movies and journalism and redirected that money toward the tech sector. After I wrote this post about monopolies a week ago, I had a couple emails from people who completely agreed with me about monopolies like the telecoms but said it was misleading to apply the same terminology and conceptual framework to tech giants like Google. Here’s part of an email I received from TPM Reader SS … I think you need to make a distinction between different kinds of monopolies (and maybe use the term a bit more judiciously, since you seem to be calling big companies monopolies just because they are big). Your experience with cable companies results from one type of monopoly. Cable companies are monopolies because of the government. The government allowed, almost surely incorrectly, cable companies to obtain local monopolies by charging really high franchising fees and imposing substantial costs on companies that wanted to compete in the market. As a result, it was really only feasible to have one company per municipality, with the exception of some really large cities, where you get two competitors in the market. The same is true with electricity, water and until two decades ago, telephone service as well. Those monopolies are terrible, and they fight tooth and nail to maintain those regulatory barriers to stop competition from springing up against them. They fight innovative companies like Solar City – who started up with differentiated distribution methods as a way to sidestep these regulatory barriers. What was the result? The local electric monopolies did everything they could to stop Solar City from growing. The same is true in the taxi business, where taxi companies fought tooth and nail to stop ride sharing companies like Uber and Lyft from getting traction in their locations. The media, pre Internet, is largely the same. The FCC handed out licenses to operate and they didn’t hand out enough. It resulted in a very concentrated media market that nobody was happy with. Only after people found other ways to reach customers did the media market become competitive. Again, these are examples of monopolies created by government regulation, and I think it is one reason to be suspect of any government policy that attempts to regulate companies, rather than allow competition to stir up the market in a way that is favorable for consumers. Uber, Lyft, Solar City, Tesla, and others are successful because people LIKED what they had to offer because it was different and better than what these monopolies previously offered. When you have no competition, you don’t really need to have a product or service that people like if they need it (e.g., cable, phones, electricity). Same is true in media when Amazon and Netflix started distributing content (and original content), without the need to get FCC licensing. I don’t think it is fair to conflate those monopolies with companies like Amazon, Google, Apple and Facebook, which are not definitionally monopolies. Those companies are large because people like their services. If you don’t like an iPhone, go buy one from Samsung. If you don’t like Facebook, use Google Plus. If you don’t like Amazon, there are a host of places to purchase products on-line. If you don’t like Google, use Bing. The fact is, though, that people like their iPhones. They like Facebook. They like the ease of purchasing on Amazon. And Google returns better search results. They have high share of use because their products are better than the competition’s products. There is quite a bit here. There’s quite a bit that tracks with the evolution of legal scholarship on anti-trust over the last half century. But to respond, I should say first that while I deeply disagree with this distinction, there’s part of it that is true. Google is awesome. It completely revolutionized search and in some key ways created the Internet we know. (Taplin would say in a lot of bad ways, which is right. But in a lot of great ways too.) Gmail is pretty awesome. TPM uses various services from Google. We’re sort of like an assimilated borg. If you removed the implants we likely wouldn’t survive. Amazon has also kind of revolutionized my life. I have immediate access to a kabillion things and I can get them delivered to my apartment quickly. Facebook has brought me back in touch with people I probably never would have spoken to again for the rest of my life. With these three, I would say Google is the one I would point to as having vast monopoly power to a great degree because they originally invented amazing things. But none of this is incompatible with these companies being monopolies, even if they first came to their position ‘fairly.’ At least at the start. Where I see this most closely is in the business I work in: journalism and publishing. Here I’m most aware of it where we actually participate in it, with Google. Google particularly has built a vast concentration of power in the digital advertising business which I think few people outside of the advertising and publishing businesses even understand. Both Facebook and Google are working to deepen their hold on and their profit extraction from the publishing industry. I plan on writing more about this soon. Because I have a front row seat on it. For right now, check out Taplin’s book. Whatever the policy tools and correctives we think are appropriate or whether we should as a society take a hands off approach, you need to understand the reality of these companies’ power. Because it is a big, big part of the world we live in and it will get even bigger. [Disclosure: Taplin’s a friend of mine. But friends of mine write a lot of books. I seldom read non-history books and I almost never recommend them.] ABOUT THE AUTHOR Josh Marshall Follow @joshtpm Josh Marshall is editor and publisher of TalkingPointsMemo.com.

Windows 10: how to download and install See related  Windows 10 Anniversary Update review Best Windows 10 tips and tricks 15 Windows 10 problems - and how to fix them Windows 10 latest news 09/05/2017: Microsoft has rushed out an emergency patch to deal with a "crazy bad" security flaw that allowed hackers to exploit an auto-scan feature to upload malicious files to a machine via email. The issue was initially flagged three days ago by Natalie Silvanovich and Tavis Ormandy, researchers at Google's Project Zero, who discovered a bug within Microsoft's Malware Protection Engine. The service includes a security tool that automatically intercepts communications and scans its contents, which included malicious codes that were uploaded during the process. This meant that attackers were able to gain remote access to a user's PC by just sending them an email, whether they opened it or not. Malicious code could also be delivered through a website, or through a file uploaded to a location that is hosting user content, such as cloud storage, where the Protection Engine is able to scan its contents. Vulnerabilities inside the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine, which is a default security tool for Windows 8 and 10, are considered among the most severe possible, given the privilege escalations and accessibility the exploit provides. I think @natashenka and I just discovered the worst Windows remote code exec in recent memory. This is crazy bad. Report on the way. %uD83D%uDD25%uD83D%uDD25%uD83D%uDD25 — Tavis Ormandy (@taviso) May 6, 2017 In fact the vulnerability is so severe that Microsoft has warned other security tools are also at risk. Those identified include Windows Defender, Intune Endpoint Protection, Microsoft Security Essentials and Microsoft System Centre Endpoint Protection. "If the affected antimalware software has real-time protection turned on, the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine will scan files automatically, leading to exploitation of the vulnerability when the specially crafted file scanned," said Microsoft, in an advisory released on Monday. The latest update, which should download automatically through the Windows updater, "addresses the vulnerability by correcting the manner in which Microsoft Malware Protection Engine scans specially crafted files". System administrators will need to ensure their update management software is set to automatically approve Windows engine updates and ensure the new versions of the engine are being downloaded. 03/05/2017: Microsoft creates Windows 10 S for the classroom Microsoft yesterday announced a new version of Windows 10 designed specifically for schools - Windows 10 S. The tweaked operating sytem prioritises simplicity and performance, Redmond said, as the tech giant targets teachers and pupils with the OS and accompanying hardware. "Technology should make teachers' lives simpler and spark students' creativity, not detract from it," said Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella. "This is a top priority we are focused on at Microsoft - to deliver streamlined platforms, readily available to all classrooms, so teachers spend less time focused on technology and more time doing what they love: inspiring students." Windows 10 S can run full-fat Office 365, Word, Excel, PowerPoint, OneNote and other Microsoft apps, and the OS will spearhead Microsoft's fightback against Google's Chromebooks. Partners like Acer, ASUS, Dell, Fujitsu, HP, Samsung and Toshiba will build a range of Windows 10 S devices ranging in price from Windows Ink-friendly "affordable" machines, to more high-end ones. Microsoft's Edge browser will support Windows Ink so pupils can make notes directly on web pages they can share with classmates. In fact, Microsoft will try to entice schools away from Google's rival G-Suite and its range of Chromebooks with partners' cheap Windows 10 PCs, starting at $189, and the offer of a free upgrade to Windows 10 S for any existing Windows Pro PC. Schools can also get a free one-year subscription to Minecraft: Education Edition for new Windows 10 education PCs, and free Office 365 for Education with Microsoft Teams, the company's new collaboration tool. A new Surface Laptop will be powered by Windows 10 S, aimed at university students and available for pre-order from today in the UK. It will release on 15 June with a price of $999. 28/04/2017: Microsoft has advised people not to manually download and install the Creators Update just yet, because doing so could invite unsolved issues onto your PC. Redmond typically blocks automatic updates to certain devices if it knows the OS update will introduce issues onto that device. When the issue is fixed, Microsoft will re-issue the update, notifying user it's ready to be downloaded. However, when users manually update their devices using the software download site, they bypass this block, so users will be affected with any reported problems. As a result Microsoft has asked Windows 10 users not to manually download Creators Update. The notification was released by Microsoft after it was discovered PCs using a specific Broadcom radio had issues with Bluetooth connectivity. As a result of users flagging the issue, Microsoft withdrew the update, offered people advice for troubleshooting the issue and blocked anyone else using the same device from installing the update. John Cable, director of program management of Windows Servicing and Delivery, said: "During the time it takes to address an issue, we want to limit the number of customers exposed to that issue. "Blocking availability of the update to devices we know will experience issues is a key aspect of our controlled rollout approach. We continue to recommend (unless you're an advanced user who is prepared to work through some issues) that you wait until the Windows 10 Creators Update is automatically offered to you." He encouraged Creators Update users to keep reporting issues so the company can work on fixes where necessary. 27/04/2017: Just a week after the Windows 10 Creators Update rolling out to machines across the world, it's already running on 10% of Windows 10 devices, according to statistic monitoring service AdDuplex. The majority of Windows 10 computers (82.1%) are still running the Anniversary update though, while 6% are using version 1511 and 1.8% are still using the original RTM release of the platform, which will stop being supported from 9 May. AdDuplex collected information from 5,000 Windows 10 apps running the AdDuplex SDK v.2 and higher on 24 April. The highest adoption of Windows 10 Creators update has been on Microsoft and MSI hardware, with around 20% of users installing the most up to date version of the operating system. Sony and ASUS follow behind with around 10% of their users adopting the Creators Update, while Toshiba's customers are the furthest behind. The Windows 10 Creators Update was due to start rolling out to mobile devices yesterday and - although it will be a staged update (with four out of the top 10 devices not due to get it at all) - it would seem some devices received it early. The Lumia 640 accounts for 13.3% of devices running the update, with more than 11% share going to the Lumia 550, Lumia 535, Lumia 650 and Lumia 640 XL. Only 60% of devices running Windows 10 will be able to take advantage of the Creators Update, although the remaining 40% will be able to do so, but without Microsoft's support and only if they opt in to the Release Preview, AdDuplex found. A third of Surface Books are running the Creators Update, while a quarter of Surface Pro 4 users have installed it. Those using older Microsoft devices are slower to upgrade, AdDuplex said. 25/04/2017: The vast majority of businesses are expected to have started their Windows 10 migrations by the end of 2017, according to Gartner. The analyst house's survey of 1,014 businesses from six countries including the UK and US found that 85% will have started deploying Microsoft's new operating system by the end of the year, with 44% citing the driver as the security improvements 10 offers, and 38% the cloud integration capabilities. Ranjit Atwal, research director at Gartner, said: "Organisations recognise the need to move to Windows 10, and the total time to both evaluate and deploy Windows 10 has shortened from 23 months to 21 months between surveys that Gartner did during 2015 and 2016". He added that the remainder of large businesses have delayed upgrading until 2018. "This likely reflects the transition of legacy applications to Windows 10 or replacing those legacy applications before Windows 10 migration takes place," he said. Gartner principal research analyst Meike Escherich said: "Respondents' device buying intentions have significantly increased as organisations saw third- and fourth-generation products optimised for Windows 10 with longer battery life, touchscreens and other Windows 10 features. The intention to purchase convertible notebooks increased as organisations shifted from the testing and pilot phases into the buying and deployment phases." Windows 10 release date Windows 10 started to roll out to consumers on 29 July 2015. The news of a July release came as little surprise to Microsoft watchers, as the company had stated the release would come in summer 2015, and AMD's CEO Lisa Su tipped the world off to a July launch thanks to a slip of the tongue during an earnings call in April that year. The RTM build was delivered to OEM partners to image new devices on 15 July, and another build is being delivered to retailers to upgrade unsold devices currently running Windows 8.1. The first end users to get the finished version of the product were the five million Windows 10 Insiders using the operating system in a preview. Following that, Redmond began offering the upgrade to Windows 7, 8 and 8.1 users. One year after the initial launch of Windows 10, Microsoft rolled out the Anniversary Update, which introduced useful tweaks but was a little light on new features. You can read our full review of the Windows 10 Anniversary Update here. Volume licensing customers are able to download Windows 10 Enterprise and Windows 10 Education from the Volume Licensing Service Center (VLSC). System requirements for Windows 10 can be found here. Windows 10 different versions As with its predecessors, Windows 10 is available in various different versions: Windows 10 Home, Windows 10 Mobile, Windows 10 Pro, Windows 10 Enterprise, Windows 10 Education and Windows 10 Mobile Enterprise. Windows 10 Home is the standard edition of Windows for consumer PCs, tablets and hybrids such as the Surface 3 and upcoming Surface Pro 4. This version of the OS features personal assistant Cortana, Edge browser, Continuum and Windows Hello facial recognition, as well as standard Universal Apps like Mail, Calendar, Photos and Maps. Windows 10 Mobile, which had until now been known as Windows 10 for Phones, "is designed to deliver the best user experience on ... smartphones and small tablets", according to Microsoft. It has many of the same features as Windows 10 Home, although Continuum is only available on large mobile devices. Windows 10 Pro is aimed at small businesses and includes all the features of Windows 10 Home plus device and app management, data protection services, and support for remote and mobile working.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Hardware Image Source: Apple Bloomberg dishes new details on Apple’s unreleased Siri speaker Yoni Heisler @edibleapple May 9th, 2017 at 1:22 PM Share Tweet A few years ago, the smart speaker market was essentially non-existent. These days, with Amazon’s Echo lineup leading the charge, competition in the smart speaker space is becoming incredibly fierce. Not only does Google have an Echo competitor dubbed Google Home, but rumor has it that Apple is planning to roll out an Echo competitor of its own later this year. While nothing is set in stone just yet, reputable Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo — who has the best track record in the business with respect to Apple rumors — recently said that Apple may introduce its Siri-based Echo rival in just three weeks at WWDC. Don't Miss: Google has a new OS that may one day kill Android, and this is your first look at it Recently, Apple executive Phil Schiller effectively said that he finds current smart speakers uninspiring because they don’t have a display, strongly suggesting that Apple’s own Siri-based hardware would be differeint. Interestingly enough, Amazon earlier today rendered Schiller’s comments moot when it introduced a new Echo device with a touchscreen that it calls the the Echo Show. In the wake of Amazon introducing the Echo Show, Bloomberg relays that the Echo Show will allow users to play music from a number of streaming services, including Spotify and Pandora. Conspicuously absent, however, is support for Apple Music, an omission that not surprisingly has more to do with Apple than with Amazon. To this point, Amazon’s Dave Limp said that while Amazon would love to feature streaming support for Apple Music, Apple — at least for now — isn’t interested in opening up its music service to third-parties. That said, we can only hope that Apple Music’s absence from all things Echo is only temporary, especially amid reports that Apple and Amazon finally reached a deal to bring Amazon Video to Apple TV. Still, if Apple is going head to head with Amazon in the smart speaker space, Apple may reasonably opt to keep Apple Music off of competing devices. Another interesting tidbit is that Apple’s Siri-based Echo competitor may not necessarily feature a display. While Schiller seemed to suggest that a smart speaker without a display is nothing worth getting excited about, Bloomberg notes that it’s not yet a guarantee. Apple employees have been testing a device at home for several months, according to people familiar with the matter. While marketing chief Phil Schiller recently talked up the benefits of having a screen on a voice-activated device, it’s not clear whether the Apple version will in fact have one. With WWDC now less than a month away, the good news is that we presumably won’t have to wait too long to see what Apple has in store for us.

Google's "Fuchsia" operating system is taking shape with a new design Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/08 10:01am PDTMay 8, 2017 36 Plus 1 on G+ 285 Share on Facebook 93 Share on Twitter Total Shares414 Development Google News We first talked about Fuchsia, a new operating system being developed at Google, back in August (in fact, it was my first post here). At the time, there wasn't much to get excited about besides the potential - it only had a command-line interface. Now the project has a snazzy new, but clearly unfinished, interface. Summary of Fuchsia First, it's worth going over exactly what Fuchsia is, because it's been quite a while since we talked about it. As opposed to all of Google's other OSes, such as Android and Chrome OS, Fuchsia uses the company's new 'Magenta' kernel instead of Linux. According to the project's documentation, Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Magenta's apps and the system interface are written with Google's Flutter SDK, which was initially designed to create cross-platform apps for iOS and Android. Flutter applications are written in Dart, the company's home-grown programming language. All of the system and apps are rendered by 'Escher,' which uses OpenGL or Vulkan to display everything. The 'Armadillo' interface So, on to the new stuff. Fuchsia's system UI has a new name - 'Armadillo.' Ars Technica was able to compile Armadillo into an Android APK, since it is written with the above-mentioned Flutter SDK. The interface doesn't really do anything besides looking pretty, but it does give us an idea of what the finished product could look like. The home screen is a vertical list, with a profile picture, the time, and a battery indicator in the center. Tapping the profile picture brings up something similar to Android's Quick Settings, with toggles for auto-rotate, do not disturb, Airplane Mode, and so on. Above the profile picture is the 'Story,' which the documentation describes as "a set of apps and/or modules that work together for the user to achieve a goal." Currently, this works similarly to Android's Recents screen. Users will also be able to combine stories into a 'Story Cluster.' This is what dragging a Story card into split-screen looks like. Dragging a Story card onto another one triggers a split-screen mode. The user can split an app 50/50 vertically or horizontally, drag in another app for a 33/33/33 split, or even have a tab bar appear for using all the open apps in full-screen. You can even have two apps split vertically next to two other split apps, seen below. This is far more flexible than Android's current multi-tasking functionality, but whether or not it will stay this way is uncertain. Below the profile picture is a panel resembling Google Now, with a placeholder search bar and suggestion cards. Armadillo's documentation says, "a suggestion is a representation of an action the user can take to augment an existing story or to start a new one. [The] suggestion contains enough information to create the visual representation of that concept." So maybe they will work more like an app launcher? It's hard to tell at this point. The Google Now panel, showing Fuchsia's keyboard. Keep in mind that all of this is subject to change, as the Armadillo interface (and the rest of Fuchsia OS) is still under heavy development. It's also hard to tell what Google's plans are for the operating system. Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware, or will it some day replace Android altogether? We'll have to wait and see.

Suicide_Note Because Google can. Corbin Davenport Ron from Ars Technica put it best: "Fuchsia really seems like a project that asks 'how would we design Android today, if we could start over?' It's a brand-new, Google-developed kernel running a brand-new, Google-developed SDK that uses a brand-new, Google-developed programming language and it's all geared to run Google's Material Design interface as quickly as possible. Google gets to dump Linux and the GPL, it can dump Java and the problems it caused with Oracle, and Google can basically insulate itself from all of Android's upstream projects and bring all the development in-house. Doing such a thing on the scale of Android today would be a massive project." makapav Would it still be open source? Also, what would happen to all the existing APKs? Corbin Davenport Fuchisa is completely open source right now. As for running Android apps, maybe Google will add some kind of stop-gap compatibility layer for running Android apps, like Chrome OS has. destinyhud read the article Suicide_Note Perhaps instead of replacing Android, this will *become* Android, as in Android P or Q? Or be the merger of Android/Chrome? m477 I could see that as Android 10. Definitely too early for P. morteum I wonder if the reason it is called "Armadillo" is because they're starting from A again, but this time they're using animals instead of desserts. Christopher Bement I think it's a smart plan, based on the guess that there's more animals to pick from in the world than tasty desserts. teolinux Ubuntu docet Paul "Tasty treats," not necessarily desserts. That said, armadillos could be a tasty treat. I won't judge. MJ I have heard desserts and candy used before which are wrong but "tasty treats" is a new one for me. To be more accurate, Android names are actually all confectionery foods. A "tasty treat" could be a slice of pizza (aka Android S). LOL Randy Gindy Armadillo is the name of the UI not the OS build itself. Matt74UK Smooth on the inside, crunchy on the outside. Armadillo ! (a few UK people of a certain age may get that). Russell Brown That bloke's a nutter... Edit: nope, that was Dime Bar. :( Nomaan Shouldnt we compare armadillo to holo/material and not to dessert names? Or am i missing something. morteum I don't think so, those are design languages and while this is a redesign of layout and function, it is still pretty much using Material Design. I could be wrong but I don't think this is closer to a build version. John Doe Idk this is a whole new OS with a new kernel, I doubt this will be done with an OTA update for Android. Mantas Pakėnas Even nowadays, some of Android's new functionality cannot be done via OTA updates (like dual system partitions, forced encryption I believe, etc). To make a completely hard cut sometime when this is ready, and if it's meant to replace Android, is not completely unimaginable. As is updating via OTA. If apple was able to change their file system via OTA, I don't see why changing most of the parts would not be possible. However, nobody aside from Google would do it, almost guaranteed :) Suicide_Note It could likely be done for Pixel devices, and possibly for future devices released after this new version of the OS rolls out. Adrian Meredith quite possibly, after all there no reason it couldn't also run android apps jonathan What they need to do is make this googles very own os for their pixel line and leave android for the oems Suicide_Note Not a chance. To much name recognition with Android for Google to drop it in favor of something else specific to the Pixel lineup. Dallas King Android Z confirmed! Suicide_Note More like Android A for Armadillo. m477 APK plz (no, really, I want a compiled apk the demo) Maxwell “Max” Weinbach https://github.com/fuchsia-mirror/sysui MJ Your link wasn't what the OP asked for... Maxwell “Max” Weinbach the only way to get the APK is to compile it yourself, so I linked to the Github page to a place to download the files to compile. The closest they will get. MJ Than you should have replied there is no known APK or not at all. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach It does not matter that much. I am building the APK right now. Once it is done I will post it. Here is the link on how to compile it. http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo MJ Don't waste your time... They updated that article with an download of the APK. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach thanks. they just did that. I still compiled it myself though. I will try to get more out of it while I have the Sysui downloaded. Michel R. https://www.androidfilehost.com/?w=files&flid=178684 there you go MJ http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo Latex beats nudity More of Proprietary code ? No thank you, we already had enough with this Pixel crud. I hope this OS dies quicker or become a chromebook OS. m477 It's open source. Latex beats nudity It's OSS but just like Android It'll be more heavily dependent on the google APIs to make it work. Look at the Pixel SysUI, Just being OSS doesn't make it open source... It's Google's OS not a Linux Based one. If this is going to replace Android It's doomsday on multiple levels. destinyhud billions of people dont care if its running linux kernel or not. maybe very few like u might. do iphone users care why kernel it runs. none of them care. u r just noise tbh Latex beats nudity Billions of people don't code. You are being a kool-aid joke tbh. destinyhud exaclt only few code and even on that few many dont care if it runs linux or not. look at iphone there are more dev there and yet they dont care for kernel. u r delusional in ur own world m477 Android it's already been on a Google-dependent road for years. I don't think this is going to change either way. An Angry Chihuahua https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/magenta/+/master/docs/getting_started.md heres the source code. do some research my dude WitnessG Imagining this running on a Google made processor is exciting. Badouken If this was the OS for the Pixel 2 alongside a Google made processor I think id cry! WitnessG Yeah I don't see this coming out for at least another 2-3 years. Badouken Indeed, but we can dream! ha Suicide_Note Maybe the Pixel 3 or 4 will see the dream become reality. Suicide_Note I'm betting this is what we'll see in a couple years time. As another commenter stated, starting with Armadillo could be Google's way of starting from the beginning (letter A codename), since there's more animal babes to use for each letter than there are dessert names to use.

Nomaan Armadillo should be compared to holo/material and not to dessert names. nachofrand What makes you think Google would be good at making SoCs? They're a software company and don't have the hardware expertise for hardcore ASIC development like that. Granted they can hire people, but in the end, does it matter? They're going to use ARM either way. UnlikeABoss Google fanboyism. The same reason he's excited over a brand new OS. He knows absolutely nothing about it, short of the fact that it will create more fragmentation not only in the OS space, but also the kernel space. So all we know are negative things so far. This is what we call exciting now is it? Why? Just because Google is doing it? If Microsoft made this exact same announcement, would we all be excited? Oh dear. Zsolt V No, because essentially everybody loathes Microsoft. Almost nobody's life would be worse if Microsoft vanished. marcusmarcus2 Don't they design and build their own servers to use for all their websites? Seems like those hardware work well for them. Sergii Pylypenko It's one thing to assemble the server using off-the-shelf components, or even to order a custom motherboard. It's a very different thing to design and manufacture your own chips. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying it is the same, just that they are not only software experts. Them designing and building the servers show they do have hardware expertise that could assist them in doing the same to chips. Zsolt V Except Google's servers are not assembled from off the shelf components. Haven't been for a few years now. Roy What about TPU? Owais Lone They DO design their own chips as well especially chips meant to run specialized AI (tensoflow) code Adrian Vovk Samsung Exynos devices are faster than Snapdragon, iPhones seem underpowered but are extremely snappy, etc. The point is that making both the software and hardware leads to a very fast ecosystem. Also, Google are making the TPU for neural networks nachofrand Yes, as expected. Exynos is faster than Snapdragon on the Galaxy phones, but put an Exynos in another phone...oh wait, you can't. That's the whole entire point. Snapdragon SoCs are general purpose SoCs and can be used for a multitude of phones so they're not custom tuned to every phone individually. Exynos have very specific power rails and the chip is made specifically for that phone. The thing is, sure this is better, but it's marginal and hardly worth talking about. They both use the same ARM architecture so performance gains are pretty negligible. Besides that, this is how Samsung makes money....off of device sales. Google doesn't make money that way. That isn't their business model so at this point it doesn't make sense for them to build their own SoCs when they could just work closer with hardware companies. They make their own TPUs because it aligns with their business model. Adrian Vovk The instruction set doesn't really matter? I can have a 6700k and a 6500k and the 6700k will perform much better even though they are both amd64. With what Google is doing with the Pixels (still as snappy as day one here) I'm pretty sure they can optimize it further than Samsung does. They have made it run smoother in some cases on a chip that they didn't manufacture. If they made their own chip it would allow them many freedoms that they otherwise don't have = easier design of the device. I brought up the TPUs because that is experience in chip manufacturing Jason What makes you say iPhones are under powered ? Apples chips are some of the fastest around and are extremely powerful. Adrian Vovk Specs wise. They have much worse specs on paper and it would lead to a slower experience, except Apple can optimize it because they make both the chip and the OS SHunter On their Own hardware running their software in their own eco system. You cant really fairly compare it to anything else. Stephen Sharp They could use Risc-V and have to pay to license absolutely nothing, while being able to make processors purpose built for their OS Randy Gindy That would be an interesting move. Stephen Sharp Indeed, I really want Risc-V to succeed as an open ISA nachofrand They could. But in my opinion, it's unlikely. Google isn't trying to compete with Samsung and Apple in device sales and that isn't their business model. People using their services so they can show ads is their business model. It doesn't make sense for Google to make their own SoC when others are already doing a good job. Plus, if they went to RISC-V then what? What about the modem? They have to buy a standalone modem from Qualcomm or Intel. Now you have to hire system integration and test engineers to make sure the modem is working with your SoC. Oh and then you need a whole firmware team to control the modem. At that point, buy a full blown SoC with the modem on chip. Stephen Sharp Eh you lost me at "Pixel phone" and all the other hardware they sell. Google also is a Platinum member of the Risc-V foundation, and if there is a direction they are going, more control or less control, I would guess it's "more". But that's just a guess nachofrand Hardware isn't even close to the same thing as asic development. IC design is a different world. Granted they do some custom hardware, but SoCs are a much much larger feat. It's still a possibility they do so, but it doesn't make sense with their current business model imo. Randy Gindy He said nothing about ASIC he is talking about RISC-V Randy Gindy I disagree with you completely. They are penetrating the IoT market, auto market, healthcare, phones, robotics, self driving, networking, etc. Them making in house chips could really benefit every project they have. Also building an OS from the ground up to work with in house chips would be smart. Look at Apple as an example. They also may let manufacturers to use the designs. If Android One isn't evidence for them to want to standardize their platforms I don't know what is. Captain On! 1 - Google has stated that they're going to make their own silicon for the Pixels in time. 2 - Google actually owns/operates the world's most powerful quantum computer. They know how to make chips. Randy Gindy That quantum computer was built by DWave though Angel I read (somewhere don’t remember) that they have three different quantum computers systems. One from DWave and two home-produced. From those two, one was made by engineers and not that disimilar from DWave in its operations. The other was made by physicists and uses a different approach. nachofrand 1. I could be wrong, but I've only read that they plan on working closer with chip manufacturers. 2. Google didn't make that computer. Even if they did, quantum is so different those skills don't even translate. Romario Maxwell Google made their own custom ASIC called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) for their AI/Machine Learning needs on their cloud platform. See https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/05/Google-supercharges-machine-learning-tasks-with-custom-chip.html and https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/04/quantifying-the-performance-of-the-TPU-our-first-machine-learning-chip.html nachofrand Sure, although a TPU is just an accelerator. Think of it as the hexagon DSP inside of the Snapdragon SoC. That's like 1/10 of the entire chip. SoC design is much larger. Timothy Vreeland How many examples of hardware design do people have to point out before you stop? Sure the hardware they worked on previously isn't exactly the same... But before they started the hardware they are currently working on, they worked on previous hardware that wasn't the same as what they are doing now. They have shown they are competent in designing many kinds of hardware. Or do you suggest a company can only build one kind of hardware and nothing else for all eternity? How did Samsung make it's current in-house chips? Did they go to ARM college? Have they been making ARM chips since the dawn of time? No. They put together some teams and got to work, so stop blabbing and being negative. sweenish Their AI that finally beat the world's top Go players was running on custom Google chips. It's not like they don't know how. theProffer They have enough liquid assets to do whatever they want, abandon it, and then do it again without even noticing they spent the money. (Which is actually the source of a few of their problems, I think.) Matt Is that why they gave up on fiber? Pixelexel Imagine a Google Pixel with a Google made processor, with Fuschia, with Project Fi with Google WiFi powered by Google fiber. If I'd have this, my life would be complete. Owais Lone and all our data with it :( needa At least it is only one company getting it. Iamsecond Ha, no. A Google processor? Supported for 18 months, then replaced with a new processor that performs half as well (but has stickers.) Does not fully process Android code, because at Google one hand doesn't even know the other hand is there, let alone talk to it. Has 20 cores (only 2 enabled outside US for 'reasons.') Has a dedicated co-processor to enable ads in every app, even those that previously didn't have them. the.cyber.trekker I spit my coffee out on my monitor reading this!! ROFLMFAO! Jason Google can't even get a phone out the door without issues and you want them to make the chips too...lol. I'll pass. UnlikeABoss "In house kernel instead of Linux". Yeah, hopefully this dies in a thousand pits of fire. "Hey Linux guys, you know how you've helped us make billions over the years with a free open source kernel? Well, we were just using you to get the "nerd" userbase. Now we own the market thanks to you guys promoting its use of Linux, we will gradually phase you out." .... m477 I hope not. Linux is not really a kernel made with smartphone in minds. I don't care for being a fan of a kernel over another. UnlikeABoss Yeah. I'd much rather use a brand new untested kernel (and all the teething issues that will come with it) in my smartphone than a mature, stable one that's hacked on by hundreds and thousands of people every month. I mean, it's just a smartphone, we don't need it to be a secure environment, right? Let's just make a nice obscure kernel that no one else will use, and just say "but but it's open source!!! love us because we are Google kk". ... ihsan ışık I'm sorry but it just looks like you are a huge Linux fan and are just against change to me. UnlikeABoss Looks can be deceiving. If you're going to fling around the Linux fanboy term, i'll fling around the Google fanboy term, and that will surely be a nice constructive argument that we will both want to continue. m477 So, in 10 years we should still be using an unoptimised kernel like Linux, because anything newer is, well, newer? UnlikeABoss Yeah, because Linux hasn't changed at all in 10 years... m477 Yes, it changed a lot, and it still has many of the same problems, which are intrinsically bound to its structure. It's not a kernel well suited for mobile devices. UnlikeABoss You think the solution is to throw it out the window and start from scratch? I disagree. I'd much rather continue improving the Linux kernel, simply because of all the eyes it will always have on its code. jonathan Play nice ladies lol m477 With this mentality we wouldn't have Linux at all. Why start anything, while we can continue this other thing which purpose was completely different? A mircokenel is more well suited than a monolitic kernel to a mobile devices, both in terms of performance and security. No matter how much you improve Linux, it will never be a microkernel. UnlikeABoss Smartphones don't need a micro kernel in 2017. You could make that argument 7 years ago. Linux can be compiled with the required drivers just like it always could. m477 I made that argument 7 years ago. They always needed something different from Linux. The fact that specific, even proprietary drivers have to be integrated in the kernel (since Android lacks an abstraction layer) is on of the problems of the interaction Android-Linux. destinyhud why havent the nerds made linux on pc's a bigger market share if they were the one who made android a global leader UnlikeABoss No nerd is promoting Linux on the desktop. All social media used to be full of people promoting Android over iOS, these days there's no need to. destinyhud why havent they promoted desktop?? just wondering why they did for android but not for desktop.. linux on desktop was an underdog for decades. android was not popular because of kernal. android became popular because it was opensource and was the only viable competition to ios. people dont care what kernel it runs. UnlikeABoss No nerd worth their salt would promote an environment that would be a downgrade from Windows. Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time, it had a very equal playing field. There's a difference between promoting a good solid FOSS kernel where possible, and promoting an agenda. m477 Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time By this, I get that you never used Android and iOS side by side in 2009-10. UnlikeABoss You clearly value different things. The hackability alone made it an upgrade through its lifetime. m477 The same can be said for GNU/Linux on desktop. UnlikeABoss No it can't, because hackability =/= app availability. i.e. The hackability on Linux desktop doesn't make it win over it's lack of apps, where that isn't an issue on Android. m477 App availability was horrible in the early days, compared to iOS. Even Symbian had more apps. UnlikeABoss That was fine since the early days didn't consist of using your smartphone for very much, due to under powered hardware. Techies didn't go around saying "use iOS because we can all take selfies and stick filters on it". m477 iOS devices didn't have front cameras until mid 2010. The system was better, faster, smoother, the interface was coesive, there were many more apps, and the jailbreak community, to address the techie audience you like to go on about so much, was very, very good. There were tweaks and modifications that even the wildest Android custom ROM didn't have at the time. Android was objectively a downgrade, as much as Linux was on desktop. UnlikeABoss Calling jailbraik an advantage over a FOSS OS is pretty hilarious. iOS wasn't popular because it was better, it was popular because of the amount of people getting their advice from paid employees in store. "Buy iOS so we get a commission". m477 iPhone was more popular for various reasons: marketing, having 2 years of advantage, and, yes, more marketing. But it was also better than Android, as an OS. What benefit did Android bring, with it being opensource, compared to iOS, even to a "techie"? The dev community was laughable in the early days. Why GNU/Linux on desktop was not promoted by "techies" (which is false) and Android was, even if their shortcomings were identical? destinyhud u live in a dream world. even most dev dont care about kernel. what they care about the dev platform. I am a dev and i dont care for the kernel UnlikeABoss If you're talking from the perspective of an app developer then ofcourse you don't care about the kernel, you care about which platform will make you the most money... destinyhud exactly. no one care what kernel it runs.. all dev care is what platform make money. so who is this nerd who care about kernel if most dont care about the kernel.. yeah very very few.. infact rare like u UnlikeABoss Techie == Technology Enthusiast. You can sit here and tell me that you would use the best dev environment all you want but the truth is if the iOS dev environment was awful you'd still suck it up and use it to make your money. I'm not sure how you can class yourself as an enthusiast at that point. destinyhud ever wonder why no one is up voting u and upvoting many of my comments? because what u say is BS. its that simple. I am up for ditching outdated linux if the new kernal is modern and build for modern devices. most dont care for this very few techies.. i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die.. UnlikeABoss "Ever wonder why Google fanboys upvote pro Google content and not anti-Google content?" No, no I don't wonder that. How dare someone critique a pointless change by Google, causing unnecessary fragmentation. Burn them! destinyhud u must be new here.. look at anti google comments here when they make stupid changes but if they make welcome changes people tend to agree UnlikeABoss No, I've been here a long time and made many anti-Google comments as well as pro-Google. No one in the right mind would cheer on kernel fragmentation other than those that think Google can do no wrong. destinyhud open up ur comments history and let me see if u made pro google comments. i have a feeling u r a troll UnlikeABoss Yeah, this discussion is going no where. You are not the authority here and the idea that you want to browse my history to make sure I fall in line is creepy as hell. Bye. destinyhud lol i see u dont want to open ur comments history. obvious troll m477 outdated linux i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die Woah, wait a second here. Linux is not outdated, and its death would be terrible for everyone. It's just that it's not the most apt kernel for a mobile device. destinyhud maybe not outdated but not the right fit for mobile devices. destinyhud android sucked when compared to ios.. it was a downgrade compared to ios. why did dev promote android and not desktop linux? u reasoning dont even make sense. UnlikeABoss No, it wasn't a downgrade. destinyhud yes, it was back in android initial release. iOS was better and much more polished at that time. but things changed now. UnlikeABoss "Polished" is not a factor that is used to judge a better OS. There are Linux environments that are much more polished than Windows 10, but that doesn't make desktop Linux better. destinyhud it was both polished and runs better than android at that time. polished was not the only one. it was also polished. android only got better later.. i have used android at that time and it sucked big time. UnlikeABoss You are using today's standards to judge it. If you do that, they both sucked. It worked perfectly fine for the basic things people were using it for at the time. destinyhud they both sucked at that time but android sucked more than iOS at that time. SVem26 I like to think I am in the nerd userbase and I don't care what kernel is used.. can you help me understand why it matters? UnlikeABoss Do you want a brand new obscure kernel in thing that holds most of your sensitive details? TipTop I don't want something that dates back to 90s, is full of zero-days and horrible code contributed by nobodies. UnlikeABoss The idea that it is full of zero days is hilarious. You do realize that the majority of Linux exploits are local, right? Unlike Windows. Yes there is obviously code from the 90s, but very, very little of it. Not to mention that age is not a factor in deciding bad code. The idea that old code is bad code shows your inexperience. By that standard, should we dismiss Chrome because of all the exploits being found in code that was written when it first started? Are we going to create brand new software every few years to purge "old code"? Do you have any idea whatsoever how much Linux has actually changed? Do you have any idea how much of this change is because it's considered a "universal" kernel everyone can use and is focusing on? Do you really think splitting the community over onto another kernel will increase security for either of those kernels? There's a little something called code maturity. There's a reason Microsoft has way less exploits in its kernel today than 10 years ago. They didn't write a new kernel from scratch. TipTop But it is. You can be in denial all you want. Linux is the OS that is used by botnets for DDoSing websites not Windows. UnlikeABoss No sorry, come back to reality. Botnets consist of all types of OS, including Linux ofc. It is not the majority of bots in a botnet, that statement alone shows how clueless you are. Also, do you understand what Linux is? It's a kernel. The majority of Linux hosts in a botnet have been hacked through exploits in outdated software, not the kernel. The same cannot be said for Windows. Again, read the statistics for the severity of Linux exploits versus Windows. More exploits are found in Linux overall because it is open source, however, that doesn't make it worse. More critical and high severity exploits are found in Windows. That speaks a lot for the secure design of Linux. Hopefully you'll do some reading and learn. Sir_Brizz All OSes are full of vulnerabilities and horrible code written by nobodies. If that is your requirement then you must have gone full luddite by now. TipTop Windows is written by paid professionals and has QA/QC. Linux is written by fat nerds for free and has no quality control but nice try. Don't gve me the top contributors crap. Sir_Brizz Yes, tell me again how many zero day vulnerabilities are found in Windows and how long they take to get fixed. Even worse, tell me that with macOS. Being paid doesn't guarantee quality, just as being unpaid doesn't guarantee garbage. Windows and macOS have some of the crappiest insecure code. And there is nothing special about having QA or being paid to write code. Some of the worst programmers I have ever met worked at places like Microsoft and Apple. https://mobile.twitter.com/taviso/status/860681252034142208 Please continue trying to tell me how infallible paid programmers are! UnlikeABoss They are totally da bestest eva! UnlikeABoss Obviously paid products will always be better than unpaid products... right!?!? /s Oh wait we have tons of real life examples of free products being better than paid, shocking how that works. It's almost as if the best products are made by the most passionate people, and like, being paid doesn't guarantee being passionate about your creation. What a crazy crazy world! ihsan ışık Are you implying that Android got popular because of "nerds" who heard it uses the Linux kernel? UnlikeABoss If you are old enough to know the early days of android you'll know that having every single nerd on the internet promoting Android over iOS most certainly helped get the ball rolling. Once it was pushed, it snowballed into what it is today. m477 Sure. It was the nerds on the internet, not the manufacturers with ads everywhere. Most people still don't know their Galaxy runs Android. UnlikeABoss The giant billboards came YEARS afterwards, cmon. m477 Yes, and that's why Android was so unpopular in the early days. UnlikeABoss What? It was massively popular among all techies for being the open source iOS alternative. m477 You are overestimating the "techies" crowd. Even BlackBerryOS was more popular at the time. Only after the Galaxy S it started to grow, and became popular among normal people. UnlikeABoss Not really. We are talking over a decade ago now, there were far less people on the internet and it was far easier for techies to promote products because everyone was asking their "techie" friend what is best. But these days everyone is an "expert" so that's not as much of a thing. m477 Again, you overestimate how many techies there actually were. Your personal experience is anecdotal. Market shares and sell data are objective. Also, over a decade ago Android was still a camera os, and it wasn't public. UnlikeABoss No, I do not. The further back in time you go, the higher the proportion of techies there were using the internet versus others. People were only just starting to look at buying a smartphone, and asking techies what they should buy. m477 Yes, the concentration on the internet of "techies" on the internet was greater. And? What normal user at the time went to the internet, looked at reviews and said "Oh, look! The HTC magic has Linux! This random guy says its good, so I'm gonna buy it!"? You really think that a bunch of "techies">marketing? A guy saying that his toy-looking HTC G1 is better than the iPhone is more effective than billboards and tv ads? Come on, even Windows Mobile was more popular. It took Samsung's aggressive marketing to make Android popular. UnlikeABoss Windows Mobile and BlackBerry were more popular in the enterprise, that's it. The entire discussion is home users. Also I think there's been some confusion. I wasn't implying that techies on the internet were promoting Android on the internet like a marketing department. I was implying that the internet was very much a "social media" platform for techies to communicate where the majority of them would use Android and mocked the use of iOS. The actual "marketing" happened offline when a normal user would ask their "techie" friend for first time buying advice. It is nothing like that today, and the internet is nothing like the techie community it once was. m477 So, what you're saying is that the internet was a circlejerk of Android users. Ok, and? It didn't affected normal users the slightest, iOS was still more popular until Samsung took Android more seriously. The techie friend thing its only your anecdotal experience, it bears no influence on the market, in the grand scheme of things. I'd even argue that Google's very light marketing did much, much more. Also, the mindless techies that recommended half backed devices instead of better alternatives because "Uh, Linux!!" did more harm than good, both to the users and to Android. UnlikeABoss If you read my OP you'll see my original point was that Google has rode the "Android circlejerk" to popularity, and you can debate how much popularity that added as much as you want. The fact remains, it got the ball rolling. Samsung didn't pick it up "just because", it saw that a lot of people were pushing it. There were several OS at the time it could have used, including sticking to its own. Why bother with Android? Maybe because it wanted to see how much market it could take by appealing to techies? However, if you stand back and look at it, how is this any different from "embrace, extend, extinguish"? Google used that "free marketing" and has now decided to use it's massive popularity to push a different product. (Which has failed in the past and will hopefully fail again). Why hate Microsoft for doing that in the past, but we praise Google for doing it? Why are we excited for something we know nothing about that is creating fragmentation? m477 Samsung had used several OSes, it had Windows Mobile and Phone devices, Symbian devices, and proprietary devices, even Palm OS devices IIRC. They used them all. Android had was the easiest to personalise for them, and create a copy of the best selling product, which was the iPhone, and there was an app market, so they tried to release and market their flagship with it, and market it as broadly as Apple. The first Galaxy (the "non S") was was vastly ignored, because it was as little marketed as all their other devices. The techies crowd was insignificant. The free marketing is just as much as Windows 10 gets for incorporating Ubuntu's bash terminal. What you saw is not really important. I saw lots and lots of Windows Phones in 2010 and 11. Many more than Android devices. Every one I knew had one, and if I had to say which OS was the most popular only based on my personal experience, in my smallish city, I'd obviously would say Windows Phone. Why are you so attached to Linux, excluding all possibilities of giving a possibly better solution a try? The community will just fork the AOSP and continue the development of the Linux branch. UnlikeABoss Cmon, we both know Android was not easier for them to customize than simply using their own OS. No one was recommending it, techie or not, no matter how much they marketed. It's only now they are popular they are trying to slip in their own OS, and still failing. I am not attached to Linux despite people using it as an easy scapegoat to dismiss a discussion critiquing almighty Google. We currently have a situation where most kernel developers focus entirely on Linux, making it virtually the universal kernel. Why are we creating pointless fragmentation there? Why divide that community? Do we honestly believe that a divided community can produce a better kernel, or do we love it because Google is doing it? Would we love it if Microsoft did this? m477 The proprietary OS they used at the time was a Java based thing with a flash interface. Hardly able to compete against iOS. It was easier for them to use the "next Symbian" that they could customise as they wanted, and that also had an app market. If they made, say, Bada, before Android become established and popular, and marketed it as much as they did with their Galaxy S, the market would be very different today. The normal user doesn't care what OS their shiny phone runs, as long as there's facebook. I am a GNU/Linux user since the first half of the 2000s, and I've always critiqued Google for using Linux as a kernel on phones. Linux might be the universal kernel, but smartphones need a more streamlined solution. I don't care if it's Google, the MIT, or Richard Stallman in person to do it. I liked WP8 architecture. Fragmentation is not pointless if it brings benefits to the user. TipTop Nobody cares about your FSF agenda. John Q I think the chief reason Google is not using Linux is that they want a real-time OS (RTOS). Linux is at best a "soft" RTOS, possessing a real-time scheduler but this is still not nearly as real-time as an actual RTOS should be. It would take a very large effort to do that for Linux so it makes sense that Google would want to make their own kernel that they can have full control over. UnlikeABoss Let's ignore the fact that Linux is used in real time car systems for a moment. Could you elaborate on why you think Google would want/need a RTOS on their smartphones? M6 The kernel they're using, 'magenta', is opened source. So who cares if they're using linux or not? Does everyone have to use linux? UnlikeABoss No it doesn't have to be Linux. But who else will use Magenta? Probably no one. So why are we fragmenting the kernel space further? Why would you choose an immature kernel for something as valuable (your data) as your smartphone. Would you trust that? I would much rather developers continue focusing on a single kernel. WesleySmalls But wouldn't Magenta be this single kernel? UnlikeABoss If everyone decided to ditch Linux and focus purely on Magenta as the universal kernel, yes. Will that happen? WesleySmalls Could be, just not overnight. The market was already fairly well developed when Linux arrived in 1991, yet it still managed to become a very, if not the most, important player in the market. It's certainly possible, it will just require proper investment(and neglect of their alternate platforms) and patience to make it work M6 That's some straight up communist shit right there. Let's just work on one thing, because we only need one thing, everything else is redundant! Let's not allow other people to do the same thing in a different way, because competition totally doesn't spur innovation at all. WORPspeed So Andromeda definitely dead or still happening? sleepinlight Pretty sure this IS Andromeda, or at least a part of it. Andromeda was never an official name for anything, it was just the internal project name for some sort of new and/or merged OS. WORPspeed I thought Andromeda specifically referred to merging Android and Chrome OS. So is that specific merger dead or on life-support? John Q Nah, the Android/Chrome merger was just speculation from what Andromeda seemed to be. There was never any concrete evidence to imply that Andromeda was a merger. WORPspeed To quote Androidpolice : "So please, when you see Fuchsia mentioned, or speculation that it "is" Andromeda, know that it is just that: speculation. Last we heard from sources we consider extremely reliable, Android was the basis of Andromeda, and Andromeda would see its commercial debut on a new Pixel laptop later this year. It is possible Google has changed plans around Andromeda, that the initiative itself may have even been scrapped. Though, we have no reason to think so - it's more that we don't know, and haven't heard anything about Andromeda in quite some time." http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ WORPspeed http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ That makes them seem very separate Srujan https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e7fda716dfcfdca76e200e51a9c9144c72e183c7e76d36b910c20ee0931aee79.gif destinyhud if this replaces android rather than having 2 separate codebase, I am all up for it. splitting the android community is dangerous senor_heisenberg Well if this does end up being what replaces Android or what Android evolves into, I just hope my apps and whatnot are compatible. Ain't got the time or money to be investing into another ecosystem. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman That's a tricky, double-edged sword. I can't fathom they would not support the old apps, or at least the vast majority of them, for exactly that reason. But in doing so it will likely be held back at least slightly from what it can/should be. Backward-compatibility tends to hold everything back. What I'd wager is we won't see this until hardware's powerful enough to make emulating the old system in a VM relatively cheap and easy, with back-end Play Store penalties to developers who don't shift to the new app models, and then slow phase-outs in stages of the older functionality and support until the new OS is running exclusively its own setup. senor_heisenberg That sounds good. Randy Gindy I think Google porting the Android Run-time to Chrome OS was to see if they could do it. morteum This is old news, I'm waiting for Fuchsia 2.0 Barracuda. /s marcusmarcus2 What if they aren't going by Animal names in general but by mammal names.

Suicide_Note There is no update problem. Nexus/Pixels run the latest and greatest. OEMs who mess with the OS give their customers severely delayed updates. pfmiller Nexus and Pixels run the latest and greatest for two years. Nobody would accept this OS update situation if it was on a desktop OS. MJ Thank God it's phones we are talking about and not a desktop PC. marcusmarcus2 That is exactly why Windows XP lasted only a couple years before all computers updated to Windows 7... Seriously though. I'm fine with only getting Android version upgrades phones for 2 years. But they really need to extend out security updates beyond 3 years. Suicide_Note This isn't a desktop OS, not to mention people tend to change phones much more often than their desktops. pfmiller Sure it's not a desktop OS, but no sense pretending that what we have leaves nothing to be desired. And sure people change their phones more often that their desktops, but there's absolutely no reason to change every 2 years. Suicide_Note I change phones at least once a year, and sometimes two or three times. I couldn't imagine going two years or more on the same phone. pfmiller You can do what you look like, but there's absolutely no reason why that would be necessary. Suicide_Note It's only necessary if you want the latest and greatest, which i like to have, because phone tech is still evolving and improving at a good clip. For example, had i skipped the Pixel, I'd still be using my 6P or N6, both of which have cameras that are vastly inferior to that in the Pixel. I've taken some incredible shots with the Pixel, some of which would be literally impossible to duplicate using the camera in the 6P/N6. That alone is reason enough for me to upgrade on a yearly basis. Doby Gillis Which is a problem, Einstein. Suicide_Note Not if you're a Nexus/Pixel owner, Dilbert. Randy Gindy I would generally say there is. Android phones are not supported for nearly as long as an iPhone. The reason being that the chip set manufacturers do not release new drivers. Shelly-Man Vol 2 It's looks pretty neat for a development stage. Rami Well Android has to reach Z someday.

Neither, this is just a side project many developers use to test and work out the feasability of a variety of things. Android is a very well developed environment, and replacing it whole is simply a no-go. Things will just gradually evolve, as they have already done with Dalvik being replaced by ART, for example. Sir_Brizz I don't think you're wrong, but it would be in Google's best interest to start building a non-JVM runtime that apps can run inside with a native language that Google has 100% full control over like Go or Dart.

Darth Vader 3rd* JG Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Modern personal computers huh? I've been interested in Google packing ChromeOS into a LiveCD type set up we could test/install on our own computers... (*Yes, I know of Chromium, haven't tried it yet... But I would prefer it coming direct from Google, faster updates and all that). It could be interesting to try out another of Google's OSs without having to fork over several hundred for new hardware... The only problem would be drivers to support the various hardware. If not modified too much, ChromeOS could possibly use the original Gentoo Linux drivers. But with Fuchsia using its own unique kernel... That might throw things off a bit... I know a few less tech-savey individuals who would probably be more comfortable if the same OS powered their phone, tablet and desktop (should Google opt to replace Android with Fuchsia).

This will obviously be used for a phone/tablet I dont know much else that uses T-mobile thats not a phone or tablet and would need a UI like this. mattcoz Tablets, wearables, vehicles, and whatever else the future brings. This is not for the devices of today, it's for the devices of tomorrow. Will that include phones? Probably, but "definitely" is too strong at this point.

However, now the OS – known as Fuschia – has acquired a UI. What’s interesting here is that Google has dumped the Linux kernel that Android and Chrome OS is built on, substituting it with its own kernel, called Magenta, instead. The new UI, which Ars Technica has posted images of, is called Armadillo, and it’s built in Google’s Flutter mobile app SDK, which is used to create apps for both iOS and Android from a single codebase. As The Verge points out, that means if you’re geekily inclined, you can compile Armadillo and run it on an Android device yourself. If you do, we’d love to hear what you make of it. Microsoft patches ‘crazy bad’ vulnerability Microsoft has pushed out a patch for the rel=”nofollow””crazy bad” vulnerability identified earlier this week by researchers at Google’s Project Zero in record time, fixing a “wormable” vulnerability in Windows’ Malware Protection Engine. The researcher who identified the flaw, Tavis Ormandy, praised Microsoft’s “amazing response” on Twitter. Microsoft usually patches vulnerabilities once a month and rarely breaks that cycle, so the speed of the turnaround is particularly notable. Sophos Home Free home computer security software for all the family Learn More It seems that the problem was in Microsoft’s antimalware protection engine, which could have been tricked into running code delivered as a payload in an email, on a web page or via an instant message. Microsoft said that the patch is available now via Windows update. Austria orders Facebook to delete post Austria has become the latest European country to crack down on Facebook, with a court in Vienna ruling that it must take down posts that defamed the leader of the country’s Green party, Eva Glawischnig. What’s significant here is that the court has ruled that the posts must be completely erased rather than just being blocked in Austria. The court said that it was “easy” for Facebook to automate that process, although it noted that Facebook couldn’t be expected to try and find similar postings elsewhere on the platform. However, any verbatim repostings must be deleted, added the court. Facebook hasn’t commented on the ruling, but it comes as Germany has threatened to fine the company €500,000 per fake news post, and as the UK government has called on Facebook and other social media providers to “do more” to combat terrorism.

May 09, 2017 13:00 ET VMware and Google Expand Partnership to Accelerate the Adoption of Chromebooks VMware Workspace ONE to enable one-click secure authentication and management of applications -- cloud, web and virtual -- for enterprise Chrome OS users LAS VEGAS, NV--(Marketwired - May 09, 2017) - DELL EMC WORLD 2017 ­- VMware, Inc. (NYSE: VMW), a global leader in cloud infrastructure and business mobility, today announced an expanded partnership with Google to accelerate the adoption of Chromebooks. Enhancing existing application accessibility of the devices, VMware Workspace ONE™ will enable one-click secure authentication and management of applications -- cloud, web and virtual -- for organizations deploying Chromebooks. Workspace ONE is a platform that unifies endpoint management for IT and delivers a unified access experience for end users to help organizations evolve away from silo-ed application and device management strategies to better embrace digital transformation. "VMware has been working with Google since 2015 to offer secure Android devices and applications, most recently with advanced support for Android Enterprise," said Sumit Dhawan, senior vice president and general manager, End-User Computing, VMware. "This partnership shows our commitment to giving customers the flexibility to pick the device of their choice and enabling the delivery of any application on any device to end users." Chrome OS provides multiple layers of protection including security modules, like TPM chips specialized for encryption, verified boot to check for compromises, sandboxing for containing threats and full disk encryption for data protection. Together with Workspace ONE on Chromebooks, IT administrators benefit from additional security capabilities to help deploy, configure and secure, web and SaaS applications. We are also collaborating on advancements to unify native Android applications. Windows applications can also be delivered through VMware Horizon 7 and VMware Horizon Cloud virtual applications and desktops, that can be quickly accessed through dynamic contextual decision-making, secured in the data center and provisioned through Workspace ONE. And end users will enjoy simple single sign-on (SSO) to a digital workspace that includes a catalogue of all the business and productivity applications they need, while IT benefits from improved data security and centralized management and delivery of applications. "With Chrome OS we continue to see momentum in the enterprise given our efforts to deliver speed, security, simplicity and shareability to customers," said Rajen Sheth, director of product management for Chrome OS at Google. "From Windows to web to mobile apps, this partnership with VMware and the integration with VMware Workspace One will allow our customers to easily and securely deploy applications on Chrome OS devices." "Application ecosystems are a major factor in the success of an endpoint operating system," said Phil Hochmuth, program director, Enterprise Mobility at IDC. "Growth in the Chrome OS application ecosystem has improved the quality of the user experience with the platform. Adding VMware Workspace ONE to further support the management and delivery of business applications to Chrome OS devices is a logical move forward."

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Google Offers Peek at New Fuchsia Operating System By Jef Cozza / NewsFactor Network PUBLISHED: MAY 09 2017 The world was treated to its first glimpse of Google's latest operating system today. The OS, which the company is calling “Fuchsia” at the moment, is a non-Linux-based system that seems to be designed with mobile devices in mind. Nevertheless, the OS could eventually replace both the company’s Android mobile OS and its Chrome OS. While clues about Fuchsia first began to appear in August, there was little to see at the time other than the command line. From the video and screenshots posted online, it looks as if Fuchsia's GUI (graphical user interface) will differ considerably from Android and Chrome, even if it continues to change in the future. A Major Change from Android Fuchsia is a big deal for a couple reasons. First, building a third OS from scratch represents a major investment in time and resources for a company that already has two operating systems on the market. Although the company has said anything about why it's developing Fuchsia, the seriousness with which it has approached the project could indicate that Google eventually plans to replace Android and Chrome with Fuchsia. And unlike those two systems (as well as the majority of operating systems currently on the market), Fuchsia is not built on a Linux kernel. Instead, it is based on a microkernel called “Magenta” developed by Google, seemingly another indicator of the time and effort Google has invested in the project. Abandoning Linux would be a major step for the company. Dropping Linux also means dropping the GNU General Public License under which it is distributed. Magenta is licensed through a combination of the Berkeley Software Distribution license (BSD), MIT, and Apache 2.0. The BSD license in particular may give Google more flexibility with regard to how it's able to distribute Fuchsia in the future. Controlling Its Destiny Another possible advantage to dropping Linux would be that Google would have more control over updates to the kernel running at the core of its operating system. The company has been slow to update Android with new versions of the Linux kernel, sometimes lagging years behind the latest update. Google is also building Fuchsia using its own Flutter software development kit. Apps developed with Flutter are written using the Dart programming language, a proprietary version of the JavaScript language that Google has developed to help create high-performance mobile apps. All of this indicates that Google is aiming to bring future OS development in-house. Not only would Google have greater control over the licensing behind its distribution agreements, but Fuchsia and the Flutter SDK are designed to be cross-platform, which would make it easier for Google developers trying to ensure Android runs on all manner of hardware platforms it's expected to power. While Fuchsia could certainly give Google more control over the destiny of its OS development, the company has not yet indicated when it might hit the market.

Name: Subject: Message: Is TouchWiz on the Galaxy S8 the best Android skin? Featuresby Nirave Gondhia12 hours ago 83 1635 67 For most smartphone enthusiasts over the past few years, there was always one interface that seemed to polarise users like no other. Samsung may have had excellent hardware but its software failed to match it, until now that is. No longer called TouchWiz – it’s now officially known as the Samsung Experience – here’s why the software on the Galaxy S8 shows that patience really can pay off. In previous generations of the Galaxy S line, software was always considered to be Samsung’s biggest downfall. The company first used the TouchWiz moniker way back with the original Galaxy S, but seemingly dropped any mention of it on the Galaxy S2. The lack of an official alternative however meant that the name TouchWiz stuck, and with it came the unwitting connotation of a poor software experience. Galaxy S7 Edge Galaxy S8 Galaxy S8 Home Screen Settings In 2017 however, this all looks set to change with Samsung launching its new Samsung Experience in December last year and with it, what appears to be an impressive change of focus when it comes to software. The Samsung Experience is both similar and different to TouchWiz of old, with a few of the concerns with previous iterations still present, albeit as part of a vastly improved interface. From the Galaxy S6 to the Galaxy S7 Edge, Samsung made some big improvements, which proved to be necessary after the debacle that was TouchWiz on the Galaxy S5. The past two years have seen Samsung adopt a more minimalist approach to software, that was in line with improvements that Google made to its Android interface, while also improving the performance and reducing the amount of useless bloatware. I say useless as there’s preinstalled apps and then there’s bloatware, and it’s important to recognise the difference between the two. Some of the preinstalled apps can be genuinely helpful – Samsung Health, Microsoft Office, Google’s apps, Samsung Gear and Smart Switch come to mind – and on my unlocked Galaxy S8, that’s all that is present. However, on carrier devices, you’ll likely find a lot more apps and on our T-Mobile branded Galaxy S8 Plus, there are several apps that serve no purpose. The latter isn’t in Samsung’s control and unlike previous iterations, the unlocked version has a very small set of installed apps. One of the reasons I’ve been a fan of TouchWiz for years is that it reminds me of the old Symbian days thanks to the mountain of customisation options available out of the box. Yet, a lot of these have often felt weird, cumbersome and even pointless, and, while some continue to do so on the Galaxy S8, most feel relatively well thought out. Galaxy S7 Edge Galaxy S8 Galaxy S8 Take the settings menu – in previous years, it’s been a myriad of options with choice layouts like tabs and menu items hidden in inexplicable locations. On the Galaxy S8, you still have a lot of the options but they’re housed where you expect to find them and the new “Looking for something else?” section at the bottom of each sub-menu is very useful for navigating quickly to common tasks. Diving into the settings further is where you’ll find new options to remove the ‘frames’ (aka backgrounds) from icons as well as the option to scale the display resolution between WQHD+, FHD+ (the default scaling) and HD+ as needed. The taller display also saw Samsung remove the home button and opt for on-screen keys and there’s now the option to switch them back to the default Android method. Interestingly, Samsung didn’t include the ability to add additional buttons, despite other Android OEMs such as Huawei and LG offering this on their devices. To offer a familiar experience to Android users, both existing and potential, Samsung has also adopted a lot of the shortcuts you can find on other phones. For example, the removal of the home button means you double press the camera button to launch the camera on the Galaxy S8, just like Google’s shortcut, while double tapping the recent apps key lets you quickly switch to the app you most recently used. A new feature that I particularly like is that you can now swipe up or down on the home screen to access the app screen, which not only frees up an icon on the dock but replicates the gesture found on the Pixel phones, as well as popular Android launchers such as Nova. You can have the app screen icon if you really want it – but, why would you?

Coupled with the in-box Galaxy S8 AKG headphones, this allows you to experience audio that you’ve customised to your exact needs. The Galaxy S8 also comes with the option to stream audio to two Bluetooth headphones or speakers at once. If you’re like me, this means you can finally have a Bluetooth headset and your car connected to your phone at the same time with calls routed to the headset and navigation / music routed through your car speakers. Looking around the latest version of TouchWiz, one thing is immediately apparent: Samsung has focused on its interface, rather than have it feel like it was designed by engineers or accountants. There’s the skilled hand of experience at play, with the all-new app icons, subtle round corners and azure colors all providing an experience that feels complete in many ways. A part of this comes from several features that are familiar from previous iterations of TouchWiz, albeit with more polish in the execution. The Secure Folder provides a welcome area that’s under lock and key and means you don’t need to worry about truly sensitive apps and information when letting someone else use your phone. The Edge UX has gained the Smart Select feature that’s shown when using the S-Pen on the late Galaxy Note 7. Notifications are also vastly improved compared to previous years. I personally prefer more content on my screen and have scaled the display and font on my Galaxy S8 to smaller to offer this. The result is a notification menu that’s incredibly useful and rather nice to look at. When there are no notifications, it takes up barely any space and there seems to be a lot less persistent notifications for Samsung’s features compared to previous years. S7 Edge Notification Menu Galaxy S8 Galaxy S8 Samsung clearly knows it makes great hardware and, with the Samsung Experience, the company is tapping into hardware-software synergy that few companies manage to achieve. Nowhere is this more prevalent than when you get a notification and the beautiful blue pulse of light that traces the edges of the stunning screen. Of course, the Samsung Experience isn’t perfect and yes, it continues to replicate some of Google’s own apps, but the number is relatively limited. Want an AI-based assistant? You’ve got Google Assistant and Samsung’s Bixby. Want to browse the web – you can choose Google Chrome or the Internet browser, albeit the latter is a necessity to provide the best experience for Samsung DeX users. Unlike previous years however, the number of duplicated apps is minimal and where Samsung has replaced Google’s apps with its own – such as Calendar, Contacts and the Dialer – some of its apps are actually much better than Google’s own. You might like: 8 ways the Galaxy S8 is objectively better than the iPhone 7 2 weeks ago In a lot of ways, the Samsung Experience reminds me of Google’s Android… but better. Yes, there’s still bloatware on carrier variants, a little lag when scrolling over to Bixby home and the odd niggle here and there, but these small gripes aside, the software on the Galaxy S8 is Samsung’s best yet, and some may say, it’s the best Android OEM interface currently available. Samsung has made great hardware for many years, but it’s taken a while for the company’s software division to catch up. I’ve used TouchWiz for several years and with the release of every new Samsung flagship, it’s often felt like a case of two steps forward, one step back. While the Galaxy S8 continues this – thanks to questionable hardware decisions like the position of the fingerprint sensor – the Samsung Experience is every bit the platform that Samsung’s hardware deserves.

KitGuru The KitGuru System Home News Reviews Gaming Lifestyle Mobile Professional Forum Home / Tech News / Featured Tech News / Google’s new ‘Fuchsia’ OS shown in new video and images Google’s new ‘Fuchsia’ OS shown in new video and images Matthew Wilson 14 hours ago Featured Tech News, Operating Systems Update: Way back in August 2016, it was discovered that Google is building a brand new operating system, currently codenamed ‘Fuchsia’. Since then, things have been a little quiet on that front but this week, new footage of the OS in action has been released, showing off the UI elements. In the video above, you can see a preview of the Fuchsia OS. The User Interface is codenamed ‘Armadillo’, which is the main focus of the video. Interestingly enough, Armadillo is built in Google’s Flutter SDK, which is used to create code/apps that can run across multiple platforms, including Android, iOS and now, Fuchsia. As seen in further images posted online by Ars Technica, Fuchsia appears to be a smartphone/tablet focussed operating system, indicating that perhaps Google has bigger plans for this OS in the long run. There appears to be a focus on multitasking too. Original Story: Google has had huge success when it comes to operating systems, with Android dominating a large portion of the smartphone market. However, it looks like Google is now looking to the future, as a new OS has been found in the works. The project is titled ‘Fuchsia’ and rumour has it that this could potentially be the bridge that connects Android and ChromeOS. At the moment, Fuchsia exists as a pile of code sitting on GitHub and as The Verge points out, Google is currently not commenting on it, nor is it giving away its intended purpose. However, we do know that the system doesn’t use the Linux Kernel, which is a change given both ChromeOS and Android are built on top of that. Image Source: Android Police Instead, Fuchsia is built on Magenta, which is based on a project called ‘LittleKernel’. LittleKernel is designed to be used in embedded systems, giving some credit the other rumours claiming that Fuchsia is intended for some of Google’s specialised hardware, like the OnHub router. However, Magenta itself is capable of more than that, with its documentation stating that the kernel targets modern PCs and smartphones that use fast processors. Google’s new OS also includes support for graphics rendering, indicating that Fuchsia is meant for more than embedded systems. The report notes that Google is apparently intending for Fuchsia to be open-source, so while it is staying quiet for now, it decided to build things out in the open right from the start. KitGuru Says: Fuchsia could end up being a pretty big deal but for now, we still don’t really know much about it outside of general speculation.

"Apple is no longer the most innovative of companies," he says. Chantel McGee 13 Hours AgoCNBC.com SHARES David A. Grogan | CNBC Walter Isaacson Apple is no longer the world's leader in innovation, Aspen Institute CEO Walter Isaacson told CNBC on Tuesday. Instead, companies like Google and Amazon are the new leaders, the biographer of Steve Jobs said. "Apple is no longer the most innovative of companies," said Isaacson said on CNBC's "Squawk Alley." "But they are good at execution." The innovation in the virtual assistant space, for example, is coming from Google and Amazon, not Apple, Isaacson said. He's surprised Apple hasn't moved it's virtual assistant Siri into the home. "I use both Amazon Alexa, and Google Home. ... Sometimes I let them compete," said Isaacson. The value of the virtual assistant model isn't just the hardware, but the potential for an ecosystem of apps, he said. Apple will likely release a home assistant device soon — possibly this summer — but Isaacson thinks it could be too late for the company to catch up in that space. Instead, Apple should look at other areas that are ripe for innovation. "You could have a great company — and Apple is a great company — without having really a next big thing, but it isn't in Apple's DNA to be that way," said Isaacson.

Anytime. Anywhere. Build Apps 5x Faster For Half the Cost Enterprise Cloud Computing On Force.com Google Offers Peek at New Fuchsia Operating System By Jef Cozza / Sci-Tech Today PUBLISHED: MAY 09 2017 The world was treated to its first glimpse of Google's latest operating system today. The OS, which the company is calling “Fuchsia” at the moment, is a non-Linux-based system that seems to be designed with mobile devices in mind. Nevertheless, the OS could eventually replace both the company’s Android mobile OS and its Chrome OS. While clues about Fuchsia first began to appear in August, there was little to see at the time other than the command line. From the video and screenshots posted online, it looks as if Fuchsia's GUI (graphical user interface) will differ considerably from Android and Chrome, even if it continues to change in the future. A Major Change from Android Fuchsia is a big deal for a couple reasons. First, building a third OS from scratch represents a major investment in time and resources for a company that already has two operating systems on the market. Although the company has said anything about why it's developing Fuchsia, the seriousness with which it has approached the project could indicate that Google eventually plans to replace Android and Chrome with Fuchsia. And unlike those two systems (as well as the majority of operating systems currently on the market), Fuchsia is not built on a Linux kernel. Instead, it is based on a microkernel called “Magenta” developed by Google, seemingly another indicator of the time and effort Google has invested in the project. Abandoning Linux would be a major step for the company. Dropping Linux also means dropping the GNU General Public License under which it is distributed. Magenta is licensed through a combination of the Berkeley Software Distribution license (BSD), MIT, and Apache 2.0. The BSD license in particular may give Google more flexibility with regard to how it's able to distribute Fuchsia in the future. Controlling Its Destiny Another possible advantage to dropping Linux would be that Google would have more control over updates to the kernel running at the core of its operating system. The company has been slow to update Android with new versions of the Linux kernel, sometimes lagging years behind the latest update. Google is also building Fuchsia using its own Flutter software development kit. Apps developed with Flutter are written using the Dart programming language, a proprietary version of the JavaScript language that Google has developed to help create high-performance mobile apps. All of this indicates that Google is aiming to bring future OS development in-house. Not only would Google have greater control over the licensing behind its distribution agreements, but Fuchsia and the Flutter SDK are designed to be cross-platform, which would make it easier for Google developers trying to ensure Android runs on all manner of hardware platforms it's expected to power. While Fuchsia could certainly give Google more control over the destiny of its OS development, the company has not yet indicated when it might hit the market.

The release reads: SMARTPHONE VR: SAMSUNG’S GEAR VR TO RETAIN LEAD IN 2017 AS GOOGLE’S DAYDREAM PLATFORM EMERGES, IHS MARKIT SAYS Competition in the high-end smartphone virtual reality market is heating up in 2017 with Google’s Daydream platform emerging to offer an alternative to the established market leader, Samsung’s Gear VR. According to the latest forecasts from business information provider IHS Markit (Nasdaq: INFO), Daydream View headset sales are forecast to jump from 120,000 in 2016 to 2.23 million in 2017 and will enjoy growing industry support from third-party smartphone vendors in the second half of 2017. While this growth is impressive, IHS Markit forecasts that Samsung’s Gear VR will remain the market leader in the high-end smartphone VR sector in 2017 with sales of 4.1 million. Samsung ended 2016 as the VR platform market leader due to its early mover advantage, high-quality VR experience and aggressive go-to-market strategy for Gear VR. However, the competitive landscape for VR headsets is unsettled and fast moving where newly released products from major competitors can quickly alter the balance of the market, IHS Markit says. Google Daydream’s impact on the market will take time to materialize as smartphone vendors get to grips with the high-end requirements for Daydream accredited phones, especially supply-chain pinch points such as OLED displays. — NOTE TO JOURNALISTS: The state of the VR market is one of many topics that leading experts will address at the first Media and Technology Conference by IHS Markit, in Los Angeles, on Wednesday, May 10. Accredited journalists may attend the one-day conference free of charge – at the Pacific Design Centre – by registering at the following event website: https://technology.ihs.com/Events/590411 and entering discount code MEDIA17. — Samsung’s Pre-Order Bundling Strategy for Galaxy S8 Becomes More Targeted In 2016, Samsung used its Gear VR headset as a powerful marketing tool to promote sales of its Galaxy S7 smartphone and implemented appropriate pre-order bundling strategies across many sales territories. In 2017, Samsung has taken a more targeted approach retaining the offer for the launch of the Galaxy S8 in USA and Australia, but dropping it in a number of European territories. “The arrival of competing platforms is playing out against a backdrop where Samsung has dialed down its previously aggressive pre-order bundling centered on its flagship smartphones and the Gear VR,” Harding-Rolls said. With this change in strategy – partly driven by the Galaxy S8’s already clearly differentiated feature set – and the higher price point of the new Gear VR including motion controller, IHS Markit expects unit sales of Gear VR to decline year-on-year, although it will remain the biggest premium platform for VR content across the major brands. IHS Markit forecasts that consumer sales of Samsung’s Gear VR will decline by 9.6 percent by year’s end, from 4.56 million in 2016 to 4.12 million. Tech, media topics at upcoming conference The May 10 IHS Markit conference will provide a holistic view of the consumer, technology and business trends that will define audio-visual entertainment landscape over the next five years. George Bloom, executive producer of CBS Digital, will deliver the keynote speech at the first-ever Media and Technology Conference, presented by IHS Markit (Nasdaq: INFO). In addition to a talk on “VR Video – Monetizing the New Medium,” session topics presented by industry-leading speakers from an assortment of leading tech and media companies will include: “The Five Forces Shaping Entertainment for the Next Five Years,” “UHD: From More Pixels to Compelling Viewing?,” “Streaming & the Future of the TV” and “Selling Digital Content.” To arrange media interviews with IHS Markit experts, please contact Dan Wilinsky at dan.wilinsky@ihsmarkit.com or press@ihs.com.

In 2017, Samsung has taken a more targeted approach retaining the offer for the launch of the Galaxy S8 in USA and Australia, but dropping it in a number of European territories. “The arrival of competing platforms is playing out against a backdrop where Samsung has dialed down its previously aggressive pre-order bundling centered on its flagship smartphones and the Gear VR,” Harding-Rolls said. With this change in strategy – partly driven by the Galaxy S8’s already clearly differentiated feature set – and the higher price point of the new Gear VR including motion controller, IHS Markit expects unit sales of Gear VR to decline year-on-year, although it will remain the biggest premium platform for VR content across the major brands. IHS Markit forecasts that consumer sales of Samsung’s Gear VR will decline by 9.6 percent by year’s end, from 4.56 million in 2016 to 4.12 million.

The release reads: SMARTPHONE VR: SAMSUNG’S GEAR VR TO RETAIN LEAD IN 2017 AS GOOGLE’S DAYDREAM PLATFORM EMERGES, IHS MARKIT SAYS Competition in the high-end smartphone virtual reality market is heating up in 2017 with Google’s Daydream platform emerging to offer an alternative to the established market leader, Samsung’s Gear VR. According to the latest forecasts from business information provider IHS Markit (Nasdaq: INFO), Daydream View headset sales are forecast to jump from 120,000 in 2016 to 2.23 million in 2017 and will enjoy growing industry support from third-party smartphone vendors in the second half of 2017. While this growth is impressive, IHS Markit forecasts that Samsung’s Gear VR will remain the market leader in the high-end smartphone VR sector in 2017 with sales of 4.1 million. Samsung ended 2016 as the VR platform market leader due to its early mover advantage, high-quality VR experience and aggressive go-to-market strategy for Gear VR. However, the competitive landscape for VR headsets is unsettled and fast moving where newly released products from major competitors can quickly alter the balance of the market, IHS Markit says.

Google Is Killing My Tracks, App Will Stop Working On April 30th Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2016/01/28 6:00am PDTJan 28, 2016 450 Plus 1 on G+ 33 Share on Facebook 0 Share on Twitter Total Shares483 Applications News Google is constantly evaluating its products so it can break your heart by killing the services you love. How dare they? The most recent product to fall victim to a tyrannical "management decision" is My Tracks. Google will shut down the service on April 30th, and the latest app update makes sure you know it. My Tracks is a GPS tracking app aimed at runners, hikers, and other outdoorsy folks. It tracks your location, speed, elevation, and distance. Users can review the data later, save it for use in apps like Maps, and share to social networking sites. The warning that pops up when you launch the new version of My Tracks links to a support article that will help you export your data via the app before the April 30th shutdown. You can send the data to Drive (which I'm pretty sure Google won't be shutting down any time soon) or download the files and keep them elsewhere. Google also recommends some apps that offer similar functionality like Google Fit, Strava, Map My Run, and Endomondo. You can still use My Tracks normally for the time being, but it's time to start looking into these alternatives. The app was not found in the store. :-( Go to store Google websearch Thanks: Carlos Cabral and Spencer Watson Tags apps Google My Tracks shutdown subscribe ...

They recently gave it offline gps support to android wear. Which i believe google fit hasn't done yet. Jan Lavicka Gps wear has been broken for half a year, like notifications, connection etc bunch of incompetent iGiots Austin Spangrud My watch seems to do pretty well with just the Google fit Android wear app... It says that it doesn't use the GPS but then I can go into my steps and see where I've been t_newt My (real life) mail box is pretty old too. In fact it is quite a bit older. But it keeps doing its intended function simply and efficiently. I hope the post office doesn't decide that it is too old and doesn't have enough features to compete anymore. Now that I think about it, I guess the post office is becoming obsolete, in a way. Fred thanks for the humilty lesson. MJ Google wants to cancel Gmail? LOL Jan Lavicka in favour of Inbox just wait a little, these arrogant guys will do it, dont worry :) MJ Inbox? That service no one uses? No, Google will not be canceling Gmail but Inbox probably will see the axe in the future. Please employ common sense... tim242 Inbox has over 10 million installs... MJ Yes so? Gmail has over 1 billion installs. You have a source on how many of those installs are actively used? Thanks for playing. I see you are spamming the whole comments section with idiotic and irrelevant posts. tim242 Go out and get some exercise. It will make you feel better. Vantius Inbox is not a Gmail replacement, it has even been said in their interviews. It is a different interface for your inbox. Jan Lavicka it can change,I don't trust google anymore, better keep away from the Google apps despite I'm an android only guy TheSpaceUnicorn Inbox IS Gmail... smh.... Jan Lavicka no, it isn't gmail is ergonomic, inbox is just a space wasting toy TheSpaceUnicorn Get back to me when Inbox doesn't completely rely on Gmail for everything. Jan Lavicka you wouldn't mind even a car without windows or wheels, you would still call it a useful car :) TheSpaceUnicorn And that assumption is based on what? tim242 He meant the Gmail app. TheSpaceUnicorn The Gmail app has greater functionality and is used by far more people than Inbox. Now way is Google going to cut Gmail instead of Inbox at this point in time. tim242 Maybe not at this point in time. However, it could happen eventually. TheSpaceUnicorn Yes, it could happen eventually, but Gmail would pretty much need to have the smaller user base between the 2 apps in order for them to justify it. Either way Jan's original comment that "these idiots even want to cancel gmail" is just false in every way. tim242 Google can at anytime force the use of the Inbox app. All they have to do is put that little pop-up message in the Gmail app telling you to use Inbox instead. They do this in a lot of apps, particularly messaging. They are removing SMS from Hangouts, and pushing users to Messenger. It has little to do with the number of users, and more to do with which apps they want to put their resources into. If they feel Inbox is the better app, they can just stop Gmail development. They pissed me off when they stopped the use of Google Listen. They had no other podcast app. They just said go use something else. People were almost as pissed about that as they were about the sudden end they put to Reader. I have such a love/hate relationship with Google. TheSpaceUnicorn Please point me in the direction of where Google said they wanted to cancel Gmail. You're ignoring the fact that that's the statment that was made that I'm arguing against. tim242 He was talking about the app, not the service. He didn't say that Google had stated they wanted to cancel Gmail. He was simply saying that is where they are headed. They won't keep two apps for one service. It is obvious that Inbox is where their head is. We have seen Google in action too many times. TheSpaceUnicorn You're arguing for nothing other than the sake of arguing right now... tim242 That would be you. You go through every thread arguing with everyone, about everything. You are just mad that you are dense, and got called out on it. Explaining someone's comment that went over your head, is not arguing. TheSpaceUnicorn Ah yes, because pointing out the fact that Inbox is Gmail when the claim that Google wants to cancel Gmail to replace it with Inbox was made is clearly trying to argue with everyone. tim242 Inbox is not Gmail. I guess you think Mailbox and Apple Mail are Gmail as well. Inbox is a Gmail client, that happens to be put out by Google. He said cancel Gmail the app, not Gmail the service. You have been told this multiple times, yet you are still arguing as if it was the service he was referring to. They will not keep both apps. They never keep multiple apps with similar functions. Stop arguing with everyone, every day. Go get laid...if you can. You will feel better. TheSpaceUnicorn Never once did I suggest that he's referring to the service and not the app. That's you drawing that conclusion based on assumption. Seriously though, what's your problem dude? We got in one argument, which you started btw, and now suddenly you have this personal vendetta against me, and saying that I argue with everyone over everything in every article while completely disregarding the fact that I comment on many articles here without ever arguing with anyone, and for the most part, only argue with someone here when they aren't properly conveying the facts or are pushing their own personal opinion as if it's an objective fact. Meanwhile, I've seen you reply to many comments here for the sole purpose of arguing. Stop being beta af. tim242 If you weren't thinking he was referring to the service, that makes your arguing even more pointless. You claimed that Inbox is Gmail, which is incorrect. You acted though if they stopped the use of the Gmail app, that it would mean the same for Inbox. They are two separate clients for the same service. Obviously one doesn't require the other to function. You just like to argue. You have made that plain for all to see. I'm not the only one pointing that out to you. TheSpaceUnicorn "They are two separate clients for the same service." That doesn't contradict anything I've said. "I'm not the only one pointing that out to you." Except for the fact that you are. tim242 That does contradict exactly what you said. You said that Inbox is Gmail and that they couldn't shut it down unless they kill Gmail. Nope, you were called out by several in the last threadwe argued in. You were attacking several people, for no reason. Get laid. .seriously. At least get a life. If you go through life this angry and argumentative, it causes undue stress to your heart. TheSpaceUnicorn Please quote where I said the couldn't shut down Inbox without killing Gmail, because I know I said the exact opposite, that they couldn't shut down Gmail without killing Inbox. Also, in that other thread You were the only one that said anything to me about being me argumentative or attacking anyone. In facts, I specifically recall you being called out by multiple people for acting like a douche. Also, I never attacked anyone for no reason, and I never have. Seriously though, grow up and learn how to not hold grudges. At this point you're arguing against me for pretty much no other reason than just false predispositions of who you think I am. I'm not an angry or argumentative person in any way shape or form, in fact, I'm probably one of the least confrontational and argumentative people you'd ever meet as well as being a genuinely happy and sincere guy. tim242 "I know I said the exact opposite, that they couldn't shut down Gmail without killing Inbox." So now you are finally admitting that you were referring to the service. You are not only very argentative, but also a liar TheSpaceUnicorn I never once said I wasn't referring to the service. tim242 Really? Then explain your reasoning behind this: "I know I said the exact opposite, "that they couldn't shut down Gmail without killing Inbox." You are such an idiot. TheSpaceUnicorn Gmail is the backbone of Inbox. Inbox is essentially just Gmail with a different UI and a couple added features. Thus they can't just get rid of Gmail without killing off Inbox as well. tim242 You would only be correct, if referring to the service. Inbox and Gmail apps both operate off of the Gmail service. They are independent of each other. They can get rid of the Gmail app and still have Inbox as the only Gmail app. I don't know why such a simple concept is so hard for you to understand. TheSpaceUnicorn It's like talking to a brick wall.... "You would only be correct, if referring to the service." How many times do I have to repeat myself.... I never once said I wasn't referring to the service. "They are independent of each other. They can get rid of the Gmail app and still have Inbox as the only Gmail app." I never said otherwise. "I don't know why such a simple concept is so hard for you to understand." I don't know why you're assuming I don't understand that concept. tim242 So you are now saying that you understand that concept, but you started this whole useless argument by contradicting that... "I know I said the exact opposite, that they couldn't shut down Gmail without killing Inbox." Talk about a brick wall... TheSpaceUnicorn Please, do go on about how Google could shut down all of Gmail right now and keep Inbox up and running just fine. tim242 All of gmail. There you go talking about the service again. All the while, dodging the question. TheSpaceUnicorn Maybe the third time is the charm: I never once said I wasn't referring to the service. You are either the most stubborn and spiteful person I've ever seen on the internet or the worst troll ever. tim242 Nobody has mentioned shutting down the service, but you. You are arguing with yourself. The OP was referring to them shutting down the Gmail app,in favor of Inbox. You seem to think that isn't possible. It's like you think the Gmail app is Gmail. The Gmail app is just a UI wrapper around the Gmail service. You know, like Inbox. You claimed that you understand that concept, but you clearly do not. TheSpaceUnicorn The Gmail app is much more than just a wrapper around the Gmail service. tim242 That's where you are dead wrong. The Gmail app is not even on my phone. Inbox works just fine. You might want to educate yourself. Inbox is a built from scratch native app, that happens to be double the size of the Gmail app. Stop making claims about something that you are so very clearly clueless about. TheSpaceUnicorn Nope, I'm not wrong at all. The Gmail app is Android's built in email app and works with far more email accounts than just gmail accounts. Meanwhile, the Gmail service, and subsequently Inbox, ONLY work with Gmail accounts. tim242 The Gmail app only recently got other email account support. Not long ago, Hangouts was the built in messaging service. You see how that is turning out. They could add other account support into Inbox, and push people there, or add back the email client for other services. But that is irrelevant to the point that Gmail the app...is just an app. Inbox does not need the Gmail app to work. They are both native Gmail apps. Again I'll say, Gmail has been removed from my phone. Inbox still works fine. One app does not require the other, to function. You are dumber than iPhone sheep. TheSpaceUnicorn "The Gmail app only recently got other email account support." Completely irrelevant "They could add other account support into Inbox, and push people there, or add back the email client for other services." If they did that then yes, like I already said earlier, I'd imagine the Gmail app days would be limited. But guess what, they haven't done nor even hinted at doing that, so the Gmail app is most certainly going to be around for the foreseeable future. Contrary to Jan's statement that "I will never rely on ANY new google product these idiots even want to cancel gmail." "Inbox does not need the Gmail app to work." I never said otherwise. "Again I'll say, Gmail has been removed from my phone. Inbox still works fine." Literally no one suggested it wouldn't work just fine because why wouldn't it work just fine? "You are dumber than iPhone sheep." Throwing in a personal attack does nothing to strengthen your argument that's solely based on semantics and grasping at straws. tim242 You are the one that has repeatedly claimed that the Inbox app can't function without the Gmail app. Support for other accounts has nothing to do with any of this. The OP posted that getting rid of the Gmail app would happen, in favor of Inbox. You have spent all day claiming that isn't possible. Now you admit that it is possible, but only if they add support for other accounts in the Inbox app. That literally has nothing to do with the dumb arguments you have been making ALL DAY. TheSpaceUnicorn "You are the one that has repeatedly claimed that the Inbox app can't function without the Gmail app." I never made any such claim. "Support for other accounts has nothing to do with any of this." I never said it did. "The OP posted that getting rid of the Gmail app would happen, in favor of Inbox." And that could happen, however it's very doubtful unless google releases a new email app, which they've never even hinted at doing. "You have spent all day claiming that isn't possible" I never made any such claim "now you admit that it is possible, but only if they add support for other accounts in the Inbox app. " I never said it was impossible. You stupidly misreading my earlier comments and interpreting them as talking about the Gmail app instead of the Gmail service and then continually ignoring me every single time I clarify what you're misreading is what got us into this mess, and just like before, you're too stubborn to admit that you're wrong. I probably should've been more clear in my comments earlier on, I'll admit that I'm at fault for not being more clear. I'm tired of arguing like kids but I highly doubt you're capable of just admitting the areas where you're wrong so there comes a point where I just need to be the bigger and more mature person and move on from this and you, so if your next comment is argumentative then I'm done with you and any further replies from you will simply be ignored. tim242 You are so dense... TheSpaceUnicorn Am I wrong? Inbox is essentially just a different UI for Gmail. They can't cancel Gmail without canceling Inbox. Biff Wonsley Gmail? I heard they're going to cancel Maps, Drive, YouTube and then shut down Android. Damn you Google to hell! But seriously, I love Tracks. Jan Lavicka oh kiddie, have you ever heard about inbox? gmail is in a feature stop ;) pfmiller What new features does Gmail need? Jan Lavicka postpone notification, integration with calendar, keep etc etc to increase productivity Google managers don't understand ergonomics, productive work or symbiosis of multiple products, they just play with colours Patryk but, why? Suicide_Note My guess is this isn't a very widely used product. Next up on the chopping block....Hangouts ? Jan Lavicka yes, their idiotic behaviour cancels everything below 10% usage, so in a short time they will upset 100 % users mark Well they're still selling Chromebooks at under 1% share... Jan Lavicka so you can understand how inconsistent thinking has the top Google management and they are going to merge Chrome os with android soon, exactly according to my demands 5 years ago InTheSpace Google+ ;) Aaron Yeah Google should chop off Hangouts too and acquire WhatsApp from Facebook. Oh man too bad Jan Koum's bromance is strong with Mark Zuckerberg. Mordalo I has a sad. My wife and I love to go driving and get lost on old country back roads, and we'd use this to see just where we went afterwards. I know there are alternatives, but the interface was simple and exported automatically to Google Drive. I remember this was Open Source, and I've heard the code is out on Github. Maybe someone (I'm not a programmer, and I don't play one on TV) will get the code and bring it back to life. Alexander Terry Indeed! Here it is, it looks like all the code is still there, bit it does say that they would nuke the repo come January 1st, of last year. https://code.google.com/archive/p/mytracks Jason Bell Yup, they nuked the code from their repo a year ago. There are a few exports on GitHub, like this one: https://github.com/jgillich/mytracks I'm considering digging into the code to see what it would take to create/release a version. David Hyman Never heard of this one before BetterWithRoot Oh man, I used this when going biking. I loved going to a strange new area (vacation) and biking around the city and then seeing where I all went. It looks like I am going to have to find a replacement. George Byers Can't say I ever used this... and as for people that like to track where they travel, doesn't Google Maps have a timeline now? xJimboJonesx The tracking Google Tracks is much more granular that Google Maps. Plus you can get info like average speed and elevation. brnpttmn It's not as precise by itself and you don't get as much information. Plus, if i'm correct, when you track in My Tracks it makes the location tracking in Timeline more granular. Christopher Bement Wanna take a gamble on Google Now parking location? :D Ryan Johnson I wish I could disable a specific location from that feature. So annoying having that card always show up when I'm not going anywhere because it's my house tehboogieman Do you have your house set in the location settings? The feature is a little flaky for me, but it never shows my house. Roh_Mish It keeps on telling me my house is 0mins away walking. When I am in my house Ryan Johnson I hop between two places, and there isn't a way to add any more places outside of 'Home' and 'Work.' Google Now needs more personalization :S brnpttmn Damn. I like this app a lot because it was simple. Used it for road trips and hiking. Surprising that they would drop it since it doesn't seem like it would be that resource-intensive to support (they didn't really do much with it). OmniWrench The funny thing is that the main draw - it being simple, always made it feel doomed to me (and rightly so apparently). It wasn't a big giant service with color coding and tags and goals and social features, it just drew your path on a map and saved it to Drive. Perfect... and doomed. I'd started using "Ghostracer" https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.bravetheskies.ghostracer&hl=en recently, a tad more complex than My Tracks, but at least doesn't have social features and yet another bloody account to create. Plus it has Wear integration same as My Tracks did (or allegedly did, I could never get that working). brnpttmn Yeah, the "simplicity" and minimal updates also gave me a bit of the doomed feeling, but I had hoped it would be safe through relative obscurity. Jason Bell Nuts. I've been using My Tracks forever. It is the perfect, minimal app to track my rides and hikes. No useless bells and whistles at all. kitze Google Fit has activities now :) DirkBelig But does it do mapping? My problem is like Jason's, My Tracks was basic and that's all I needed. Other fitness apps seem more geared for hardcore jocks; I'm just a guy who goes for walks. Sanat Gersappa Try MovesApp for something similar. TDioWS Yes it does! Not automatically, tho. You have to click on "start new activity". Jure Zitnik I've been trying out Fit for tracking my hikes for the past few weeks and it's eating up the battery like crazy. It's completely unusable, at least on my stock N5. Leif Sikorski But Google Fit can't really replace Googe MyTracks. I've often used MyTracks to create gps logs for Adobe Lightroom to tag photos with GPS data ... something Google Fit can't do as far as I know teolinux what if you enable "your timeline" feature in google maps? It silently tracks your positions all day long, and you can review the history from inside Google Maps. Very useful to attribute position to pictures and to review your trips/worklife Leif Sikorski It's less accurate and has a big impact on the daily battery life. I prefer to have the Google location history deactivated and use my tracks for high accuracy tracking when I need it. The Google Location history has just disadvantages for me .. it wastes my battery when I don't need it and isn't accurate enough when I need the data. Joseph Grassi Will this feature be stopping ? I use that everyday . its my lifeline . MJ Oh my God! Google is shutting down My Tracks? I must vent my rage on the Internet over my first world problems! Personally, it's first time I even heard of My Tracks... Everyone here who is complaining about this I like to know how much money you paid for this service? Oh right, not one damn cent. Sorry, Google is not going to keep services running that are not worth it for them. Get over it... atlouiedog What happened to you this morning that made you so angry? Does anyone know if Dead Zebra makes Android stress toys? MJ I am angry? I think you are little confused and maybe meant your comment for one of the dozen people here throwing childish fits over Google canceling a niche little used service. tim242 It sounds like you need to get laid... deepdvd Yeah, Not that they would, but I'm sure you wouldn't have a problem if they shut down Gmail. Have some compassion. MJ Your right, my life as I know it would end and who knows what I would do if Gmail was no more... Shit, you have me all worried now. EDIT: A friend just informed me if Gmail was ever shutdown I could just switch to another free email provider and there is like a 1000 of them. Phew... pfmiller Right, you can just use your magic switch so that everyone you ever gave your email address to will have your new one instead. It's so easy! MJ #facepalm I didn't say it wouldn't be inconvenient. Maybe you are new to the Internet but most people are not still using their first email address they ever had... tim242 Because switching emails is soooo easy... MJ Did you even read read my comment before replying? Yes, it does require like an IQ of at least 80 and more then 10 minutes of work to change one's email. tim242 10 minutes of work to get every site and every contact your new email? You simpleton. deepdvd Oh yeah, never mind. Don't have compassion. Silly of me. Edit: You're? DuckingGold Don't be an asshole your entire life. Just because you're a fat prick too lazy to get off your ass doesn't mean everyone's like you. VikingAesir Go turn off your computer, shut off your water, sewer and power if you don't want to hear about first world problems moron. MJ Wow! Did you really make a nonsense reply to comment I posted 11 days ago and then call me a name you would never to my face? You get lost from Facebook you loser? live2ski I thought this was just a side project from some of the developers and was never an 'official' google product. Plus wasn't it open-sourced and community developed now? not sure why they are canceling it. sad. MJ Shit costs money... live2ski no it doesn't. there is no paid staff maintaining it. it was a very good simple tracking app. Adam Well, yes and no. They still have to support any support tickets that come there way for it. And then there is the link to Google Drive that somebody *could* *potentially* *possibly* *at some point* have issues with, etc. Someone would have to be kept around specifically for it and a minimal amount of resources devoted to it. It's not much, but it's not nothing. They're looking to "improve efficiency" by eliminating that last little itty bitty resource usage. MJ I forgot bandwidth is free in 2016 and support is all done my volunteers. Obviously there is some costs associated with MY Tracks or they won't be canceling it. Ir's a duplicate service covered by Google Fit now... N6Perfection and support is all done my volunteers. Your vast ignorance is showing - 20% time pfmiller They app was just updated on 1/27 to say that they were killing it. If they didn't kill it they wouldn't have needed to update it. And Google doesn't care about the bandwidth. My Tracks doesn't use any other than uploading things to Drive. MJ What? An app with no updates? Google doesn't care about bandwidth? That's right, it's free for them! Uploading to Google Drive is using bandwidth. Google doesn't do anything unless it is benefiting them (via ad revenue or your data) as they are a for profit company. Obviously, My Tracks was no longer benefiting them. pfmiller So they should cancel Google Drive if they are so hard up for bandwidth, that's the service using the bandwidth not Tracks. Tracks operated for quite a while just fine without Drive, saving data locally. MJ Dude, please refer to my previous comment again. Google makes their money via your data and selling ads. That is only profitable if you have a lot of users. Sorry, My Tracks didn't make the cut. Google Fit is the product they care about which probably has 1000x more users. tim242 The update was just to add a cancel message. I'm sure that was so expensive. STFU MJ The app was never updated before huh? tim242 It had been over a year ..and the updates never added anything I know, I am a user NexusKoolaid MJ is coming across as a bit abrasive today (I assume he skipped his coffee this morning? ;) ), but he's probably right. For example, My Tracks allows you to share your tracks to Social Media. A casual following of Google+ would show that some of the features of that services are being broken off. It's not too much of a stretch to surmise that the Google API is changing, and some changes could require corresponding development time for clients that use them, like My Tracks. The app has some offline features that one would think will still work after April 30. Like mapping your track - I know I've tracked some of my hikes from start to finish in the absence of any cell coverage so for that any Google services shouldn't be required. If you've used My Tracks, you know it will show you your track overlaid atop a Google Maps view, so there will be some integration with GM for this feature even when there's no data (when calling up map data you may have pre-loaded before your trek). And don't forget integration with Android Wear. As any of the APIs of these things change things that use them need to change and sometimes the corresponding change can involve a significant redesign - something in this case that Google doesn't seem keen on investing in. MJ I am coming off as abrasive? Are you serious? It's really weird you would single me out when there like a half dozen other people here making comments that 10x more off the wall then mine. #facepalm NexusKoolaid Yes, you have come off as abrasive. Others, though, have been downright childish. mark If it is open source, then why can't someone else continue it? Steven Santinelli Ok this is just horrible. I love my tracks for when I go wandering in the woods, and can't find my way back!!!! :( How much friggin does it take to keep this app alive and just the way it is??? This is as bad is getting rid of Listen. It takes NOTHING. You don't even have to support the damn thing, just keep it breathing.... :( Larry Simpson This is what happens when they market products for mass appeal that only get used by a minority of the android ecosystem. Hangouts and G+ hopefully should die next DuckingGold Congrats for the most insipid, moronic comment this morning. Alex Yeah, it has only 10 - 50 million installs. I can imagine they had to stop this niche product. techdan1989 Maybe I'm being dense, but what backend service does Tracks use that would require or even allow shutting it down completely? I thought it just used the phone GPS to record your track and logged it locally with an option to copy to Drive. Paul_Werner Totally wondering the same thing though with them killing it off I doubt we'd get an answer. I think I'm going to ask the same question on G+ to see if they'd answer Devin Rodriguez There are a number of small services that the code behind it runs on, like using the Google Maps API, something they can charge third party companies money for, but can't really charge themselves. That's my best guess, I'm disappointed either way. Clemens Li Nonsense. It still works as it did before. Now without support and without unwanted updates. None of the alternatives has the speed-indicating color of track. Devin Rodriguez ✓ʳᵃᵈ Dunno why you are dredging up something from over a year ago, but I'm not totally sure what you are trying to say here. What did I say that was nonsense? Someone asked what backend services were used that necessitates shutting down the whole project, I responded that there were a few. If the app is still working then clearly they didn't shut things down as they said they would on April 30th, 2016. Channel 2012 It doesn't. As far as I can tell, this is just a joke. Nothing is going to change after April 30. t_newt You are right! It is now June 16th and the app still works! Google's help actually said it would stop working on April 30th. I'm glad they were wrong. I'm going to keep using it until it stops working. I've got a backup for when that happens (if ever). Everything else I've tried is bloated with unwanted 'features'. Channel 2012 Thanks for following up. I just thought I'd mention that I've kept on using it too with no problems. Because of the fact that the only service that MyTracks actually relies on is Maps, I don't think it'll ever stop working or truly be "shut down" unless Google Maps closes its doors (in which case we'll have bigger problems than MyTracks not working). Adam Howard Bummer! Sava D. been using My Tracks to map my flying since 2010. SH*T. Asovse1 How would they go about preventing us using the app after April 30? Is it hardwired into the app to not let us use it after that? Can't we just use an old My Tracks apk from back in the day before they knew they were gonna kill it? Paul_Werner Wondering the same. Probably something talking to a server that will be killed that makes it useless Asovse1 Yeah! All functions can be done while offline anyway, including exporting your data after you finish recording your track. NexusKoolaid Link sharing to social media and the Google Earth integration perhaps? Stuff I never used anyway. I might miss having the track viewed against a Google Maps view though. Paul_Werner Oh right, I tried out the social sharing but never really use it and had issues in the past with the Google Earth integration so if those are the only things that go after the cut off date I'd totally be fine with that t_newt It is the middle of June and it is still working. Maybe it will keep working as long as its API calls are still functional. jackennils I highly recommend komoot to track hikes etc. JD Anxiously waiting for the same Announcement for Hangouts. selonmoi :-( Alex Yeah, and GTasks, Snapseed, Blogger, Goggles, Cardboard, News, GooglePlus (the announcement will start with "This was a very tough decision..."), Kiosk, Arts and Culture (how about a real niche) will follow as well, I assume. N6Perfection I used to write "words" with my tracks and look at them on the map. Sort of like writing your name inthe snow, excpet using your bike and huge parking lots as your canvas. Rita El Khoury Google: I'm stopping dead in My Tracks. Mordalo I see what you did there. RyanWhitwam Fired. rheerani Shots. Imparus activate "your timeline" in google maps? teolinux ^this DEKKER People should try Oruxmaps. Quite complex when looking at it but very complete. Biff Wonsley I loved this app when I walked around the neighborhood. Pure simplicity. I have since graduated to 30 minutes on the elliptical, so longer use it. Never had need for anything more sophisticated, like telling everyone I know that I just walked around the neighborhood. RIP Tracks. Good night sweet prince. Nicholas Conrad Don't worry. In 3 years they'll kill Fit and spin each discreet function into a standalone app. AQ Then they will add a fitness section to Google+ & start killing off the individual apps... matesfm what???? why google!!!!! :( Chaotic Entropy They seem to be pushing Google Fit a lot more, so hopefully functionality will be transitioned. mike shwilly Yeah like Maps in 1-2 years you will get your features back. Chaotic Entropy Playing the long game! mike shwilly They should have killed "Google Goggles" instead. brkshr Bummer! I used it to track all the trails I take in my Jeeps. Always trying to find new trails. SB This really sucks. I've used it since the beginning. ugh. Nogib I've been a big fan of this app since it came out because it was so straight forward. I didn't need or want the excess frills of any of the other route tracking apps out there. Here's to hoping it will still just work despite the message being given out. ePoch 270 Now I know how the Google reader people felt. I guess this is karma for making fun of them and saying "It's free, what do you expect" Michael McGuire Yep, I was one of those Reader fans who was extremely disappointed when that happened. ePoch 270 Can anyone recommend a similar replacement app? Leandro Brandão WTF, they kill good apps, same as google reader. What to use now guys to track my cycling and running? Angry_Badger Just use Strava Josh Legoza Like others here, I liked this app for its simplicity. I used it for so many things I don't think any other apps are good at all of. If I found a good camping spot, trail, etc, I would record how to get there so I could remember how to find it in the middle of nowhere. I used it when I went on quick walks during work to make sure I was keeping a 4 mph pace. Of course tracking runs, walks, skiing (love it for that!). And like some have said just turning it on to see where I went while wandering. I'm definitely gonna miss that. I know that there are apps that can do each of those things, but does anyone know of a good one that does all of them in one? I'm kind of an app minimalist, so I'd love some recommendations. Adam Christensen Not sure if it's a good fit, but GeoLog might be a replacement: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=eu.chainfire.geolog Dana Do any of these: Google Fit, Strava, Map My Run, and Endomondo, actually let you export a .kml or .gpx file? That's the entire reason I've been using My Tracks for the last half-decade. Exporting the .kml files gives me an easy way to build trail maps using Google Maps. Dave I hope they kill G+ but instead they kill other useful things AnoNYC Does Google Fit have live run/bike tracking? Channel 2012 It's an offline tool. How are they going to make it "stop working"? tehboogieman That sucks, anyone have any suggestions for a similar app that isn't only for workouts? I like to track my drives and runs and export them to an open format like GPX or KML. M.e.Puente If you're out hiking on or around the 30th of April, make sure you make it back before they kill the app so you don't get lost ashjas Google... Open source the app if you can't maintain! And BTW... What will stop working? The support and updates...? Even still it will continue to log tracks for offline save.. No gdrive sync etc...right? kjohnson04 I've used MapMyRide, but I've always returned to Tracks because of it's simplicity. Damn. Glad I picked up Runtastic Pro when it was a $0.10 deal a few months ago. badzi0r I'm using google timeline, fit and my tracks. Each one shows different results but my tracks always was most precisely. loop6719 How many more times are you going screw me Google....every time I get used to one of your apps..you go and kill it..3 time loser now David Logan I found My Tracks unreliable and have been using Geotracker. It's fairly battery friendly and tracks are easily renamed and exported. https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ilyabogdanovich.geotracker Michael McGuire Think this might still work if we save the install apk and side-load it? Ambra Vanderpool This is the first time I've ever heard of it. JoostA Well after strolling the internet I think I have found a good alternative (I was able to import my existing tracks very easily too): it is called Geo Tracker. It is available in Google play (I found it via http://tinyurl.com/j2oprpr, with some other alternatives as well). Testing will start tomorrow -:) Scott Breitbach Sooo... they'll probably just bring it back in about 4 years and integrate it into Google Fit? (I'm looking at you Google Play Music with Podcasts) Zeph It used to be open source, but they stopped that (there are github copies of the last released version). If the motive for killing it off was saving development money, they could just stop enhancing it, and/or release the latest source code; they would not need to actively disable usage. More likely some part of Google sees it as competition for other products which provide more useful data to Google (eg: location history, which is more designed to be analyzed by Google for their own purposes than My Tracks is). While you have the option of uploading tracks to Google Drive, that's not designed for Google to analyze (and you can disable or delete those tracks). More importantly perhaps, My Tracks only records tracks when you tell it, typically for short spells when working out in some way; other Google products are moving towards 24/7 recording, which is probably much more valuable for analyzing your life as a consumer (and uses much more battery life). Channel 2012 Thumbs up if you're still using MyTracks in June 2016 and beyond! Lol Google.

Tech Search Search WMPWThe World’s Most Powerful Women: May 10 MusicThe Grammy Awards Will Move to New York After a Decade in Los Angeles PoliticsTrump Will Meet Russia’s Foreign Minister at the White House ChinaChinese Premier Sends Foxconn a Reminder After Its CEO Visits the White House PointCloud Edward Snowden Says Use Cloud Services at Your Own Peril Barb Darrow May 09, 2017 NSA whistleblower Edward Snowden warned that using cloud services from Amazon, Google, and Microsoft may be convenient, but that it comes at a high price in terms of lack of visibility and control over what those cloud providers are doing on the back end. People should not use technology mindlessly, Snowden noted. For-profit infrastructure like Amazon (amzn)Web Services or Google (goog) Cloud Platform is fine, except those companies tell customers little about what's happening inside those data centers. Amazon, for example, won't even let customers tour its data centers. "You're giving them your data and giving up control," he told attendees of the OpenStack Summit 2017 in Boston on Tuesday via a satellite link, ostensibly from Russia where he is in exile. Public clouds like AWS are increasingly used by businesses that don't want to build more of their own data centers, saving on upfront costs and headaches. Cloud vendors typically say they cannot see or access encrypted user data. But the fact remains that public cloud is all about customers running their operations on hardware and software managed by another company, and that gives Snowden pause. This was a receptive audience for his message. OpenStack is a set of freely available software that companies can use to build, manage, and control their own cloud infrastructure. And open-source proponents would say this allows companies to manage their own destiny. The use of open-source technologies may be a better option for users than investing in technology they "don't own, don't influence, don't control, or even shape," Snowden said. Related ChinaChinese Premier Sends Foxconn a Reminder After Its CEO Visits the White House China Chinese Premier Sends Foxconn a Reminder After Its CEO Visits the White House Companies can use OpenStack, which can be downloaded for free, or offered with paid support from Rackspace, Canonical, SUSE, and Red Hat (rhat), to build their own computing infrastructure which, admittedly, requires a lot of technology expertise which tends to be expensive. Related: Snowden May Return to U.S, Complicating matters on the public cloud side, is that the same big providers—Amazon, Google, and Microsoft—that run all that industrial infrastructure, are also amassing vast quantities of data about consumers via devices like Amazon Echo, Google Home, and the upcoming Microsoft Invoke. Every time you order a Domino's pizza, or an Uber car, or conduct a banking transaction using Echo, your data is being collected and used in theory, to provide you with better services. But, even though that data is anonymized, and users can delete things they don't want aggregated, the whole notion of a device listening in to you at home makes many people uncomfortable. One technologist with a financial institution that uses AWS, but who is not authorized to speak about it publicly, said he personally would never have an Amazon Echo or Google Home because he doesn't want those companies collecting his personal data. The problem for many users is, or should be, trust, said Snowden. Get Data Sheet, Fortune’s technology newsletter. "If you run on Google's or Amazon's technology, how do you know when it starts spying on you?" Snowden told the audience. "You have no awareness because it happens at a hidden layer of the software." For the record, these companies have said they are careful in how they collect, use, and protect customer data. The problem is whether you believe that. This is the atomic moment for computer scientists. @Snowden #OpenStackSummit #freedom @OpenStack pic.twitter.com/7WhgbsDWTB- August Simonelli (@silentaug) May 9, 2017 And just as business users have very little visibility into what's going on in a public cloud, there is a similar issue of what's happening in our own personal devices, including smartphones. "When you put your phone on airplane mode or turn off location services, how do you know those things are really off?" Snowden asked. Toward that end, he said the Freedom Of Press Foundation is working on a design that will let phone users know definitively if their phones are sending data about their whereabouts. Forrester Research (forr) senior analyst Paul Miller said people should pay heed to Snowden's words. It can be fine to trust computing and data to a third-party, but you need to do so with your eyes open, he said.

[Update: Confirmed] Google Assistant in Allo is learning Spanish and French Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/09 9:40am PDTMay 9, 2017 39 Plus 1 on G+ 68 Share on Facebook 86 Share on Twitter Total Shares193 Applications Google News Update 1: 2017/05/09 9:43am PDT Confirmed Google rolled out Assistant first in Allo, but it only supported English at launch. Google has been slowly but steadily adding more languages to the Allo version, as well as the voice-activated version on phones. The company has quietly rolled out support for Spanish and French to Assistant in Allo, but it looks to still be in beta. Google has not updated its list of officially supported Assistant languages yet. It currently includes English, German, Hindi, Japanese, and Portuguese. However, we've gotten multiple tips that Assistant has started popping up in conversations happening in French and Spanish. Specifically, users are seeing smart replies in those languages, and they can ask the Assistant bot to use those languages. This appears to be a very recent change. When asked if is spoke French or Spanish before, Assistant would say it was still learning. Now, it offers to set those as the default language in Allo. It sounds like the new languages are a bit rougher around the edges than the "official" ones. Google's head of conversational search, Behshad Behzadi has reportedly said Spanish will be working completely later this year. French might be on the same track, but at least there's progress. Update 1: 2017/05/09 9:43am PDT Confirmed These languages are now confirmed. Google's head of product for Allo has tweeted that Spanish is rolling out. As for French, Google's Canadian blog says French is a go. End of Update Thanks: Roberto and Mikaël Tags allo assistant Google languages subscribe ...

I live in Quebec and my main language is french Canada so I would appreciate interacting with the assistant in French but do not wish to change my default language to French. I want to keep my device setup in English same as I always had my windows in English or any other tech devices.. TVs etc. And depending who I text it can be in English or French so unless it can switch easily it's useless currently. When I tried speaking french it would come up with gibersih words. It works better to just switch my keyboard language and use the mic. That way I am positive it understands what I am saying the first time whether it's French or English. roberto.elena At least in Allo, you don't have to do any changes. My phone has English US as the main system language for UI and Spanish (Spain) as secondary language for speech recognition. In Allo I can chat via text with the Assistant in English, Spanish and German and it understands all 3 without a problem. What I find weird is that the Assistant always replies using the same language, until you explicitly tell it to change to another one, so if I tell it to speak Spanish, it will always reply in Spanish even if I ask questions in English or German. EowynCarter Saying the assistant "speak french" should do that from what i tested. Keept talking english (device language is french), And it wasn't understanding anything before, expecting me to speak english. Then, it got the french sentance alright. Misanthrope Unfortunately, it still speaks English after that. I am in the same situation and don't want to put my device in French. I want to keep it in English and speak French which is impossible EowynCarter Mmm. I can tell the assistant to speak English despite my phone being in French. But I'm using the allo assistant. Girouf Yeah I remember when I was testing the assistant ...although it was using "French France" then cause french Canada was still not a "learned language, it would never switch to French on the fly if I tried dictating an SMS. As I mentioned my system was set as English default and I want it to stay that way. The best solution for me was to turn everything off and just use the mic in the keyboard, switch my language from there and I could easily create a French or English sms that way with the first try. I haven't used it since though so I don't know how it is now if any better. Marc ¡Hola! Omelette du fromage. Arthur J. Means nothing Bru [971] Seems to be out of beta as Google France's facebook page is asking us to try Assistant in French. With no mention of beta. This is how i saw it roberto.elena I think Google still considers it a beta, even when there is no mention of it. Maybe I'm wrong, but the same happened when the Assistant was launched in English in Allo, before the Pixel launch. JD Has it learned french? Or has it learned Quebecois? Qbancelli Gracias, Google! Daniel D’Oleo ¡Por fin, ya habla español! 😃 Can confirm it works in Spanish (Spain/Latin America). https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/737f7c20cd24f2fc2ad7d8dee390630046978e4c2f455b8f88277ae7afa1fcbf.png Diego S. Spanish yesss Petr Kuchyňka And few commands in Czech (like setting an alarm etc.) Gerardo Sarabia this should come to the rest of the Assistant ecosystem, instead of being limited to Allo. Leonardo Baez Thanks for the heads up. I will change my language to spanish now. 👍 cvm And here, I'm trying to learn French... Stefan There is so much to do in the field of bi-lingual and tri-lingual users.. the OS should know when I chat with a specific person what language I use and the keyboard and Assistant should adopt to contacts across the device.. I use three languages on a daily basis and it's a nightmare to say the least. EnerJi Do you use Gboard as your keyboard? Supposedly it auto-detects languages automatically, but I haven't tested it extensively and I'm not sure whether it works well. Stefan yes nexus 5x with clean android and Gboard.. it seems to work every now and then, and only integrates with native android apps. my iPad seems to work better with remembering which language was previously used in the chat.. but that's iMessage ... siri is one language only and that's a BIG reason why I switched to android because google Now understood which language I was speaking in.. google assistant is FAR behind Rod Swiftkey is your friend. VAVAMk_2 ¿Cuándo podemos esperar que Google Allo aprenda soporte SMS además de nuevos idiomas? YuCMi Proof that Allo is still in beta... it's literally Google's testing ground.

TechShout Gadgets Software Hardware Mobile Phones Internet Apple Features Everything Else Home Software Google’s mysterious Fuchsia OS breaks cover Software Google’s mysterious Fuchsia OS breaks cover By Bindu Nair - May 9, 2017 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter tweet Google’s mysterious open source Fuchsia OS was first spotted on GitHub all the way back in August last year, sparking a wave of speculation that it was working on a third OS which would one day replace Android and Chrome. The company’s been publicly sharing its work since then and now Kyle Bradshaw of HotFix has posted an entire guide on how to install it in an Android device. Fuchsia OS features a user interface dubbed Armadillo. It’s still in the early stages, but it’s clearly a huge departure from Android. Firstly, it abandons Linux in favor or Google’s own Magenta kernel. The latter is meant for modern phones and computers with fast processors, a hint at where it might be heading. It also overcomes one of the main drawbacks of the former. Linux isn’t suitable for all devices, especially connected ones like car dashboards or GPS units. This limits Android to a large extent. The OS wasn’t conceived keeping in mind that it would run on billions of devices around the world and it’s become extremely fragmented in the years since its debut because third-party companies don’t regularly update its products. Also See: Gmail users hit with massive Google Docs phishing scam Fuchsia might overcome that glaring issue while still maintaining the same open nature of Android. Its Armadillo UI takes a lot of cues from Google’s Material Design interface and utilizes the brand’s own cross-platform Flutter SDK for apps. All-in-all, it seems to be built from the ground up using only the company’s software for a pure Google experience. As for what a pure shot of Google looks like, Fuchsia opens up to a profile photo next to time, date, battery, and location data. Tapping on the image triggers a bunch of settings to do things like adjust sound, enable airplane mode, and auto rotate. Rather than a host of apps, there’s a long scrolling list of cards like Email and Story Zeta; likely placeholder folders for actual applications or perhaps recent apps. The familiar Google symbol is present below, prompting users to ask for anything. Cards can dragged and dropped into various configurations, allowing for split-screen multitasking in which multiple apps can be fit onto the screen. The keyboard is a bit different, resembling Gboard more than the current Android system keyboard. It’s too early to say when exactly Fuchsia will be ready for the public. Ars Technica posits that it might be unveiled by 2020 since Android gestated as an internal project for 5 years. That should give Google enough time to figure out how to transition between Android and Fuchsia, if that really is its intention.

Video Samsung DeX: The Galaxy S8 desktop dock really works No matter how fast our phones get, they’re still only as good as the network they’re using. But now Google is taking steps to make sure you don’t lose your train of thought just because you’ve lost your connection. Last year, Chrome gained a download button that let you save web pages for viewing when your connection is spotty, and Google says some 45 million of them are downloaded every week. That's why in the latest version of Chrome for Android, Google is making it even easier to save web pages for offline reading. Google A set of new options in Chrome make it easier to download web pages for offline viewing. Instead of tapping the overflow menu and hitting the download button, you’ll now get the option when you long-press on a link. And Chrome is also making it easier to find things you’ve previously downloaded. When you open a new tab in Chrome now, you’ll see a list of articles that you have downloaded tagged with a new offline badge. And Chrome will also display all of your recent downloads right side on the page for quicker access to the things you want to read. You'll also be able to view and manage downloads on the Downloads page. But the best new feature is one you won’t actually be using all that often. The next time you see Chrome’s offline dinosaur, a new “Download Page Later” button will appear that will queue the URL for download as soon as a connection is restored. Then it will instantly become available in your download list so you won’t forget whatever it was you wanted to read. The new version of Chrome is rolling out to Android users, but if you’re not seeing it, you can side-load the Google-signed APK from APKMirror. The impact on those with poor connections: While our offline struggles are becoming less and less common here in the U.S., they’re still a big deal in many parts of the world. These new changes will ensure that whatever you're reading, researching, or watching won't get lost due to a connection that quits.

May 09, 2017 13:00 ET VMware and Google Expand Partnership to Accelerate the Adoption of Chromebooks VMware Workspace ONE to enable one-click secure authentication and management of applications -- cloud, web and virtual -- for enterprise Chrome OS users LAS VEGAS, NV--(Marketwired - May 09, 2017) - DELL EMC WORLD 2017 ­- VMware, Inc. (NYSE: VMW), a global leader in cloud infrastructure and business mobility, today announced an expanded partnership with Google to accelerate the adoption of Chromebooks. Enhancing existing application accessibility of the devices, VMware Workspace ONE™ will enable one-click secure authentication and management of applications -- cloud, web and virtual -- for organizations deploying Chromebooks. Workspace ONE is a platform that unifies endpoint management for IT and delivers a unified access experience for end users to help organizations evolve away from silo-ed application and device management strategies to better embrace digital transformation. "VMware has been working with Google since 2015 to offer secure Android devices and applications, most recently with advanced support for Android Enterprise," said Sumit Dhawan, senior vice president and general manager, End-User Computing, VMware. "This partnership shows our commitment to giving customers the flexibility to pick the device of their choice and enabling the delivery of any application on any device to end users." Chrome OS provides multiple layers of protection including security modules, like TPM chips specialized for encryption, verified boot to check for compromises, sandboxing for containing threats and full disk encryption for data protection. Together with Workspace ONE on Chromebooks, IT administrators benefit from additional security capabilities to help deploy, configure and secure, web and SaaS applications. We are also collaborating on advancements to unify native Android applications. Windows applications can also be delivered through VMware Horizon 7 and VMware Horizon Cloud virtual applications and desktops, that can be quickly accessed through dynamic contextual decision-making, secured in the data center and provisioned through Workspace ONE. And end users will enjoy simple single sign-on (SSO) to a digital workspace that includes a catalogue of all the business and productivity applications they need, while IT benefits from improved data security and centralized management and delivery of applications. "With Chrome OS we continue to see momentum in the enterprise given our efforts to deliver speed, security, simplicity and shareability to customers," said Rajen Sheth, director of product management for Chrome OS at Google. "From Windows to web to mobile apps, this partnership with VMware and the integration with VMware Workspace One will allow our customers to easily and securely deploy applications on Chrome OS devices." "Application ecosystems are a major factor in the success of an endpoint operating system," said Phil Hochmuth, program director, Enterprise Mobility at IDC. "Growth in the Chrome OS application ecosystem has improved the quality of the user experience with the platform. Adding VMware Workspace ONE to further support the management and delivery of business applications to Chrome OS devices is a logical move forward." Availability Workspace ONE with VMware AirWatch and Horizon support for Chromebook is available immediately.

[Update: Confirmed] Google Assistant in Allo is learning Spanish and French Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/09 9:40am PDTMay 9, 2017 39 Plus 1 on G+ 68 Share on Facebook 86 Share on Twitter Total Shares193 Applications Google News Update 1: 2017/05/09 9:43am PDT Confirmed Google rolled out Assistant first in Allo, but it only supported English at launch. Google has been slowly but steadily adding more languages to the Allo version, as well as the voice-activated version on phones. The company has quietly rolled out support for Spanish and French to Assistant in Allo, but it looks to still be in beta. Google has not updated its list of officially supported Assistant languages yet. It currently includes English, German, Hindi, Japanese, and Portuguese. However, we've gotten multiple tips that Assistant has started popping up in conversations happening in French and Spanish. Specifically, users are seeing smart replies in those languages, and they can ask the Assistant bot to use those languages. This appears to be a very recent change. When asked if is spoke French or Spanish before, Assistant would say it was still learning. Now, it offers to set those as the default language in Allo. It sounds like the new languages are a bit rougher around the edges than the "official" ones. Google's head of conversational search, Behshad Behzadi has reportedly said Spanish will be working completely later this year. French might be on the same track, but at least there's progress. Update 1: 2017/05/09 9:43am PDT Confirmed These languages are now confirmed. Google's head of product for Allo has tweeted that Spanish is rolling out. As for French, Google's Canadian blog says French is a go. End of Update Thanks: Roberto and Mikaël Tags allo assistant Google languages subscribe ...

I live in Quebec and my main language is french Canada so I would appreciate interacting with the assistant in French but do not wish to change my default language to French. I want to keep my device setup in English same as I always had my windows in English or any other tech devices.. TVs etc. And depending who I text it can be in English or French so unless it can switch easily it's useless currently. When I tried speaking french it would come up with gibersih words. It works better to just switch my keyboard language and use the mic. That way I am positive it understands what I am saying the first time whether it's French or English. roberto.elena At least in Allo, you don't have to do any changes. My phone has English US as the main system language for UI and Spanish (Spain) as secondary language for speech recognition. In Allo I can chat via text with the Assistant in English, Spanish and German and it understands all 3 without a problem. What I find weird is that the Assistant always replies using the same language, until you explicitly tell it to change to another one, so if I tell it to speak Spanish, it will always reply in Spanish even if I ask questions in English or German. EowynCarter Saying the assistant "speak french" should do that from what i tested. Keept talking english (device language is french), And it wasn't understanding anything before, expecting me to speak english. Then, it got the french sentance alright. Misanthrope Unfortunately, it still speaks English after that. I am in the same situation and don't want to put my device in French. I want to keep it in English and speak French which is impossible EowynCarter Mmm. I can tell the assistant to speak English despite my phone being in French. But I'm using the allo assistant. Girouf Yeah I remember when I was testing the assistant ...although it was using "French France" then cause french Canada was still not a "learned language, it would never switch to French on the fly if I tried dictating an SMS. As I mentioned my system was set as English default and I want it to stay that way. The best solution for me was to turn everything off and just use the mic in the keyboard, switch my language from there and I could easily create a French or English sms that way with the first try. I haven't used it since though so I don't know how it is now if any better. Marc ¡Hola! Omelette du fromage. Arthur J. Means nothing Bru [971] Seems to be out of beta as Google France's facebook page is asking us to try Assistant in French. With no mention of beta. This is how i saw it roberto.elena I think Google still considers it a beta, even when there is no mention of it. Maybe I'm wrong, but the same happened when the Assistant was launched in English in Allo, before the Pixel launch. JD Has it learned french? Or has it learned Quebecois? Qbancelli Gracias, Google! Daniel D’Oleo ¡Por fin, ya habla español! 😃 Can confirm it works in Spanish (Spain/Latin America). https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/737f7c20cd24f2fc2ad7d8dee390630046978e4c2f455b8f88277ae7afa1fcbf.png Diego S. Spanish yesss Petr Kuchyňka And few commands in Czech (like setting an alarm etc.) Gerardo Sarabia this should come to the rest of the Assistant ecosystem, instead of being limited to Allo. Leonardo Baez Thanks for the heads up. I will change my language to spanish now. 👍 cvm And here, I'm trying to learn French... Stefan There is so much to do in the field of bi-lingual and tri-lingual users.. the OS should know when I chat with a specific person what language I use and the keyboard and Assistant should adopt to contacts across the device.. I use three languages on a daily basis and it's a nightmare to say the least. EnerJi Do you use Gboard as your keyboard? Supposedly it auto-detects languages automatically, but I haven't tested it extensively and I'm not sure whether it works well. Stefan yes nexus 5x with clean android and Gboard.. it seems to work every now and then, and only integrates with native android apps. my iPad seems to work better with remembering which language was previously used in the chat.. but that's iMessage ... siri is one language only and that's a BIG reason why I switched to android because google Now understood which language I was speaking in.. google assistant is FAR behind Rod Swiftkey is your friend.

The alleged flaw could allow crooks to make changes to your device and steal everything you have saved on there. 1 Microsoft users risk having their PCs taken over remotely, just by receiving an email The terrifying problem lies in a security tool used in all modern Windows systems. The issue was picked up by Google researcher Tavis Ormandy, who said it was the “worst” Windows remote control flaw he had ever seen. Windows – which is one of the most widely used operating systems in the world – is being updated right now to solve the problem. I think @natashenka and I just discovered the worst Windows remote code exec in recent memory. This is crazy bad. Report on the way. 🔥🔥🔥 — Tavis Ormandy (@taviso) May 6, 2017 In a tweet, Mr Ormandy said the situation is “crazy bad”. Microsoft has marked the bug “critical” and has offered a fix for the problem. The issue effects Windows 7, 8.1 and 10. It should come through to Brits’ systems automatically but you can manually trigger an Windows Update if you’re worried you might be infected. You can do that by clicking on settings and searching for “Windows update” in the search box. Click “install optional updates” and then click “check for updates”. How to check if you're affected by the Microsoft bug If you go to “Windows Defender settings” and check out the Engine version number, anything reading 1.1.13704.0 or higher means you’ve been patched. It should come through to Brits’ systems automatically but you can manually trigger an Windows Update if you’re worried you might be infected. You can do that by clicking on settings and searching for “Windows update” in the search box. Click Install optional updates and then click “check for updates”. Mr Ormandy later praised Microsoft for how quickly it dealt with the bug. Google recently warned of a Google Docs “phishing” scam targeting Gmail users. The “sophisticated” scam was targeting accounts with a message – seemingly from someone in people’s address book – inviting them to share a Google Doc. If you click on the link it appears to go to a Google page asking the user if they wish to allow widespread permission, which if granted gives the fraudsters full access to your account. Doing so also forwards the email on to everyone in the user’s address book, spreading the potential hack even further.

Best iPhone, iPad, & Apple TV game controllers iDevices, the preeminent brand in the connected home industry, announces the compatibility of its connected home products and app with the Google Assistant. This announcement makes iDevices one of the first and few brands to offer compatibility across all three of the most popular smart home platforms; Apple HomeKit™, Amazon Alexa, and now the Google Assistant. Users can now control iDevices products with a simple command like “Ok Google, turn on the lights” to a Google Home voice-enabled speaker powered by the Google Assistant. iDevices’ connected home product lineup includes various switches and outlets, a lightbulb socket adapter, and a thermostat. With Google Assistant support, users will be able to control the products using voice commands via any Google Home, Google Pixel or future voice-enabled Home speakers. If you already own products from iDevices and a Google Home speaker or Pixel, you can enable support by downloading the iDevices Connected app and enabling assistant from the app’s settings. You can then enable the iDevices services from the Google Home app. Earlier this month Google Home added support for a few other products as developers started bringing Assistant to desktops. With the introduction of iDevices today, Google Home currently supports “smart home” products from 18 brands, including: Nest, Philips, Samsung, Honeywell, Belkin, Osram, iHome, Lutron, and others. It also offers integration with other streaming video and audio devices and services. Google maintains a full list of partners on its website.

You’re not the only one. A team of UK data analysts uncovered the most common Google searches made about loved ones – and the results range from bizarre to heartbreaking. The study, conducted by cyber security consultants Online Spy Shop, revealed that the vast majority of family-related Google searches were related to infidelity, mental health and emotional abuse. The most common spouse-related searches were about cheating, with the biggest question about partners being: “Is my boyfriend gay?” The next most common searches for male partners were: “Why does my boyfriend hate me?” and “Why does my husband lie?” Searches from suspicious spouses dominated Google’s suggestions for wives and girlfriends, but concern about mental health was also a common theme. For searches beginning with “Why does my wife…”, Google suggested “hate me?” “ignore me” and “fart?” For questions starting with “Is my girlfriend…”, Google automatically offered up “cheating?”, “pregnant?” and “crazy?” Google Strangely the most common question about dads was “Is my dad alive?”, while stepsisters were the least Googled family members. Hubbies came across badly in the study, with the three most common searches starting with “Why does my husband…” offering up “lie?”, “snore?” and “look at porn?” The top Google suggestion for “Is my mom…” was “pregnant?”, followed by “emotionally abusive?” and “jealous of me?” Google Searches about children were typically health and welfare related. Sibling squabbles appear to drive people to Google in search of answers. “Is my brother annoying?” was the most common, yet seemingly unnecessary, search about brothers, while sisters drove their siblings to ask, “Is my sister an idiot?” Teeth grinding sons, daughters with lice and farting brothers were also common sources of curiosity. Depressingly, the most common autocomplete suggestion of all, for “Why does my…” questions was “hate me?” It was the top suggestion for searches about girlfriends, boyfriends, wives, moms, dads, aunts, brothers, sons, daughters, sisters-in-law and even brothers-in-law. Google Using data collected from Google’s autocomplete function, the data team were able to measure which queries were most frequently made based on the suggestions Google offered. The data team sampled Google’s suggestions over five days, using numerous devices and browsers, to control for biases. Steve Roberts, a cyber security and surveillance consultant at Online Spy Shop, said: “It sadly didn’t come as much of a surprise to us that people turn to the internet for answers about cheating spouses. “It’s such a sensitive subject that people often feel they can’t turn to friends or family. “We’re regularly approached by distressed spouses who are considering using surveillance. “By the time they come to us, they are typically convinced of infidelity and have their own evidence, but are looking for ways to prove it to assist with divorce proceedings.” Read the full results of the survey here. Earlier this year we told how a make-up artist to the stars provided the answers to Google’s most searched-for beauty questions. Meanwhile, these Google searches reveal what the world REALLY thinks of the British.

Google's "Fuchsia" operating system is taking shape with a new design Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/08 10:01am PDTMay 8, 2017 36 Plus 1 on G+ 285 Share on Facebook 93 Share on Twitter Total Shares414 Development Google News We first talked about Fuchsia, a new operating system being developed at Google, back in August (in fact, it was my first post here). At the time, there wasn't much to get excited about besides the potential - it only had a command-line interface. Now the project has a snazzy new, but clearly unfinished, interface. Summary of Fuchsia First, it's worth going over exactly what Fuchsia is, because it's been quite a while since we talked about it. As opposed to all of Google's other OSes, such as Android and Chrome OS, Fuchsia uses the company's new 'Magenta' kernel instead of Linux. According to the project's documentation, Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Magenta's apps and the system interface are written with Google's Flutter SDK, which was initially designed to create cross-platform apps for iOS and Android. Flutter applications are written in Dart, the company's home-grown programming language. All of the system and apps are rendered by 'Escher,' which uses OpenGL or Vulkan to display everything. The 'Armadillo' interface So, on to the new stuff. Fuchsia's system UI has a new name - 'Armadillo.' Ars Technica was able to compile Armadillo into an Android APK, since it is written with the above-mentioned Flutter SDK. The interface doesn't really do anything besides looking pretty, but it does give us an idea of what the finished product could look like. The home screen is a vertical list, with a profile picture, the time, and a battery indicator in the center. Tapping the profile picture brings up something similar to Android's Quick Settings, with toggles for auto-rotate, do not disturb, Airplane Mode, and so on. Above the profile picture is the 'Story,' which the documentation describes as "a set of apps and/or modules that work together for the user to achieve a goal." Currently, this works similarly to Android's Recents screen. Users will also be able to combine stories into a 'Story Cluster.' This is what dragging a Story card into split-screen looks like. Dragging a Story card onto another one triggers a split-screen mode. The user can split an app 50/50 vertically or horizontally, drag in another app for a 33/33/33 split, or even have a tab bar appear for using all the open apps in full-screen. You can even have two apps split vertically next to two other split apps, seen below. This is far more flexible than Android's current multi-tasking functionality, but whether or not it will stay this way is uncertain. Below the profile picture is a panel resembling Google Now, with a placeholder search bar and suggestion cards. Armadillo's documentation says, "a suggestion is a representation of an action the user can take to augment an existing story or to start a new one. [The] suggestion contains enough information to create the visual representation of that concept." So maybe they will work more like an app launcher? It's hard to tell at this point. The Google Now panel, showing Fuchsia's keyboard. Keep in mind that all of this is subject to change, as the Armadillo interface (and the rest of Fuchsia OS) is still under heavy development. It's also hard to tell what Google's plans are for the operating system. Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware, or will it some day replace Android altogether? We'll have to wait and see.

Suicide_Note Because Google can. Corbin Davenport Ron from Ars Technica put it best: "Fuchsia really seems like a project that asks 'how would we design Android today, if we could start over?' It's a brand-new, Google-developed kernel running a brand-new, Google-developed SDK that uses a brand-new, Google-developed programming language and it's all geared to run Google's Material Design interface as quickly as possible. Google gets to dump Linux and the GPL, it can dump Java and the problems it caused with Oracle, and Google can basically insulate itself from all of Android's upstream projects and bring all the development in-house. Doing such a thing on the scale of Android today would be a massive project." makapav Would it still be open source? Also, what would happen to all the existing APKs? Corbin Davenport Fuchisa is completely open source right now. As for running Android apps, maybe Google will add some kind of stop-gap compatibility layer for running Android apps, like Chrome OS has. destinyhud read the article Suicide_Note Perhaps instead of replacing Android, this will *become* Android, as in Android P or Q? Or be the merger of Android/Chrome? m477 I could see that as Android 10. Definitely too early for P. morteum I wonder if the reason it is called "Armadillo" is because they're starting from A again, but this time they're using animals instead of desserts. Christopher Bement I think it's a smart plan, based on the guess that there's more animals to pick from in the world than tasty desserts. teolinux Ubuntu docet Paul "Tasty treats," not necessarily desserts. That said, armadillos could be a tasty treat. I won't judge. MJ I have heard desserts and candy used before which are wrong but "tasty treats" is a new one for me. To be more accurate, Android names are actually all confectionery foods. A "tasty treat" could be a slice of pizza (aka Android S). LOL Randy Gindy Armadillo is the name of the UI not the OS build itself. Matt74UK Smooth on the inside, crunchy on the outside. Armadillo ! (a few UK people of a certain age may get that). Russell Brown That bloke's a nutter... Edit: nope, that was Dime Bar. :( Nomaan Shouldnt we compare armadillo to holo/material and not to dessert names? Or am i missing something. morteum I don't think so, those are design languages and while this is a redesign of layout and function, it is still pretty much using Material Design. I could be wrong but I don't think this is closer to a build version. John Doe Idk this is a whole new OS with a new kernel, I doubt this will be done with an OTA update for Android. Mantas Pakėnas Even nowadays, some of Android's new functionality cannot be done via OTA updates (like dual system partitions, forced encryption I believe, etc). To make a completely hard cut sometime when this is ready, and if it's meant to replace Android, is not completely unimaginable. As is updating via OTA. If apple was able to change their file system via OTA, I don't see why changing most of the parts would not be possible. However, nobody aside from Google would do it, almost guaranteed :) Suicide_Note It could likely be done for Pixel devices, and possibly for future devices released after this new version of the OS rolls out. Adrian Meredith quite possibly, after all there no reason it couldn't also run android apps jonathan What they need to do is make this googles very own os for their pixel line and leave android for the oems Suicide_Note Not a chance. To much name recognition with Android for Google to drop it in favor of something else specific to the Pixel lineup. Dallas King Android Z confirmed! Suicide_Note More like Android A for Armadillo. m477 APK plz (no, really, I want a compiled apk the demo) Maxwell “Max” Weinbach https://github.com/fuchsia-mirror/sysui MJ Your link wasn't what the OP asked for... Maxwell “Max” Weinbach the only way to get the APK is to compile it yourself, so I linked to the Github page to a place to download the files to compile. The closest they will get. MJ Than you should have replied there is no known APK or not at all. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach It does not matter that much. I am building the APK right now. Once it is done I will post it. Here is the link on how to compile it. http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo MJ Don't waste your time... They updated that article with an download of the APK. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach thanks. they just did that. I still compiled it myself though. I will try to get more out of it while I have the Sysui downloaded. Michel R. https://www.androidfilehost.com/?w=files&flid=178684 there you go MJ http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo Latex beats nudity More of Proprietary code ? No thank you, we already had enough with this Pixel crud. I hope this OS dies quicker or become a chromebook OS. m477 It's open source. Latex beats nudity It's OSS but just like Android It'll be more heavily dependent on the google APIs to make it work. Look at the Pixel SysUI, Just being OSS doesn't make it open source... It's Google's OS not a Linux Based one. If this is going to replace Android It's doomsday on multiple levels. destinyhud billions of people dont care if its running linux kernel or not. maybe very few like u might. do iphone users care why kernel it runs. none of them care. u r just noise tbh Latex beats nudity Billions of people don't code. You are being a kool-aid joke tbh. destinyhud exaclt only few code and even on that few many dont care if it runs linux or not. look at iphone there are more dev there and yet they dont care for kernel. u r delusional in ur own world m477 Android it's already been on a Google-dependent road for years. I don't think this is going to change either way. An Angry Chihuahua https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/magenta/+/master/docs/getting_started.md heres the source code. do some research my dude WitnessG Imagining this running on a Google made processor is exciting. Badouken If this was the OS for the Pixel 2 alongside a Google made processor I think id cry! WitnessG Yeah I don't see this coming out for at least another 2-3 years. Badouken Indeed, but we can dream! ha Suicide_Note Maybe the Pixel 3 or 4 will see the dream become reality. Suicide_Note I'm betting this is what we'll see in a couple years time. As another commenter stated, starting with Armadillo could be Google's way of starting from the beginning (letter A codename), since there's more animal babes to use for each letter than there are dessert names to use. Timothy Vreeland You are getting the furries excited. Evelynmtalley Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Nomaan Armadillo should be compared to holo/material and not to dessert names. nachofrand What makes you think Google would be good at making SoCs? They're a software company and don't have the hardware expertise for hardcore ASIC development like that. Granted they can hire people, but in the end, does it matter? They're going to use ARM either way. UnlikeABoss Google fanboyism. The same reason he's excited over a brand new OS. He knows absolutely nothing about it, short of the fact that it will create more fragmentation not only in the OS space, but also the kernel space. So all we know are negative things so far. This is what we call exciting now is it? Why? Just because Google is doing it? If Microsoft made this exact same announcement, would we all be excited? Oh dear. Zsolt V No, because essentially everybody loathes Microsoft. Almost nobody's life would be worse if Microsoft vanished. marcusmarcus2 Don't they design and build their own servers to use for all their websites? Seems like those hardware work well for them. Sergii Pylypenko It's one thing to assemble the server using off-the-shelf components, or even to order a custom motherboard. It's a very different thing to design and manufacture your own chips. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying it is the same, just that they are not only software experts. Them designing and building the servers show they do have hardware expertise that could assist them in doing the same to chips. Zsolt V Except Google's servers are not assembled from off the shelf components. Haven't been for a few years now. Roy What about TPU? Owais Lone They DO design their own chips as well especially chips meant to run specialized AI (tensoflow) code Adrian Vovk Samsung Exynos devices are faster than Snapdragon, iPhones seem underpowered but are extremely snappy, etc. The point is that making both the software and hardware leads to a very fast ecosystem. Also, Google are making the TPU for neural networks nachofrand Yes, as expected. Exynos is faster than Snapdragon on the Galaxy phones, but put an Exynos in another phone...oh wait, you can't. That's the whole entire point. Snapdragon SoCs are general purpose SoCs and can be used for a multitude of phones so they're not custom tuned to every phone individually. Exynos have very specific power rails and the chip is made specifically for that phone. The thing is, sure this is better, but it's marginal and hardly worth talking about. They both use the same ARM architecture so performance gains are pretty negligible. Besides that, this is how Samsung makes money....off of device sales. Google doesn't make money that way. That isn't their business model so at this point it doesn't make sense for them to build their own SoCs when they could just work closer with hardware companies. They make their own TPUs because it aligns with their business model. Adrian Vovk The instruction set doesn't really matter? I can have a 6700k and a 6500k and the 6700k will perform much better even though they are both amd64. With what Google is doing with the Pixels (still as snappy as day one here) I'm pretty sure they can optimize it further than Samsung does. They have made it run smoother in some cases on a chip that they didn't manufacture. If they made their own chip it would allow them many freedoms that they otherwise don't have = easier design of the device. I brought up the TPUs because that is experience in chip manufacturing Jason What makes you say iPhones are under powered ? Apples chips are some of the fastest around and are extremely powerful. Adrian Vovk Specs wise. They have much worse specs on paper and it would lead to a slower experience, except Apple can optimize it because they make both the chip and the OS SHunter On their Own hardware running their software in their own eco system. You cant really fairly compare it to anything else. Stephen Sharp They could use Risc-V and have to pay to license absolutely nothing, while being able to make processors purpose built for their OS Randy Gindy That would be an interesting move. Stephen Sharp Indeed, I really want Risc-V to succeed as an open ISA nachofrand They could. But in my opinion, it's unlikely. Google isn't trying to compete with Samsung and Apple in device sales and that isn't their business model. People using their services so they can show ads is their business model. It doesn't make sense for Google to make their own SoC when others are already doing a good job. Plus, if they went to RISC-V then what? What about the modem? They have to buy a standalone modem from Qualcomm or Intel. Now you have to hire system integration and test engineers to make sure the modem is working with your SoC. Oh and then you need a whole firmware team to control the modem. At that point, buy a full blown SoC with the modem on chip. Stephen Sharp Eh you lost me at "Pixel phone" and all the other hardware they sell. Google also is a Platinum member of the Risc-V foundation, and if there is a direction they are going, more control or less control, I would guess it's "more". But that's just a guess nachofrand Hardware isn't even close to the same thing as asic development. IC design is a different world. Granted they do some custom hardware, but SoCs are a much much larger feat. It's still a possibility they do so, but it doesn't make sense with their current business model imo. Randy Gindy He said nothing about ASIC he is talking about RISC-V Randy Gindy I disagree with you completely. They are penetrating the IoT market, auto market, healthcare, phones, robotics, self driving, networking, etc. Them making in house chips could really benefit every project they have. Also building an OS from the ground up to work with in house chips would be smart. Look at Apple as an example. They also may let manufacturers to use the designs. If Android One isn't evidence for them to want to standardize their platforms I don't know what is. Captain On! 1 - Google has stated that they're going to make their own silicon for the Pixels in time. 2 - Google actually owns/operates the world's most powerful quantum computer. They know how to make chips. Randy Gindy That quantum computer was built by DWave though Angel I read (somewhere don’t remember) that they have three different quantum computers systems. One from DWave and two home-produced. From those two, one was made by engineers and not that disimilar from DWave in its operations. The other was made by physicists and uses a different approach. nachofrand 1. I could be wrong, but I've only read that they plan on working closer with chip manufacturers. 2. Google didn't make that computer. Even if they did, quantum is so different those skills don't even translate. Romario Maxwell Google made their own custom ASIC called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) for their AI/Machine Learning needs on their cloud platform. See https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/05/Google-supercharges-machine-learning-tasks-with-custom-chip.html and https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/04/quantifying-the-performance-of-the-TPU-our-first-machine-learning-chip.html nachofrand Sure, although a TPU is just an accelerator. Think of it as the hexagon DSP inside of the Snapdragon SoC. That's like 1/10 of the entire chip. SoC design is much larger. Timothy Vreeland How many examples of hardware design do people have to point out before you stop? Sure the hardware they worked on previously isn't exactly the same... But before they started the hardware they are currently working on, they worked on previous hardware that wasn't the same as what they are doing now. They have shown they are competent in designing many kinds of hardware. Or do you suggest a company can only build one kind of hardware and nothing else for all eternity? How did Samsung make it's current in-house chips? Did they go to ARM college? Have they been making ARM chips since the dawn of time? No. They put together some teams and got to work, so stop blabbing and being negative. sweenish Their AI that finally beat the world's top Go players was running on custom Google chips. It's not like they don't know how. theProffer They have enough liquid assets to do whatever they want, abandon it, and then do it again without even noticing they spent the money. (Which is actually the source of a few of their problems, I think.) Matt Is that why they gave up on fiber? Pixelexel Imagine a Google Pixel with a Google made processor, with Fuschia, with Project Fi with Google WiFi powered by Google fiber. If I'd have this, my life would be complete. Owais Lone and all our data with it :( needa At least it is only one company getting it. Iamsecond Ha, no. A Google processor? Supported for 18 months, then replaced with a new processor that performs half as well (but has stickers.) Does not fully process Android code, because at Google one hand doesn't even know the other hand is there, let alone talk to it. Has 20 cores (only 2 enabled outside US for 'reasons.') Has a dedicated co-processor to enable ads in every app, even those that previously didn't have them. the.cyber.trekker I spit my coffee out on my monitor reading this!! ROFLMFAO! Jason Google can't even get a phone out the door without issues and you want them to make the chips too...lol. I'll pass. UnlikeABoss "In house kernel instead of Linux". Yeah, hopefully this dies in a thousand pits of fire. "Hey Linux guys, you know how you've helped us make billions over the years with a free open source kernel? Well, we were just using you to get the "nerd" userbase. Now we own the market thanks to you guys promoting its use of Linux, we will gradually phase you out." .... m477 I hope not. Linux is not really a kernel made with smartphone in minds. I don't care for being a fan of a kernel over another. UnlikeABoss Yeah. I'd much rather use a brand new untested kernel (and all the teething issues that will come with it) in my smartphone than a mature, stable one that's hacked on by hundreds and thousands of people every month. I mean, it's just a smartphone, we don't need it to be a secure environment, right? Let's just make a nice obscure kernel that no one else will use, and just say "but but it's open source!!! love us because we are Google kk". ... ihsan ışık I'm sorry but it just looks like you are a huge Linux fan and are just against change to me. UnlikeABoss Looks can be deceiving. If you're going to fling around the Linux fanboy term, i'll fling around the Google fanboy term, and that will surely be a nice constructive argument that we will both want to continue. m477 So, in 10 years we should still be using an unoptimised kernel like Linux, because anything newer is, well, newer? UnlikeABoss Yeah, because Linux hasn't changed at all in 10 years... m477 Yes, it changed a lot, and it still has many of the same problems, which are intrinsically bound to its structure. It's not a kernel well suited for mobile devices. UnlikeABoss You think the solution is to throw it out the window and start from scratch? I disagree. I'd much rather continue improving the Linux kernel, simply because of all the eyes it will always have on its code. jonathan Play nice ladies lol m477 With this mentality we wouldn't have Linux at all. Why start anything, while we can continue this other thing which purpose was completely different? A mircokenel is more well suited than a monolitic kernel to a mobile devices, both in terms of performance and security. No matter how much you improve Linux, it will never be a microkernel. UnlikeABoss Smartphones don't need a micro kernel in 2017. You could make that argument 7 years ago. Linux can be compiled with the required drivers just like it always could. m477 I made that argument 7 years ago. They always needed something different from Linux. The fact that specific, even proprietary drivers have to be integrated in the kernel (since Android lacks an abstraction layer) is on of the problems of the interaction Android-Linux. destinyhud why havent the nerds made linux on pc's a bigger market share if they were the one who made android a global leader UnlikeABoss No nerd is promoting Linux on the desktop. All social media used to be full of people promoting Android over iOS, these days there's no need to. destinyhud why havent they promoted desktop?? just wondering why they did for android but not for desktop.. linux on desktop was an underdog for decades. android was not popular because of kernal. android became popular because it was opensource and was the only viable competition to ios. people dont care what kernel it runs. UnlikeABoss No nerd worth their salt would promote an environment that would be a downgrade from Windows. Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time, it had a very equal playing field. There's a difference between promoting a good solid FOSS kernel where possible, and promoting an agenda. m477 Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time By this, I get that you never used Android and iOS side by side in 2009-10. UnlikeABoss You clearly value different things. The hackability alone made it an upgrade through its lifetime. m477 The same can be said for GNU/Linux on desktop. UnlikeABoss No it can't, because hackability =/= app availability. i.e. The hackability on Linux desktop doesn't make it win over it's lack of apps, where that isn't an issue on Android. m477 App availability was horrible in the early days, compared to iOS. Even Symbian had more apps. UnlikeABoss That was fine since the early days didn't consist of using your smartphone for very much, due to under powered hardware. Techies didn't go around saying "use iOS because we can all take selfies and stick filters on it". m477 iOS devices didn't have front cameras until mid 2010. The system was better, faster, smoother, the interface was coesive, there were many more apps, and the jailbreak community, to address the techie audience you like to go on about so much, was very, very good. There were tweaks and modifications that even the wildest Android custom ROM didn't have at the time. Android was objectively a downgrade, as much as Linux was on desktop. UnlikeABoss Calling jailbraik an advantage over a FOSS OS is pretty hilarious. iOS wasn't popular because it was better, it was popular because of the amount of people getting their advice from paid employees in store. "Buy iOS so we get a commission". m477 iPhone was more popular for various reasons: marketing, having 2 years of advantage, and, yes, more marketing. But it was also better than Android, as an OS. What benefit did Android bring, with it being opensource, compared to iOS, even to a "techie"? The dev community was laughable in the early days. Why GNU/Linux on desktop was not promoted by "techies" (which is false) and Android was, even if their shortcomings were identical? destinyhud u live in a dream world. even most dev dont care about kernel. what they care about the dev platform. I am a dev and i dont care for the kernel UnlikeABoss If you're talking from the perspective of an app developer then ofcourse you don't care about the kernel, you care about which platform will make you the most money... destinyhud exactly. no one care what kernel it runs.. all dev care is what platform make money. so who is this nerd who care about kernel if most dont care about the kernel.. yeah very very few.. infact rare like u UnlikeABoss Techie == Technology Enthusiast. You can sit here and tell me that you would use the best dev environment all you want but the truth is if the iOS dev environment was awful you'd still suck it up and use it to make your money. I'm not sure how you can class yourself as an enthusiast at that point. destinyhud ever wonder why no one is up voting u and upvoting many of my comments? because what u say is BS. its that simple. I am up for ditching outdated linux if the new kernal is modern and build for modern devices. most dont care for this very few techies.. i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die.. UnlikeABoss "Ever wonder why Google fanboys upvote pro Google content and not anti-Google content?" No, no I don't wonder that. How dare someone critique a pointless change by Google, causing unnecessary fragmentation. Burn them! destinyhud u must be new here.. look at anti google comments here when they make stupid changes but if they make welcome changes people tend to agree UnlikeABoss No, I've been here a long time and made many anti-Google comments as well as pro-Google. No one in the right mind would cheer on kernel fragmentation other than those that think Google can do no wrong. destinyhud open up ur comments history and let me see if u made pro google comments. i have a feeling u r a troll UnlikeABoss Yeah, this discussion is going no where. You are not the authority here and the idea that you want to browse my history to make sure I fall in line is creepy as hell. Bye. destinyhud lol i see u dont want to open ur comments history. obvious troll m477 outdated linux i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die Woah, wait a second here. Linux is not outdated, and its death would be terrible for everyone. It's just that it's not the most apt kernel for a mobile device. destinyhud maybe not outdated but not the right fit for mobile devices. destinyhud android sucked when compared to ios.. it was a downgrade compared to ios. why did dev promote android and not desktop linux? u reasoning dont even make sense. UnlikeABoss No, it wasn't a downgrade. destinyhud yes, it was back in android initial release. iOS was better and much more polished at that time. but things changed now. UnlikeABoss "Polished" is not a factor that is used to judge a better OS. There are Linux environments that are much more polished than Windows 10, but that doesn't make desktop Linux better. destinyhud it was both polished and runs better than android at that time. polished was not the only one. it was also polished. android only got better later.. i have used android at that time and it sucked big time. UnlikeABoss You are using today's standards to judge it. If you do that, they both sucked. It worked perfectly fine for the basic things people were using it for at the time. destinyhud they both sucked at that time but android sucked more than iOS at that time. SVem26 I like to think I am in the nerd userbase and I don't care what kernel is used.. can you help me understand why it matters? UnlikeABoss Do you want a brand new obscure kernel in thing that holds most of your sensitive details? TipTop I don't want something that dates back to 90s, is full of zero-days and horrible code contributed by nobodies. UnlikeABoss The idea that it is full of zero days is hilarious. You do realize that the majority of Linux exploits are local, right? Unlike Windows. Yes there is obviously code from the 90s, but very, very little of it. Not to mention that age is not a factor in deciding bad code. The idea that old code is bad code shows your inexperience. By that standard, should we dismiss Chrome because of all the exploits being found in code that was written when it first started? Are we going to create brand new software every few years to purge "old code"? Do you have any idea whatsoever how much Linux has actually changed? Do you have any idea how much of this change is because it's considered a "universal" kernel everyone can use and is focusing on? Do you really think splitting the community over onto another kernel will increase security for either of those kernels? There's a little something called code maturity. There's a reason Microsoft has way less exploits in its kernel today than 10 years ago. They didn't write a new kernel from scratch. TipTop But it is. You can be in denial all you want. Linux is the OS that is used by botnets for DDoSing websites not Windows. UnlikeABoss No sorry, come back to reality. Botnets consist of all types of OS, including Linux ofc. It is not the majority of bots in a botnet, that statement alone shows how clueless you are. Also, do you understand what Linux is? It's a kernel. The majority of Linux hosts in a botnet have been hacked through exploits in outdated software, not the kernel. The same cannot be said for Windows. Again, read the statistics for the severity of Linux exploits versus Windows. More exploits are found in Linux overall because it is open source, however, that doesn't make it worse. More critical and high severity exploits are found in Windows. That speaks a lot for the secure design of Linux. Hopefully you'll do some reading and learn. Sir_Brizz All OSes are full of vulnerabilities and horrible code written by nobodies. If that is your requirement then you must have gone full luddite by now. TipTop Windows is written by paid professionals and has QA/QC. Linux is written by fat nerds for free and has no quality control but nice try. Don't gve me the top contributors crap. Sir_Brizz Yes, tell me again how many zero day vulnerabilities are found in Windows and how long they take to get fixed. Even worse, tell me that with macOS. Being paid doesn't guarantee quality, just as being unpaid doesn't guarantee garbage. Windows and macOS have some of the crappiest insecure code. And there is nothing special about having QA or being paid to write code. Some of the worst programmers I have ever met worked at places like Microsoft and Apple. https://mobile.twitter.com/taviso/status/860681252034142208 Please continue trying to tell me how infallible paid programmers are! UnlikeABoss They are totally da bestest eva! UnlikeABoss Obviously paid products will always be better than unpaid products... right!?!? /s Oh wait we have tons of real life examples of free products being better than paid, shocking how that works. It's almost as if the best products are made by the most passionate people, and like, being paid doesn't guarantee being passionate about your creation. What a crazy crazy world! ihsan ışık Are you implying that Android got popular because of "nerds" who heard it uses the Linux kernel? UnlikeABoss If you are old enough to know the early days of android you'll know that having every single nerd on the internet promoting Android over iOS most certainly helped get the ball rolling. Once it was pushed, it snowballed into what it is today. m477 Sure. It was the nerds on the internet, not the manufacturers with ads everywhere. Most people still don't know their Galaxy runs Android. UnlikeABoss The giant billboards came YEARS afterwards, cmon. m477 Yes, and that's why Android was so unpopular in the early days. UnlikeABoss What? It was massively popular among all techies for being the open source iOS alternative. m477 You are overestimating the "techies" crowd. Even BlackBerryOS was more popular at the time. Only after the Galaxy S it started to grow, and became popular among normal people. UnlikeABoss Not really. We are talking over a decade ago now, there were far less people on the internet and it was far easier for techies to promote products because everyone was asking their "techie" friend what is best. But these days everyone is an "expert" so that's not as much of a thing. m477 Again, you overestimate how many techies there actually were. Your personal experience is anecdotal. Market shares and sell data are objective. Also, over a decade ago Android was still a camera os, and it wasn't public. UnlikeABoss No, I do not. The further back in time you go, the higher the proportion of techies there were using the internet versus others. People were only just starting to look at buying a smartphone, and asking techies what they should buy. m477 Yes, the concentration on the internet of "techies" on the internet was greater. And? What normal user at the time went to the internet, looked at reviews and said "Oh, look! The HTC magic has Linux! This random guy says its good, so I'm gonna buy it!"? You really think that a bunch of "techies">marketing? A guy saying that his toy-looking HTC G1 is better than the iPhone is more effective than billboards and tv ads? Come on, even Windows Mobile was more popular. It took Samsung's aggressive marketing to make Android popular. UnlikeABoss Windows Mobile and BlackBerry were more popular in the enterprise, that's it. The entire discussion is home users. Also I think there's been some confusion. I wasn't implying that techies on the internet were promoting Android on the internet like a marketing department. I was implying that the internet was very much a "social media" platform for techies to communicate where the majority of them would use Android and mocked the use of iOS. The actual "marketing" happened offline when a normal user would ask their "techie" friend for first time buying advice. It is nothing like that today, and the internet is nothing like the techie community it once was. m477 So, what you're saying is that the internet was a circlejerk of Android users. Ok, and? It didn't affected normal users the slightest, iOS was still more popular until Samsung took Android more seriously. The techie friend thing its only your anecdotal experience, it bears no influence on the market, in the grand scheme of things. I'd even argue that Google's very light marketing did much, much more. Also, the mindless techies that recommended half backed devices instead of better alternatives because "Uh, Linux!!" did more harm than good, both to the users and to Android. UnlikeABoss If you read my OP you'll see my original point was that Google has rode the "Android circlejerk" to popularity, and you can debate how much popularity that added as much as you want. The fact remains, it got the ball rolling. Samsung didn't pick it up "just because", it saw that a lot of people were pushing it. There were several OS at the time it could have used, including sticking to its own. Why bother with Android? Maybe because it wanted to see how much market it could take by appealing to techies? However, if you stand back and look at it, how is this any different from "embrace, extend, extinguish"? Google used that "free marketing" and has now decided to use it's massive popularity to push a different product. (Which has failed in the past and will hopefully fail again). Why hate Microsoft for doing that in the past, but we praise Google for doing it? Why are we excited for something we know nothing about that is creating fragmentation? m477 Samsung had used several OSes, it had Windows Mobile and Phone devices, Symbian devices, and proprietary devices, even Palm OS devices IIRC. They used them all. Android had was the easiest to personalise for them, and create a copy of the best selling product, which was the iPhone, and there was an app market, so they tried to release and market their flagship with it, and market it as broadly as Apple. The first Galaxy (the "non S") was was vastly ignored, because it was as little marketed as all their other devices. The techies crowd was insignificant. The free marketing is just as much as Windows 10 gets for incorporating Ubuntu's bash terminal. What you saw is not really important. I saw lots and lots of Windows Phones in 2010 and 11. Many more than Android devices. Every one I knew had one, and if I had to say which OS was the most popular only based on my personal experience, in my smallish city, I'd obviously would say Windows Phone. Why are you so attached to Linux, excluding all possibilities of giving a possibly better solution a try? The community will just fork the AOSP and continue the development of the Linux branch. UnlikeABoss Cmon, we both know Android was not easier for them to customize than simply using their own OS. No one was recommending it, techie or not, no matter how much they marketed. It's only now they are popular they are trying to slip in their own OS, and still failing. I am not attached to Linux despite people using it as an easy scapegoat to dismiss a discussion critiquing almighty Google. We currently have a situation where most kernel developers focus entirely on Linux, making it virtually the universal kernel. Why are we creating pointless fragmentation there? Why divide that community? Do we honestly believe that a divided community can produce a better kernel, or do we love it because Google is doing it? Would we love it if Microsoft did this? m477 The proprietary OS they used at the time was a Java based thing with a flash interface. Hardly able to compete against iOS. It was easier for them to use the "next Symbian" that they could customise as they wanted, and that also had an app market. If they made, say, Bada, before Android become established and popular, and marketed it as much as they did with their Galaxy S, the market would be very different today. The normal user doesn't care what OS their shiny phone runs, as long as there's facebook. I am a GNU/Linux user since the first half of the 2000s, and I've always critiqued Google for using Linux as a kernel on phones. Linux might be the universal kernel, but smartphones need a more streamlined solution. I don't care if it's Google, the MIT, or Richard Stallman in person to do it. I liked WP8 architecture. Fragmentation is not pointless if it brings benefits to the user. TipTop Nobody cares about your FSF agenda. John Q I think the chief reason Google is not using Linux is that they want a real-time OS (RTOS). Linux is at best a "soft" RTOS, possessing a real-time scheduler but this is still not nearly as real-time as an actual RTOS should be. It would take a very large effort to do that for Linux so it makes sense that Google would want to make their own kernel that they can have full control over. UnlikeABoss Let's ignore the fact that Linux is used in real time car systems for a moment. Could you elaborate on why you think Google would want/need a RTOS on their smartphones? M6 The kernel they're using, 'magenta', is opened source. So who cares if they're using linux or not? Does everyone have to use linux? UnlikeABoss No it doesn't have to be Linux. But who else will use Magenta? Probably no one. So why are we fragmenting the kernel space further? Why would you choose an immature kernel for something as valuable (your data) as your smartphone. Would you trust that? I would much rather developers continue focusing on a single kernel. WesleySmalls But wouldn't Magenta be this single kernel? UnlikeABoss If everyone decided to ditch Linux and focus purely on Magenta as the universal kernel, yes. Will that happen? WesleySmalls Could be, just not overnight. The market was already fairly well developed when Linux arrived in 1991, yet it still managed to become a very, if not the most, important player in the market. It's certainly possible, it will just require proper investment(and neglect of their alternate platforms) and patience to make it work M6 That's some straight up communist shit right there. Let's just work on one thing, because we only need one thing, everything else is redundant! Let's not allow other people to do the same thing in a different way, because competition totally doesn't spur innovation at all. WORPspeed So Andromeda definitely dead or still happening? sleepinlight Pretty sure this IS Andromeda, or at least a part of it. Andromeda was never an official name for anything, it was just the internal project name for some sort of new and/or merged OS. WORPspeed I thought Andromeda specifically referred to merging Android and Chrome OS. So is that specific merger dead or on life-support? John Q Nah, the Android/Chrome merger was just speculation from what Andromeda seemed to be. There was never any concrete evidence to imply that Andromeda was a merger. WORPspeed To quote Androidpolice : "So please, when you see Fuchsia mentioned, or speculation that it "is" Andromeda, know that it is just that: speculation. Last we heard from sources we consider extremely reliable, Android was the basis of Andromeda, and Andromeda would see its commercial debut on a new Pixel laptop later this year. It is possible Google has changed plans around Andromeda, that the initiative itself may have even been scrapped. Though, we have no reason to think so - it's more that we don't know, and haven't heard anything about Andromeda in quite some time." http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ WORPspeed http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ That makes them seem very separate Srujan https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e7fda716dfcfdca76e200e51a9c9144c72e183c7e76d36b910c20ee0931aee79.gif destinyhud if this replaces android rather than having 2 separate codebase, I am all up for it. splitting the android community is dangerous senor_heisenberg Well if this does end up being what replaces Android or what Android evolves into, I just hope my apps and whatnot are compatible. Ain't got the time or money to be investing into another ecosystem. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman That's a tricky, double-edged sword. I can't fathom they would not support the old apps, or at least the vast majority of them, for exactly that reason. But in doing so it will likely be held back at least slightly from what it can/should be. Backward-compatibility tends to hold everything back. What I'd wager is we won't see this until hardware's powerful enough to make emulating the old system in a VM relatively cheap and easy, with back-end Play Store penalties to developers who don't shift to the new app models, and then slow phase-outs in stages of the older functionality and support until the new OS is running exclusively its own setup. senor_heisenberg That sounds good. Randy Gindy I think Google porting the Android Run-time to Chrome OS was to see if they could do it. morteum This is old news, I'm waiting for Fuchsia 2.0 Barracuda. /s marcusmarcus2 What if they aren't going by Animal names in general but by mammal names.

Suicide_Note There is no update problem. Nexus/Pixels run the latest and greatest. OEMs who mess with the OS give their customers severely delayed updates. pfmiller Nexus and Pixels run the latest and greatest for two years. Nobody would accept this OS update situation if it was on a desktop OS. MJ Thank God it's phones we are talking about and not a desktop PC. marcusmarcus2 That is exactly why Windows XP lasted only a couple years before all computers updated to Windows 7... Seriously though. I'm fine with only getting Android version upgrades phones for 2 years. But they really need to extend out security updates beyond 3 years. Suicide_Note This isn't a desktop OS, not to mention people tend to change phones much more often than their desktops. pfmiller Sure it's not a desktop OS, but no sense pretending that what we have leaves nothing to be desired. And sure people change their phones more often that their desktops, but there's absolutely no reason to change every 2 years. Suicide_Note I change phones at least once a year, and sometimes two or three times. I couldn't imagine going two years or more on the same phone. pfmiller You can do what you look like, but there's absolutely no reason why that would be necessary. Suicide_Note It's only necessary if you want the latest and greatest, which i like to have, because phone tech is still evolving and improving at a good clip. For example, had i skipped the Pixel, I'd still be using my 6P or N6, both of which have cameras that are vastly inferior to that in the Pixel. I've taken some incredible shots with the Pixel, some of which would be literally impossible to duplicate using the camera in the 6P/N6. That alone is reason enough for me to upgrade on a yearly basis. Doby Gillis Which is a problem, Einstein. Suicide_Note Not if you're a Nexus/Pixel owner, Dilbert. Randy Gindy I would generally say there is. Android phones are not supported for nearly as long as an iPhone. The reason being that the chip set manufacturers do not release new drivers. Shelly-Man Vol 2 It's looks pretty neat for a development stage. Rami Well Android has to reach Z someday.

Neither, this is just a side project many developers use to test and work out the feasability of a variety of things. Android is a very well developed environment, and replacing it whole is simply a no-go. Things will just gradually evolve, as they have already done with Dalvik being replaced by ART, for example. Sir_Brizz I don't think you're wrong, but it would be in Google's best interest to start building a non-JVM runtime that apps can run inside with a native language that Google has 100% full control over like Go or Dart.

Darth Vader 3rd* JG Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Modern personal computers huh? I've been interested in Google packing ChromeOS into a LiveCD type set up we could test/install on our own computers... (*Yes, I know of Chromium, haven't tried it yet... But I would prefer it coming direct from Google, faster updates and all that). It could be interesting to try out another of Google's OSs without having to fork over several hundred for new hardware... The only problem would be drivers to support the various hardware. If not modified too much, ChromeOS could possibly use the original Gentoo Linux drivers. But with Fuchsia using its own unique kernel... That might throw things off a bit... I know a few less tech-savey individuals who would probably be more comfortable if the same OS powered their phone, tablet and desktop (should Google opt to replace Android with Fuchsia).

[Update: Confirmed] Google Assistant in Allo is learning Spanish and French Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/05/09 9:40am PDTMay 9, 2017 39 Plus 1 on G+ 68 Share on Facebook 86 Share on Twitter Total Shares193 Applications Google News Update 1: 2017/05/09 9:43am PDT Confirmed Google rolled out Assistant first in Allo, but it only supported English at launch. Google has been slowly but steadily adding more languages to the Allo version, as well as the voice-activated version on phones. The company has quietly rolled out support for Spanish and French to Assistant in Allo, but it looks to still be in beta. Google has not updated its list of officially supported Assistant languages yet. It currently includes English, German, Hindi, Japanese, and Portuguese. However, we've gotten multiple tips that Assistant has started popping up in conversations happening in French and Spanish. Specifically, users are seeing smart replies in those languages, and they can ask the Assistant bot to use those languages. This appears to be a very recent change. When asked if is spoke French or Spanish before, Assistant would say it was still learning. Now, it offers to set those as the default language in Allo. It sounds like the new languages are a bit rougher around the edges than the "official" ones. Google's head of conversational search, Behshad Behzadi has reportedly said Spanish will be working completely later this year. French might be on the same track, but at least there's progress. Update 1: 2017/05/09 9:43am PDT Confirmed These languages are now confirmed. Google's head of product for Allo has tweeted that Spanish is rolling out. As for French, Google's Canadian blog says French is a go. End of Update Thanks: Roberto and Mikaël Tags allo assistant Google languages subscribe ...

Paul_Werner https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4144818d866c1fb25ae6ed88df45dd0de5a0e7794672d3f6ff9258979b26e080.jpg Kenni Odelheim Now add Danish :) Francois Roy Almost there https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7f4f877561ea887017e0bb26ec933c9506f44996a9c173cc3264075c4a0d93b1.png Mattia Italy is patiently waiting :D stuffcompare http://www.stuffcompare.com here you can get mobile features, new upcoming mobiles, and reviews Girouf Interesting but unless they change how the whole default language setup works, I will not be enabling the assistant on my device. I live in Quebec and my main language is french Canada so I would appreciate interacting with the assistant in French but do not wish to change my default language to French. I want to keep my device setup in English same as I always had my windows in English or any other tech devices.. TVs etc. And depending who I text it can be in English or French so unless it can switch easily it's useless currently. When I tried speaking french it would come up with gibersih words. It works better to just switch my keyboard language and use the mic. That way I am positive it understands what I am saying the first time whether it's French or English. roberto.elena At least in Allo, you don't have to do any changes. My phone has English US as the main system language for UI and Spanish (Spain) as secondary language for speech recognition. In Allo I can chat via text with the Assistant in English, Spanish and German and it understands all 3 without a problem. What I find weird is that the Assistant always replies using the same language, until you explicitly tell it to change to another one, so if I tell it to speak Spanish, it will always reply in Spanish even if I ask questions in English or German. EowynCarter Saying the assistant "speak french" should do that from what i tested. Keept talking english (device language is french), And it wasn't understanding anything before, expecting me to speak english. Then, it got the french sentance alright. Misanthrope Unfortunately, it still speaks English after that. I am in the same situation and don't want to put my device in French. I want to keep it in English and speak French which is impossible EowynCarter Mmm. I can tell the assistant to speak English despite my phone being in French. But I'm using the allo assistant. Girouf Yeah I remember when I was testing the assistant ...although it was using "French France" then cause french Canada was still not a "learned language, it would never switch to French on the fly if I tried dictating an SMS. As I mentioned my system was set as English default and I want it to stay that way. The best solution for me was to turn everything off and just use the mic in the keyboard, switch my language from there and I could easily create a French or English sms that way with the first try. I haven't used it since though so I don't know how it is now if any better. Marc ¡Hola! Omelette du fromage. Arthur J. Means nothing Bru [971] Seems to be out of beta as Google France's facebook page is asking us to try Assistant in French. With no mention of beta. This is how i saw it roberto.elena I think Google still considers it a beta, even when there is no mention of it. Maybe I'm wrong, but the same happened when the Assistant was launched in English in Allo, before the Pixel launch. JD Has it learned french? Or has it learned Quebecois? Qbancelli Gracias, Google! Daniel D’Oleo ¡Por fin, ya habla español! 😃 Can confirm it works in Spanish (Spain/Latin America). https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/737f7c20cd24f2fc2ad7d8dee390630046978e4c2f455b8f88277ae7afa1fcbf.png Diego S. Spanish yesss Petr Kuchyňka And few commands in Czech (like setting an alarm etc.) Gerardo Sarabia this should come to the rest of the Assistant ecosystem, instead of being limited to Allo. Leonardo Baez Thanks for the heads up. I will change my language to spanish now. 👍 cvm And here, I'm trying to learn French... Stefan There is so much to do in the field of bi-lingual and tri-lingual users.. the OS should know when I chat with a specific person what language I use and the keyboard and Assistant should adopt to contacts across the device.. I use three languages on a daily basis and it's a nightmare to say the least. EnerJi Do you use Gboard as your keyboard? Supposedly it auto-detects languages automatically, but I haven't tested it extensively and I'm not sure whether it works well. Stefan yes nexus 5x with clean android and Gboard.. it seems to work every now and then, and only integrates with native android apps. my iPad seems to work better with remembering which language was previously used in the chat.. but that's iMessage ... siri is one language only and that's a BIG reason why I switched to android because google Now understood which language I was speaking in.. google assistant is FAR behind Rod Swiftkey is your friend. VAVAMk_2 ¿Cuándo podemos esperar que Google Allo aprenda soporte SMS además de nuevos idiomas? YuCMi Proof that Allo is still in beta... it's literally Google's testing ground.

These apps keep working in the background all the time, even when you aren’t using them. They’re pinging the internet and using motion sensors, all of it sucking the battery’s life. While several apps do this, some are far worse than others. The biggest leeches Find out Which Apps Are Killing Your Android Battery Find out Which Apps Are Killing Your Android Battery If you're getting poor battery life on your device, you likely have an app abusing your battery in the background. Find out how to identify those apps and solve your battery problems. Read More are often some of the most popular apps. We can also now identify these apps thanks to research conducted by mobile carriers, antivirus makers Avast and AVG, and tech enthusiasts. Here are the worst apps that drain battery on Android devices. 1. Snapchat Bad news, Snapchat users. This is the most battery-hogging social media app according to every survey out there. Snapchat was ranked #4 in Avast’s list and #2 in AVG’s list. Several users on the XDA Developers forum mentioned a significant battery boost after uninstalling Snapchat. What You Can Do Enable Travel Mode, one of the new Snapchat features you need to know about The 15 Newest Snapchat Features You Need To Know About The 15 Newest Snapchat Features You Need To Know About Few apps update quite as frequently or as dramatically as Snapchat. The app's most recent update featured a major overhaul that offers brand new features, new filters, a new font and tons of confusion. Read More . Travel Mode prevents Snapchat from pre-loading images and videos in your feed. You’ll find it in the app’s settings. You should also disable location tracking, a major battery leech. But be warned, this also disables geofilters, one of Snapchat’s cool new features. Alternatives to Snapchat Every social network seems to be doing what Snapchat does, copying filters, masks, “stories”, and so on. You might want to try Instagram Stories instead of Snapchat Snapchat Stories vs. Instagram Stories: What's the Difference? Snapchat Stories vs. Instagram Stories: What's the Difference? At first glance Instagram Stories and Snapchat Stories are very similar, but there are a couple key differences that mean they aren't interchangeable. You'll want to avoid a social media faux pas! Read More . 2. Tinder Tinder boosts your social life, but it also sucks the life out of your battery. The app is all about finding people who are around you, so it constantly tracks your location and refreshes the data based on that. What You Can Do Go from an “always active” Tinder user to a more passive one. Switch off the app’s background refresh so it stops working silently when you aren’t even looking at it. You might also want to disable all notifications while you’re at it. This combination leads to better battery performance, according to several user reports. And when you can, use Tinder Online through desktop browsers Tinder Online Lets You Swipe Right on Your Laptop Tinder Online Lets You Swipe Right on Your Laptop Tinder now has a home on the web as well as on your phone. This is thanks to Tinder launching Tinder Online, a browser-based version of its infamous online dating app. Read More . Alternatives to Tinder For an app like Tinder, you need to find an alternative that has a similar user base and the same mentality. OkCupid and Match.com are among the most popular apps for online dating. However, all these apps use similar resources if you’re an “always active” user type, so stick with Tinder and changing the settings. 3. BBC News (or Any News App) News apps are important to stay updated The 5 Best News Curation Apps to Fight Information Overload The 5 Best News Curation Apps to Fight Information Overload You've got so much vying for your attention -- news articles, Reddit posts, tweets, Facebook posts -- but what if you could get it all curated in one place? Read More , but this comes at the cost of battery life. Apps for BBC News, NYTimes, NDTV, CNN, and others constantly refresh in the background. Thankfully, this is the easiest to fix. What You Can Do Ditch the apps. Uninstall any news app you have. It offers nothing substantially more than their mobile site. So simply turn the mobile web site into a Chrome-based app How to Turn Any Website into an Android App in Seconds How to Turn Any Website into an Android App in Seconds With this app, it's super easy and quick to make Lite versions of apps, saving you battery life and improving your phone's performance. Read More . It’s easy, and it takes less space, data, and battery. Alternatives to News Apps For timely updates, you might want to ditch apps altogether and use Twitter as your news source. All the major news media houses are active on it. 4. Microsoft Outlook This is a surprising contender on the battery hogs list. Microsoft makes some great Android apps How Microsoft Took Over My Android Phone How Microsoft Took Over My Android Phone It's honestly surprising how many Microsoft apps are available for Android -- and they're really good! Read More , and the Outlook email app has been winning people over. Unfortunately, it was #10 in Avast’s list, so it might be time to reconsider. What You Can Do Email apps would be useless if they didn’t refresh in the background. While one can make a case to disable email notifications, you’re better off simply changing to a different app. Alternatives to Microsoft Outlook There is no shortage of email apps on the Play Store, so take your pick. Personally, I would recommend Inbox by Gmail, the productivity-email hybrid Google Inbox Review: A Breath Of Fresh Air Google Inbox Review: A Breath Of Fresh Air Gmail is a household name in the email department, but Google wasn't content with it. Meet Google Inbox, a new way of approaching email. Read More . As a full-time user and someone who gets hundreds of emails every day, I can vouch for its battery efficiency. Download — Inbox by Gmail for Android (Free) 5. Facebook and Messenger The biggest social network in the world is also one of the biggest battery drainers. The Facebook app, and its sister app Messenger, constantly rank high in all these reports. It’s logical when you consider how many Android permissions Facebook asks for How To Use Facebook On Android Without All The Invasive Permissions How To Use Facebook On Android Without All The Invasive Permissions Facebook's Android app requires a ton of permissions, and it shouldn't be trusted with them. The Tinfoil app for Facebook is the privacy-conscious solution. Read More . What You Can Do Remove the main apps and install Facebook Lite and Messenger Lite, the company’s lightweight alternatives Facebook Messenger Lite Is the App We've All Been Waiting For Facebook Messenger Lite Is the App We've All Been Waiting For If your Android smartphone is running slow or running out of battery too quickly, one app might be to blame: Messenger. The good news is Facebook has launched Messenger Lite. Read More . Both apps use less data, resources, and battery. You’ll miss a few functions, like video calling, but the overall experience is excellent. Alternatives to Facebook Let’s face it, there is no social network that is a real alternative to Facebook. The best you can do is not to use any of its apps, and instead use the Facebook mobile web site instead. Download — Facebook Lite for Android (Free) Download — Messenger Lite for Android (Free) 6. Amazon Shopping If you have the Amazon Shopping app installed on your phone, get rid of it right now. Amazon has plenty of deals and offers, but the app is not well optimized for Android, according to Android Pit. The result is that it drains battery as the app constantly pings servers in the background to get you the latest deals. What You Can Do The Amazon Shopping app is hardly any different from the Amazon mobile web site. Uninstall the app and do all your shopping from a browser instead. Or browse clutter-free Amazon sites on desktops 5 Clutter-Free Sites for Better Amazon Shopping 5 Clutter-Free Sites for Better Amazon Shopping Amazon is like Wal-Mart – cluttered, visually overwhelming, and busy. There's nothing wrong with that, but if you'd like a change of pace here are 5 sites worth chekcing out. Read More . Alternatives to Amazon Shopping No online store really compares to Amazon, so don’t bother looking for alternatives. 7. Samsung’s Default Apps Android has a bloatware problem, and it’s most evident with Samsung. Samsung devices come preinstalled with a whole bunch of their proprietary apps. You probably don’t use many of these, but they are working in the background, using up precious battery. The three biggest culprits are Samsung Link (or AllShare), Beaming Service for Samsung, and WatchON. What You Can Do Unless you root the Android device, you can’t remove these preinstalled apps. The next best thing is to disable them. Go to Settings > Applications > Applications Manager > All and tap on the Samsung Link app. Uncheck the “Show notifications” box, which is ticked by default. Then tap Clear Data, followed by tapping Disable. Do this for all the Samsung apps you don’t use. Alternatives to Samsung’s Default Apps Several of the preinstalled Samsung apps are redundant, so install better alternatives from the Play Store Replace Samsung Apps With These Better Alternatives Replace Samsung Apps With These Better Alternatives Whether you have a Samsung device and want to avoid the built-in apps, or you just want some of those cool Samsung features, these are apps you should check out. Read More . For example, instead of the S-Voice app, you can use Google Assistant 10 Things You Didn't Know Google Assistant Could Do 10 Things You Didn't Know Google Assistant Could Do Android's version of Siri -- Google Assistant -- is more powerful than most people realize. Read More . 8. musical.ly This relatively-new social network for aspiring music stars 6 Sparkling Star-Lit Social Networks for Singers 6 Sparkling Star-Lit Social Networks for Singers There are a number of really interesting ways you can get together with other singers online, so we pulled together a list of the most fun you can have socializing with other singers. Read More has been growing in popularity and taking its slice of battery life with it. Musical.ly is filling the void left by Vine, but it isn’t the background process that kills battery here. When you run the app, it uses a tremendous amount of hardware resources and is a data hog as well. The result is that it consumes far more battery than the average app. What You Can Do Like Facebook and Messenger, you can download musical.ly lite for Android. This lightweight version has most of the features of the main app, but uses less resources and data. Alternatives to musical.ly This isn’t the first app of its kind. You can try out Dubsmash for a similar experience. Download — musical.ly lite for Android (Free) Download — Dubsmash for Android (Free) 9. YouTube, Netflix, and Other Streaming Apps If you prefer to stream all your movies and music, then it’s only natural that those apps will use a lot of battery. After all, they’re using either Wi-Fi or data, and in the case of video streaming, your screen is also on all the time. What You Can Do There’s not much you can do here, since the experience requires battery usage. The best you can hope to achieve is through small tricks. For example, manually set the screen brightness to the lowest for comfortable viewing when streaming videos, or use wired headphones instead of Bluetooth ones. Alternatives to Streaming Apps There aren’t any real alternatives to streaming apps except the new YouTube Go for Android You Can Now Test the Brand New YouTube App You Can Now Test the Brand New YouTube App YouTube Go is hiding in plain sight on the Google Play Store right now, so it would be rude not to give it a quick spin, right?! Read More . It’s more battery-efficient and reduces data usage too. Download — YouTube Go for Android (Free) 10. LionMobi Power Battery and CleanMaster Ironically, battery optimizers and system cleaners are some of the biggest battery culprits. Avast found LionMobi’s Power Battery series to be among the top 10 guzzlers. AVG has similarly warned users about the popular Clean Master. What You Can Do It’s simple, actually. Stop looking for these magical optimization cures and uninstall these popular apps Do Not Install These 10 Popular Android Apps Do Not Install These 10 Popular Android Apps These Android apps are extremely popular, but they also compromise your security and privacy. If you have them installed, you'll want to uninstall them after reading this. Read More . Alternatives for Battery Optimization The only battery optimization app we can recommend is Greenify.

Among other things, I use Assistant to turn on my music, change the brightness or colors of my LIFX connected lightbulbs, add items to a grocery list, ask random trivia questions, and more, all using just my voice. It’s been rolling out to Android Nougat devices over the past few months, and to put it into even more users’ hands Google has recently released the Google Assistant SDK. Thanks to this extensive post by Mishaal Rahman on XDA Developers, many enthusiasts, including myself, have gotten it up and running on Mac, Windows, and Linux computers. Keep reading to find out how you can install it as well… The XDA post goes into great detail on how to configure the API and install Google Assistant from within your computer’s command line, but for more visual learners, this step-by-step instructional video (below) should hopefully make things a little easier, especially since you’ll be working entirely from within the command line throughout this process.

The Harman Kardon Invoke is the latest voice-controlled device that speaks the language of Cortana. No, it doesn’t work with Alexa nor the Google Assistant yet but only with Microsoft’s very own voice assistant. As with the Google Home and Amazon Echo, this Harman Kardon Invoke takes advantage of a known AI system. However, we’re not so much familiar with talking to Cortana because there aren’t many devices that play with such. The Harman Kardon Invoke is a premium speaker that offers 360-degree audio. The voice-enabled technology is relatively new for speakers but there is certainly a young market now. Thanks to the Google Home and Amazon Echo for being the first in the industry. This is one of HARMAN’s steps to deliver and improve on a “connected life through smart technology” according to Michael Mauser, the company’s Lifestyle Audio Division President. This Harman Kardon Invoke with built-in Cortana can do a number of things like play music, set reminds, deliver the news, check traffic, and manage your activities, and calendar. Since Cortana is from Microsoft, it also integrates Skype so you can easily communicate over the program and make calls to any landline or smartphone. It’s a smart speaker so obviously you can use it control home temperature or turn on-off the lights when you need it to. This partnership between Microsoft and Harman Kardon brings a premium smart speaker that boasts of a stylish design and excellent audio quality. It is also another step for the software giant to expanding Cortana’s reach. Harman Kardon Invoke is ready in Graphite and Pearl Silver. The simple and sleek metallic design makes it an elegant fixture inside any room. It will be out in the United States later this Fall at Microsoft Stores and some retailers. No information on pricing and exact release date yet but we’ll let you know soon.

The vulnerability resided in the Microsoft’s Malware Protection Engine. Yesterday we reported how two Google Zero Project members tweeted that they had found, ‘the worst Windows remote code exec in recent memory’. Microsoft was fast in following up, and last night the software giant released a security advisory and patch for the issue. The reason the Google employees called the vulnerability, ‘the worst in recent memory’, is because it was found in Microsoft’s Malware Protection Engine, software used as the foundation for several security applications in Windows, including Windows Defender. The software has access to all files and processes on a Windows system and through the vulnerability unauthorized code could be executed without the user even opening a malcious file. To exploit the vulnerability a specially crafted file would need to be scanned by Microsoft’s Malware Protection Engine. And because Microsoft’s malware protection scans all files on the HDD automatically, even temporarily files,  receiving a mail or visiting a website was sufficient to become infected. The Google Zero Project members were therefore very worried about the vulnerability because it could be executed remotely and could be distributed very easily. Microsoft Security Essentials, Windows Defender on Windows 7, Windows 8/Windows 8.1, Windows RT and Windows 10 are all vulnerable. The update that fixes the leak will be automatically installed within 48 hours through the built-in mechanism for the automatic detection and deployment of updates of Microsoft’s Malware Protection Engine.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: Ars Technica This is the first ever video of Fuchsia, Google’s new mobile OS that will replace Android Chris Smith @chris_writes May 9th, 2017 at 11:23 AM Share Tweet Google is working on a mysterious new operating system called Fuchsia that might one day replace both Android and Chrome. Apparently, Fuchsia is more than a hobby for Google, and the operating system represents a major endeavor for the company. There’s no Linux involved, and Google is even working with its own programming language for the OS and the apps that will run on it. Fuchsia also comes with a reimagined user interface that looks nothing like Android, even though it still has Material Design at its core. We already saw the first screenshots of Fuchsia’s Armadillo UI, but now a short video shows us how it’s actually supposed to work. Don't Miss: Amazon just discounted the Echo for the first time in 2017 The home screen in Fuchsia an image of the user profile that’s currently logged in at its center. There are no app shortcuts and no app drawer in sight. Instead, we’re looking at a home area that can be scrolled up or down for different purposes. It looks sort of like Google Now cards in the Google app. Scroll up and you see the apps or “stories” that you’ve accessed recently. You can get into each app that you need from there, expand it to full screen, or enable a multi-window mode by dragging an app into a second area. Scroll down and you get Google Now-like suggestions and a search field complete with a new keyboard app. As for that profile image that dominates the home screen, you can tap on it to reach quick settings like volume, screen brightness, airplane model, orientation lock, and more. The profile section also offers additional information about the handset, including battery life and wireless network details. The video below, via HotFix, highlights the main features of Armadillo in action.

By Peter Sayer Paris Bureau Chief, IDG News Service | May 9, 2017 8:43 AM PT Credit: Peter Sayer More like this Google News to be shut down in Spain ahead of new law German Bill Seeks Licensing Fee from Google, Other Search Engines German Cabinet Backs Law That Could Allow News Publishers to Sue Google Video Witcher 3 on a MacBook Air? Yep, with Nvidia GeForce Now German news publishers suing Google for copyright dues under a 2013 law may get more than they bargained for, with implications for readers and newspapers throughout the EU. Rather than rule in their favor, the Berlin court hearing their case has raised doubts about the validity of the very law they sought to enforce: It has asked the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) to rule on whether the German government should have notified the European Commission of its introduction. Such notifications are required when EU member states pass laws that may create barriers to the free provision of internet and digital services. At stake is how much Google must pay publishers under Germany's 2013 Ancillary Copyright for Press Publishers law to displays snippets of their news stories in search results on its Google News site -- and perhaps also whether internet users across Europe will continue to have free access to news aggregators such as Google's. VG Media, the German publishers' collective that brought the lawsuit against Google, welcomed the Berlin court's statement that its claim against Google was at least partly justified -- but said it agreed with the German government that notification of the law to the Commission was not necessary. For its part, Google wants to continue working with German publishers, a spokeswoman said. "Today's decision in Berlin highlights that there are still many contradictions and unanswered questions in the law of ancillary copyright for publishers. We've said many times that we don't want to fight legal battles with publishers. We'd much rather work with them to drive traffic to their websites and apps, promote their brands, and support online journalism--and that’s what we’ll continue to do," she said. Most countries do not require news aggregators such as Google to pay a licensing fee when displaying a "snippet," a short excerpt or summary of a news story that links back to the news publisher's site. Newspapers, however, have claimed that such snippets deprived them of advertising revenue by satisfying readers' curiosity without them needing to click through to the originating website, and in Germany and Spain succeeded in persuading governments to legislate. A draft of a new EU copyright law published by the European Commission last September suggested that other European countries should follow in their footsteps in allowing charges for news snippets. Given the success of the laws in Spain and Germany, where readership fell when aggregators stopped publishing snippets, that could spell bad news for newspaper publishers and readers alike. A ruling from the CJEU in the German case could sway thinking about the draft, which is still under discussion. In Spain, a December 2014 law obliged publishers to demand a license fee for news snippets: They could not waive it. In protest, Google closed down its Spanish news aggregation portal on Jan. 1, 2015, saying that because it showed no advertising on the site, it did not make any money. A month later news site El Confidencial Digital said Spanish websites had lost between 2 percent and 12 percent of their traffic, citing sources at the Association of Spanish Newspaper Publishers (AEDE). AEDE is still negotiating the fee with the country's remaining news aggregators.  Germany's 2013 law, in contrast, allowed publishers to choose whether to demand a license fee for snippets of their news, and to negotiate the amount directly with aggregators. Google's initial reaction was to remove sites asking for a license fee from its search results, with the resulting fall in traffic prompting some of them to reconsider their demands. In Belgium, news publishers filed suit to extract a license fee from Google under existing copyright laws, but ended their legal action by mutual agreement in 2012.

 A former Google exec explains why bosses at the company can't fire, hire, or promote their employees Minda Zetlin, Inc. May 9, 2017, 10:15 AM 4,146 facebook linkedin twitter email print Kim Scott. Sam Rega/Business Insider Being a manager at Google is a bit different from being a manager anywhere else. That's because the company makes nearly all decisions by consensus, explains Kim Scott, the bestselling author of "Radical Candor: Be a Kickass Boss Without Losing Your Humanity."  Scott once led Adsense and YouTube at Google. These days, the company goes to extreme lengths to make sure no one working at Google tells anyone outside the company anything about what goes on there. But in an interview at the recent Qualtrics Insight Summit, Scott provides a rare inside view of what being a boss at Google is really like. "Basically, Google stripped away most of the forces of power and control managers have at other companies," she explains. "If you're a manager at Google, you don't get to choose who you hire unilaterally. You don't get to choose who you fire unilaterally. You don't get to choose what ratings people get, which determines the bonuses they get." So how do these decisions get made? Using "packets" according to Scott. "A group of people would interview a candidate and write an interview packet and give their opinions on whether the person should be hired," she says. This group of interviewers will include the candidates prospective managers, peers, and employees. Scott herself was interviewed by several future direct reports before Google hired her. Once the interviews are complete, the packets go to a committee. "The hiring manager doesn't get to decide if the person is hired or not," Scott says. "They can sort of bid to get the person on their team, but the person who's hired could choose to be on another team." Nor can managers prevent anyone currently on their team from moving on to another job at Google. In fact, this very thing happened to Scott. "When I joined Google, I had five people reporting to me," Scott says. "In the first week, three of them took other jobs at Google." Managers have even less power over whether or not to promote employees. "Especially in engineering, it's really interesting," Scott says. "The employee puts their hand up and says, 'I'm ready to be promoted.' The manager can advise, but even if the manager says, 'I think you're not ready,' the employee can still get a packet together. It's harder to do it without your manager's help, but you could." Or, if the manager approves of the promotion, he or she can help the employee prepare a packet, assisting in obtaining recommendations from others in support of the promotion. At the end of this process, there's a promotion packet. "That goes to a committee," Scott says. "The person's manager is not on the committee and the committee decides yes or no." This all might sound complicated, but it's very good for Google, Scott says. For example, because of the promotion packet process, "there are very few unfair promotions." It also makes for better working relationships throughout the company. "The way you are an effective manager is you have to have good relationships," she says. "Taking unilateral power away from managers allows good relationships to exist. There's nothing worse for a relationship than an imbalance of power." Will this kind of approach work for every company and every group of employees? Maybe not. But there's a lesson here for every boss. The more decisions are made by consensus, the better relationships, and the more collaborative your culture will be. Get the latest Google stock price here. Read the original article on Inc..

 Google and Uber enter India's meal delivery market Stephanie Pandolph May 9, 2017, 10:49 AM 522 facebook linkedin twitter email print BII See Also RETAIL FORECAST: U.S. consumers will spend $632 billion online by 2020 THE SHIP-FROM-STORE REPORT: Why legacy retailers need to rethink the purpose of their brick-and-mortar stores Domestic smartphone brands continue to outshine Apple in China This story was delivered to BI Intelligence "E-Commerce Briefing" subscribers. To learn more and subscribe, please click here. Both Google and Uber have recently launched online meal delivery schemes in India, taking on an uphill battle in a market that several startups have failed to crack, Quartz India reports. Google launched its Areo restaurant delivery and home services platform in April, and Uber followed up by launching competitor UberEATS in India last week. However, the two large tech companies are entering an online meal delivery space littered with troubled startups that have failed to gain much traction outside of India’s largest cities.  The list of online meal delivery startups that shuttered operations in the country last year includes Zupermeal, iTiffin, EazyMeals, Zeppery, and BiteClub. There's also been a wave of consolidation lately — on-demand meal delivery startup TinyOwl was acquired by hyper-local delivery firm Roadrunnr last June. Then, in December, startup DeliveryHero acquired competitor FoodPanda.  Meanwhile, investment in Indian food tech startups, including meal delivery ones, plummeted to $80 million last year from $500 million in 2015. The little success online meal delivery companies have found in India is concentrated in its biggest cities, with more than 80% of all orders for these companies stemming from the top five, according to research from RedSeer Consulting. Google’s Areo only delivers in Mumbai and Bangalore right now, and UberEATS is only in Mumbai. Google and Uber have deep pockets, allowing them to undercut their competition on delivery fees. For instance, UberEATS only charges $.23 per delivery, with no order minimum, less than half of what some startups charge. However, the tech moguls still face steep overall barriers in India’s fledgling online meal delivery space. Much of India’s population still doesn’t have access to the internet. That lack of internet penetration has also limited Google’s and Uber’s brand recognition in India compared with other markets like North America and Europe. Lastly, individual restaurants in India typically have their own neighborhood delivery services, and have very established networks of couriers and customers. For the tech behemoths to build successful meal delivery businesses in India, they will need to rely on massive expansion of internet access and find ways to differentiate their app or delivery experience from the plethora of other delivery services out there. Pizza chains have long dominated meal delivery, but digital platforms are now enabling the entire restaurant industry to plug into online delivery. In the dominant on-demand meal delivery model, platforms like Grubhub serve as a middleman that connect people to food using the scalability of the internet. Although some industry leaders are processing hundreds of millions, even billions, in annual food sales volume already, they're a drop in the bucket in terms of the total addressable market (TAM) for food delivery, which is valued at $210 billion, according to Morgan Stanley Research estimates. Companies are adopting diverse business models in the market to deliver these meals; some, like Postmates, are focused on the logistics of delivering food, while end-to-end providers like Sprig cook, facilitate ordering, and deliver the food themselves. Ultimately, order-focused platforms like Grubhub/Seamless and Eat24 appear to hold the strongest positions in the market. The former controlled an estimated 59% of total order volume in 2015, while Eat24 held an estimated 7% share. Moreover, Grubhub/Seamless could pose a threat to the logistics companies DoorDash and Postmates if it pushes further into proprietary delivery services, especially in markets its competitors haven't expanded to yet. Despite varying advantages and disadvantages, all stakeholders will have to navigate some challenges in the market, including cooling deal volume, consumer resistance to delivery fees, potential industry consolidation, and downward pressure on take rates, which measure the revenue a company actually earns out of the volume they process. BI Intelligence, Business Insider's premium research service, has compiled a detailed report for on-demand meal delivery that sizes the market for on-demand meal delivery, outlines the main business models, assesses which key players are in the best and worst position in the market, and also analyzes the underlying risks that all stakeholders will have to navigate. Here are some of the key takeaways: There is a massive unfulfilled market opportunity. As of 2015, about $210 billion worth of food is ordered for delivery or takeout on an annual basis in the US, according to Morgan Stanley Research. But two of the industry leaders, Grubhub/Seamless and Eat24, generated a combined $2.6 billion in food sales last year. This means the market is underpenetrated but massive, which will incentivize continued competition and, potentially, an influx of new entrants.  There are three main business models that companies adopt. The dominant business model so far has been platform aggregators whose primary function is to support online orders. These include Grubhub/Seamless and Eat24, which control a combined 66% share of the market so far. Other models include delivery-focused logistics models and full-service models in which companies cook the food themselves.  There are a number of risks that all players in the ecosystem will have to navigate. SpoonRocket, a once promising full-service delivery provider, shut down earlier this year in the face of insufficient capital and intensified competition. This, along with cooling deal volume, could signal upcoming consolidation in the industry. Other risk factors include consumer resistance to delivery fees and lowering take rates, which measure the revenue a company actually earns out of the volume they process.  In full, the report: Overviews the on-demand meal delivery market and quantifies the opportunity for expansion.  Explains the three main business models meal delivery companies adopt.

Google's "Fuchsia" operating system is taking shape with a new design Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/08 10:01am PDTMay 8, 2017 36 Plus 1 on G+ 285 Share on Facebook 93 Share on Twitter Total Shares414 Development Google News We first talked about Fuchsia, a new operating system being developed at Google, back in August (in fact, it was my first post here). At the time, there wasn't much to get excited about besides the potential - it only had a command-line interface. Now the project has a snazzy new, but clearly unfinished, interface. Summary of Fuchsia First, it's worth going over exactly what Fuchsia is, because it's been quite a while since we talked about it. As opposed to all of Google's other OSes, such as Android and Chrome OS, Fuchsia uses the company's new 'Magenta' kernel instead of Linux. According to the project's documentation, Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Magenta's apps and the system interface are written with Google's Flutter SDK, which was initially designed to create cross-platform apps for iOS and Android. Flutter applications are written in Dart, the company's home-grown programming language. All of the system and apps are rendered by 'Escher,' which uses OpenGL or Vulkan to display everything. The 'Armadillo' interface So, on to the new stuff. Fuchsia's system UI has a new name - 'Armadillo.' Ars Technica was able to compile Armadillo into an Android APK, since it is written with the above-mentioned Flutter SDK. The interface doesn't really do anything besides looking pretty, but it does give us an idea of what the finished product could look like. The home screen is a vertical list, with a profile picture, the time, and a battery indicator in the center. Tapping the profile picture brings up something similar to Android's Quick Settings, with toggles for auto-rotate, do not disturb, Airplane Mode, and so on. Above the profile picture is the 'Story,' which the documentation describes as "a set of apps and/or modules that work together for the user to achieve a goal." Currently, this works similarly to Android's Recents screen. Users will also be able to combine stories into a 'Story Cluster.' This is what dragging a Story card into split-screen looks like. Dragging a Story card onto another one triggers a split-screen mode. The user can split an app 50/50 vertically or horizontally, drag in another app for a 33/33/33 split, or even have a tab bar appear for using all the open apps in full-screen. You can even have two apps split vertically next to two other split apps, seen below. This is far more flexible than Android's current multi-tasking functionality, but whether or not it will stay this way is uncertain. Below the profile picture is a panel resembling Google Now, with a placeholder search bar and suggestion cards. Armadillo's documentation says, "a suggestion is a representation of an action the user can take to augment an existing story or to start a new one. [The] suggestion contains enough information to create the visual representation of that concept." So maybe they will work more like an app launcher? It's hard to tell at this point. The Google Now panel, showing Fuchsia's keyboard. Keep in mind that all of this is subject to change, as the Armadillo interface (and the rest of Fuchsia OS) is still under heavy development. It's also hard to tell what Google's plans are for the operating system. Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware, or will it some day replace Android altogether? We'll have to wait and see.

Suicide_Note Because Google can. Corbin Davenport Ron from Ars Technica put it best: "Fuchsia really seems like a project that asks 'how would we design Android today, if we could start over?' It's a brand-new, Google-developed kernel running a brand-new, Google-developed SDK that uses a brand-new, Google-developed programming language and it's all geared to run Google's Material Design interface as quickly as possible. Google gets to dump Linux and the GPL, it can dump Java and the problems it caused with Oracle, and Google can basically insulate itself from all of Android's upstream projects and bring all the development in-house. Doing such a thing on the scale of Android today would be a massive project." makapav Would it still be open source? Also, what would happen to all the existing APKs? Corbin Davenport Fuchisa is completely open source right now. As for running Android apps, maybe Google will add some kind of stop-gap compatibility layer for running Android apps, like Chrome OS has. destinyhud read the article Suicide_Note Perhaps instead of replacing Android, this will *become* Android, as in Android P or Q? Or be the merger of Android/Chrome? m477 I could see that as Android 10. Definitely too early for P. morteum I wonder if the reason it is called "Armadillo" is because they're starting from A again, but this time they're using animals instead of desserts. Christopher Bement I think it's a smart plan, based on the guess that there's more animals to pick from in the world than tasty desserts. teolinux Ubuntu docet Paul "Tasty treats," not necessarily desserts. That said, armadillos could be a tasty treat. I won't judge. MJ I have heard desserts and candy used before which are wrong but "tasty treats" is a new one for me. To be more accurate, Android names are actually all confectionery foods. A "tasty treat" could be a slice of pizza (aka Android S). LOL Randy Gindy Armadillo is the name of the UI not the OS build itself. Matt74UK Smooth on the inside, crunchy on the outside. Armadillo ! (a few UK people of a certain age may get that). Russell Brown That bloke's a nutter... Edit: nope, that was Dime Bar. :( Nomaan Shouldnt we compare armadillo to holo/material and not to dessert names? Or am i missing something. morteum I don't think so, those are design languages and while this is a redesign of layout and function, it is still pretty much using Material Design. I could be wrong but I don't think this is closer to a build version. John Doe Idk this is a whole new OS with a new kernel, I doubt this will be done with an OTA update for Android. Mantas Pakėnas Even nowadays, some of Android's new functionality cannot be done via OTA updates (like dual system partitions, forced encryption I believe, etc). To make a completely hard cut sometime when this is ready, and if it's meant to replace Android, is not completely unimaginable. As is updating via OTA. If apple was able to change their file system via OTA, I don't see why changing most of the parts would not be possible. However, nobody aside from Google would do it, almost guaranteed :) Suicide_Note It could likely be done for Pixel devices, and possibly for future devices released after this new version of the OS rolls out. Adrian Meredith quite possibly, after all there no reason it couldn't also run android apps jonathan What they need to do is make this googles very own os for their pixel line and leave android for the oems Suicide_Note Not a chance. To much name recognition with Android for Google to drop it in favor of something else specific to the Pixel lineup. Dallas King Android Z confirmed! Suicide_Note More like Android A for Armadillo. m477 APK plz (no, really, I want a compiled apk the demo) Maxwell “Max” Weinbach https://github.com/fuchsia-mirror/sysui MJ Your link wasn't what the OP asked for... Maxwell “Max” Weinbach the only way to get the APK is to compile it yourself, so I linked to the Github page to a place to download the files to compile. The closest they will get. MJ Than you should have replied there is no known APK or not at all. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach It does not matter that much. I am building the APK right now. Once it is done I will post it. Here is the link on how to compile it. http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo MJ Don't waste your time... They updated that article with an download of the APK. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach thanks. they just did that. I still compiled it myself though. I will try to get more out of it while I have the Sysui downloaded. Michel R. https://www.androidfilehost.com/?w=files&flid=178684 there you go MJ http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo Latex beats nudity More of Proprietary code ? No thank you, we already had enough with this Pixel crud. I hope this OS dies quicker or become a chromebook OS. m477 It's open source. Latex beats nudity It's OSS but just like Android It'll be more heavily dependent on the google APIs to make it work. Look at the Pixel SysUI, Just being OSS doesn't make it open source... It's Google's OS not a Linux Based one. If this is going to replace Android It's doomsday on multiple levels. destinyhud billions of people dont care if its running linux kernel or not. maybe very few like u might. do iphone users care why kernel it runs. none of them care. u r just noise tbh Latex beats nudity Billions of people don't code. You are being a kool-aid joke tbh. destinyhud exaclt only few code and even on that few many dont care if it runs linux or not. look at iphone there are more dev there and yet they dont care for kernel. u r delusional in ur own world m477 Android it's already been on a Google-dependent road for years. I don't think this is going to change either way. An Angry Chihuahua https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/magenta/+/master/docs/getting_started.md heres the source code. do some research my dude WitnessG Imagining this running on a Google made processor is exciting. Badouken If this was the OS for the Pixel 2 alongside a Google made processor I think id cry! WitnessG Yeah I don't see this coming out for at least another 2-3 years. Badouken Indeed, but we can dream! ha Suicide_Note Maybe the Pixel 3 or 4 will see the dream become reality. Suicide_Note I'm betting this is what we'll see in a couple years time. As another commenter stated, starting with Armadillo could be Google's way of starting from the beginning (letter A codename), since there's more animal babes to use for each letter than there are dessert names to use. Timothy Vreeland You are getting the furries excited. Evelynmtalley Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Nomaan Armadillo should be compared to holo/material and not to dessert names. nachofrand What makes you think Google would be good at making SoCs? They're a software company and don't have the hardware expertise for hardcore ASIC development like that. Granted they can hire people, but in the end, does it matter? They're going to use ARM either way. UnlikeABoss Google fanboyism. The same reason he's excited over a brand new OS. He knows absolutely nothing about it, short of the fact that it will create more fragmentation not only in the OS space, but also the kernel space. So all we know are negative things so far. This is what we call exciting now is it? Why? Just because Google is doing it? If Microsoft made this exact same announcement, would we all be excited? Oh dear. Zsolt V No, because essentially everybody loathes Microsoft. Almost nobody's life would be worse if Microsoft vanished. marcusmarcus2 Don't they design and build their own servers to use for all their websites? Seems like those hardware work well for them. Sergii Pylypenko It's one thing to assemble the server using off-the-shelf components, or even to order a custom motherboard. It's a very different thing to design and manufacture your own chips. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying it is the same, just that they are not only software experts. Them designing and building the servers show they do have hardware expertise that could assist them in doing the same to chips. Zsolt V Except Google's servers are not assembled from off the shelf components. Haven't been for a few years now. Roy What about TPU? Owais Lone They DO design their own chips as well especially chips meant to run specialized AI (tensoflow) code Adrian Vovk Samsung Exynos devices are faster than Snapdragon, iPhones seem underpowered but are extremely snappy, etc. The point is that making both the software and hardware leads to a very fast ecosystem. Also, Google are making the TPU for neural networks nachofrand Yes, as expected. Exynos is faster than Snapdragon on the Galaxy phones, but put an Exynos in another phone...oh wait, you can't. That's the whole entire point. Snapdragon SoCs are general purpose SoCs and can be used for a multitude of phones so they're not custom tuned to every phone individually. Exynos have very specific power rails and the chip is made specifically for that phone. The thing is, sure this is better, but it's marginal and hardly worth talking about. They both use the same ARM architecture so performance gains are pretty negligible. Besides that, this is how Samsung makes money....off of device sales. Google doesn't make money that way. That isn't their business model so at this point it doesn't make sense for them to build their own SoCs when they could just work closer with hardware companies. They make their own TPUs because it aligns with their business model. Adrian Vovk The instruction set doesn't really matter? I can have a 6700k and a 6500k and the 6700k will perform much better even though they are both amd64. With what Google is doing with the Pixels (still as snappy as day one here) I'm pretty sure they can optimize it further than Samsung does. They have made it run smoother in some cases on a chip that they didn't manufacture. If they made their own chip it would allow them many freedoms that they otherwise don't have = easier design of the device. I brought up the TPUs because that is experience in chip manufacturing Jason What makes you say iPhones are under powered ? Apples chips are some of the fastest around and are extremely powerful. Adrian Vovk Specs wise. They have much worse specs on paper and it would lead to a slower experience, except Apple can optimize it because they make both the chip and the OS SHunter On their Own hardware running their software in their own eco system. You cant really fairly compare it to anything else. Stephen Sharp They could use Risc-V and have to pay to license absolutely nothing, while being able to make processors purpose built for their OS Randy Gindy That would be an interesting move. Stephen Sharp Indeed, I really want Risc-V to succeed as an open ISA nachofrand They could. But in my opinion, it's unlikely. Google isn't trying to compete with Samsung and Apple in device sales and that isn't their business model. People using their services so they can show ads is their business model. It doesn't make sense for Google to make their own SoC when others are already doing a good job. Plus, if they went to RISC-V then what? What about the modem? They have to buy a standalone modem from Qualcomm or Intel. Now you have to hire system integration and test engineers to make sure the modem is working with your SoC. Oh and then you need a whole firmware team to control the modem. At that point, buy a full blown SoC with the modem on chip. Stephen Sharp Eh you lost me at "Pixel phone" and all the other hardware they sell. Google also is a Platinum member of the Risc-V foundation, and if there is a direction they are going, more control or less control, I would guess it's "more". But that's just a guess nachofrand Hardware isn't even close to the same thing as asic development. IC design is a different world. Granted they do some custom hardware, but SoCs are a much much larger feat. It's still a possibility they do so, but it doesn't make sense with their current business model imo. Randy Gindy He said nothing about ASIC he is talking about RISC-V Randy Gindy I disagree with you completely. They are penetrating the IoT market, auto market, healthcare, phones, robotics, self driving, networking, etc. Them making in house chips could really benefit every project they have. Also building an OS from the ground up to work with in house chips would be smart. Look at Apple as an example. They also may let manufacturers to use the designs. If Android One isn't evidence for them to want to standardize their platforms I don't know what is. Captain On! 1 - Google has stated that they're going to make their own silicon for the Pixels in time. 2 - Google actually owns/operates the world's most powerful quantum computer. They know how to make chips. Randy Gindy That quantum computer was built by DWave though Angel I read (somewhere don’t remember) that they have three different quantum computers systems. One from DWave and two home-produced. From those two, one was made by engineers and not that disimilar from DWave in its operations. The other was made by physicists and uses a different approach. nachofrand 1. I could be wrong, but I've only read that they plan on working closer with chip manufacturers. 2. Google didn't make that computer. Even if they did, quantum is so different those skills don't even translate. Romario Maxwell Google made their own custom ASIC called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) for their AI/Machine Learning needs on their cloud platform. See https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/05/Google-supercharges-machine-learning-tasks-with-custom-chip.html and https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/04/quantifying-the-performance-of-the-TPU-our-first-machine-learning-chip.html nachofrand Sure, although a TPU is just an accelerator. Think of it as the hexagon DSP inside of the Snapdragon SoC. That's like 1/10 of the entire chip. SoC design is much larger. Timothy Vreeland How many examples of hardware design do people have to point out before you stop? Sure the hardware they worked on previously isn't exactly the same... But before they started the hardware they are currently working on, they worked on previous hardware that wasn't the same as what they are doing now. They have shown they are competent in designing many kinds of hardware. Or do you suggest a company can only build one kind of hardware and nothing else for all eternity? How did Samsung make it's current in-house chips? Did they go to ARM college? Have they been making ARM chips since the dawn of time? No. They put together some teams and got to work, so stop blabbing and being negative. sweenish Their AI that finally beat the world's top Go players was running on custom Google chips. It's not like they don't know how. theProffer They have enough liquid assets to do whatever they want, abandon it, and then do it again without even noticing they spent the money. (Which is actually the source of a few of their problems, I think.) Matt Is that why they gave up on fiber? Pixelexel Imagine a Google Pixel with a Google made processor, with Fuschia, with Project Fi with Google WiFi powered by Google fiber. If I'd have this, my life would be complete. Owais Lone and all our data with it :( needa At least it is only one company getting it. Iamsecond Ha, no. A Google processor? Supported for 18 months, then replaced with a new processor that performs half as well (but has stickers.) Does not fully process Android code, because at Google one hand doesn't even know the other hand is there, let alone talk to it. Has 20 cores (only 2 enabled outside US for 'reasons.') Has a dedicated co-processor to enable ads in every app, even those that previously didn't have them. the.cyber.trekker I spit my coffee out on my monitor reading this!! ROFLMFAO! Jason Google can't even get a phone out the door without issues and you want them to make the chips too...lol. I'll pass. UnlikeABoss "In house kernel instead of Linux". Yeah, hopefully this dies in a thousand pits of fire. "Hey Linux guys, you know how you've helped us make billions over the years with a free open source kernel? Well, we were just using you to get the "nerd" userbase. Now we own the market thanks to you guys promoting its use of Linux, we will gradually phase you out." .... m477 I hope not. Linux is not really a kernel made with smartphone in minds. I don't care for being a fan of a kernel over another. UnlikeABoss Yeah. I'd much rather use a brand new untested kernel (and all the teething issues that will come with it) in my smartphone than a mature, stable one that's hacked on by hundreds and thousands of people every month. I mean, it's just a smartphone, we don't need it to be a secure environment, right? Let's just make a nice obscure kernel that no one else will use, and just say "but but it's open source!!! love us because we are Google kk". ... ihsan ışık I'm sorry but it just looks like you are a huge Linux fan and are just against change to me. UnlikeABoss Looks can be deceiving. If you're going to fling around the Linux fanboy term, i'll fling around the Google fanboy term, and that will surely be a nice constructive argument that we will both want to continue. m477 So, in 10 years we should still be using an unoptimised kernel like Linux, because anything newer is, well, newer? UnlikeABoss Yeah, because Linux hasn't changed at all in 10 years... m477 Yes, it changed a lot, and it still has many of the same problems, which are intrinsically bound to its structure. It's not a kernel well suited for mobile devices. UnlikeABoss You think the solution is to throw it out the window and start from scratch? I disagree. I'd much rather continue improving the Linux kernel, simply because of all the eyes it will always have on its code. jonathan Play nice ladies lol m477 With this mentality we wouldn't have Linux at all. Why start anything, while we can continue this other thing which purpose was completely different? A mircokenel is more well suited than a monolitic kernel to a mobile devices, both in terms of performance and security. No matter how much you improve Linux, it will never be a microkernel. UnlikeABoss Smartphones don't need a micro kernel in 2017. You could make that argument 7 years ago. Linux can be compiled with the required drivers just like it always could. m477 I made that argument 7 years ago. They always needed something different from Linux. The fact that specific, even proprietary drivers have to be integrated in the kernel (since Android lacks an abstraction layer) is on of the problems of the interaction Android-Linux. destinyhud why havent the nerds made linux on pc's a bigger market share if they were the one who made android a global leader UnlikeABoss No nerd is promoting Linux on the desktop. All social media used to be full of people promoting Android over iOS, these days there's no need to. destinyhud why havent they promoted desktop?? just wondering why they did for android but not for desktop.. linux on desktop was an underdog for decades. android was not popular because of kernal. android became popular because it was opensource and was the only viable competition to ios. people dont care what kernel it runs. UnlikeABoss No nerd worth their salt would promote an environment that would be a downgrade from Windows. Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time, it had a very equal playing field. There's a difference between promoting a good solid FOSS kernel where possible, and promoting an agenda. m477 Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time By this, I get that you never used Android and iOS side by side in 2009-10. UnlikeABoss You clearly value different things. The hackability alone made it an upgrade through its lifetime. m477 The same can be said for GNU/Linux on desktop. UnlikeABoss No it can't, because hackability =/= app availability. i.e. The hackability on Linux desktop doesn't make it win over it's lack of apps, where that isn't an issue on Android. m477 App availability was horrible in the early days, compared to iOS. Even Symbian had more apps. UnlikeABoss That was fine since the early days didn't consist of using your smartphone for very much, due to under powered hardware. Techies didn't go around saying "use iOS because we can all take selfies and stick filters on it". m477 iOS devices didn't have front cameras until mid 2010. The system was better, faster, smoother, the interface was coesive, there were many more apps, and the jailbreak community, to address the techie audience you like to go on about so much, was very, very good. There were tweaks and modifications that even the wildest Android custom ROM didn't have at the time. Android was objectively a downgrade, as much as Linux was on desktop. UnlikeABoss Calling jailbraik an advantage over a FOSS OS is pretty hilarious. iOS wasn't popular because it was better, it was popular because of the amount of people getting their advice from paid employees in store. "Buy iOS so we get a commission". m477 iPhone was more popular for various reasons: marketing, having 2 years of advantage, and, yes, more marketing. But it was also better than Android, as an OS. What benefit did Android bring, with it being opensource, compared to iOS, even to a "techie"? The dev community was laughable in the early days. Why GNU/Linux on desktop was not promoted by "techies" (which is false) and Android was, even if their shortcomings were identical? destinyhud u live in a dream world. even most dev dont care about kernel. what they care about the dev platform. I am a dev and i dont care for the kernel UnlikeABoss If you're talking from the perspective of an app developer then ofcourse you don't care about the kernel, you care about which platform will make you the most money... destinyhud exactly. no one care what kernel it runs.. all dev care is what platform make money. so who is this nerd who care about kernel if most dont care about the kernel.. yeah very very few.. infact rare like u UnlikeABoss Techie == Technology Enthusiast. You can sit here and tell me that you would use the best dev environment all you want but the truth is if the iOS dev environment was awful you'd still suck it up and use it to make your money. I'm not sure how you can class yourself as an enthusiast at that point. destinyhud ever wonder why no one is up voting u and upvoting many of my comments? because what u say is BS. its that simple. I am up for ditching outdated linux if the new kernal is modern and build for modern devices. most dont care for this very few techies.. i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die.. UnlikeABoss "Ever wonder why Google fanboys upvote pro Google content and not anti-Google content?" No, no I don't wonder that. How dare someone critique a pointless change by Google, causing unnecessary fragmentation. Burn them! destinyhud u must be new here.. look at anti google comments here when they make stupid changes but if they make welcome changes people tend to agree UnlikeABoss No, I've been here a long time and made many anti-Google comments as well as pro-Google. No one in the right mind would cheer on kernel fragmentation other than those that think Google can do no wrong. destinyhud open up ur comments history and let me see if u made pro google comments. i have a feeling u r a troll UnlikeABoss Yeah, this discussion is going no where. You are not the authority here and the idea that you want to browse my history to make sure I fall in line is creepy as hell. Bye. destinyhud lol i see u dont want to open ur comments history. obvious troll m477 outdated linux i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die Woah, wait a second here. Linux is not outdated, and its death would be terrible for everyone. It's just that it's not the most apt kernel for a mobile device. destinyhud maybe not outdated but not the right fit for mobile devices. destinyhud android sucked when compared to ios.. it was a downgrade compared to ios. why did dev promote android and not desktop linux? u reasoning dont even make sense. UnlikeABoss No, it wasn't a downgrade. destinyhud yes, it was back in android initial release. iOS was better and much more polished at that time. but things changed now. UnlikeABoss "Polished" is not a factor that is used to judge a better OS. There are Linux environments that are much more polished than Windows 10, but that doesn't make desktop Linux better. destinyhud it was both polished and runs better than android at that time. polished was not the only one. it was also polished. android only got better later.. i have used android at that time and it sucked big time. UnlikeABoss You are using today's standards to judge it. If you do that, they both sucked. It worked perfectly fine for the basic things people were using it for at the time. destinyhud they both sucked at that time but android sucked more than iOS at that time. SVem26 I like to think I am in the nerd userbase and I don't care what kernel is used.. can you help me understand why it matters? UnlikeABoss Do you want a brand new obscure kernel in thing that holds most of your sensitive details? TipTop I don't want something that dates back to 90s, is full of zero-days and horrible code contributed by nobodies. UnlikeABoss The idea that it is full of zero days is hilarious. You do realize that the majority of Linux exploits are local, right? Unlike Windows. Yes there is obviously code from the 90s, but very, very little of it. Not to mention that age is not a factor in deciding bad code. The idea that old code is bad code shows your inexperience. By that standard, should we dismiss Chrome because of all the exploits being found in code that was written when it first started? Are we going to create brand new software every few years to purge "old code"? Do you have any idea whatsoever how much Linux has actually changed? Do you have any idea how much of this change is because it's considered a "universal" kernel everyone can use and is focusing on? Do you really think splitting the community over onto another kernel will increase security for either of those kernels? There's a little something called code maturity. There's a reason Microsoft has way less exploits in its kernel today than 10 years ago. They didn't write a new kernel from scratch. TipTop But it is. You can be in denial all you want. Linux is the OS that is used by botnets for DDoSing websites not Windows. UnlikeABoss No sorry, come back to reality. Botnets consist of all types of OS, including Linux ofc. It is not the majority of bots in a botnet, that statement alone shows how clueless you are. Also, do you understand what Linux is? It's a kernel. The majority of Linux hosts in a botnet have been hacked through exploits in outdated software, not the kernel. The same cannot be said for Windows. Again, read the statistics for the severity of Linux exploits versus Windows. More exploits are found in Linux overall because it is open source, however, that doesn't make it worse. More critical and high severity exploits are found in Windows. That speaks a lot for the secure design of Linux. Hopefully you'll do some reading and learn. Sir_Brizz All OSes are full of vulnerabilities and horrible code written by nobodies. If that is your requirement then you must have gone full luddite by now. TipTop Windows is written by paid professionals and has QA/QC. Linux is written by fat nerds for free and has no quality control but nice try. Don't gve me the top contributors crap. Sir_Brizz Yes, tell me again how many zero day vulnerabilities are found in Windows and how long they take to get fixed. Even worse, tell me that with macOS. Being paid doesn't guarantee quality, just as being unpaid doesn't guarantee garbage. Windows and macOS have some of the crappiest insecure code. And there is nothing special about having QA or being paid to write code. Some of the worst programmers I have ever met worked at places like Microsoft and Apple. https://mobile.twitter.com/taviso/status/860681252034142208 Please continue trying to tell me how infallible paid programmers are! UnlikeABoss They are totally da bestest eva! UnlikeABoss Obviously paid products will always be better than unpaid products... right!?!? /s Oh wait we have tons of real life examples of free products being better than paid, shocking how that works. It's almost as if the best products are made by the most passionate people, and like, being paid doesn't guarantee being passionate about your creation. What a crazy crazy world! ihsan ışık Are you implying that Android got popular because of "nerds" who heard it uses the Linux kernel? UnlikeABoss If you are old enough to know the early days of android you'll know that having every single nerd on the internet promoting Android over iOS most certainly helped get the ball rolling. Once it was pushed, it snowballed into what it is today. m477 Sure. It was the nerds on the internet, not the manufacturers with ads everywhere. Most people still don't know their Galaxy runs Android. UnlikeABoss The giant billboards came YEARS afterwards, cmon. m477 Yes, and that's why Android was so unpopular in the early days. UnlikeABoss What? It was massively popular among all techies for being the open source iOS alternative. m477 You are overestimating the "techies" crowd. Even BlackBerryOS was more popular at the time. Only after the Galaxy S it started to grow, and became popular among normal people. UnlikeABoss Not really. We are talking over a decade ago now, there were far less people on the internet and it was far easier for techies to promote products because everyone was asking their "techie" friend what is best. But these days everyone is an "expert" so that's not as much of a thing. m477 Again, you overestimate how many techies there actually were. Your personal experience is anecdotal. Market shares and sell data are objective. Also, over a decade ago Android was still a camera os, and it wasn't public. UnlikeABoss No, I do not. The further back in time you go, the higher the proportion of techies there were using the internet versus others. People were only just starting to look at buying a smartphone, and asking techies what they should buy. m477 Yes, the concentration on the internet of "techies" on the internet was greater. And? What normal user at the time went to the internet, looked at reviews and said "Oh, look! The HTC magic has Linux! This random guy says its good, so I'm gonna buy it!"? You really think that a bunch of "techies">marketing? A guy saying that his toy-looking HTC G1 is better than the iPhone is more effective than billboards and tv ads? Come on, even Windows Mobile was more popular. It took Samsung's aggressive marketing to make Android popular. UnlikeABoss Windows Mobile and BlackBerry were more popular in the enterprise, that's it. The entire discussion is home users. Also I think there's been some confusion. I wasn't implying that techies on the internet were promoting Android on the internet like a marketing department. I was implying that the internet was very much a "social media" platform for techies to communicate where the majority of them would use Android and mocked the use of iOS. The actual "marketing" happened offline when a normal user would ask their "techie" friend for first time buying advice. It is nothing like that today, and the internet is nothing like the techie community it once was. m477 So, what you're saying is that the internet was a circlejerk of Android users. Ok, and? It didn't affected normal users the slightest, iOS was still more popular until Samsung took Android more seriously. The techie friend thing its only your anecdotal experience, it bears no influence on the market, in the grand scheme of things. I'd even argue that Google's very light marketing did much, much more. Also, the mindless techies that recommended half backed devices instead of better alternatives because "Uh, Linux!!" did more harm than good, both to the users and to Android. UnlikeABoss If you read my OP you'll see my original point was that Google has rode the "Android circlejerk" to popularity, and you can debate how much popularity that added as much as you want. The fact remains, it got the ball rolling. Samsung didn't pick it up "just because", it saw that a lot of people were pushing it. There were several OS at the time it could have used, including sticking to its own. Why bother with Android? Maybe because it wanted to see how much market it could take by appealing to techies? However, if you stand back and look at it, how is this any different from "embrace, extend, extinguish"? Google used that "free marketing" and has now decided to use it's massive popularity to push a different product. (Which has failed in the past and will hopefully fail again). Why hate Microsoft for doing that in the past, but we praise Google for doing it? Why are we excited for something we know nothing about that is creating fragmentation? m477 Samsung had used several OSes, it had Windows Mobile and Phone devices, Symbian devices, and proprietary devices, even Palm OS devices IIRC. They used them all. Android had was the easiest to personalise for them, and create a copy of the best selling product, which was the iPhone, and there was an app market, so they tried to release and market their flagship with it, and market it as broadly as Apple. The first Galaxy (the "non S") was was vastly ignored, because it was as little marketed as all their other devices. The techies crowd was insignificant. The free marketing is just as much as Windows 10 gets for incorporating Ubuntu's bash terminal. What you saw is not really important. I saw lots and lots of Windows Phones in 2010 and 11. Many more than Android devices. Every one I knew had one, and if I had to say which OS was the most popular only based on my personal experience, in my smallish city, I'd obviously would say Windows Phone. Why are you so attached to Linux, excluding all possibilities of giving a possibly better solution a try? The community will just fork the AOSP and continue the development of the Linux branch. UnlikeABoss Cmon, we both know Android was not easier for them to customize than simply using their own OS. No one was recommending it, techie or not, no matter how much they marketed. It's only now they are popular they are trying to slip in their own OS, and still failing. I am not attached to Linux despite people using it as an easy scapegoat to dismiss a discussion critiquing almighty Google. We currently have a situation where most kernel developers focus entirely on Linux, making it virtually the universal kernel. Why are we creating pointless fragmentation there? Why divide that community? Do we honestly believe that a divided community can produce a better kernel, or do we love it because Google is doing it? Would we love it if Microsoft did this? m477 The proprietary OS they used at the time was a Java based thing with a flash interface. Hardly able to compete against iOS. It was easier for them to use the "next Symbian" that they could customise as they wanted, and that also had an app market. If they made, say, Bada, before Android become established and popular, and marketed it as much as they did with their Galaxy S, the market would be very different today. The normal user doesn't care what OS their shiny phone runs, as long as there's facebook. I am a GNU/Linux user since the first half of the 2000s, and I've always critiqued Google for using Linux as a kernel on phones. Linux might be the universal kernel, but smartphones need a more streamlined solution. I don't care if it's Google, the MIT, or Richard Stallman in person to do it. I liked WP8 architecture. Fragmentation is not pointless if it brings benefits to the user. TipTop Nobody cares about your FSF agenda. John Q I think the chief reason Google is not using Linux is that they want a real-time OS (RTOS). Linux is at best a "soft" RTOS, possessing a real-time scheduler but this is still not nearly as real-time as an actual RTOS should be. It would take a very large effort to do that for Linux so it makes sense that Google would want to make their own kernel that they can have full control over. UnlikeABoss Let's ignore the fact that Linux is used in real time car systems for a moment. Could you elaborate on why you think Google would want/need a RTOS on their smartphones? M6 The kernel they're using, 'magenta', is opened source. So who cares if they're using linux or not? Does everyone have to use linux? UnlikeABoss No it doesn't have to be Linux. But who else will use Magenta? Probably no one. So why are we fragmenting the kernel space further? Why would you choose an immature kernel for something as valuable (your data) as your smartphone. Would you trust that? I would much rather developers continue focusing on a single kernel. WesleySmalls But wouldn't Magenta be this single kernel? UnlikeABoss If everyone decided to ditch Linux and focus purely on Magenta as the universal kernel, yes. Will that happen? WesleySmalls Could be, just not overnight. The market was already fairly well developed when Linux arrived in 1991, yet it still managed to become a very, if not the most, important player in the market. It's certainly possible, it will just require proper investment(and neglect of their alternate platforms) and patience to make it work M6 That's some straight up communist shit right there. Let's just work on one thing, because we only need one thing, everything else is redundant! Let's not allow other people to do the same thing in a different way, because competition totally doesn't spur innovation at all. WORPspeed So Andromeda definitely dead or still happening? sleepinlight Pretty sure this IS Andromeda, or at least a part of it. Andromeda was never an official name for anything, it was just the internal project name for some sort of new and/or merged OS. WORPspeed I thought Andromeda specifically referred to merging Android and Chrome OS. So is that specific merger dead or on life-support? John Q Nah, the Android/Chrome merger was just speculation from what Andromeda seemed to be. There was never any concrete evidence to imply that Andromeda was a merger. WORPspeed To quote Androidpolice : "So please, when you see Fuchsia mentioned, or speculation that it "is" Andromeda, know that it is just that: speculation. Last we heard from sources we consider extremely reliable, Android was the basis of Andromeda, and Andromeda would see its commercial debut on a new Pixel laptop later this year. It is possible Google has changed plans around Andromeda, that the initiative itself may have even been scrapped. Though, we have no reason to think so - it's more that we don't know, and haven't heard anything about Andromeda in quite some time." http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ WORPspeed http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ That makes them seem very separate Srujan https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e7fda716dfcfdca76e200e51a9c9144c72e183c7e76d36b910c20ee0931aee79.gif destinyhud if this replaces android rather than having 2 separate codebase, I am all up for it. splitting the android community is dangerous senor_heisenberg Well if this does end up being what replaces Android or what Android evolves into, I just hope my apps and whatnot are compatible. Ain't got the time or money to be investing into another ecosystem. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman That's a tricky, double-edged sword. I can't fathom they would not support the old apps, or at least the vast majority of them, for exactly that reason. But in doing so it will likely be held back at least slightly from what it can/should be. Backward-compatibility tends to hold everything back. What I'd wager is we won't see this until hardware's powerful enough to make emulating the old system in a VM relatively cheap and easy, with back-end Play Store penalties to developers who don't shift to the new app models, and then slow phase-outs in stages of the older functionality and support until the new OS is running exclusively its own setup. senor_heisenberg That sounds good. Randy Gindy I think Google porting the Android Run-time to Chrome OS was to see if they could do it. morteum This is old news, I'm waiting for Fuchsia 2.0 Barracuda. /s marcusmarcus2 What if they aren't going by Animal names in general but by mammal names. I'd skip the Fuchsia 2.0 Bandicoot. It will probably be "Crash" prone. Alfonso Surroca Three operating systems is not nearly enough. We need at least two more announced at I/O. Suicide_Note One OS for each Google messaging app. AbbyZFresh If this is not customizable, the Andorid OEMs won't be liking this one bit. Miku is Best Vocaloid Leprosy OS. 4Ui812 All of Google's projects are missing one thing..... can I make a suggestion Google? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7c05d652570603779d08c4dbce3535891bbfd9b0bd62ebb1c5a084b03e7d21ea.gif Christopher Bement Honestly, this would cure my fever. 4Ui812 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7ac8191019b3b90075b387b129808b379bef70d0796d8d2263109849fa1b71bc.gif BetterWithRoot https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6ozscsz4jRX7xuQE/giphy.gif saf1927 Reading the comments of armchair experts here makes me smile. klaus666 But will it solve the update problem? Suicide_Note There is no update problem. Nexus/Pixels run the latest and greatest. OEMs who mess with the OS give their customers severely delayed updates. pfmiller Nexus and Pixels run the latest and greatest for two years. Nobody would accept this OS update situation if it was on a desktop OS. MJ Thank God it's phones we are talking about and not a desktop PC. marcusmarcus2 That is exactly why Windows XP lasted only a couple years before all computers updated to Windows 7... Seriously though. I'm fine with only getting Android version upgrades phones for 2 years. But they really need to extend out security updates beyond 3 years. Suicide_Note This isn't a desktop OS, not to mention people tend to change phones much more often than their desktops. pfmiller Sure it's not a desktop OS, but no sense pretending that what we have leaves nothing to be desired. And sure people change their phones more often that their desktops, but there's absolutely no reason to change every 2 years. Suicide_Note I change phones at least once a year, and sometimes two or three times. I couldn't imagine going two years or more on the same phone. pfmiller You can do what you look like, but there's absolutely no reason why that would be necessary. Suicide_Note It's only necessary if you want the latest and greatest, which i like to have, because phone tech is still evolving and improving at a good clip. For example, had i skipped the Pixel, I'd still be using my 6P or N6, both of which have cameras that are vastly inferior to that in the Pixel. I've taken some incredible shots with the Pixel, some of which would be literally impossible to duplicate using the camera in the 6P/N6. That alone is reason enough for me to upgrade on a yearly basis. Doby Gillis Which is a problem, Einstein. Suicide_Note Not if you're a Nexus/Pixel owner, Dilbert. Randy Gindy I would generally say there is. Android phones are not supported for nearly as long as an iPhone. The reason being that the chip set manufacturers do not release new drivers. Shelly-Man Vol 2 It's looks pretty neat for a development stage. Rami Well Android has to reach Z someday. In the case, Hello Fuchsia! marcusmarcus2 Those split-screens will be really useful for running of of Google's different messaging apps. Hopefully OS's aren't the new messaging apps of Google.

You can install it just as any other apk Rick Kode Cool WesleySmalls "Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware, or will it some day replace Android altogether?" Neither, this is just a side project many developers use to test and work out the feasability of a variety of things. Android is a very well developed environment, and replacing it whole is simply a no-go. Things will just gradually evolve, as they have already done with Dalvik being replaced by ART, for example. Sir_Brizz I don't think you're wrong, but it would be in Google's best interest to start building a non-JVM runtime that apps can run inside with a native language that Google has 100% full control over like Go or Dart. Тарас Мукин 1. This is definetelly Chat UI! It came from Telegram bots and whatsoever, and it is so smart of Google to be developing it now. Feels like it's going to be next big UI-change after Apple came up with apps divided into screens. 2. "Magenta is designed for ... non-trivial amounts of ram" This is going to be optimised sooo bad.

Lol Cyber Jethro I personally think this is for embedded systems like shopping kiosks or other customer service applications. Zach Mauch "Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware" Did you mean "relegated", not "neglected"? ZettabyteGamer Neglected works, and is the better word choice here. PVL_93_RU Those "stories" on the "home screen" look like they'd fit perfectly for a kiosk-type display, where you have a lot of space to work with JG Fuchsia is a purple-y pink color. T-Mobile's color is Magenta, a slightly different purple-y pink color T-Mobile is rumored to be looking into launching their own phone... Coincidence??? Almost certainly, without a doubt yes... But consider... T-Mobile also launched the first Android phone... Nomaan Is this why Pixels were released in 2016 coz google tested fuchsia and magenta on existing pixels with existing qualcomm drivers and they know they could just update it in 2018 and further without having to worry about qualcomm dropping support? One can dream... yoloswag Inspired by the messaging team, Google wants to start working on a 2nd operating system. Darth Vader 3rd* JG Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Modern personal computers huh? I've been interested in Google packing ChromeOS into a LiveCD type set up we could test/install on our own computers... (*Yes, I know of Chromium, haven't tried it yet... But I would prefer it coming direct from Google, faster updates and all that). It could be interesting to try out another of Google's OSs without having to fork over several hundred for new hardware... The only problem would be drivers to support the various hardware. If not modified too much, ChromeOS could possibly use the original Gentoo Linux drivers. But with Fuchsia using its own unique kernel... That might throw things off a bit... I know a few less tech-savey individuals who would probably be more comfortable if the same OS powered their phone, tablet and desktop (should Google opt to replace Android with Fuchsia). Especially if it could run both Android apps and Chrome extensions natively.

King_Android Well its safe to say its definitely for mobile phones seeing that T-mobile is the "current" carrier, so we can rule out it only being for IoT. mattcoz Phones aren't the only devices that can use mobile data. King_Android Such as a tablet? Either way it still holds true. This will obviously be used for a phone/tablet I dont know much else that uses T-mobile thats not a phone or tablet and would need a UI like this. mattcoz Tablets, wearables, vehicles, and whatever else the future brings. This is not for the devices of today, it's for the devices of tomorrow. Will that include phones? Probably, but "definitely" is too strong at this point.

Google mobile image search adds new quick filters Google image search on mobile has added quick filters for latest images, GIFs, clip art, colors and copyright usage. Barry Schwartz on May 9, 2017 at 10:11 am More Google Image Search has added a new filter option to the mobile version of image search. Right under the search box, it now gives you quick filter links to filter for the latest images, GIFs, clip art, colors and copyright. You can even drag the bar to the left to show more color filtering options. At the end of the filter options is an option for filtering for “labeled for reuse.” Here is a screen shot: After you click the filter — in this case, I clicked red — you get filtered results based on your selection: Google has not yet announced this new filter option, but it seems it is now rolling out in the mobile image search results.

Relevance vs. authority: Which link has more value? (Part 1) When pursuing a link, which is more important, relevance or authority? Columnist Andrew Dennis asks expert link builders this question, and in the first of his three-part series, we hear from those who value relevance. Andrew Dennis on May 9, 2017 at 11:20 am More Relevance versus authority: these two metrics are always at the forefront of a link builder’s mind. Both authority and relevance should be part of the overall evaluation of a given link. In an ideal world, every link we secure would be from sites that are both authoritative and highly relevant to our own site. But what if you had to pick one or the other? Which is more important: relevance or authority? This is a very difficult question to answer and a constant source of passionate debate at Page One Power. There are many nuances, and link opportunities are never cut-and-dried in the real (online) world. Relevance versus authority can be particularly challenging for beginner link builders as they begin the arduous process of securing links. To dissect the issue, I posed the following question to a number of the best and brightest minds in search: “All other metrics being equal, would you rather have a high-authority link with lower relevance or a highly relevant link with low authority?” I received so many great responses that I will be separating them into three categories, and three separate parts: Relevance Authority Varies depending on situation Quick Disclaimer: This is a purely hypothetical debate, as link building is never this black-and-white. I posed this question to tease out the valid points for both sides of the relevance vs. authority argument. This is a difficult question to answer in a short quote, but everyone I contacted was a good sport and gave their best shot, sharing valuable insight. The debate on relevance and authority won’t end with this post, but hopefully, this will push the discussion forward. Expert opinions: Relevance I’ll start by sharing the opinions of those who answered on the side of relevance. Referral traffic and conversions The opportunity for qualified referral traffic is a major bonus of relevant links, and some of our experts highlighted this point: “It’s a tough question because of context; a high authority link is great, but if ‘all other metrics are equal,’ this would mean that the page with the high authority link is receiving the same amount of traffic as the highly relevant link, which then stands not only to pass link equity (albeit less) but then has the potential to send highly qualified traffic… which exponentially increases the likelihood for a conversion; so I’d go contextual over authoritative.” –– Nick Eubanks, IFTF “I’d rather have a more relevant link with low authority. I’d hope that was better for traffic, but I’d not really expect it to have the same effect on rankings as a higher authority link with lower relevance. I certainly wouldn’t want a high authority link with zero relevance of course, but I like to think that someone’s actually going to click on the links that I build.” –– Julie Joyce, Link Fish Media “I would pursue the more relevant linking opportunity because the domain still likely has some authority and by having relevancy, you increase the chance of driving targeted traffic to your site, which has the potential to affect other metrics like conversions. Of course, the golden opportunity would be one that is both authoritative and relevant, but that’s the politician’s answer. The other option would be to pursue both opportunities. After all, sometimes link building is a game of numbers.” –– Annalisa Hilliard, Pole Position Marketing “I am one of those people who believes that links not only to improve search engine rankings, but if link building is done right it allows you to build doors that allow targeted audiences to move to your website and possibly convert into paying customers. “The reason why I would love to go for a website that has high relevance and low authority is because it has a better ability to drive a targeted audience back to the website, instead of a high authority low relevance site that might get me/my client tons of traffic, but little-to-no conversions. “If your SEO/Digital Marketing efforts aim to help a company grow and increase its conversions, then you should choose a website that has more relevance, and it’s ok if the website has low authority. Obviously, you also have to make sure that the link profile of the website is decent and will not produce any negative effect to your website if you get a link from them.” –– Moosa Hemani, SEtalks Authority metrics are only barometers Other experts cited the fact that while the authority measurements we have in the SEO industry (Majestic Trust Flow, Moz Domain Authority, Ahrefs Rank and so on) are helpful barometers, nobody truly knows how Google measures authority. “High authority links are great, but in my opinion, relevant links win the game every time. They are truly in their natural habitat and make more sense for users that click on them, hence serving as a stronger ranking signal. Google hasn’t updated Toolbar PageRank since 2013, and I’m fairly certain it’s not because they wanted to promote other third-party metrics.” –– David Farkas, The Upper Ranks “If all metrics are the same (including all link value metrics at page level), then I would take relevance in 2017 over authority. Authority seems to be just a function of the link metric, or at least that is what Google suggests. Whilst I am never one to just follow what Google tell us as reality, I personally lean more towards the view that most authority, as a baseline, can be seen in the link metrics.” –– Paul Madden, Kerboo “Highly relevant link with low authority. “I strongly believe that relevant links have a bigger impact on the algorithm. More so, authority is pretty subjective, as metrics available on SEO tools out there can be flawed; how users/website visitors look at sites is mostly based on the relevance and utility of the information they’ve found on a given page. “Also, in terms of scalability, you’re likely to get a bigger list of highly relevant link prospects, sitting in a very specific niche, than finding only high-authority sites with your choice of metric. Plus, if you’ve been reaching out to a webmaster, it makes more sense for them to give you a link if they think you’re highly relevant to their sites.” — Venchito Tampon, SharpRocket “I would prefer a relevant link with less authority than higher authority link with low relevance. It’s very difficult to accurately measure authority. While Moz and Majestic do a great job in helping to evaluate relative authority, no one really knows how Google evaluates it. But one thing is pretty clear from our clients’ results: the more relevant the links, the more they push up rankings and traffic. I can’t say I’ve noticed the same kind of push from a handful of high Domain Authority placements.” –– Nicole DeLeon, North Star Inbound Google might discount irrelevant links Even links from high-authority sites may be discounted if there is no relevance. “Without question, I would take a highly relevant link, with low authority. All. Day. Long. The reasons for choosing a relevant link are many: 1. Google can, and does, ignore low relevance links. The worst offenders are generic links (“click here”) and even worse, off-topic links (“premium watches” when your content is about cat food). 2. Several Google technologies discussed in patents, including Topic-Sensitive PageRank, Reasonable Surfer, and Phrase Based Indexing with Co-occurrence, assign more weight to topically relevant links, and less to off-topic links. 3. Relevant links generate more — and better targeted — traffic to your content. Sure, we all want high-authority links. Including me! But if the link is low-relevance, it may not count at all. Better to get a boost from a relevant link, even if it comes from a lower quality source.” –– Cyrus Shepard, CyrusShepard.com Relevant sites have potential to grow Some of our other experts who sided with a relevance-first approach pointed to the fact that relevant sites with low authority still have the potential become more authoritative over time. “If I had to choose, I’d vote for higher relevance. Your authority will constantly be in flux — just because you have a low authority now, doesn’t mean it will always be that way (for example, consider a new site building up their reputation). Strong relevance is a better customer experience and is more likely to remain consistent.” –– Erin Everhart, The Home Depot “If you asked me this a few years ago, I’d have a more absolute answer. But today I want the relevance and would accept a lower authority link, as long as we aren’t talking about a spammy ‘bad neighborhood’ website. Sites with low authority can eventually grow, giving your link future Domain/Page Authority. But the relevance can also lead to qualified referral traffic. For me, it’s a case-by-case scenario because I’m wearing a ‘marketing’ hat along with an ‘SEO’ hat. I simply don’t do link building by authority metrics alone anymore.” –– Bill Sebald, Greenlane SEO “I’d choose a highly relevant link with low authority. The authority can always increase over time if it’s a relevant and useful site; however, the relevance of the link likely won’t change.” – Aleyda Solis, Orainti Relevant links = relevant anchor text Relevant sites will typically implement more relevant anchor text as well. “From personal experience, I’ve found that the right answer to this question mostly comes from the competitive landscape. You need to know what type of resources are referring to pages with whom you want to compete in SERPS. Based on this data, you can make the right decision. However, I prefer to vote for a link with the right anchor text and high authority sites typically don’t allow that.” –– Alexandra Tachalova, AlexTachalova.com Total respondents who chose relevance: 13 That wraps up the folks who came down on the side of relevance. In Part 2, I’ll share some thoughts from the experts who chose the high authority, low relevance link.

Teachers’ Day Google doodle celebrates educators across the US Google says it's taking today, "... to appreciate those who dedicate their lives to encouraging our intellectual development." Amy Gesenhues on May 9, 2017 at 10:08 am More Google is honoring educators across the country today with an animated doodle on its US home page to mark Teachers’ Day. The doodle uses Google’s letters to depict a teacher leading students through a variety of lessons. The image links to a search for “Teachers’ Day” and includes the usual sharing icon. From the Google Doodle Blog: On this day we take a moment to appreciate those who dedicate their lives to encouraging our intellectual development, be it through mathematics, ecology, astronomy, chemistry, biology, or any other subject we may explore. Teachers nurture our intelligence, creativity, and critical thinking skills. They help shape us and guide our development. Here is the fully animated doodle featured on Google’s US home page today: As a mom of a seventh and second grader, I am thankful for all the ways teachers contribute to my children’s development as students — as a professional writer, I am forever grateful for the teachers who shaped my education.

The animated image depicts the letter "g" teaching the other letters of Google about a range of subjects from chemistry to space and arithmetic. In a changing political climate with competing ideas on how to fix America's struggling education system, here’s why the country needs to value its teachers and inspire even more to take up the job. 1. The US is declining in global education rankings When it comes to math and science education, American students rank behind many advanced industrial nations, according to data from Pew international math and science assessments. The most recent Programme for International Student Assessment — one of the largest comparisons compiled between countries — found that US students ranked 38th out of 71 in math and 24th in science in that field (other rankings are more generous with the US, but not by much). 2. Trump's White House is looking to cut education funding President Donald Trump requested a budget earlier this year that would slash domestic funding while boosting military expenditures. That included a requested cut of 13.5 per cent, or $9.2 billion, to the US Department of Education.  Included in that original budget plan was the removal of $2.4 billion in grants for teacher training and $1.2 billion in funding for summer and after school programmes. America has always needed great teachers, but with the education system facing such a rocky path, it needs to value and recruit them more than ever.  Google marks International Women's Day with 13 amazing women 13 show all Google marks International Women's Day with 13 amazing women 1/13 Ida Wells An African-American journalist and activist born in Mississippi in 1862, she wrote prolifically on the fight for women’s suffrage as well as the struggle for civil rights. She documented the practice of lynching black people in the southern states showing how it was often used as means of controlling or punishing black people who competed with whites rather than as a means of “justice” for crimes. 2/13 Lotifa El Nadi Egypt’s first female pilot born in 1907 in Cairo. Although her father saw no need for her to pursue secondary education, expecting her to marry and have a family, she rebelled and worked as a secretary and telephone operator at a flying school in exchange for lessons as she had no other means to pay for the training. Her achievements made headlines around the world when she flew over the pyramids and competed in international flying races. 3/13 Frida Kahlo A Mexican painter and activist born in Mexico City in 1907, her work has been celebrated internationally as emblematic of Mexican national and indigenous traditions and by feminists for its honest depiction of female experience. 4/13 Lina Bo Bardi A Brazilian architect, born in Italy in 1914, she devoted her life to the promotion of the social and cultural potential of architecture and design. She is also celebrated for her furniture and jewellery designs. 5/13 Olga Skorokhodova A Soviet scientist born into a poor Ukranian peasant family in 1911, she lost her vision and hearing at the age of five. Overcoming these difficulties in a remarkable way, she became a researcher in the field of communication and created a number of scientific works concerning the development of education of deaf-blind children. She was also a teacher, therapist and writer. 6/13 Miriam Makeba A South African singer and civil rights activist born in Johannesburg in 1932, she was forced to work as a child following her father’s death. She became a teenaged mother after a bried and allegedly abusive marriage at 17, before she was discovered as a singer of jazz and African melodies. After becoming hugely successful in the US and winning a Grammy, she became involved in the civil rights struggle stateside as well as in the campaign against apartheid in her home country, writing political songs. Upon her death, South African President Nelson Mandela said that “her music inspired a powerful sense of hope in all of us.” 7/13 Sally Ride An American astronaut and physicist, she was born in Los Angeles in 1951 and joined NASA in 1978 after gaining her PhD. She became the first American woman and the third woman ever to go into space in 1983 at the age of 32. Prior to her first space flight, she attracted attention because of her gender and at press conferences, was asked questions such as, “Will the flight affect your reproductive organs?” She later worked as an academic at the University of California, San Diego. 8/13 Halet Cambel A Turkish archaeologist born in 1916, she became the first Muslim women to compete in the Olympics in the 1936 Berlin games as a fencer. She declined an invitation to meet Adolf Hitler on political grounds, and after the conclusion of the Second World War, she trained as an architect and later worked as an academic in Turkey and Germany. 9/13 Ada Lovelace An English mathematician and writer born in 1815, she became the world’s first computer programmer. The daughter of poet George Byron, she is chiefly known for her work on Charles Babbage's proposed mechanical general-purpose computer, the Analytical Engine, and was the first to recognise the machine had applications beyond pure calculation, creating the first algorithm intended to be carried out by such a machine. 10/13 Rukmini Devi An Indian dancer and choreographer credited with reviving Indian classical dance, she was born in 1904 and presented her form of dance on stage even though it was considered “low” and “vulgar” in the 1920s. She features in India Today’s list of “100 people who shaped India” having also worked to re-establish traditional Indian arts and crafts and as an animal rights activist. 11/13 Cecilia Grierson An Argentine physician, reformer born in Buenes Aires in 1859, she became the first woman in Argentina to receive a medical degree having previously worked as a teacher. Women were barred from entering medical school at the time, so she first volunteered as an unpaid lab assistant before she was allowed to train as a doctor. She was acclaimed for her work during a cholera epidemic before going on to found the first nursing school in Argentina. The harassment she experienced at mediacl school helped make her a militant advocate for women’s rights in Argentina. 12/13 Lee Tai-young Korea’s first female lawyer and judge born in 1914 in what is now North Korea, she was also an activist who founded the country’s first legal aid centre and fought for women’s rights throughout her career. Her often mentioned refrain was, “No society can or will prosper without the cooperation of women.” She worked as a teacher, married and had four children before she was able to begin her legal career after the Second World War, becoming the first woman to enter Seoul National University. She also fought for civil rights in the country and was arrested in 1977 for her beliefs, receiving a three-year suspended sentence and a ten year disbarment. 13/13 Suzanne Lenglen A French tennis champion born in 1899, she popularised the sport winning 31 championships and dominating the women’s sport for over a decade. She was the first female tennis celebrity and one of the first international women sports stars, overcoming a childhood plagued with ill health including chronic asthma – which continued to plague her in her adult life. At 15, she became the youngest ever winner of a major championship and lost only seven matches during her entire career. She received widespread criticism for her decision to turn professional, but defended her right to make a decent living in the days when the grand slam tournaments paid a relative pittance to the winners. 3. Many jobs of the future are in science, maths and tech Jobs that rely on STEM expertise (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) are expected to increase considerably. Those jobs, which generally require a bachelor’s degree, are also pretty lucrative, and there will be hundreds of thousands of new jobs in the next years that pay six-figure salaries. Read more Michelle Obama responds to reports Trump may abolish 'Let Girls Learn' Millennials are shunning marriage and kids for education and a career 4. Creationism is still being taught in a number of public schools At least 14 states allow taxpayer dollars to go fund schools that teach creationism. The issue is contentious to say the least, with opponents saying that teaching creationism with taxpayer dollars violates the separation of church and state clause in the US constitution. What's more, it isn’t based on any empirical evidence. Supporters of that curriculum argue for their religious freedoms and say that evolution hasn’t been adequately proven. Having good teachers to wade that debate and help students to make informed decisions has always been important.

Google's "Fuchsia" operating system is taking shape with a new design Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/08 10:01am PDTMay 8, 2017 36 Plus 1 on G+ 285 Share on Facebook 93 Share on Twitter Total Shares414 Development Google News We first talked about Fuchsia, a new operating system being developed at Google, back in August (in fact, it was my first post here). At the time, there wasn't much to get excited about besides the potential - it only had a command-line interface. Now the project has a snazzy new, but clearly unfinished, interface. Summary of Fuchsia First, it's worth going over exactly what Fuchsia is, because it's been quite a while since we talked about it. As opposed to all of Google's other OSes, such as Android and Chrome OS, Fuchsia uses the company's new 'Magenta' kernel instead of Linux. According to the project's documentation, Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Magenta's apps and the system interface are written with Google's Flutter SDK, which was initially designed to create cross-platform apps for iOS and Android. Flutter applications are written in Dart, the company's home-grown programming language. All of the system and apps are rendered by 'Escher,' which uses OpenGL or Vulkan to display everything. The 'Armadillo' interface So, on to the new stuff. Fuchsia's system UI has a new name - 'Armadillo.' Ars Technica was able to compile Armadillo into an Android APK, since it is written with the above-mentioned Flutter SDK. The interface doesn't really do anything besides looking pretty, but it does give us an idea of what the finished product could look like. The home screen is a vertical list, with a profile picture, the time, and a battery indicator in the center. Tapping the profile picture brings up something similar to Android's Quick Settings, with toggles for auto-rotate, do not disturb, Airplane Mode, and so on. Above the profile picture is the 'Story,' which the documentation describes as "a set of apps and/or modules that work together for the user to achieve a goal." Currently, this works similarly to Android's Recents screen. Users will also be able to combine stories into a 'Story Cluster.' This is what dragging a Story card into split-screen looks like. Dragging a Story card onto another one triggers a split-screen mode. The user can split an app 50/50 vertically or horizontally, drag in another app for a 33/33/33 split, or even have a tab bar appear for using all the open apps in full-screen. You can even have two apps split vertically next to two other split apps, seen below. This is far more flexible than Android's current multi-tasking functionality, but whether or not it will stay this way is uncertain. Below the profile picture is a panel resembling Google Now, with a placeholder search bar and suggestion cards. Armadillo's documentation says, "a suggestion is a representation of an action the user can take to augment an existing story or to start a new one. [The] suggestion contains enough information to create the visual representation of that concept." So maybe they will work more like an app launcher? It's hard to tell at this point. The Google Now panel, showing Fuchsia's keyboard. Keep in mind that all of this is subject to change, as the Armadillo interface (and the rest of Fuchsia OS) is still under heavy development. It's also hard to tell what Google's plans are for the operating system. Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware, or will it some day replace Android altogether? We'll have to wait and see.

Suicide_Note Because Google can. Corbin Davenport Ron from Ars Technica put it best: "Fuchsia really seems like a project that asks 'how would we design Android today, if we could start over?' It's a brand-new, Google-developed kernel running a brand-new, Google-developed SDK that uses a brand-new, Google-developed programming language and it's all geared to run Google's Material Design interface as quickly as possible. Google gets to dump Linux and the GPL, it can dump Java and the problems it caused with Oracle, and Google can basically insulate itself from all of Android's upstream projects and bring all the development in-house. Doing such a thing on the scale of Android today would be a massive project." makapav Would it still be open source? Also, what would happen to all the existing APKs? Corbin Davenport Fuchisa is completely open source right now. As for running Android apps, maybe Google will add some kind of stop-gap compatibility layer for running Android apps, like Chrome OS has. destinyhud read the article Suicide_Note Perhaps instead of replacing Android, this will *become* Android, as in Android P or Q? Or be the merger of Android/Chrome? m477 I could see that as Android 10. Definitely too early for P. morteum I wonder if the reason it is called "Armadillo" is because they're starting from A again, but this time they're using animals instead of desserts. Christopher Bement I think it's a smart plan, based on the guess that there's more animals to pick from in the world than tasty desserts. teolinux Ubuntu docet Paul "Tasty treats," not necessarily desserts. That said, armadillos could be a tasty treat. I won't judge. MJ I have heard desserts and candy used before which are wrong but "tasty treats" is a new one for me. To be more accurate, Android names are actually all confectionery foods. A "tasty treat" could be a slice of pizza (aka Android S). LOL Randy Gindy Armadillo is the name of the UI not the OS build itself. Matt74UK Smooth on the inside, crunchy on the outside. Armadillo ! (a few UK people of a certain age may get that). Russell Brown That bloke's a nutter... Edit: nope, that was Dime Bar. :( Nomaan Shouldnt we compare armadillo to holo/material and not to dessert names? Or am i missing something. morteum I don't think so, those are design languages and while this is a redesign of layout and function, it is still pretty much using Material Design. I could be wrong but I don't think this is closer to a build version. John Doe Idk this is a whole new OS with a new kernel, I doubt this will be done with an OTA update for Android. Mantas Pakėnas Even nowadays, some of Android's new functionality cannot be done via OTA updates (like dual system partitions, forced encryption I believe, etc). To make a completely hard cut sometime when this is ready, and if it's meant to replace Android, is not completely unimaginable. As is updating via OTA. If apple was able to change their file system via OTA, I don't see why changing most of the parts would not be possible. However, nobody aside from Google would do it, almost guaranteed :) Suicide_Note It could likely be done for Pixel devices, and possibly for future devices released after this new version of the OS rolls out. Adrian Meredith quite possibly, after all there no reason it couldn't also run android apps jonathan What they need to do is make this googles very own os for their pixel line and leave android for the oems Suicide_Note Not a chance. To much name recognition with Android for Google to drop it in favor of something else specific to the Pixel lineup. Dallas King Android Z confirmed! Suicide_Note More like Android A for Armadillo. m477 APK plz (no, really, I want a compiled apk the demo) Maxwell “Max” Weinbach https://github.com/fuchsia-mirror/sysui MJ Your link wasn't what the OP asked for... Maxwell “Max” Weinbach the only way to get the APK is to compile it yourself, so I linked to the Github page to a place to download the files to compile. The closest they will get. MJ Than you should have replied there is no known APK or not at all. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach It does not matter that much. I am building the APK right now. Once it is done I will post it. Here is the link on how to compile it. http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo MJ Don't waste your time... They updated that article with an download of the APK. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach thanks. they just did that. I still compiled it myself though. I will try to get more out of it while I have the Sysui downloaded. Michel R. https://www.androidfilehost.com/?w=files&flid=178684 there you go MJ http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo Latex beats nudity More of Proprietary code ? No thank you, we already had enough with this Pixel crud. I hope this OS dies quicker or become a chromebook OS. m477 It's open source. Latex beats nudity It's OSS but just like Android It'll be more heavily dependent on the google APIs to make it work. Look at the Pixel SysUI, Just being OSS doesn't make it open source... It's Google's OS not a Linux Based one. If this is going to replace Android It's doomsday on multiple levels. destinyhud billions of people dont care if its running linux kernel or not. maybe very few like u might. do iphone users care why kernel it runs. none of them care. u r just noise tbh Latex beats nudity Billions of people don't code. You are being a kool-aid joke tbh. destinyhud exaclt only few code and even on that few many dont care if it runs linux or not. look at iphone there are more dev there and yet they dont care for kernel. u r delusional in ur own world m477 Android it's already been on a Google-dependent road for years. I don't think this is going to change either way. An Angry Chihuahua https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/magenta/+/master/docs/getting_started.md heres the source code. do some research my dude WitnessG Imagining this running on a Google made processor is exciting. Badouken If this was the OS for the Pixel 2 alongside a Google made processor I think id cry! WitnessG Yeah I don't see this coming out for at least another 2-3 years. Badouken Indeed, but we can dream! ha Suicide_Note Maybe the Pixel 3 or 4 will see the dream become reality. Suicide_Note I'm betting this is what we'll see in a couple years time. As another commenter stated, starting with Armadillo could be Google's way of starting from the beginning (letter A codename), since there's more animal babes to use for each letter than there are dessert names to use. Timothy Vreeland You are getting the furries excited. Evelynmtalley Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Nomaan Armadillo should be compared to holo/material and not to dessert names. nachofrand What makes you think Google would be good at making SoCs? They're a software company and don't have the hardware expertise for hardcore ASIC development like that. Granted they can hire people, but in the end, does it matter? They're going to use ARM either way. UnlikeABoss Google fanboyism. The same reason he's excited over a brand new OS. He knows absolutely nothing about it, short of the fact that it will create more fragmentation not only in the OS space, but also the kernel space. So all we know are negative things so far. This is what we call exciting now is it? Why? Just because Google is doing it? If Microsoft made this exact same announcement, would we all be excited? Oh dear. Zsolt V No, because essentially everybody loathes Microsoft. Almost nobody's life would be worse if Microsoft vanished. marcusmarcus2 Don't they design and build their own servers to use for all their websites? Seems like those hardware work well for them. Sergii Pylypenko It's one thing to assemble the server using off-the-shelf components, or even to order a custom motherboard. It's a very different thing to design and manufacture your own chips. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying it is the same, just that they are not only software experts. Them designing and building the servers show they do have hardware expertise that could assist them in doing the same to chips. Zsolt V Except Google's servers are not assembled from off the shelf components. Haven't been for a few years now. Roy What about TPU? Owais Lone They DO design their own chips as well especially chips meant to run specialized AI (tensoflow) code Adrian Vovk Samsung Exynos devices are faster than Snapdragon, iPhones seem underpowered but are extremely snappy, etc. The point is that making both the software and hardware leads to a very fast ecosystem. Also, Google are making the TPU for neural networks nachofrand Yes, as expected. Exynos is faster than Snapdragon on the Galaxy phones, but put an Exynos in another phone...oh wait, you can't. That's the whole entire point. Snapdragon SoCs are general purpose SoCs and can be used for a multitude of phones so they're not custom tuned to every phone individually. Exynos have very specific power rails and the chip is made specifically for that phone. The thing is, sure this is better, but it's marginal and hardly worth talking about. They both use the same ARM architecture so performance gains are pretty negligible. Besides that, this is how Samsung makes money....off of device sales. Google doesn't make money that way. That isn't their business model so at this point it doesn't make sense for them to build their own SoCs when they could just work closer with hardware companies. They make their own TPUs because it aligns with their business model. Adrian Vovk The instruction set doesn't really matter? I can have a 6700k and a 6500k and the 6700k will perform much better even though they are both amd64. With what Google is doing with the Pixels (still as snappy as day one here) I'm pretty sure they can optimize it further than Samsung does. They have made it run smoother in some cases on a chip that they didn't manufacture. If they made their own chip it would allow them many freedoms that they otherwise don't have = easier design of the device. I brought up the TPUs because that is experience in chip manufacturing Jason What makes you say iPhones are under powered ? Apples chips are some of the fastest around and are extremely powerful. Adrian Vovk Specs wise. They have much worse specs on paper and it would lead to a slower experience, except Apple can optimize it because they make both the chip and the OS SHunter On their Own hardware running their software in their own eco system. You cant really fairly compare it to anything else. Stephen Sharp They could use Risc-V and have to pay to license absolutely nothing, while being able to make processors purpose built for their OS Randy Gindy That would be an interesting move. Stephen Sharp Indeed, I really want Risc-V to succeed as an open ISA nachofrand They could. But in my opinion, it's unlikely. Google isn't trying to compete with Samsung and Apple in device sales and that isn't their business model. People using their services so they can show ads is their business model. It doesn't make sense for Google to make their own SoC when others are already doing a good job. Plus, if they went to RISC-V then what? What about the modem? They have to buy a standalone modem from Qualcomm or Intel. Now you have to hire system integration and test engineers to make sure the modem is working with your SoC. Oh and then you need a whole firmware team to control the modem. At that point, buy a full blown SoC with the modem on chip. Stephen Sharp Eh you lost me at "Pixel phone" and all the other hardware they sell. Google also is a Platinum member of the Risc-V foundation, and if there is a direction they are going, more control or less control, I would guess it's "more". But that's just a guess nachofrand Hardware isn't even close to the same thing as asic development. IC design is a different world. Granted they do some custom hardware, but SoCs are a much much larger feat. It's still a possibility they do so, but it doesn't make sense with their current business model imo. Randy Gindy He said nothing about ASIC he is talking about RISC-V Randy Gindy I disagree with you completely. They are penetrating the IoT market, auto market, healthcare, phones, robotics, self driving, networking, etc. Them making in house chips could really benefit every project they have. Also building an OS from the ground up to work with in house chips would be smart. Look at Apple as an example. They also may let manufacturers to use the designs. If Android One isn't evidence for them to want to standardize their platforms I don't know what is. Captain On! 1 - Google has stated that they're going to make their own silicon for the Pixels in time. 2 - Google actually owns/operates the world's most powerful quantum computer. They know how to make chips. Randy Gindy That quantum computer was built by DWave though Angel I read (somewhere don’t remember) that they have three different quantum computers systems. One from DWave and two home-produced. From those two, one was made by engineers and not that disimilar from DWave in its operations. The other was made by physicists and uses a different approach. nachofrand 1. I could be wrong, but I've only read that they plan on working closer with chip manufacturers. 2. Google didn't make that computer. Even if they did, quantum is so different those skills don't even translate. Romario Maxwell Google made their own custom ASIC called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) for their AI/Machine Learning needs on their cloud platform. See https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/05/Google-supercharges-machine-learning-tasks-with-custom-chip.html and https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/04/quantifying-the-performance-of-the-TPU-our-first-machine-learning-chip.html nachofrand Sure, although a TPU is just an accelerator. Think of it as the hexagon DSP inside of the Snapdragon SoC. That's like 1/10 of the entire chip. SoC design is much larger. Timothy Vreeland How many examples of hardware design do people have to point out before you stop? Sure the hardware they worked on previously isn't exactly the same... But before they started the hardware they are currently working on, they worked on previous hardware that wasn't the same as what they are doing now. They have shown they are competent in designing many kinds of hardware. Or do you suggest a company can only build one kind of hardware and nothing else for all eternity? How did Samsung make it's current in-house chips? Did they go to ARM college? Have they been making ARM chips since the dawn of time? No. They put together some teams and got to work, so stop blabbing and being negative. sweenish Their AI that finally beat the world's top Go players was running on custom Google chips. It's not like they don't know how. theProffer They have enough liquid assets to do whatever they want, abandon it, and then do it again without even noticing they spent the money. (Which is actually the source of a few of their problems, I think.) Matt Is that why they gave up on fiber? Pixelexel Imagine a Google Pixel with a Google made processor, with Fuschia, with Project Fi with Google WiFi powered by Google fiber. If I'd have this, my life would be complete. Owais Lone and all our data with it :( needa At least it is only one company getting it. Iamsecond Ha, no. A Google processor? Supported for 18 months, then replaced with a new processor that performs half as well (but has stickers.) Does not fully process Android code, because at Google one hand doesn't even know the other hand is there, let alone talk to it. Has 20 cores (only 2 enabled outside US for 'reasons.') Has a dedicated co-processor to enable ads in every app, even those that previously didn't have them. the.cyber.trekker I spit my coffee out on my monitor reading this!! ROFLMFAO! Jason Google can't even get a phone out the door without issues and you want them to make the chips too...lol. I'll pass. UnlikeABoss "In house kernel instead of Linux". Yeah, hopefully this dies in a thousand pits of fire. "Hey Linux guys, you know how you've helped us make billions over the years with a free open source kernel? Well, we were just using you to get the "nerd" userbase. Now we own the market thanks to you guys promoting its use of Linux, we will gradually phase you out." .... m477 I hope not. Linux is not really a kernel made with smartphone in minds. I don't care for being a fan of a kernel over another. UnlikeABoss Yeah. I'd much rather use a brand new untested kernel (and all the teething issues that will come with it) in my smartphone than a mature, stable one that's hacked on by hundreds and thousands of people every month. I mean, it's just a smartphone, we don't need it to be a secure environment, right? Let's just make a nice obscure kernel that no one else will use, and just say "but but it's open source!!! love us because we are Google kk". ... ihsan ışık I'm sorry but it just looks like you are a huge Linux fan and are just against change to me. UnlikeABoss Looks can be deceiving. If you're going to fling around the Linux fanboy term, i'll fling around the Google fanboy term, and that will surely be a nice constructive argument that we will both want to continue. m477 So, in 10 years we should still be using an unoptimised kernel like Linux, because anything newer is, well, newer? UnlikeABoss Yeah, because Linux hasn't changed at all in 10 years... m477 Yes, it changed a lot, and it still has many of the same problems, which are intrinsically bound to its structure. It's not a kernel well suited for mobile devices. UnlikeABoss You think the solution is to throw it out the window and start from scratch? I disagree. I'd much rather continue improving the Linux kernel, simply because of all the eyes it will always have on its code. jonathan Play nice ladies lol m477 With this mentality we wouldn't have Linux at all. Why start anything, while we can continue this other thing which purpose was completely different? A mircokenel is more well suited than a monolitic kernel to a mobile devices, both in terms of performance and security. No matter how much you improve Linux, it will never be a microkernel. UnlikeABoss Smartphones don't need a micro kernel in 2017. You could make that argument 7 years ago. Linux can be compiled with the required drivers just like it always could. m477 I made that argument 7 years ago. They always needed something different from Linux. The fact that specific, even proprietary drivers have to be integrated in the kernel (since Android lacks an abstraction layer) is on of the problems of the interaction Android-Linux. destinyhud why havent the nerds made linux on pc's a bigger market share if they were the one who made android a global leader UnlikeABoss No nerd is promoting Linux on the desktop. All social media used to be full of people promoting Android over iOS, these days there's no need to. destinyhud why havent they promoted desktop?? just wondering why they did for android but not for desktop.. linux on desktop was an underdog for decades. android was not popular because of kernal. android became popular because it was opensource and was the only viable competition to ios. people dont care what kernel it runs. UnlikeABoss No nerd worth their salt would promote an environment that would be a downgrade from Windows. Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time, it had a very equal playing field. There's a difference between promoting a good solid FOSS kernel where possible, and promoting an agenda. m477 Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time By this, I get that you never used Android and iOS side by side in 2009-10. UnlikeABoss You clearly value different things. The hackability alone made it an upgrade through its lifetime. m477 The same can be said for GNU/Linux on desktop. UnlikeABoss No it can't, because hackability =/= app availability. i.e. The hackability on Linux desktop doesn't make it win over it's lack of apps, where that isn't an issue on Android. m477 App availability was horrible in the early days, compared to iOS. Even Symbian had more apps. UnlikeABoss That was fine since the early days didn't consist of using your smartphone for very much, due to under powered hardware. Techies didn't go around saying "use iOS because we can all take selfies and stick filters on it". m477 iOS devices didn't have front cameras until mid 2010. The system was better, faster, smoother, the interface was coesive, there were many more apps, and the jailbreak community, to address the techie audience you like to go on about so much, was very, very good. There were tweaks and modifications that even the wildest Android custom ROM didn't have at the time. Android was objectively a downgrade, as much as Linux was on desktop. UnlikeABoss Calling jailbraik an advantage over a FOSS OS is pretty hilarious. iOS wasn't popular because it was better, it was popular because of the amount of people getting their advice from paid employees in store. "Buy iOS so we get a commission". m477 iPhone was more popular for various reasons: marketing, having 2 years of advantage, and, yes, more marketing. But it was also better than Android, as an OS. What benefit did Android bring, with it being opensource, compared to iOS, even to a "techie"? The dev community was laughable in the early days. Why GNU/Linux on desktop was not promoted by "techies" (which is false) and Android was, even if their shortcomings were identical? destinyhud u live in a dream world. even most dev dont care about kernel. what they care about the dev platform. I am a dev and i dont care for the kernel UnlikeABoss If you're talking from the perspective of an app developer then ofcourse you don't care about the kernel, you care about which platform will make you the most money... destinyhud exactly. no one care what kernel it runs.. all dev care is what platform make money. so who is this nerd who care about kernel if most dont care about the kernel.. yeah very very few.. infact rare like u UnlikeABoss Techie == Technology Enthusiast. You can sit here and tell me that you would use the best dev environment all you want but the truth is if the iOS dev environment was awful you'd still suck it up and use it to make your money. I'm not sure how you can class yourself as an enthusiast at that point. destinyhud ever wonder why no one is up voting u and upvoting many of my comments? because what u say is BS. its that simple. I am up for ditching outdated linux if the new kernal is modern and build for modern devices. most dont care for this very few techies.. i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die.. UnlikeABoss "Ever wonder why Google fanboys upvote pro Google content and not anti-Google content?" No, no I don't wonder that. How dare someone critique a pointless change by Google, causing unnecessary fragmentation. Burn them! destinyhud u must be new here.. look at anti google comments here when they make stupid changes but if they make welcome changes people tend to agree UnlikeABoss No, I've been here a long time and made many anti-Google comments as well as pro-Google. No one in the right mind would cheer on kernel fragmentation other than those that think Google can do no wrong. destinyhud open up ur comments history and let me see if u made pro google comments. i have a feeling u r a troll UnlikeABoss Yeah, this discussion is going no where. You are not the authority here and the idea that you want to browse my history to make sure I fall in line is creepy as hell. Bye. destinyhud lol i see u dont want to open ur comments history. obvious troll m477 outdated linux i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die Woah, wait a second here. Linux is not outdated, and its death would be terrible for everyone. It's just that it's not the most apt kernel for a mobile device. destinyhud maybe not outdated but not the right fit for mobile devices. destinyhud android sucked when compared to ios.. it was a downgrade compared to ios. why did dev promote android and not desktop linux? u reasoning dont even make sense. UnlikeABoss No, it wasn't a downgrade. destinyhud yes, it was back in android initial release. iOS was better and much more polished at that time. but things changed now. UnlikeABoss "Polished" is not a factor that is used to judge a better OS. There are Linux environments that are much more polished than Windows 10, but that doesn't make desktop Linux better. destinyhud it was both polished and runs better than android at that time. polished was not the only one. it was also polished. android only got better later.. i have used android at that time and it sucked big time. UnlikeABoss You are using today's standards to judge it. If you do that, they both sucked. It worked perfectly fine for the basic things people were using it for at the time. destinyhud they both sucked at that time but android sucked more than iOS at that time. SVem26 I like to think I am in the nerd userbase and I don't care what kernel is used.. can you help me understand why it matters? UnlikeABoss Do you want a brand new obscure kernel in thing that holds most of your sensitive details? TipTop I don't want something that dates back to 90s, is full of zero-days and horrible code contributed by nobodies. UnlikeABoss The idea that it is full of zero days is hilarious. You do realize that the majority of Linux exploits are local, right? Unlike Windows. Yes there is obviously code from the 90s, but very, very little of it. Not to mention that age is not a factor in deciding bad code. The idea that old code is bad code shows your inexperience. By that standard, should we dismiss Chrome because of all the exploits being found in code that was written when it first started? Are we going to create brand new software every few years to purge "old code"? Do you have any idea whatsoever how much Linux has actually changed? Do you have any idea how much of this change is because it's considered a "universal" kernel everyone can use and is focusing on? Do you really think splitting the community over onto another kernel will increase security for either of those kernels? There's a little something called code maturity. There's a reason Microsoft has way less exploits in its kernel today than 10 years ago. They didn't write a new kernel from scratch. TipTop But it is. You can be in denial all you want. Linux is the OS that is used by botnets for DDoSing websites not Windows. UnlikeABoss No sorry, come back to reality. Botnets consist of all types of OS, including Linux ofc. It is not the majority of bots in a botnet, that statement alone shows how clueless you are. Also, do you understand what Linux is? It's a kernel. The majority of Linux hosts in a botnet have been hacked through exploits in outdated software, not the kernel. The same cannot be said for Windows. Again, read the statistics for the severity of Linux exploits versus Windows. More exploits are found in Linux overall because it is open source, however, that doesn't make it worse. More critical and high severity exploits are found in Windows. That speaks a lot for the secure design of Linux. Hopefully you'll do some reading and learn. Sir_Brizz All OSes are full of vulnerabilities and horrible code written by nobodies. If that is your requirement then you must have gone full luddite by now. TipTop Windows is written by paid professionals and has QA/QC. Linux is written by fat nerds for free and has no quality control but nice try. Don't gve me the top contributors crap. Sir_Brizz Yes, tell me again how many zero day vulnerabilities are found in Windows and how long they take to get fixed. Even worse, tell me that with macOS. Being paid doesn't guarantee quality, just as being unpaid doesn't guarantee garbage. Windows and macOS have some of the crappiest insecure code. And there is nothing special about having QA or being paid to write code. Some of the worst programmers I have ever met worked at places like Microsoft and Apple. https://mobile.twitter.com/taviso/status/860681252034142208 Please continue trying to tell me how infallible paid programmers are! UnlikeABoss They are totally da bestest eva! UnlikeABoss Obviously paid products will always be better than unpaid products... right!?!? /s Oh wait we have tons of real life examples of free products being better than paid, shocking how that works. It's almost as if the best products are made by the most passionate people, and like, being paid doesn't guarantee being passionate about your creation. What a crazy crazy world! ihsan ışık Are you implying that Android got popular because of "nerds" who heard it uses the Linux kernel? UnlikeABoss If you are old enough to know the early days of android you'll know that having every single nerd on the internet promoting Android over iOS most certainly helped get the ball rolling. Once it was pushed, it snowballed into what it is today. m477 Sure. It was the nerds on the internet, not the manufacturers with ads everywhere. Most people still don't know their Galaxy runs Android. UnlikeABoss The giant billboards came YEARS afterwards, cmon. m477 Yes, and that's why Android was so unpopular in the early days. UnlikeABoss What? It was massively popular among all techies for being the open source iOS alternative. m477 You are overestimating the "techies" crowd. Even BlackBerryOS was more popular at the time. Only after the Galaxy S it started to grow, and became popular among normal people. UnlikeABoss Not really. We are talking over a decade ago now, there were far less people on the internet and it was far easier for techies to promote products because everyone was asking their "techie" friend what is best. But these days everyone is an "expert" so that's not as much of a thing. m477 Again, you overestimate how many techies there actually were. Your personal experience is anecdotal. Market shares and sell data are objective. Also, over a decade ago Android was still a camera os, and it wasn't public. UnlikeABoss No, I do not. The further back in time you go, the higher the proportion of techies there were using the internet versus others. People were only just starting to look at buying a smartphone, and asking techies what they should buy. m477 Yes, the concentration on the internet of "techies" on the internet was greater. And? What normal user at the time went to the internet, looked at reviews and said "Oh, look! The HTC magic has Linux! This random guy says its good, so I'm gonna buy it!"? You really think that a bunch of "techies">marketing? A guy saying that his toy-looking HTC G1 is better than the iPhone is more effective than billboards and tv ads? Come on, even Windows Mobile was more popular. It took Samsung's aggressive marketing to make Android popular. UnlikeABoss Windows Mobile and BlackBerry were more popular in the enterprise, that's it. The entire discussion is home users. Also I think there's been some confusion. I wasn't implying that techies on the internet were promoting Android on the internet like a marketing department. I was implying that the internet was very much a "social media" platform for techies to communicate where the majority of them would use Android and mocked the use of iOS. The actual "marketing" happened offline when a normal user would ask their "techie" friend for first time buying advice. It is nothing like that today, and the internet is nothing like the techie community it once was. m477 So, what you're saying is that the internet was a circlejerk of Android users. Ok, and? It didn't affected normal users the slightest, iOS was still more popular until Samsung took Android more seriously. The techie friend thing its only your anecdotal experience, it bears no influence on the market, in the grand scheme of things. I'd even argue that Google's very light marketing did much, much more. Also, the mindless techies that recommended half backed devices instead of better alternatives because "Uh, Linux!!" did more harm than good, both to the users and to Android. UnlikeABoss If you read my OP you'll see my original point was that Google has rode the "Android circlejerk" to popularity, and you can debate how much popularity that added as much as you want. The fact remains, it got the ball rolling. Samsung didn't pick it up "just because", it saw that a lot of people were pushing it. There were several OS at the time it could have used, including sticking to its own. Why bother with Android? Maybe because it wanted to see how much market it could take by appealing to techies? However, if you stand back and look at it, how is this any different from "embrace, extend, extinguish"? Google used that "free marketing" and has now decided to use it's massive popularity to push a different product. (Which has failed in the past and will hopefully fail again). Why hate Microsoft for doing that in the past, but we praise Google for doing it? Why are we excited for something we know nothing about that is creating fragmentation? m477 Samsung had used several OSes, it had Windows Mobile and Phone devices, Symbian devices, and proprietary devices, even Palm OS devices IIRC. They used them all. Android had was the easiest to personalise for them, and create a copy of the best selling product, which was the iPhone, and there was an app market, so they tried to release and market their flagship with it, and market it as broadly as Apple. The first Galaxy (the "non S") was was vastly ignored, because it was as little marketed as all their other devices. The techies crowd was insignificant. The free marketing is just as much as Windows 10 gets for incorporating Ubuntu's bash terminal. What you saw is not really important. I saw lots and lots of Windows Phones in 2010 and 11. Many more than Android devices. Every one I knew had one, and if I had to say which OS was the most popular only based on my personal experience, in my smallish city, I'd obviously would say Windows Phone. Why are you so attached to Linux, excluding all possibilities of giving a possibly better solution a try? The community will just fork the AOSP and continue the development of the Linux branch. UnlikeABoss Cmon, we both know Android was not easier for them to customize than simply using their own OS. No one was recommending it, techie or not, no matter how much they marketed. It's only now they are popular they are trying to slip in their own OS, and still failing. I am not attached to Linux despite people using it as an easy scapegoat to dismiss a discussion critiquing almighty Google. We currently have a situation where most kernel developers focus entirely on Linux, making it virtually the universal kernel. Why are we creating pointless fragmentation there? Why divide that community? Do we honestly believe that a divided community can produce a better kernel, or do we love it because Google is doing it? Would we love it if Microsoft did this? m477 The proprietary OS they used at the time was a Java based thing with a flash interface. Hardly able to compete against iOS. It was easier for them to use the "next Symbian" that they could customise as they wanted, and that also had an app market. If they made, say, Bada, before Android become established and popular, and marketed it as much as they did with their Galaxy S, the market would be very different today. The normal user doesn't care what OS their shiny phone runs, as long as there's facebook. I am a GNU/Linux user since the first half of the 2000s, and I've always critiqued Google for using Linux as a kernel on phones. Linux might be the universal kernel, but smartphones need a more streamlined solution. I don't care if it's Google, the MIT, or Richard Stallman in person to do it. I liked WP8 architecture. Fragmentation is not pointless if it brings benefits to the user. TipTop Nobody cares about your FSF agenda. John Q I think the chief reason Google is not using Linux is that they want a real-time OS (RTOS). Linux is at best a "soft" RTOS, possessing a real-time scheduler but this is still not nearly as real-time as an actual RTOS should be. It would take a very large effort to do that for Linux so it makes sense that Google would want to make their own kernel that they can have full control over. UnlikeABoss Let's ignore the fact that Linux is used in real time car systems for a moment. Could you elaborate on why you think Google would want/need a RTOS on their smartphones? M6 The kernel they're using, 'magenta', is opened source. So who cares if they're using linux or not? Does everyone have to use linux? UnlikeABoss No it doesn't have to be Linux. But who else will use Magenta? Probably no one. So why are we fragmenting the kernel space further? Why would you choose an immature kernel for something as valuable (your data) as your smartphone. Would you trust that? I would much rather developers continue focusing on a single kernel. WesleySmalls But wouldn't Magenta be this single kernel? UnlikeABoss If everyone decided to ditch Linux and focus purely on Magenta as the universal kernel, yes. Will that happen? WesleySmalls Could be, just not overnight. The market was already fairly well developed when Linux arrived in 1991, yet it still managed to become a very, if not the most, important player in the market. It's certainly possible, it will just require proper investment(and neglect of their alternate platforms) and patience to make it work M6 That's some straight up communist shit right there. Let's just work on one thing, because we only need one thing, everything else is redundant! Let's not allow other people to do the same thing in a different way, because competition totally doesn't spur innovation at all. WORPspeed So Andromeda definitely dead or still happening? sleepinlight Pretty sure this IS Andromeda, or at least a part of it. Andromeda was never an official name for anything, it was just the internal project name for some sort of new and/or merged OS. WORPspeed I thought Andromeda specifically referred to merging Android and Chrome OS. So is that specific merger dead or on life-support? John Q Nah, the Android/Chrome merger was just speculation from what Andromeda seemed to be. There was never any concrete evidence to imply that Andromeda was a merger. WORPspeed To quote Androidpolice : "So please, when you see Fuchsia mentioned, or speculation that it "is" Andromeda, know that it is just that: speculation. Last we heard from sources we consider extremely reliable, Android was the basis of Andromeda, and Andromeda would see its commercial debut on a new Pixel laptop later this year. It is possible Google has changed plans around Andromeda, that the initiative itself may have even been scrapped. Though, we have no reason to think so - it's more that we don't know, and haven't heard anything about Andromeda in quite some time." http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ WORPspeed http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ That makes them seem very separate Srujan https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e7fda716dfcfdca76e200e51a9c9144c72e183c7e76d36b910c20ee0931aee79.gif destinyhud if this replaces android rather than having 2 separate codebase, I am all up for it. splitting the android community is dangerous senor_heisenberg Well if this does end up being what replaces Android or what Android evolves into, I just hope my apps and whatnot are compatible. Ain't got the time or money to be investing into another ecosystem. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman That's a tricky, double-edged sword. I can't fathom they would not support the old apps, or at least the vast majority of them, for exactly that reason. But in doing so it will likely be held back at least slightly from what it can/should be. Backward-compatibility tends to hold everything back. What I'd wager is we won't see this until hardware's powerful enough to make emulating the old system in a VM relatively cheap and easy, with back-end Play Store penalties to developers who don't shift to the new app models, and then slow phase-outs in stages of the older functionality and support until the new OS is running exclusively its own setup. senor_heisenberg That sounds good. Randy Gindy I think Google porting the Android Run-time to Chrome OS was to see if they could do it. morteum This is old news, I'm waiting for Fuchsia 2.0 Barracuda. /s marcusmarcus2 What if they aren't going by Animal names in general but by mammal names. I'd skip the Fuchsia 2.0 Bandicoot. It will probably be "Crash" prone. Alfonso Surroca Three operating systems is not nearly enough. We need at least two more announced at I/O. Suicide_Note One OS for each Google messaging app. AbbyZFresh If this is not customizable, the Andorid OEMs won't be liking this one bit. Miku is Best Vocaloid Leprosy OS. 4Ui812 All of Google's projects are missing one thing..... can I make a suggestion Google? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7c05d652570603779d08c4dbce3535891bbfd9b0bd62ebb1c5a084b03e7d21ea.gif Christopher Bement Honestly, this would cure my fever. 4Ui812 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7ac8191019b3b90075b387b129808b379bef70d0796d8d2263109849fa1b71bc.gif BetterWithRoot https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6ozscsz4jRX7xuQE/giphy.gif saf1927 Reading the comments of armchair experts here makes me smile. klaus666 But will it solve the update problem? Suicide_Note There is no update problem. Nexus/Pixels run the latest and greatest. OEMs who mess with the OS give their customers severely delayed updates. pfmiller Nexus and Pixels run the latest and greatest for two years. Nobody would accept this OS update situation if it was on a desktop OS. MJ Thank God it's phones we are talking about and not a desktop PC. marcusmarcus2 That is exactly why Windows XP lasted only a couple years before all computers updated to Windows 7... Seriously though. I'm fine with only getting Android version upgrades phones for 2 years. But they really need to extend out security updates beyond 3 years. Suicide_Note This isn't a desktop OS, not to mention people tend to change phones much more often than their desktops. pfmiller Sure it's not a desktop OS, but no sense pretending that what we have leaves nothing to be desired. And sure people change their phones more often that their desktops, but there's absolutely no reason to change every 2 years. Suicide_Note I change phones at least once a year, and sometimes two or three times. I couldn't imagine going two years or more on the same phone. pfmiller You can do what you look like, but there's absolutely no reason why that would be necessary. Suicide_Note It's only necessary if you want the latest and greatest, which i like to have, because phone tech is still evolving and improving at a good clip. For example, had i skipped the Pixel, I'd still be using my 6P or N6, both of which have cameras that are vastly inferior to that in the Pixel. I've taken some incredible shots with the Pixel, some of which would be literally impossible to duplicate using the camera in the 6P/N6. That alone is reason enough for me to upgrade on a yearly basis. Doby Gillis Which is a problem, Einstein. Suicide_Note Not if you're a Nexus/Pixel owner, Dilbert. Randy Gindy I would generally say there is. Android phones are not supported for nearly as long as an iPhone. The reason being that the chip set manufacturers do not release new drivers. Shelly-Man Vol 2 It's looks pretty neat for a development stage. Rami Well Android has to reach Z someday. In the case, Hello Fuchsia! marcusmarcus2 Those split-screens will be really useful for running of of Google's different messaging apps. Hopefully OS's aren't the new messaging apps of Google.

You can install it just as any other apk Rick Kode Cool WesleySmalls "Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware, or will it some day replace Android altogether?" Neither, this is just a side project many developers use to test and work out the feasability of a variety of things. Android is a very well developed environment, and replacing it whole is simply a no-go. Things will just gradually evolve, as they have already done with Dalvik being replaced by ART, for example. Sir_Brizz I don't think you're wrong, but it would be in Google's best interest to start building a non-JVM runtime that apps can run inside with a native language that Google has 100% full control over like Go or Dart. Тарас Мукин 1. This is definetelly Chat UI! It came from Telegram bots and whatsoever, and it is so smart of Google to be developing it now. Feels like it's going to be next big UI-change after Apple came up with apps divided into screens. 2. "Magenta is designed for ... non-trivial amounts of ram" This is going to be optimised sooo bad.

Nicolas Bahamondes Fuchsia Police... Alvin My money is on this turning into a really useful and innovative messaging app. Oh, with stickers. Superman Not happening, just like module phone. Lol Cyber Jethro I personally think this is for embedded systems like shopping kiosks or other customer service applications. Zach Mauch "Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware" Did you mean "relegated", not "neglected"? ZettabyteGamer Neglected works, and is the better word choice here. PVL_93_RU Those "stories" on the "home screen" look like they'd fit perfectly for a kiosk-type display, where you have a lot of space to work with JG Fuchsia is a purple-y pink color. T-Mobile's color is Magenta, a slightly different purple-y pink color T-Mobile is rumored to be looking into launching their own phone... Coincidence??? Almost certainly, without a doubt yes... But consider... T-Mobile also launched the first Android phone... Nomaan Is this why Pixels were released in 2016 coz google tested fuchsia and magenta on existing pixels with existing qualcomm drivers and they know they could just update it in 2018 and further without having to worry about qualcomm dropping support? One can dream... yoloswag Inspired by the messaging team, Google wants to start working on a 2nd operating system. Darth Vader 3rd* JG Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Modern personal computers huh? I've been interested in Google packing ChromeOS into a LiveCD type set up we could test/install on our own computers... (*Yes, I know of Chromium, haven't tried it yet... But I would prefer it coming direct from Google, faster updates and all that). It could be interesting to try out another of Google's OSs without having to fork over several hundred for new hardware... The only problem would be drivers to support the various hardware. If not modified too much, ChromeOS could possibly use the original Gentoo Linux drivers. But with Fuchsia using its own unique kernel... That might throw things off a bit... I know a few less tech-savey individuals who would probably be more comfortable if the same OS powered their phone, tablet and desktop (should Google opt to replace Android with Fuchsia). Especially if it could run both Android apps and Chrome extensions natively. Zxyon Rhysivz This could be the beginning of distros for Android. *Imagines Ubuntu Android* Aqrasil Wasn't there Ubuntu though? Peter World Citizen This will run in parallel with Android.

King_Android Well its safe to say its definitely for mobile phones seeing that T-mobile is the "current" carrier, so we can rule out it only being for IoT. mattcoz Phones aren't the only devices that can use mobile data. King_Android Such as a tablet? Either way it still holds true. This will obviously be used for a phone/tablet I dont know much else that uses T-mobile thats not a phone or tablet and would need a UI like this. mattcoz Tablets, wearables, vehicles, and whatever else the future brings. This is not for the devices of today, it's for the devices of tomorrow. Will that include phones? Probably, but "definitely" is too strong at this point.

Liliputing LPX Show Mini PCs Reviews Deals Shop About Contact us Advertise on Liliputing About Liliputing Privacy Statement Chrome for Android gets a few new offline tricks 05/08/2017 at 3:30 PM by Brad Linder 1 Comment Google’s Chrome browser for Android already has a feature that lets you save web pages for viewing later… even if you don’t have an active internet connection when you finally get around to reading that article, opening those directions, or doing whatever it is you wanted to do with a saved page. But now Google is rolling out a few updates that make it easier to save pages for offline viewing… and even to tell the browser to download a page the next time you’re online if you click a link only to find out it can’t load because you’ve lost your connection. In addition to downloading the page you’re currently viewing, Chrome now lets you long-press any link or article suggestion from the new tab page and choose “download link” to save that page for later viewing. This can come in handy if you’re reading an article with a bunch of links you want to follow up on, but might not have time to read them all right now. And if you do lose your internet connection while navigating, and find yourself looking at Google’s “you are offline” dinosaur icon, you can now tap the “download page later” button to save that page automatically when you and your internet connection are reunited.

The Harmon Kardon Invoke is a voice-enabled 360 speaker powered by Microsoft's Cortana. The news spoiled the announcement of Amazon's new Echo Show, which loosely resembles an iPad built into a carriage clock. Quite who intended to spoil who first isn't clear. It looks like a mutual spoiling. Amazon's Echo Show is harder to explain. It's a 7-inch box with a colour display and speaker, and Alexa inside. To which you may ask: "Why? When everyone has a perfectly capable voice assistant in their pocket already? And can watch videos on their tablet or phablet?" To answer that somewhat gives the game away. The Amazon Echo was a hit because it allowed you to look up and talk, not fumble for a gadget. But on a phone, it's Google (or Apple) that collects the voice data and personal information, not Amazon. Therefore Amazon felt an overwhelming urge to build a portable device that allows it to capture your speech, bypassing Apple and Google. You mean it's all about data collection? No, silly, it's about bringing information to your fingertips seamlessly, integrating with your always-on digital lifestyle! But it's still a clunky gadget with a hefty price tag. Amazon's Echo Show Just like the category-defining Amazon Echo and Google's clone, Home (review), the Invoke is a 360-degrees speaker. What sets it apart from the Alexa-powered eavesdropper is the ability to make Skype calls, although both Echo and Home are expected to get this functionality before too long. Harmon Kardon's Cortana-powered Invoke Don't hold your breath, though. Harmon Kardon's Invoke won't be available until autumn and the retail price wasn't disclosed. Amazon's Echo Look The six-month delay has given Amazon time to diversify its hit line. Amazon recently launched an always-on camera, Echo Look, a very 1984-ish eye in the home. "See yourself from every angle with the companion app. Build a personal lookbook and share your photos," Amazon urges a little creepily. Cortana may have superior speech recognition but Amazon is the more attractive prospect for developers and businesses looking to integrate with the new UI. Echo doesn't just have a huge sales lead, it has the more open platform too, Wireless Watch noted here. Amazon is pushing Alexa hard at other consumer electronics categories. Samsung has yet to release its Bixby SDK and, for now, has yet to decouple it from its phones either. Find out more about the luggable Echo here, Invoke here.

Now, they can show you stuff, too.  On Tuesday, the Seattle-based giant unveiled the Echo Show, which features a seven-inch touch screen that can pull up calendar appointments, display music lyrics, play videos and a lot more. Bloomberg reported on the new device last November. The Echo Show will cost $229 when it goes on sale in late June, $50 more than the current high-end model. The debut follows last month's introduction of the Echo Look, which can evaluate a user's wardrobe. Including the two new entrants, Amazon will have five products in the Echo lineup, all powered by the Alexa digital assistant. Echo Show Source: Amazon Amazon's gadget business isn't about big profits; it's a way to hook consumers into the company's fast-growing retail business and get people to sign up for the lucrative Prime subscription service. Meanwhile, Amazon has managed to outflank Google, which began selling its Home device two years after the Echo debuted, and Apple, which is still working on its own Siri-based version. Amazon won't say how many Echos have been sold, but it has grabbed 70 percent of the U.S. market  for voice-assisted speakers, according to eMarketer, with Google accounting for most of the rest. In a demonstration at Amazon's San Francisco offices, the Echo Show displayed full weather forecasts, news headlines and LeBron James highlights. The company says the device will also play camera feeds from such connected devices as baby monitors and camera-equipped door bells. Services that already connect to the Echo will be able to display information—say how far an Uber is from your front door or the basic box score for a baseball game. Alexa currently supports 12,000 "skills," Amazon's term for third-party services, and over time will offer increasingly comprehensive information, such as the points scored by a specific player.  "We're not trying to build a phone or tablet interface on this, but extend that ambient nature of what you already have with an Echo," says Amazon devices chief Dave Limp, who has been testing the Show at home for about a year.  This is the first Echo speaker with a built-in camera. The five-megapixel sensor makes possible a new video conferencing service that Amazon is rolling out alongside the new hardware. Similar to Apple's FaceTime, the service lets people make video calls from one Echo Show to another, or between the Show and an updated Alexa app on a smartphone. The service doubles as an intercom, allowing a person to call an Alexa speaker in another room without a camera. Users can't currently make cell phone calls via the Echo Show.  The Echo Show screen is slightly smaller than an iPad mini's and the same size as the Kindle Fire tablet. The Intel-powered device has better sound than its predecessor, eight microphones instead of seven and can now connect directly to WiFi, not solely via the Alexa smartphone app. By pushing a button, you can disable the camera and microphones. Limp says hackers won't be able to activate the camera remotely.  The new Echo will stream music from Amazon's own service, Spotify and Pandora, but not Apple Music. "We'd love to have Apple, but they're not super big" on opening up Apple Music integration, Limp says. (Apple Music subscribers can do a workaround by streaming audio from their smartphone to the Echo device via Bluetooth.) Will the new Echo enhance Amazon's first-mover advantage? Photos of the Show—a black or white wedge of plastic—elicited decidedly mixed reviews on Twitter, with one person saying it belonged on Star Trek (presumably the original) and another comparing it with the Chumby, a chunky digital assistant whose maker filed for bankruptcy. The Show may also be too pricey for many consumers. A report released Monday by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners in Chicago said the cheapest Echo product, the $50, hockey puck-shaped Dot, has accounted for more than half of the estimated 10.7 million Echo devices sold since 2014.

Sign Up Plus Apple, maker of beautiful products even when they aren't hits, potentially could leapfrog the Show. In a recent research note, analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said Apple may debut an Echo rival next month at the company's annual developer's conference. Apple employees have been testing a device at home for several months, according to people familiar with the matter. While marketing chief Phil Schiller recently talked up the benefits of having a screen on a voice-activated device, it's not clear whether the Apple version will in fact have one.

Echo Show, which will cost $230 in the US and will ship on 28 June (no UK release date is set), will operate like Amazon’s existing Echo and Echo Dot wifi-connected smart speakers, putting the company’s artificially intelligent voice assistant Alexa into the home. But unlike Amazon’s previous voice-only smart speakers, it will also have a touchscreen to show extra information, play videos from YouTube and elsewhere, show results for questions and other visual information that’s currently displayed when Alexa is asked a question on the firm’s Fire TV smart devices. Amazon said: “Voice responses from Alexa are now enhanced with visuals and optimised for visibility across the room. Call or message your family and friends that also have an Echo or the Alexa App, get the news with a video flash briefing, see your Prime Photos, shop with your voice, see lyrics with Amazon Music, and more. All you have to do is ask.” Echo Show has two Dolby-tuned speakers in the front, which Amazon says should fill a room and make listening to music or watching video better than with previous devices, and a front-facing camera. Users can also place calls to other Echo or Alexa App users, including a new feature Amazon calls “Drop In” for family and friends. The screen can also display the feeds from compatible security cameras The Echo Show is the second new Amazon Echo device to be announced in the last few weeks. In April, Amazon launched the Echo Look, a voice-controlled smart selfie camera that is able to compare outfits and give fashion advice. While Echo Look is only available to select customers in the US via invitation, Echo Show will see wider availability, albeit only in the US initially. Fight for the smart home Facebook Twitter Pinterest Amazon, which launched the original Echo in the US in 2014, has benefitted from being ahead of the chasing pack. Photograph: Amazon Amazon is locked in battle with Google and others for the burgeoning new world of voice assistant-powered smart speakers. Amazon has the lead thanks to its original Echo, which was launched in the US in 2014 and the UK in 2016. It became a sleeper hit in the US, while its open partnerships with various smart home makers including Alphabet’s Nest and Samsung’s SmartThings propelled it to an early market majority. According to data from eMarketer, Amazon’s Echo devices will have 70.6% of the market versus 23.8% for Google’s Home. The research firm expects 35.6 million Americans will use a voice-assisted device at least once a month, which means that smart speakers will be far from a mass-market device, but usage will be up 128.9% year on year. Martín Utreras, vice president of forecasting for eMarketer, said: “Consumers are becoming increasingly comfortable with the technology, which is driving engagement. As prices decrease and functionality increases, consumers are finding more reasons to adopt these devices.” Samsung’s Harman Kardon is set to release a voice-controlled speaker with Microsoft’s Cortana virtual assistant in the Autumn in the US, leaving Apple as the last of the big four US technology companies with a virtual assistant but no voice-controlled speakers to house it in. While Google’s Assistant has been available in a broad range of Android devices, including smartphones and smartwatches, Amazon’s big advantage has been the opening up of its Alexa system to third-party developers and hardware makers, which has seen Alexa appear in various speakers, other devices and cars. Whether an Echo speaker with a screen is what the next stage of voice-control in the home looks like remains to be seen. Apple’s senior vice-president of worldwide marketing, Phil Schiller, recently said in an interview with NDTV that a screen was key to a voice-controlled device, although the popularity of Amazon’s original Echo was partly fuelled by it being a voice-only interface that freed both hands and eyes.

First discovered (by folks outside of Google) last year, at the time it wasn’t entirely clear what Fuchsia was for. It was clear it was a new OS that used a custom kernel called Magenta rather than Linux. But as a command line-only OS, it was difficult for outsiders to figure out what to do with Fuchsia. Now Google has added some documentation and the tools needed to compile a user interface for the operating system. You can also compile that UI as an Android app, which is how the folks at Hotfix and Ars Technica took the new UI for a spin and figured out that it seems to be designed for smartphones or other touchscreen devices. In a nutshell, the new user interface (which is codenamed “armadillo”) includes a home screen that lets you scroll through recent apps, a quick settings view that lets you adjust the volume, screen rotation lock, volume, and other features, and a Google Now-like search-and-suggestion view. There’s a software keyboard, a home button, and notifications that are displayed on the bottom of the screen. But while the Fuchsia/Armadillo user interface looks quite different from Android, it’s what’s under the hood that really makes it stand out. It has a different kernel, a custom graphics rendering engine based on Vulkan, and users other Google tools to help apps run smoothly. As Ars Technica notes, Google hasn’t officially said what it plans to do with Fuchsia. But it sure looks like an attempt to reimagine what a mobile operating system should look like. Android includes a lot of legacy code that was developed based on decisions made years ago. If you were starting over from scratch, you’d probably ditch a lot of things in the Android codebase… and you might end up with something that looks a lot like Fuchsia. What remains to be seen is whether Google plans to replace Android with Fuchsia one day, or if the goal is to develop the two operating systems simultaneously. With hundreds of millions of devices currently running Android, making a sudden switch could be a risky move. But if there’s an upgrade path or a way to let the two projects coexist for a while and test the waters, Fuchsia may have a role in the future of Google’s mobile strategy.

Mobile has evolved and continues to do so. Fuschia, right now, looks like a throw back to prehistoric times. Maybe the goal is another ToyOS for low-end devices aimed at 3rd-ish world countries who don’t have the benefits of constant surveillance and increasing censorship.

MEPs, April 24, wrote to Google demanding the company "implement Google's own guidelines on harassment and bullying content, and stop serving ads to the hate site Breitbart.com." "Fake news is a complex problem, but there is one simple thing you can do to tackle it in this instance. Breitbart (and Google) makes money from displaying Google Ads on the site, often without the knowledge of the brands involved," the MEPs wrote. "More than a thousand brands have stopped their ads appearing on the site, and workers have resigned over their employer's unwillingness to sever ties with Breitbart." Are We All Living in the Breitbart Bubble? 'Difficult Issues' Google has now responded, staunchly defending itself, refusing to even mention the Los Angeles-based news network in its response. "We would like to reassure you that we understand your concerns, and that we take hate speech and 'fake news'-issues that extend well beyond any individual website-very seriously. We will also outline how we have put in place a long-term, considered response to these difficult issues," Google said in its letter. "Since its inception, the world wide web has enabled people to share a diversity of views, products, and services, with tens of thousands of new web pages coming online every day. Online advertising- such as that provided by Google, amongst others — has enabled millions of website publishers and creators in Europe and around the world to build businesses, find audiences and earn a living. © REUTERS/ Dado Ruvic Facebook Steps Up Security to Suppress 'Fake News' in UK Election Campaign "Google has strict policies that determine the types of content against which ads may be displayed. These policies exclude ads from, for example, content that promotes illegal activity, contains graphic or gory images, and more, and we enforce them rigorously," Google said. "In addition, we have also built comprehensive tools for advertisers to define to a granular degree the content and websites that they deem to be appropriate for their ads. Advertisers can, for example, target and block content by topics, categories, content appropriateness, and even by individual URLs." ...

To create a link, simply set the length of time you want your location shared and pick an app. Choosing a contact simply connects directly to their account, but using the "More" button at the bottom (or the shortcut next to it) creates a link. They're all "maps.app.goo.gl" URLs. You can do whatever you want with the link—email it, share it in a message, even tweet it. I don't know why you would do that, but you can. The links are managed just like connections to contacts. You can deactivate them at any time and view the current status in Maps. Each one is also unique, so you can set different lengths of time for different links. It's a bit similar to the photo sharing links built into Google Photos. Neat, right?

It is now enabled for me. In the UK. The app never updated. Artem Russakovskii Yeah, it's a server side change. Total Insecurity I think you can force it, though. Here in Germany in German language I got it by doing the following: "[On my other phone] it could get activated by signing out and in again. Then you need to press the new widget and it should appear. Maybe try deleting a your cache like I did before as well! All you need to do is: Go to widgets in Android, add and click on the share location widget​." Dirge LOL. No need to jump through hoops. Just clear google map's cache and force stop, then open it again and viola! It is there. Total Insecurity Not everyone made that experience, I think. But you could be right, though. :) Ian Kumlien If you select settings from the three buttons on the right side, you can select which circles to share with but the settings can't be saved apparently demarcmj That is probably a remnant from G+. When I first went to that settings page yesterday, it complained at me that I needed a G+ profile. But today that went away and it's working. I imagine that circle sharing will probably go away entirely. Shaques So if you're sharing via a contact and not a link, that person needs to have Google Maps installed on their device (mainly thinking iOS) for it to work properly otherwise they apparently receive an email. Midas Gordon-Farleigh I think they'll need to be logged into their Google account too, obviously. I have many contacts that I can invite that definitely use Google maps, but haven't logged in - more particularly on iOS where it's not linked to the OS. Morten Ulv Just tested, no need to be logged in. JG Does it work on the web as well? If so iOS (and the few WP users) could access your location via maps.google.com via their web browser of choice without having to install Google Maps app... bulletmark Location sharing in the G+ app was poorly implemented and the web view was hopeless. This new native implementation in Maps seems to work great though, both on mobile and the web. F4LL0U7 Yeah even Latitude wasn't implemented so well. Let's hope this is something they stick with, and don't abandon it like they tend to do. demarcmj Agree, but Latitude was at least implemented better than G+ Rod Just got it. (Brazil) http://i.imgur.com/T13JaqD.png Carson Saldanha Before us US folks? Unacceptable! /s Rod Haters gonna hate. Dirge I'm in the US and I got it around Noon, Pacific Time. René Simonsen Would like to know how it works on the receiving end. Is that part integrated into Google Maps too? Can I share my location with an iOS user, and will he easily keep track of my location in his Google Maps app? ericshmerick iOS works as well, appeared on my iPhone a few hours ago. Should be platform independent as it's using Google's services/account to communicate. Giampi Working very well. I would like a persistent notification when sharing although. F4LL0U7 The option to have it would be good. They have that in Trusted Contacts. But for those of us who share indefinitely with a spouse, that would get annoying, so it would be good to be able to turn it off. Jennifercalvarez Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Jurij Turnšek Can you comment on battery drain when sharing location constantly? F4LL0U7 My wife and I have been sharing our locations with each other constantly since the feature launched, and we haven't noticed any impact on battery life. I don't think it's using any more power than usual. Your phone determines your exact location on a pretty regular basis anyway, assuming you have that enabled. All this feature is doing is taking that info that Google already knows, and sharing it with people of your choice. tofuuu630 After a month in, can you comment on the battery life? I tried it for a day but noticing my battery dropped faster than normal. But then again I'm not sure if it was placebo effect or due to the app's I downloaded around that time. Thanks! F4LL0U7 No noticeable difference in battery life whatsoever. I'm still at 20-30% by end of day. See my comment above. It's not using any extra resources, unless you didn't have location services always enabled anyway. tofuuu630 Thanks for the fast response! Yeah I figured it shouldn't use more battery since google now always knows where you are near as long as you have location services set to high accuracy (which I do) so maybe it's placebo effect that I'm experiencing. Will test it for a longer period and see! F4LL0U7 And also, if you happen to be using your phone a lot more that day due to new apps and features, your battery obviously won't last as long. I'd say give it a week of normal use to give you a better idea. tofuuu630 I left the feature on overnight and now while on my commute to work and noticed the following: while overnight and at home (wifi), my phone drained 2% in 8 hours, but when I was on my commute which is around an hour (and on LTE), my phone drained 4%. Both of these situations my phone would be left idle and I didn't use my phone at all during the commute. What was your battery life when you had this feature on and moving around while on data? F4LL0U7 Well, staying in one physical location while on wifi will drain your battery far less than moving and on LTE. Even if you're not technically using your phone on your commute, your phone's cell connection is still being handed off from tower to tower as you pass them. It's constantly searching for signal, which uses way more battery than staying in one spot on one stable connection. Also, just something else to consider. If your phone started off at 100% in both instances, and you observed it at 98% and 96% respectively, those numbers aren't exactly accurate. When your phone charges to "100%", it doesn't technically stay there. To protect the life of modern batteries, your charger will allow periodic discharges and trickle recharges towards the top capacity of the battery. However, when you take it off the charger, it will still appear at 100% regardless of where it is in that dis/recharge cycle (so consumers don't think there's something wrong with their device). Once the charge level updates to its actual level, you may see it drop lower than you'd expect. I personally don't keep that close an eye on my battery level. My phone comes off the charger at 6:30am, it charges in my car for about 20 minutes while I drive to work, then it sits on my desk all day on LTE, charges in my car for another 20 minutes on my way home, and then it's off the charger at home on wifi until 11pm or so, at which point I charge it for the night. At the end of the night, the level is anywhere between 15-30% depending on how much I've used it. If you're worried about battery life, I'd say location sharing via Google Maps is probably one of your lowest concerns. If you're looking to optimize your battery, I'd say go through your apps and see which ones are syncing in the background and pulling your phone out of Doze mode. Try using Swipe instead of Facebook. Try keeping your brightness on auto. Delete apps you rarely use, and use their mobile websites in Chrome instead. Don't use live wallpaper or widgets. Those kinds of things. The worst enemies of battery life are crappy apps that (intentionally or accidentally) remain active when they don't need to be. tofuuu630 Yeah you are exactly right! I should have mentioned before hand that I don't fully charge my phone to 100% either. I just plug it in when I need to and unplug when I don't. So when I left home, my phone was at 83% and 79% when I got to work. I should have also mentioned that previously before I had this feature enabled the drain would have only been at most 2% while idle in my pocket on my commute to work. I am not trying to refute your claim that this feature doesn't drain battery, I am just curious as to what's causing it (which may very well be other rogue apps) or the new May security patch update. Just wanted to bring my findings here to share :) As for Facebook, I don't use Facebook lol, so I don't have that app. I only have 72 apps on my phone (a lot of it are component apps by Google) and I would say the apps I use the most would be Whatsapp and Instagram (which are both Facebook apps as well I know lol). I really would like to keep this feature on which is why I am troubleshooting to see what may be causing this recent drain! Thanks for all your input! What phone do you use if I may ask? F4LL0U7 No problem! I use a Nexus 5X. Good luck with your troubleshooting, if you figure it out, post it! Benjamin Pavel When this activated they also turned off the G+ location sharing...that sucks as I've had my mother and my cousin on there and it seems these shared locations are not transitioning to this new system which sucks! Biff Wonsley Yeah, you're gonna have to set them up again from scratch. Oddly, my G+ location sharing widget is still working, even though location sharing in my Maps is live. I know where my wife is, she doesn't know where I am. Even though she's sitting right next to me. F4LL0U7 Sharing via a link is a great idea. Does your location have a persistent link? Like, could my wife and I bookmark each other's locations on our desktops? Or would we have to share to a link and bookmark that? codemonkey85 If it's your wife, why even deal with links if you can share directly through Google accounts? But anyway, the links you generate are persistent, same as Photos sharing links... until they are revoked. F4LL0U7 We are sharing that way, I'm just wondering if there's a permalink directly to the user's location, (if someone is sharing with you) for bookmarking purposes. demarcmj I think I saw something in the video they put out that said sharing via link was limited to a certain duration. Can't be set as "ongoing." JG They're all "maps.app.goo.gl" URLs. You can do whatever you want with the link—email it, share it in a message, even tweet it. I don't know why you would do that, but you can. A food truck might want to tweet a link to their location so fans could come get food... create812 I can imagine some people will come up with clever and creative uses of this feature. mwolverine If my wife and I share location with each other (until we turn it off), will this be a massive battery drain? Rod Yes. GPS + location download/upload Jeroen Kap My guess: no. Your smartphone updates your location by default on standard times. I think this will benefit from that information. Only when you force a refresh in Maps it will gain new location data Rod Sure about that? Because then, it won't be exactly "live" tracking.. KappadeX That (actual battery and GPS use) will be the case when you navigate. And send the ETA link to a friend. I was assuming you meant the daily location sharing. The Pool Man I have this exact question too. demarcmj No more than usual. Your phone doesn't check location any more or less than it normally would. It just shares whatever your most recent location was. The only additional battery implications are the sharing part of it, but that's not a lot of data to transfer. Tomáš Petrík I hope they will add a feature to turn on/off the layer with the contact heads on the map, just like I can turn on/off traffic, satellite, etc. Sure, when I want to check where somebody is, I will enable that and look. But I don't want the icons in the map permanently (from family members who share the location indefinitely). demarcmj Yea that'd be nice. When it was Latitude, they had it implemented as a layer, like satellite or traffic, so it could do just that. HSidhu The sad part is that you have to turn on location history. groid Is location history required to be able to use this? I know you are asked to turn it on when setting up the sharing, but does it have to stay on? I really don't want to keep location history on and I have no use for timeline or any other location history feature. HSidhu I think it should be ON all the time but you should try turning it OFF and see if it still tells you your friend's location. let us know too. Matt Terk My Maps app crashes every time I try to enable Location Sharing, either by link or through the menu. Anyone else experienced this? Wiped cache/davlik, on PureNexus 7.1.1 Shamu, I am in the beta for Maps.

Including speed and location history, it even shows the path they took. It also shows if the person in moving or not. Google might introduce all this in coming days. SSyar i still dont get the sharing option :/ johnforamerica Suddenly it doesn't work on my wife's iphone, and she's not getting a timeline history for the last 3 days either.

When I walked into an Arlington, VA coffee shop to meet Candice Jordan, I felt the usual anxious vigilance I get when I'm looking for a person I've never met. People are usually great at producing obvious body-language signals that indicate they're also waiting for a stranger, but Candice wouldn't be looking for me: She'd be listening. She did display a few great cues, thankfully. A patient, doe-eyed Labrador retriever named Austria rested by her side, and a clutch of electronic gadgets were spread before her on the table. Candice also had a Google Glass headset perched on the bridge her nose. It was this that I'd really come to talk to her about. After we exchanged pleasantries, she gave me a quick rundown on her recent life—one in which smart assistive technology is playing an increasingly important role. AI-enabled eyesight services, smart hearing aids, and other intuitive, connected technology is changing the game for people with disabilities. Vision Quest Candice lost her sight entirely in college in 1998, at the age of 21, waking up blind one morning after months of declining vision because of worsening, inoperable cataracts. She worked with her university to complete her degree in psychology and then obtained a master's degree in rehabilitation counseling; she's been working for the District of Columbia government's Rehabilitation Services Administration since 2007. So why Google Glass? Candice uses them with Aira, a new service she subscribes to: It connects her with a human agent who uses video feed from the headset or a phone's camera to describe her environment for her and help navigate her through it. The agent also has access to a dashboard of data about her preferences, multiple maps, and information about her physical location. Aira can tell her as much or as little as she wants to know about her surroundings. Suman Kanuganti, CEO and founder of Aira, said his concept arose from a time he was on a phone-camera video call with a visually impaired friend. He asked his friend to hold his phone camera up, facing outward from his head, and then proceeded to describe what he saw in the friend's kitchen to him. On subsequent calls, they performed the exercise outdoors using a Google Glass headset Kanuganti had acquired. "I was walking with him as I sat in San Diego, and I realized, I can pull up maps and other information for him while he's moving," Kanuganti said. "He said, Suman, what we're doing is for fun, but there are millions of blind people for whom a service like this would be life-changing." Candice Jordan navigates around an outdoor mall with the help of Aira (photo: Michelle Z. Donahue) Candice handed me her Google Glass and phone and told me to have at it. I really wasn't sure where to start, but the agent she connected with that day, Patrick, took the lead. He described the store, telling me where I could find the ordering counter and a shelf of mugs and providing some details about what was on the walls and who was immediately nearby. We then made our way to the exit (the door swung outward, Patrick noted). Then we were in a bright courtyard ringed by shops, where Patrick told us it was 49 degrees and sunny. As Austria nosed into the vestibule of a Thai restaurant, Patrick mentioned we could also opt for sushi, grilled chicken, Lebanese, shoes, or discount designer clothes. Candice asked what other stores were around; when he mentioned a housewares outlet, she asked him to direct us there so she could look for a stovetop griddle. Armed again with her headset and phone, Candice followed the ensuing left-right- straight-ahead directions, avoiding obstacles with Austria's help and alerts from Patrick. She stepped gingerly down into a curb cut when Patrick told her it was there; as we waited at a crosswalk, he had her scan left and right so he could look for oncoming vehicles. All clear. In the store, she switched to using her phone's camera when the Wi-Fi connection fizzled, causing Patrick's video feed to freeze. The highlight of our day, Candice said, was the moment when a store clerk stopped by and asked if she needed any help. "I love being able to say, 'No, I've got it, thanks!' when people ask me that now," Candice said. "Before, any time I needed anything in a store, I'd have to find customer service, wait for them to bring someone to help me, then have them go through my list. And because you need help, so often you have to be nice, and kind of market yourself, and educate them. Well, if it's Saturday at 7 a.m. and it's the only time I have to go to the grocery store, who wants to do all that? Now I don't need to." Tech Enablement According to a 2010 report from the U.S. Census, more than 56 million people, or nearly 20 percent of the nation's population, are living with a physical or cognitive impairment of some kind. Aira is just one example of an emerging segment of smart technology that's being designed specifically with this population in mind. The ability to connect to myriad streams of data, whether through a new piece of hardware or software and apps for devices, is playing heavily into how these products and applications are being developed, with the goal of helping people lead more independent, inclusive, and fulfilling lives. The array of available solutions is dizzying. Lechal, which started as a navigation aid for the visually impaired, has developed GPS-connected shoes with haptics feedback: They buzz to help you navigate as you walk. New Jersey-based Oticon makes a set of smart hearing aids that can be programmed to prompt other devices in your home to perform a cascade of tasks according to your proximity or time of day—automatically closing the garage door, locking the house, and turning the thermostat down when you leave for work, for example. In Europe, SpeechCode created a system to produce highly detailed QR codes that can be included on packaging, signage, or any other printed material. When scanned by the user via an app (which helps locate and center the code), the text from the package or sign encoded in the code is translated to an audio file available in 40 different languages. And Dimple, a programmable stick-on button for Android devices, uses near-field communication (NFC) to launch apps, phone settings, and even control other smart home appliances at a touch. Myriad other devices exist to help individuals adapt to their particular disability. As illustration, a single adaptive-tech loan program at Easter Seals of Massachusetts' Assistive Technology Regional Center holds 1,200 devices for people to borrow and test out. High-tech options include eyegaze devices (these help you to access a computer or communication aid by controlling a mouse with your eyes), text-to-speech machines, and smartwatch-like wristbands that relay mobile phone messages. The overall concept is to enable people with disabilities to automate aspects of their lives that are otherwise cumbersome, as well as to make information more easily accessible. Easter Seals of Massachussetts' Assistive Technology Regional Center "This idea of having connected devices in your home, a smart home, really is a boon to people with all kinds of disabilities," said Henry Claypool, executive vice president of the American Association of People with Disabilities, and director of policy for University of California San Francisco's Community Living Policy Center. "Greater independence, a better quality of life, and integration and inclusion—those are hallmarks of the Americans with Disabilities Act. Connected devices have tremendous potential to enable people to live as part of a community, instead of having to move to a more restricted environment where everything is brought to them." It's a robust topic of academic research and development, as well. At the Rochester Institute of Technology, Professor Matt Huenerfauth is working on developing tools such as an American Sign Language (ASL) trainer using a Microsoft Xbox Kinect camera. The system uses animations of common ASL gestures to "spellcheck" a learner's signs: the user can copy the animation's movements, and because the program can "see" the user's movements via the Kinect camera, the software can flag or help the user correct errors in their signing. Huenerfauth is also investigating how speech-recognition technology could be used to produce captions automatically for one-on-one or small-group meetings between deaf and hearing participants. And at the Georgia Tech Institute for People and Technology, Executive Director Beth Mynatt recently spoke of research underway that uses sensing of the brain's motor cortex to recognize the formation of individual words and phrases and translate them into machine-generated speech or text. This idea, too, emerged out of work with ASL. While researching how to read and translate brain signals, the team realized that the signal generated by a person physically signing an ASL letter or word was the same as when he or she thought about signing the letter. But as promising and as useful as recent innovations have been, they need to be more reliable, easier to use, and there for the long haul. "It's tough to get individuals with disabilities to be the primary or initial adopters of some of these technologies, because if it fails, there are real consequences," said Eric Oddleifson, assistant vice president of Assistive Technology and Employment Services at Easter Seals of Massachusetts. "Many times, people will opt for something they know will work rather than try something new that may not work in the long term." Informing Design, Connecting Solutions One obstacle to adoption is the piecemeal nature of current solutions. There are lots of gadgets and apps out there that can communicate with your phone to relay information, or keep track of personal preferences, or automate your home. So maybe you have haptic shoes, if-this-then-that hearing aids, a smart thermostat, an Amazon Echo, and a dozen Wi-Fi-enabled LED light bulbs. And each one of them has its own app. At what point does managing all these solutions become more of an obstacle than the problem they're meant to solve? Intelligent platforms that can integrate a mix of products and user interfaces into a single, easily accessible ecosystem are still largely lacking. Scott Moody is CEO of K4Connect, which has developed a smart-device ecosystem platform for people living with disabilities, called the K4Community, which can be used with nearly any connected device on the market across a variety of communications protocols. "Products are often designed for one demographic—say, millennials—and then an often-feeble attempt is made to adapt them," he told me. "Each device and application is developed to solve a specific issue, but it can get to the point where one needs to have tens of apps or devices just to move around their living room. All these applications and devices need to work together—not just your home-automation products but your health, wellness, content, and communication devices, as well." To Moody's point about product design, often the needs of the disabled aren't considered up front at all, even if the technology could, at its core, solve a key need. KR Liu (photo: courtesy KR Liu) "Generally, a couple of big companies have been doing better about being pioneers in trying to make their products more accessible," said KR Liu, the head of sales and marketing strategy for Doppler Labs. "It's just in the last few years that the tech industry has started to think about how it can be more inclusive, not only within companies but in design for consumers." Lui suffers from severe hearing loss herself; she needs to use high-powered hearing aids instead of her company's sound-enhancing Here One earbuds. These wireless headphones can use GPS and location information to automatically shift volume and filter settings, depending on whether the user is indoors, outdoors, at a concert or in a library. Though it was initially conceived of as a "music curation" tool for users to customize live-music events, Liu's presence on the team from very early on in the design process helped shape the earbuds into a product that could address multiple needs. "I was involved in helping them navigate what it would take to have our technology reach a consumer like myself," Liu said. When the Here One earbuds were unveiled, the company received thousands of inquiries about whether the product could be used as assistive hearing devices. "There are consumers who need a little help in loud restaurants or an open office but don't need a $5,000 hearing aid," she said, some of whom may also have been drawn by the idea of having a listening booster without the stigma of a full-blown hearing aid. Hear One earbuds (photo courtesy Doppler Labs) "You'll get better, focused products by having someone with a disability involved in the design process," Oddleifson said. "We have many clients who are involved with Harvard and MIT in creating new kinds of assistive technology, and their involvement is a crucial step. Wouldn't it be nice if the big companies all had a person on their team, maybe with a disability, who could inform some of those design decisions?" That idea was a key tenet in the development process of a Braille smartwatch, and eventually, a Braille tablet, by the South Korean company Dot. One of Dot's front-office workers is a blind individual who is active in the local vision-impaired community. He also served as Dot's first line of testing for prototype tweaks, said Alex Lee, a company representative. "We go straight to him when there's something new," Lee said. "We say, 'What do you think about this function? How would you change this?'" He has also brought friends and others from his mostly online community into Dot's offices for beta testing and periodic chats with the engineers. Backed by a successful crowdfunding campaign and with the first units shipped in April, the low-profile Dot watch features four Braille characters, which are driven by magnetically controlled pins. Connected via Bluetooth to a user's phone, the watch face can scroll through text messages, e-mails, and other short missives. And, of course, it tells time—but without the need for Siri to shout it out in a quiet room. The Dot watch next to a phone displaying the Dot app. Its appearance as an accessory was also important, Lee said, because the company felt adaptive devices shouldn't reflexively be clunky. Aira's Kanuganti agreed, saying his company was in the process of developing a headset where style doesn't take a backseat. He noted that the Aira service is agnostic, though, intended to work with any hardware the user chooses to use. "Think about how much these phone companies worry about the design of their handsets, but how often it's actually just sitting in your pocket," Kanuganti said. "But glasses—they're on your face, and they'd better be cool." Think Tom Ford frames but packing a quality camera, antennas, GPS, and proximity and altimeter sensors. Taking a Walk Eventually, Aira may be able to do even more for Candice that won't require her to talk to agents. "Aira" is a portmanteau of the term AI (artificial intelligence) and the name of the ancient Egyptian sun god Ra, and the company eventually intends to use artificial intelligence to generate and communicate information to its subscribers based on their most common habits, routes, and routines. The goal is to draw upon image recognition technologies, information from previous conversations with agents, street and satellite maps, GPS, and physical location to augment and occasionally replace what a human agent relays to the Aira user. "We're looking to leverage existing systems to do the work," Kanuganti said. "You categorize individual tasks, then push your training system to automate those things." For now, though, Candice is still chatting with Patrick and the other agents. And beyond what she describes as the "absolute freedom" that Aira has afforded her over the previous six months, she wasn't expecting for it to restore one aspect of making her way through the world: just enjoying a walk, with no particular purpose or destination. When she met Kanuganti last fall on the National Mall in Washington to try Aira, the agent she connected with guided her from a subway entrance to one of the Smithsonian museums. And instead of just receiving directions, she asked what the agent could see: orange and red leaves falling from the trees. A trash can to her left. A person walking toward her with a stroller and a baby dressed in pink. "For the very first time, in I don't know how long, I felt like I was talking a walk in the city that I live in and love," Candice said. "It was a walk. Not just the task of getting safely from point A to point B. I wanted to scream with happiness." Back to top Previous : Fix Your Sleep, Be More Productive By Michelle Donahue Michelle Z.

Reprinted with permission from Dey Street Books. Think of your own experience using Google. I am guessing you have upon occasion typed things into that search box that reveal a behavior or thought that you would hesitate to admit in polite company. In fact, the evidence is overwhelming that a large majority of Americans are telling Google some very personal things. If you type “Why is . . .” the first two Google auto-completes currently are “Why is the sky blue?” and “Why is there a leap day?” suggesting these are the two most common ways to complete this search. The third: “Why is my poop green?” And Google auto-complete can get disturbing. Today, if you type in “Is it normal to want to . . . ,” the first suggestion is “kill.” If you type in “Is it normal to want to kill . . . ,” the first suggestion is “my family.” Need more evidence that Google searches can give a different picture of the world than the one we usually see? Consider searches related to regrets around the decision to have or not to have children. Before deciding, some people fear they might make the wrong choice. And, almost always, the question is whether they will regret not having kids. People are seven times more likely to ask Google whether they will regret not having children than whether they will regret having children. After making their decision—either to reproduce (or adopt) or not—people sometimes confess to Google that they rue their choice. This may come as something of a shock but post-decision, the numbers are reversed. Adults with children are 3.6 times more likely to tell Google they regret their decision than are adults without children. One caveat that should be kept in mind: Google can display a bias toward unseemly thoughts, thoughts people feel they can’t discuss with anyone else. Nonetheless, if we are trying to uncover hidden thoughts, Google’s ability to ferret them out can be useful. And the large disparity between regrets on having versus not having kids seems to be telling us that the unseemly thought in this case is a significant one. Let’s pause for a moment to consider what it even means to make a search such as “I regret having children.” Google presents itself as a source from which we can seek information directly, on topics like the weather, who won last night’s game, or when the Statue of Liberty was erected. But sometimes we type our uncensored thoughts into Google, without much hope that it will be able to help us. In this case, the search window serves as a kind of confessional. There are thousands of searches every year, for example, for “I hate cold weather,” “People are annoying,” and “I am sad.” Of course, those thousands of Google searches for “I am sad” represent only a tiny of fraction of the hundreds of millions of people who feel sad in a given year. Searches expressing thoughts, rather than looking for information, my research has found, are only made by a small sample of everyone for whom that thought comes to mind. Similarly, my research suggests that the seven thousand searches by Americans every year for “I regret having children” represent a small sample of those who have had that thought. Kids are obviously a huge joy for many, probably most, people. And, despite my mom’s fear that “you and your stupid data analysis” are going to limit her number of grandchildren, this research has not changed my desire to have kids. But that unseemly regret is interesting—and another aspect of humanity that we tend not to see in the traditional datasets. Our culture is constantly flooding us with images of wonderful, happy families. Most people would never consider having children as something they might regret. But some do.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Apps & Software Image Source: YouTube Google has a new OS that may one day kill Android, and this is your first look at it Chris Smith @chris_writes May 9th, 2017 at 8:51 AM Share Tweet Google currently has two operating systems out in the wild, Android and Chrome. But we keep hearing that a third OS is in the making — one that might replace Android at some point in the future, and maybe even replace Chrome as well. Up until now, we only heard rumors about this third Google OS, but it looks like the first images of Fuchsia OS have leaked, showing the new user interface Google has been working on. Don't Miss: Amazon just discounted the Echo for the first time in 2017 Found by Ars Technica and compiled to run on an Android device as an application, Fuchsia OS shows what Google is looking to achieve with the new system. For starters, Google’s Fuchsia is built using Google’s own microkernel called Magenta. Google clearly wants to dump Linux, which is part of both Android and Chrome OS. Image Source: Ars Technica Magenta is a tool that targets “modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of RAM with arbitrary peripherals doing open-ended computation.” Therefore, it could be used for both smartphones and computers. Furthermore, Fuchsia’s interface is built using Google’s Flutter SDK, which lets programmers come up with cross-platform code that runs on Android and iOS. Flutter might be the key to making a smooth transition from Android to Fuchsia in the coming years, assuming the new OS doesn’t die on the vine. Fuchsia, started at some point in February 2016, isn’t just a hobby for Google, at least according to what Fuchsia developer Travis Geiselbrecht said in the public Fuchsia IRC channel. The OS “isn’t a toy thing, it’s not a 20% project, it’s not a dumping ground of a dead thing that we don’t care about anymore.” Image Source: Ars Technica That said, we have no idea when Fuchsia might actually reach commercial products. Fuchsia’s UI, called Armadillo, looks nothing like what you expect from Android, but it does have Material Design traces in it. The OS appears to be centered around the main Google account that dominates the home screen, which is a giant scrolling list. In it, you’ll find recent apps on top of the picture (the Story mode) and a search/Google Now area below the picture. Tapping the profile picture will get you into a Quick Settings mode, and the home screen will also show the time and a battery indicator. Image Source: Ars Technica Fuchsia already has a tablet mode and supports a variety of split-screen multitasking options. This seems to indicate that Fuchsia might run on a bunch of products in the future, even beyond smartphones and computers. Finally, the OS also comes with its own keyboard app. Check out more images over at Ars Technica.

You might sync the files to your PC and edit with Windows Movie Maker How to Easily Create a Stunning Video Using Windows Movie Maker How to Easily Create a Stunning Video Using Windows Movie Maker Creating a movie using your photos, videos, and music is child's play once you master Windows Movie Maker's simple editing tools.

But if your smartphone or tablet is already capable of editing movies together, what is the point of a desktop app? This is the approach taken by the developers of the Google Photos app, which has an excellent movie editor built in. Capable of creating movies while you sleep from the clips in your library, or letting you do the hard work, it’s available absolutely free to iOS and Android users. Basically, if you have the Google Photos app (available free from your mobile app store), you have the movie editor. Want to find out more? Make Movies With Google Photos You probably just thought that the Google Photos app allowed you to manage photos, right? Well, it’s much more than that. You know how it groups photos and videos you’ve recorded by date? That’s a pretty useful feature, one that comes in handy when it comes to putting a video together. But before you get this far, there’s something important that you need to do. Adopt a consistent method for recording videos. Because there’s nothing worse than watching a movie made on a smartphone that switches between portrait and landscape formats. In short, if you’re planning to make movies with Google Photos, ensure you keep your shots’ orientation consistent. Otherwise, you can end up with some very jarring cuts. For the best results overall, however, stick with a landscape orientation. iOS vs. Android While the Google Photos movie editor tool is available for both iOS and Android (but not for any Windows 10 devices), you’ll find that there are some marked operational differences between the two. As a result, we’re going to look at each app in turn, and demonstrate how you can create awesome home movies (and more) on both platforms. To be clear, the end results are indistinguishable. The only difference is how you edit the clips together in your respective app. To minimize the confusion, we’ll look at the process first in Android, and then in iOS. Make Movies on Android With Google Photos Getting started making movies in Google Photos in Android is simple. Just open the app, long tap to select the first video clip (or photo, even) in your gallery, then select the others you want to use. With your selection made (up to 50 clips can be selected), click the + button, then choose Movie from the menu. Wait while the files are uploaded, and the initial movie made. You’ll get the option to give the movie a title, and preview it. Notice that a theme (or style) for the video will have been preselected by the app. Additionally, music will have been assigned, and the clips you selected used. However, there is no guarantee that any of this will be to your satisfaction. So what can you do? Manually Edit the Movie Automated movie creation is useful, and can occasionally deliver great results. For the best results, however, you will need to manually edit your clips. Do this by selecting the film strip icon during playback. From here, select the individual clip you wish to edit. For instance, you might want to adjust when the clip begins so you can capture the subject entering the frame. Conversely, you may want the clip to end when the subject goes out of shot. Both can be achieved by tapping the scissors Trim icon and dragging the placeholders to trim the clip to your requirements. Clips can also be rearranged (long-press and drag) or discarded entirely (tap and press the trashcan icon). Tap + to find the original clip in your library if you want to restore it. Each of the clips can be edited, but note that they must be downloaded first, then re-uploaded, so this can prove to be a time-consuming exercise. You’ll probably have more success on a tablet than on a phone. Ultimately, however, you’ll have the edit that you want. On to this, you can tweak the music via the note icon, and change the style using the clapperboard button. Various tunes are available in the Google library, a collection of royalty-free clips grouped by category. You can also select music from your device library, but if you’re sharing the clip, it’s best to make sure that you have permission to use the tunes. Meanwhile, the styles you can apply to your video range from 8mm-style movie filters, to black and white, or documentary themes. When you’re done, click the checkmark to confirm your changes. Wait for the new version to be uploaded, and you’ll soon be able to share it via your usual Android apps! Create Awesome Movies on iOS With Google Photos If you’re using an iPhone or iPad, the principle is the same for the creation of movies, but there are some notable differences. Begin by selecting your video clips (and photos, perhaps). A long tap will enable selection. Dragging your finger diagonally will enable the selection of additional files. When you’re happy with the selection, click the + button, then select Movie in the Create new menu. The is where the iOS app begins to differ from the Android offering. You’ll notice that the files are downloaded from your Google Photos unlimited cloud storage Get Free Unlimited Photo Storage & More with Google Photos Get Free Unlimited Photo Storage & More with Google Photos If you aren't using these hidden Google Photos features, you're really missing out. (Hint: There's free and unlimited photo storage!) Read More . Here, however, they’re displayed in a timeline. Movie editing apps have long used timelines — they make it easy to see what’s going on. In this app, you can tap each clip in the timeline (on the left-hand preview) to see what is selected. If you’re happy with the automatically-created movie, you can click Save. You’ll then be able to share finished video via your favorite social apps on your iPhone or iPad. Information (i) can also be seen for the edited file. If you’re not happy with the movie, however, you might opt to Delete it. The menu in the top-right will let you Download the finished movie to your phone or tablet, or Add to album in your Google Photos cloud storage. And if you’re not happy with the automated edit and want to change it, there’s the Edit button. Edit and Trim Your Movie Clips Trimming, discarding, or adding a new clip in Google Photos movie editor on iOS is simple. Review the video first, and make a note of what you want to change. You’ll notice as the video plays that the clips are highlighted in turn, and the portion of footage used in the compiled video is highlighted with start and finish placeholders. To alter the trim, simply drag the placeholders so that the footage you want to see in the movie is selected. Want to delete the clip entirely? You can tap the three dots at the end of each row and display the menu, where you’ll find the option to Remove. Also in this menu are the options to Hide trimmed portions, Mute audio (this is done by default, but disable if you want your video audio to play along with the chosen soundtrack) and Insert clips. You can also Duplicate a clip. This last option is useful if you have a five-second portion of a clip selected in the timeline, but want to add another portion from the same clip. Simply duplicate the clip, and select the additional footage! Edit Audio and Styles (or Not) If you were dissatisfied with the preselected audio, you can click the note icon to choose music from your device (My Music) or from the royalty-free library (Theme music). Also, an option is No music, to hear only the audio in your clips (useful if you’re an amateur movie maker, perhaps). Unlike the Android version, however, it isn’t possible to apply a theme or Instagram-style filter to your movie. This seems a striking omission, one that will hopefully be resolved in future updates. Great Movie Results With Google Photos! As you can see, while both apps appear to be the same, the Android and iOS versions of Google Photos offer quite different tools for creating movies. Indeed, each has features that the other doesn’t — it’s odd that the Android version doesn’t have the same flexible timeline as the iPhone app. Similarly, the absence of Styles is notable in iOS. Perhaps a future update will add these absent highlights into each version, for the good of the end user! Whichever version you’re using, the end result is a great movie, complete with musical soundtrack and perhaps even an Instagram-style filter. Once created, these can be shared on Facebook or Instagram, or whatever other social networks you might have installed on your device. And if you like that kind of thing, the app might even work in the background, using Google’s immense cloud hardware to create a surprise movie for you to enjoy next time you unlock your device.

Google's "Fuchsia" operating system is taking shape with a new design Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/08 10:01am PDTMay 8, 2017 36 Plus 1 on G+ 285 Share on Facebook 93 Share on Twitter Total Shares414 Development Google News We first talked about Fuchsia, a new operating system being developed at Google, back in August (in fact, it was my first post here). At the time, there wasn't much to get excited about besides the potential - it only had a command-line interface. Now the project has a snazzy new, but clearly unfinished, interface. Summary of Fuchsia First, it's worth going over exactly what Fuchsia is, because it's been quite a while since we talked about it. As opposed to all of Google's other OSes, such as Android and Chrome OS, Fuchsia uses the company's new 'Magenta' kernel instead of Linux. According to the project's documentation, Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Magenta's apps and the system interface are written with Google's Flutter SDK, which was initially designed to create cross-platform apps for iOS and Android. Flutter applications are written in Dart, the company's home-grown programming language. All of the system and apps are rendered by 'Escher,' which uses OpenGL or Vulkan to display everything. The 'Armadillo' interface So, on to the new stuff. Fuchsia's system UI has a new name - 'Armadillo.' Ars Technica was able to compile Armadillo into an Android APK, since it is written with the above-mentioned Flutter SDK. The interface doesn't really do anything besides looking pretty, but it does give us an idea of what the finished product could look like. The home screen is a vertical list, with a profile picture, the time, and a battery indicator in the center. Tapping the profile picture brings up something similar to Android's Quick Settings, with toggles for auto-rotate, do not disturb, Airplane Mode, and so on. Above the profile picture is the 'Story,' which the documentation describes as "a set of apps and/or modules that work together for the user to achieve a goal." Currently, this works similarly to Android's Recents screen. Users will also be able to combine stories into a 'Story Cluster.' This is what dragging a Story card into split-screen looks like. Dragging a Story card onto another one triggers a split-screen mode. The user can split an app 50/50 vertically or horizontally, drag in another app for a 33/33/33 split, or even have a tab bar appear for using all the open apps in full-screen. You can even have two apps split vertically next to two other split apps, seen below. This is far more flexible than Android's current multi-tasking functionality, but whether or not it will stay this way is uncertain. Below the profile picture is a panel resembling Google Now, with a placeholder search bar and suggestion cards. Armadillo's documentation says, "a suggestion is a representation of an action the user can take to augment an existing story or to start a new one. [The] suggestion contains enough information to create the visual representation of that concept." So maybe they will work more like an app launcher? It's hard to tell at this point. The Google Now panel, showing Fuchsia's keyboard. Keep in mind that all of this is subject to change, as the Armadillo interface (and the rest of Fuchsia OS) is still under heavy development. It's also hard to tell what Google's plans are for the operating system. Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware, or will it some day replace Android altogether? We'll have to wait and see.

Suicide_Note Because Google can. Corbin Davenport Ron from Ars Technica put it best: "Fuchsia really seems like a project that asks 'how would we design Android today, if we could start over?' It's a brand-new, Google-developed kernel running a brand-new, Google-developed SDK that uses a brand-new, Google-developed programming language and it's all geared to run Google's Material Design interface as quickly as possible. Google gets to dump Linux and the GPL, it can dump Java and the problems it caused with Oracle, and Google can basically insulate itself from all of Android's upstream projects and bring all the development in-house. Doing such a thing on the scale of Android today would be a massive project." makapav Would it still be open source? Also, what would happen to all the existing APKs? Corbin Davenport Fuchisa is completely open source right now. As for running Android apps, maybe Google will add some kind of stop-gap compatibility layer for running Android apps, like Chrome OS has. destinyhud read the article Suicide_Note Perhaps instead of replacing Android, this will *become* Android, as in Android P or Q? Or be the merger of Android/Chrome? m477 I could see that as Android 10. Definitely too early for P. morteum I wonder if the reason it is called "Armadillo" is because they're starting from A again, but this time they're using animals instead of desserts. Christopher Bement I think it's a smart plan, based on the guess that there's more animals to pick from in the world than tasty desserts. teolinux Ubuntu docet Paul "Tasty treats," not necessarily desserts. That said, armadillos could be a tasty treat. I won't judge. MJ I have heard desserts and candy used before which are wrong but "tasty treats" is a new one for me. To be more accurate, Android names are actually all confectionery foods. A "tasty treat" could be a slice of pizza (aka Android S). LOL Randy Gindy Armadillo is the name of the UI not the OS build itself. Matt74UK Smooth on the inside, crunchy on the outside. Armadillo ! (a few UK people of a certain age may get that). Russell Brown That bloke's a nutter... Edit: nope, that was Dime Bar. :( Nomaan Shouldnt we compare armadillo to holo/material and not to dessert names? Or am i missing something. morteum I don't think so, those are design languages and while this is a redesign of layout and function, it is still pretty much using Material Design. I could be wrong but I don't think this is closer to a build version. John Doe Idk this is a whole new OS with a new kernel, I doubt this will be done with an OTA update for Android. Mantas Pakėnas Even nowadays, some of Android's new functionality cannot be done via OTA updates (like dual system partitions, forced encryption I believe, etc). To make a completely hard cut sometime when this is ready, and if it's meant to replace Android, is not completely unimaginable. As is updating via OTA. If apple was able to change their file system via OTA, I don't see why changing most of the parts would not be possible. However, nobody aside from Google would do it, almost guaranteed :) Suicide_Note It could likely be done for Pixel devices, and possibly for future devices released after this new version of the OS rolls out. Adrian Meredith quite possibly, after all there no reason it couldn't also run android apps jonathan What they need to do is make this googles very own os for their pixel line and leave android for the oems Suicide_Note Not a chance. To much name recognition with Android for Google to drop it in favor of something else specific to the Pixel lineup. Dallas King Android Z confirmed! Suicide_Note More like Android A for Armadillo. m477 APK plz (no, really, I want a compiled apk the demo) Maxwell “Max” Weinbach https://github.com/fuchsia-mirror/sysui MJ Your link wasn't what the OP asked for... Maxwell “Max” Weinbach the only way to get the APK is to compile it yourself, so I linked to the Github page to a place to download the files to compile. The closest they will get. MJ Than you should have replied there is no known APK or not at all. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach It does not matter that much. I am building the APK right now. Once it is done I will post it. Here is the link on how to compile it. http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo MJ Don't waste your time... They updated that article with an download of the APK. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach thanks. they just did that. I still compiled it myself though. I will try to get more out of it while I have the Sysui downloaded. Michel R. https://www.androidfilehost.com/?w=files&flid=178684 there you go MJ http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo Latex beats nudity More of Proprietary code ? No thank you, we already had enough with this Pixel crud. I hope this OS dies quicker or become a chromebook OS. m477 It's open source. Latex beats nudity It's OSS but just like Android It'll be more heavily dependent on the google APIs to make it work. Look at the Pixel SysUI, Just being OSS doesn't make it open source... It's Google's OS not a Linux Based one. If this is going to replace Android It's doomsday on multiple levels. destinyhud billions of people dont care if its running linux kernel or not. maybe very few like u might. do iphone users care why kernel it runs. none of them care. u r just noise tbh Latex beats nudity Billions of people don't code. You are being a kool-aid joke tbh. destinyhud exaclt only few code and even on that few many dont care if it runs linux or not. look at iphone there are more dev there and yet they dont care for kernel. u r delusional in ur own world m477 Android it's already been on a Google-dependent road for years. I don't think this is going to change either way. An Angry Chihuahua https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/magenta/+/master/docs/getting_started.md heres the source code. do some research my dude WitnessG Imagining this running on a Google made processor is exciting. Badouken If this was the OS for the Pixel 2 alongside a Google made processor I think id cry! WitnessG Yeah I don't see this coming out for at least another 2-3 years. Badouken Indeed, but we can dream! ha Suicide_Note Maybe the Pixel 3 or 4 will see the dream become reality. Suicide_Note I'm betting this is what we'll see in a couple years time. As another commenter stated, starting with Armadillo could be Google's way of starting from the beginning (letter A codename), since there's more animal babes to use for each letter than there are dessert names to use.

Nomaan Armadillo should be compared to holo/material and not to dessert names. nachofrand What makes you think Google would be good at making SoCs? They're a software company and don't have the hardware expertise for hardcore ASIC development like that. Granted they can hire people, but in the end, does it matter? They're going to use ARM either way. UnlikeABoss Google fanboyism. The same reason he's excited over a brand new OS. He knows absolutely nothing about it, short of the fact that it will create more fragmentation not only in the OS space, but also the kernel space. So all we know are negative things so far. This is what we call exciting now is it? Why? Just because Google is doing it? If Microsoft made this exact same announcement, would we all be excited? Oh dear. Zsolt V No, because essentially everybody loathes Microsoft. Almost nobody's life would be worse if Microsoft vanished. marcusmarcus2 Don't they design and build their own servers to use for all their websites? Seems like those hardware work well for them. Sergii Pylypenko It's one thing to assemble the server using off-the-shelf components, or even to order a custom motherboard. It's a very different thing to design and manufacture your own chips. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying it is the same, just that they are not only software experts. Them designing and building the servers show they do have hardware expertise that could assist them in doing the same to chips. Zsolt V Except Google's servers are not assembled from off the shelf components. Haven't been for a few years now. Roy What about TPU? Owais Lone They DO design their own chips as well especially chips meant to run specialized AI (tensoflow) code Adrian Vovk Samsung Exynos devices are faster than Snapdragon, iPhones seem underpowered but are extremely snappy, etc. The point is that making both the software and hardware leads to a very fast ecosystem. Also, Google are making the TPU for neural networks nachofrand Yes, as expected. Exynos is faster than Snapdragon on the Galaxy phones, but put an Exynos in another phone...oh wait, you can't. That's the whole entire point. Snapdragon SoCs are general purpose SoCs and can be used for a multitude of phones so they're not custom tuned to every phone individually. Exynos have very specific power rails and the chip is made specifically for that phone. The thing is, sure this is better, but it's marginal and hardly worth talking about. They both use the same ARM architecture so performance gains are pretty negligible. Besides that, this is how Samsung makes money....off of device sales. Google doesn't make money that way. That isn't their business model so at this point it doesn't make sense for them to build their own SoCs when they could just work closer with hardware companies. They make their own TPUs because it aligns with their business model. Adrian Vovk The instruction set doesn't really matter? I can have a 6700k and a 6500k and the 6700k will perform much better even though they are both amd64. With what Google is doing with the Pixels (still as snappy as day one here) I'm pretty sure they can optimize it further than Samsung does. They have made it run smoother in some cases on a chip that they didn't manufacture. If they made their own chip it would allow them many freedoms that they otherwise don't have = easier design of the device. I brought up the TPUs because that is experience in chip manufacturing Jason What makes you say iPhones are under powered ? Apples chips are some of the fastest around and are extremely powerful. Adrian Vovk Specs wise. They have much worse specs on paper and it would lead to a slower experience, except Apple can optimize it because they make both the chip and the OS SHunter On their Own hardware running their software in their own eco system. You cant really fairly compare it to anything else. Stephen Sharp They could use Risc-V and have to pay to license absolutely nothing, while being able to make processors purpose built for their OS Randy Gindy That would be an interesting move. Stephen Sharp Indeed, I really want Risc-V to succeed as an open ISA nachofrand They could. But in my opinion, it's unlikely. Google isn't trying to compete with Samsung and Apple in device sales and that isn't their business model. People using their services so they can show ads is their business model. It doesn't make sense for Google to make their own SoC when others are already doing a good job. Plus, if they went to RISC-V then what? What about the modem? They have to buy a standalone modem from Qualcomm or Intel. Now you have to hire system integration and test engineers to make sure the modem is working with your SoC. Oh and then you need a whole firmware team to control the modem. At that point, buy a full blown SoC with the modem on chip. Stephen Sharp Eh you lost me at "Pixel phone" and all the other hardware they sell. Google also is a Platinum member of the Risc-V foundation, and if there is a direction they are going, more control or less control, I would guess it's "more". But that's just a guess nachofrand Hardware isn't even close to the same thing as asic development. IC design is a different world. Granted they do some custom hardware, but SoCs are a much much larger feat. It's still a possibility they do so, but it doesn't make sense with their current business model imo. Randy Gindy He said nothing about ASIC he is talking about RISC-V Randy Gindy I disagree with you completely. They are penetrating the IoT market, auto market, healthcare, phones, robotics, self driving, networking, etc. Them making in house chips could really benefit every project they have. Also building an OS from the ground up to work with in house chips would be smart. Look at Apple as an example. They also may let manufacturers to use the designs. If Android One isn't evidence for them to want to standardize their platforms I don't know what is. Captain On! 1 - Google has stated that they're going to make their own silicon for the Pixels in time. 2 - Google actually owns/operates the world's most powerful quantum computer. They know how to make chips. Randy Gindy That quantum computer was built by DWave though Angel I read (somewhere don’t remember) that they have three different quantum computers systems. One from DWave and two home-produced. From those two, one was made by engineers and not that disimilar from DWave in its operations. The other was made by physicists and uses a different approach. nachofrand 1. I could be wrong, but I've only read that they plan on working closer with chip manufacturers. 2. Google didn't make that computer. Even if they did, quantum is so different those skills don't even translate. Romario Maxwell Google made their own custom ASIC called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) for their AI/Machine Learning needs on their cloud platform. See https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/05/Google-supercharges-machine-learning-tasks-with-custom-chip.html and https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/04/quantifying-the-performance-of-the-TPU-our-first-machine-learning-chip.html nachofrand Sure, although a TPU is just an accelerator. Think of it as the hexagon DSP inside of the Snapdragon SoC. That's like 1/10 of the entire chip. SoC design is much larger. Timothy Vreeland How many examples of hardware design do people have to point out before you stop? Sure the hardware they worked on previously isn't exactly the same... But before they started the hardware they are currently working on, they worked on previous hardware that wasn't the same as what they are doing now. They have shown they are competent in designing many kinds of hardware. Or do you suggest a company can only build one kind of hardware and nothing else for all eternity? How did Samsung make it's current in-house chips? Did they go to ARM college? Have they been making ARM chips since the dawn of time? No. They put together some teams and got to work, so stop blabbing and being negative. sweenish Their AI that finally beat the world's top Go players was running on custom Google chips. It's not like they don't know how. theProffer They have enough liquid assets to do whatever they want, abandon it, and then do it again without even noticing they spent the money. (Which is actually the source of a few of their problems, I think.) Matt Is that why they gave up on fiber? Pixelexel Imagine a Google Pixel with a Google made processor, with Fuschia, with Project Fi with Google WiFi powered by Google fiber. If I'd have this, my life would be complete. Owais Lone and all our data with it :( needa At least it is only one company getting it. Iamsecond Ha, no. A Google processor? Supported for 18 months, then replaced with a new processor that performs half as well (but has stickers.) Does not fully process Android code, because at Google one hand doesn't even know the other hand is there, let alone talk to it. Has 20 cores (only 2 enabled outside US for 'reasons.') Has a dedicated co-processor to enable ads in every app, even those that previously didn't have them. the.cyber.trekker I spit my coffee out on my monitor reading this!! ROFLMFAO! Jason Google can't even get a phone out the door without issues and you want them to make the chips too...lol. I'll pass. UnlikeABoss "In house kernel instead of Linux". Yeah, hopefully this dies in a thousand pits of fire. "Hey Linux guys, you know how you've helped us make billions over the years with a free open source kernel? Well, we were just using you to get the "nerd" userbase. Now we own the market thanks to you guys promoting its use of Linux, we will gradually phase you out." .... m477 I hope not. Linux is not really a kernel made with smartphone in minds. I don't care for being a fan of a kernel over another. UnlikeABoss Yeah. I'd much rather use a brand new untested kernel (and all the teething issues that will come with it) in my smartphone than a mature, stable one that's hacked on by hundreds and thousands of people every month. I mean, it's just a smartphone, we don't need it to be a secure environment, right? Let's just make a nice obscure kernel that no one else will use, and just say "but but it's open source!!! love us because we are Google kk". ... ihsan ışık I'm sorry but it just looks like you are a huge Linux fan and are just against change to me. UnlikeABoss Looks can be deceiving. If you're going to fling around the Linux fanboy term, i'll fling around the Google fanboy term, and that will surely be a nice constructive argument that we will both want to continue. m477 So, in 10 years we should still be using an unoptimised kernel like Linux, because anything newer is, well, newer? UnlikeABoss Yeah, because Linux hasn't changed at all in 10 years... m477 Yes, it changed a lot, and it still has many of the same problems, which are intrinsically bound to its structure. It's not a kernel well suited for mobile devices. UnlikeABoss You think the solution is to throw it out the window and start from scratch? I disagree. I'd much rather continue improving the Linux kernel, simply because of all the eyes it will always have on its code. jonathan Play nice ladies lol m477 With this mentality we wouldn't have Linux at all. Why start anything, while we can continue this other thing which purpose was completely different? A mircokenel is more well suited than a monolitic kernel to a mobile devices, both in terms of performance and security. No matter how much you improve Linux, it will never be a microkernel. UnlikeABoss Smartphones don't need a micro kernel in 2017. You could make that argument 7 years ago. Linux can be compiled with the required drivers just like it always could. m477 I made that argument 7 years ago. They always needed something different from Linux. The fact that specific, even proprietary drivers have to be integrated in the kernel (since Android lacks an abstraction layer) is on of the problems of the interaction Android-Linux. destinyhud why havent the nerds made linux on pc's a bigger market share if they were the one who made android a global leader UnlikeABoss No nerd is promoting Linux on the desktop. All social media used to be full of people promoting Android over iOS, these days there's no need to. destinyhud why havent they promoted desktop?? just wondering why they did for android but not for desktop.. linux on desktop was an underdog for decades. android was not popular because of kernal. android became popular because it was opensource and was the only viable competition to ios. people dont care what kernel it runs. UnlikeABoss No nerd worth their salt would promote an environment that would be a downgrade from Windows. Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time, it had a very equal playing field. There's a difference between promoting a good solid FOSS kernel where possible, and promoting an agenda. m477 Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time By this, I get that you never used Android and iOS side by side in 2009-10. UnlikeABoss You clearly value different things. The hackability alone made it an upgrade through its lifetime. m477 The same can be said for GNU/Linux on desktop. UnlikeABoss No it can't, because hackability =/= app availability. i.e. The hackability on Linux desktop doesn't make it win over it's lack of apps, where that isn't an issue on Android. m477 App availability was horrible in the early days, compared to iOS. Even Symbian had more apps. UnlikeABoss That was fine since the early days didn't consist of using your smartphone for very much, due to under powered hardware. Techies didn't go around saying "use iOS because we can all take selfies and stick filters on it". m477 iOS devices didn't have front cameras until mid 2010. The system was better, faster, smoother, the interface was coesive, there were many more apps, and the jailbreak community, to address the techie audience you like to go on about so much, was very, very good. There were tweaks and modifications that even the wildest Android custom ROM didn't have at the time. Android was objectively a downgrade, as much as Linux was on desktop. UnlikeABoss Calling jailbraik an advantage over a FOSS OS is pretty hilarious. iOS wasn't popular because it was better, it was popular because of the amount of people getting their advice from paid employees in store. "Buy iOS so we get a commission". m477 iPhone was more popular for various reasons: marketing, having 2 years of advantage, and, yes, more marketing. But it was also better than Android, as an OS. What benefit did Android bring, with it being opensource, compared to iOS, even to a "techie"? The dev community was laughable in the early days. Why GNU/Linux on desktop was not promoted by "techies" (which is false) and Android was, even if their shortcomings were identical? destinyhud u live in a dream world. even most dev dont care about kernel. what they care about the dev platform. I am a dev and i dont care for the kernel UnlikeABoss If you're talking from the perspective of an app developer then ofcourse you don't care about the kernel, you care about which platform will make you the most money... destinyhud exactly. no one care what kernel it runs.. all dev care is what platform make money. so who is this nerd who care about kernel if most dont care about the kernel.. yeah very very few.. infact rare like u UnlikeABoss Techie == Technology Enthusiast. You can sit here and tell me that you would use the best dev environment all you want but the truth is if the iOS dev environment was awful you'd still suck it up and use it to make your money. I'm not sure how you can class yourself as an enthusiast at that point. destinyhud ever wonder why no one is up voting u and upvoting many of my comments? because what u say is BS. its that simple. I am up for ditching outdated linux if the new kernal is modern and build for modern devices. most dont care for this very few techies.. i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die.. UnlikeABoss "Ever wonder why Google fanboys upvote pro Google content and not anti-Google content?" No, no I don't wonder that. How dare someone critique a pointless change by Google, causing unnecessary fragmentation. Burn them! destinyhud u must be new here.. look at anti google comments here when they make stupid changes but if they make welcome changes people tend to agree UnlikeABoss No, I've been here a long time and made many anti-Google comments as well as pro-Google. No one in the right mind would cheer on kernel fragmentation other than those that think Google can do no wrong. destinyhud open up ur comments history and let me see if u made pro google comments. i have a feeling u r a troll UnlikeABoss Yeah, this discussion is going no where. You are not the authority here and the idea that you want to browse my history to make sure I fall in line is creepy as hell. Bye. destinyhud lol i see u dont want to open ur comments history. obvious troll m477 outdated linux i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die Woah, wait a second here. Linux is not outdated, and its death would be terrible for everyone. It's just that it's not the most apt kernel for a mobile device. destinyhud maybe not outdated but not the right fit for mobile devices. destinyhud android sucked when compared to ios.. it was a downgrade compared to ios. why did dev promote android and not desktop linux? u reasoning dont even make sense. UnlikeABoss No, it wasn't a downgrade. destinyhud yes, it was back in android initial release. iOS was better and much more polished at that time. but things changed now. UnlikeABoss "Polished" is not a factor that is used to judge a better OS. There are Linux environments that are much more polished than Windows 10, but that doesn't make desktop Linux better. destinyhud it was both polished and runs better than android at that time. polished was not the only one. it was also polished. android only got better later.. i have used android at that time and it sucked big time. UnlikeABoss You are using today's standards to judge it. If you do that, they both sucked. It worked perfectly fine for the basic things people were using it for at the time. destinyhud they both sucked at that time but android sucked more than iOS at that time. SVem26 I like to think I am in the nerd userbase and I don't care what kernel is used.. can you help me understand why it matters? UnlikeABoss Do you want a brand new obscure kernel in thing that holds most of your sensitive details? TipTop I don't want something that dates back to 90s, is full of zero-days and horrible code contributed by nobodies. UnlikeABoss The idea that it is full of zero days is hilarious. You do realize that the majority of Linux exploits are local, right? Unlike Windows. Yes there is obviously code from the 90s, but very, very little of it. Not to mention that age is not a factor in deciding bad code. The idea that old code is bad code shows your inexperience. By that standard, should we dismiss Chrome because of all the exploits being found in code that was written when it first started? Are we going to create brand new software every few years to purge "old code"? Do you have any idea whatsoever how much Linux has actually changed? Do you have any idea how much of this change is because it's considered a "universal" kernel everyone can use and is focusing on? Do you really think splitting the community over onto another kernel will increase security for either of those kernels? There's a little something called code maturity. There's a reason Microsoft has way less exploits in its kernel today than 10 years ago. They didn't write a new kernel from scratch. TipTop But it is. You can be in denial all you want. Linux is the OS that is used by botnets for DDoSing websites not Windows. UnlikeABoss No sorry, come back to reality. Botnets consist of all types of OS, including Linux ofc. It is not the majority of bots in a botnet, that statement alone shows how clueless you are. Also, do you understand what Linux is? It's a kernel. The majority of Linux hosts in a botnet have been hacked through exploits in outdated software, not the kernel. The same cannot be said for Windows. Again, read the statistics for the severity of Linux exploits versus Windows. More exploits are found in Linux overall because it is open source, however, that doesn't make it worse. More critical and high severity exploits are found in Windows. That speaks a lot for the secure design of Linux. Hopefully you'll do some reading and learn. Sir_Brizz All OSes are full of vulnerabilities and horrible code written by nobodies. If that is your requirement then you must have gone full luddite by now. TipTop Windows is written by paid professionals and has QA/QC. Linux is written by fat nerds for free and has no quality control but nice try. Don't gve me the top contributors crap. Sir_Brizz Yes, tell me again how many zero day vulnerabilities are found in Windows and how long they take to get fixed. Even worse, tell me that with macOS. Being paid doesn't guarantee quality, just as being unpaid doesn't guarantee garbage. Windows and macOS have some of the crappiest insecure code. And there is nothing special about having QA or being paid to write code. Some of the worst programmers I have ever met worked at places like Microsoft and Apple. https://mobile.twitter.com/taviso/status/860681252034142208 Please continue trying to tell me how infallible paid programmers are! UnlikeABoss They are totally da bestest eva! UnlikeABoss Obviously paid products will always be better than unpaid products... right!?!? /s Oh wait we have tons of real life examples of free products being better than paid, shocking how that works. It's almost as if the best products are made by the most passionate people, and like, being paid doesn't guarantee being passionate about your creation. What a crazy crazy world! ihsan ışık Are you implying that Android got popular because of "nerds" who heard it uses the Linux kernel? UnlikeABoss If you are old enough to know the early days of android you'll know that having every single nerd on the internet promoting Android over iOS most certainly helped get the ball rolling. Once it was pushed, it snowballed into what it is today. m477 Sure. It was the nerds on the internet, not the manufacturers with ads everywhere. Most people still don't know their Galaxy runs Android. UnlikeABoss The giant billboards came YEARS afterwards, cmon. m477 Yes, and that's why Android was so unpopular in the early days. UnlikeABoss What? It was massively popular among all techies for being the open source iOS alternative. m477 You are overestimating the "techies" crowd. Even BlackBerryOS was more popular at the time. Only after the Galaxy S it started to grow, and became popular among normal people. UnlikeABoss Not really. We are talking over a decade ago now, there were far less people on the internet and it was far easier for techies to promote products because everyone was asking their "techie" friend what is best. But these days everyone is an "expert" so that's not as much of a thing. m477 Again, you overestimate how many techies there actually were. Your personal experience is anecdotal. Market shares and sell data are objective. Also, over a decade ago Android was still a camera os, and it wasn't public. UnlikeABoss No, I do not. The further back in time you go, the higher the proportion of techies there were using the internet versus others. People were only just starting to look at buying a smartphone, and asking techies what they should buy. m477 Yes, the concentration on the internet of "techies" on the internet was greater. And? What normal user at the time went to the internet, looked at reviews and said "Oh, look! The HTC magic has Linux! This random guy says its good, so I'm gonna buy it!"? You really think that a bunch of "techies">marketing? A guy saying that his toy-looking HTC G1 is better than the iPhone is more effective than billboards and tv ads? Come on, even Windows Mobile was more popular. It took Samsung's aggressive marketing to make Android popular. UnlikeABoss Windows Mobile and BlackBerry were more popular in the enterprise, that's it. The entire discussion is home users. Also I think there's been some confusion. I wasn't implying that techies on the internet were promoting Android on the internet like a marketing department. I was implying that the internet was very much a "social media" platform for techies to communicate where the majority of them would use Android and mocked the use of iOS. The actual "marketing" happened offline when a normal user would ask their "techie" friend for first time buying advice. It is nothing like that today, and the internet is nothing like the techie community it once was. m477 So, what you're saying is that the internet was a circlejerk of Android users. Ok, and? It didn't affected normal users the slightest, iOS was still more popular until Samsung took Android more seriously. The techie friend thing its only your anecdotal experience, it bears no influence on the market, in the grand scheme of things. I'd even argue that Google's very light marketing did much, much more. Also, the mindless techies that recommended half backed devices instead of better alternatives because "Uh, Linux!!" did more harm than good, both to the users and to Android. UnlikeABoss If you read my OP you'll see my original point was that Google has rode the "Android circlejerk" to popularity, and you can debate how much popularity that added as much as you want. The fact remains, it got the ball rolling. Samsung didn't pick it up "just because", it saw that a lot of people were pushing it. There were several OS at the time it could have used, including sticking to its own. Why bother with Android? Maybe because it wanted to see how much market it could take by appealing to techies? However, if you stand back and look at it, how is this any different from "embrace, extend, extinguish"? Google used that "free marketing" and has now decided to use it's massive popularity to push a different product. (Which has failed in the past and will hopefully fail again). Why hate Microsoft for doing that in the past, but we praise Google for doing it? Why are we excited for something we know nothing about that is creating fragmentation? m477 Samsung had used several OSes, it had Windows Mobile and Phone devices, Symbian devices, and proprietary devices, even Palm OS devices IIRC. They used them all. Android had was the easiest to personalise for them, and create a copy of the best selling product, which was the iPhone, and there was an app market, so they tried to release and market their flagship with it, and market it as broadly as Apple. The first Galaxy (the "non S") was was vastly ignored, because it was as little marketed as all their other devices. The techies crowd was insignificant. The free marketing is just as much as Windows 10 gets for incorporating Ubuntu's bash terminal. What you saw is not really important. I saw lots and lots of Windows Phones in 2010 and 11. Many more than Android devices. Every one I knew had one, and if I had to say which OS was the most popular only based on my personal experience, in my smallish city, I'd obviously would say Windows Phone. Why are you so attached to Linux, excluding all possibilities of giving a possibly better solution a try? The community will just fork the AOSP and continue the development of the Linux branch. UnlikeABoss Cmon, we both know Android was not easier for them to customize than simply using their own OS. No one was recommending it, techie or not, no matter how much they marketed. It's only now they are popular they are trying to slip in their own OS, and still failing. I am not attached to Linux despite people using it as an easy scapegoat to dismiss a discussion critiquing almighty Google. We currently have a situation where most kernel developers focus entirely on Linux, making it virtually the universal kernel. Why are we creating pointless fragmentation there? Why divide that community? Do we honestly believe that a divided community can produce a better kernel, or do we love it because Google is doing it? Would we love it if Microsoft did this? m477 The proprietary OS they used at the time was a Java based thing with a flash interface. Hardly able to compete against iOS. It was easier for them to use the "next Symbian" that they could customise as they wanted, and that also had an app market. If they made, say, Bada, before Android become established and popular, and marketed it as much as they did with their Galaxy S, the market would be very different today. The normal user doesn't care what OS their shiny phone runs, as long as there's facebook. I am a GNU/Linux user since the first half of the 2000s, and I've always critiqued Google for using Linux as a kernel on phones. Linux might be the universal kernel, but smartphones need a more streamlined solution. I don't care if it's Google, the MIT, or Richard Stallman in person to do it. I liked WP8 architecture. Fragmentation is not pointless if it brings benefits to the user. TipTop Nobody cares about your FSF agenda. John Q I think the chief reason Google is not using Linux is that they want a real-time OS (RTOS). Linux is at best a "soft" RTOS, possessing a real-time scheduler but this is still not nearly as real-time as an actual RTOS should be. It would take a very large effort to do that for Linux so it makes sense that Google would want to make their own kernel that they can have full control over. UnlikeABoss Let's ignore the fact that Linux is used in real time car systems for a moment. Could you elaborate on why you think Google would want/need a RTOS on their smartphones? M6 The kernel they're using, 'magenta', is opened source. So who cares if they're using linux or not? Does everyone have to use linux? UnlikeABoss No it doesn't have to be Linux. But who else will use Magenta? Probably no one. So why are we fragmenting the kernel space further? Why would you choose an immature kernel for something as valuable (your data) as your smartphone. Would you trust that? I would much rather developers continue focusing on a single kernel. WesleySmalls But wouldn't Magenta be this single kernel? UnlikeABoss If everyone decided to ditch Linux and focus purely on Magenta as the universal kernel, yes. Will that happen? WesleySmalls Could be, just not overnight. The market was already fairly well developed when Linux arrived in 1991, yet it still managed to become a very, if not the most, important player in the market. It's certainly possible, it will just require proper investment(and neglect of their alternate platforms) and patience to make it work M6 That's some straight up communist shit right there. Let's just work on one thing, because we only need one thing, everything else is redundant! Let's not allow other people to do the same thing in a different way, because competition totally doesn't spur innovation at all. WORPspeed So Andromeda definitely dead or still happening? sleepinlight Pretty sure this IS Andromeda, or at least a part of it. Andromeda was never an official name for anything, it was just the internal project name for some sort of new and/or merged OS. WORPspeed I thought Andromeda specifically referred to merging Android and Chrome OS. So is that specific merger dead or on life-support? John Q Nah, the Android/Chrome merger was just speculation from what Andromeda seemed to be. There was never any concrete evidence to imply that Andromeda was a merger. WORPspeed To quote Androidpolice : "So please, when you see Fuchsia mentioned, or speculation that it "is" Andromeda, know that it is just that: speculation. Last we heard from sources we consider extremely reliable, Android was the basis of Andromeda, and Andromeda would see its commercial debut on a new Pixel laptop later this year. It is possible Google has changed plans around Andromeda, that the initiative itself may have even been scrapped. Though, we have no reason to think so - it's more that we don't know, and haven't heard anything about Andromeda in quite some time." http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ WORPspeed http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ That makes them seem very separate Srujan https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e7fda716dfcfdca76e200e51a9c9144c72e183c7e76d36b910c20ee0931aee79.gif destinyhud if this replaces android rather than having 2 separate codebase, I am all up for it. splitting the android community is dangerous senor_heisenberg Well if this does end up being what replaces Android or what Android evolves into, I just hope my apps and whatnot are compatible. Ain't got the time or money to be investing into another ecosystem. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman That's a tricky, double-edged sword. I can't fathom they would not support the old apps, or at least the vast majority of them, for exactly that reason. But in doing so it will likely be held back at least slightly from what it can/should be. Backward-compatibility tends to hold everything back. What I'd wager is we won't see this until hardware's powerful enough to make emulating the old system in a VM relatively cheap and easy, with back-end Play Store penalties to developers who don't shift to the new app models, and then slow phase-outs in stages of the older functionality and support until the new OS is running exclusively its own setup. senor_heisenberg That sounds good. Randy Gindy I think Google porting the Android Run-time to Chrome OS was to see if they could do it. morteum This is old news, I'm waiting for Fuchsia 2.0 Barracuda. /s marcusmarcus2 What if they aren't going by Animal names in general but by mammal names. I'd skip the Fuchsia 2.0 Bandicoot. It will probably be "Crash" prone. Alfonso Surroca Three operating systems is not nearly enough. We need at least two more announced at I/O. Suicide_Note One OS for each Google messaging app. AbbyZFresh If this is not customizable, the Andorid OEMs won't be liking this one bit. Miku is Best Vocaloid Leprosy OS. 4Ui812 All of Google's projects are missing one thing..... can I make a suggestion Google? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7c05d652570603779d08c4dbce3535891bbfd9b0bd62ebb1c5a084b03e7d21ea.gif Christopher Bement Honestly, this would cure my fever. 4Ui812 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/7ac8191019b3b90075b387b129808b379bef70d0796d8d2263109849fa1b71bc.gif BetterWithRoot https://media.giphy.com/media/3o6ozscsz4jRX7xuQE/giphy.gif saf1927 Reading the comments of armchair experts here makes me smile. klaus666 But will it solve the update problem? Suicide_Note There is no update problem. Nexus/Pixels run the latest and greatest. OEMs who mess with the OS give their customers severely delayed updates. pfmiller Nexus and Pixels run the latest and greatest for two years. Nobody would accept this OS update situation if it was on a desktop OS. MJ Thank God it's phones we are talking about and not a desktop PC. marcusmarcus2 That is exactly why Windows XP lasted only a couple years before all computers updated to Windows 7... Seriously though. I'm fine with only getting Android version upgrades phones for 2 years. But they really need to extend out security updates beyond 3 years. Suicide_Note This isn't a desktop OS, not to mention people tend to change phones much more often than their desktops. pfmiller Sure it's not a desktop OS, but no sense pretending that what we have leaves nothing to be desired. And sure people change their phones more often that their desktops, but there's absolutely no reason to change every 2 years. Suicide_Note I change phones at least once a year, and sometimes two or three times. I couldn't imagine going two years or more on the same phone. pfmiller You can do what you look like, but there's absolutely no reason why that would be necessary. Suicide_Note It's only necessary if you want the latest and greatest, which i like to have, because phone tech is still evolving and improving at a good clip. For example, had i skipped the Pixel, I'd still be using my 6P or N6, both of which have cameras that are vastly inferior to that in the Pixel. I've taken some incredible shots with the Pixel, some of which would be literally impossible to duplicate using the camera in the 6P/N6. That alone is reason enough for me to upgrade on a yearly basis. Doby Gillis Which is a problem, Einstein. Suicide_Note Not if you're a Nexus/Pixel owner, Dilbert. Randy Gindy I would generally say there is. Android phones are not supported for nearly as long as an iPhone. The reason being that the chip set manufacturers do not release new drivers. Shelly-Man Vol 2 It's looks pretty neat for a development stage. Rami Well Android has to reach Z someday. In the case, Hello Fuchsia! marcusmarcus2 Those split-screens will be really useful for running of of Google's different messaging apps. Hopefully OS's aren't the new messaging apps of Google.

Neither, this is just a side project many developers use to test and work out the feasability of a variety of things. Android is a very well developed environment, and replacing it whole is simply a no-go. Things will just gradually evolve, as they have already done with Dalvik being replaced by ART, for example. Sir_Brizz I don't think you're wrong, but it would be in Google's best interest to start building a non-JVM runtime that apps can run inside with a native language that Google has 100% full control over like Go or Dart. Тарас Мукин 1. This is definetelly Chat UI! It came from Telegram bots and whatsoever, and it is so smart of Google to be developing it now. Feels like it's going to be next big UI-change after Apple came up with apps divided into screens. 2. "Magenta is designed for ... non-trivial amounts of ram" This is going to be optimised sooo bad.

Lol Cyber Jethro I personally think this is for embedded systems like shopping kiosks or other customer service applications. Zach Mauch "Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware" Did you mean "relegated", not "neglected"? ZettabyteGamer Neglected works, and is the better word choice here. PVL_93_RU Those "stories" on the "home screen" look like they'd fit perfectly for a kiosk-type display, where you have a lot of space to work with JG Fuchsia is a purple-y pink color. T-Mobile's color is Magenta, a slightly different purple-y pink color T-Mobile is rumored to be looking into launching their own phone... Coincidence??? Almost certainly, without a doubt yes... But consider... T-Mobile also launched the first Android phone... Nomaan Is this why Pixels were released in 2016 coz google tested fuchsia and magenta on existing pixels with existing qualcomm drivers and they know they could just update it in 2018 and further without having to worry about qualcomm dropping support? One can dream... yoloswag Inspired by the messaging team, Google wants to start working on a 2nd operating system. Darth Vader 3rd* JG Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Modern personal computers huh? I've been interested in Google packing ChromeOS into a LiveCD type set up we could test/install on our own computers... (*Yes, I know of Chromium, haven't tried it yet... But I would prefer it coming direct from Google, faster updates and all that). It could be interesting to try out another of Google's OSs without having to fork over several hundred for new hardware... The only problem would be drivers to support the various hardware. If not modified too much, ChromeOS could possibly use the original Gentoo Linux drivers. But with Fuchsia using its own unique kernel... That might throw things off a bit... I know a few less tech-savey individuals who would probably be more comfortable if the same OS powered their phone, tablet and desktop (should Google opt to replace Android with Fuchsia). Especially if it could run both Android apps and Chrome extensions natively.

King_Android Well its safe to say its definitely for mobile phones seeing that T-mobile is the "current" carrier, so we can rule out it only being for IoT. mattcoz Phones aren't the only devices that can use mobile data. King_Android Such as a tablet? Either way it still holds true. This will obviously be used for a phone/tablet I dont know much else that uses T-mobile thats not a phone or tablet and would need a UI like this. mattcoz Tablets, wearables, vehicles, and whatever else the future brings. This is not for the devices of today, it's for the devices of tomorrow. Will that include phones? Probably, but "definitely" is too strong at this point.

The bug in the main Windows Defender program was described in Security Advisory 4022344. Chances are good your Windows computer got the fix last night. [ InfoWorld’s deep look: Why (and how) you should manage Windows 10 PCs like iPhones. | The essentials for Windows 10 installation: Download the Windows 10 Installation Superguide today. ] Google Project Zero security researchers Tavis Ormandy and Natalie Silvanovich are credited with discovering the vulnerability. Ormandy tweeted that the security hole was “the worst Windows remote code exec in recent memory… crazy bad.” After Microsoft’s quick action on the bug, Ormandy—ordinarily one of Microsoft’s biggest critics—was swift to respond. “What an amazing response, thanks so much Simon and MSRC! That was incredible work.” The praise seems quite justified. The “wormable” hole has been plugged, and everything is now right with Microsoft Endpoint Protection, Forefront Security, Security Essentials, Intune Endpoint Protection, and all versions of Windows Defender, from Windows 7 to 8.1 to RT to Windows 10 versions 1507, 1511, 1607, and 1703. In short, it was a stunning response to a bad bug (and one more reason why you should not turn off wuauserv, the Windows Update service). The easiest way to make sure you got the fix is to check the version number for MsMpEng.exe, the Microsoft Malware Protection Engine. You’re looking for engine version 1.1.13704.0 or higher (1.1.13701.0 has the security hole). Here’s how to hunt down the version: In Windows 7, click Start > Run, type Windows Defender, and press Enter. Click the down arrow at the top on the right and choose About Windows Defender. To manually update the engine, click the down arrow, then Check for updates. In Windows 8.1, click Start and in the search box type Windows Defender. Then follow the instructions for Windows 7. In Windows 10, type Windows Defender in the Cortana search box and press Enter. In the upper-right corner, click Settings. Scroll down to the bottom and your Engine version appears under Version info. If you don’t have 1.1.13704.0, go into Windows Update (Start > Settings > Update & security), then click Check for updates. The new Windows Defender update (1.243.10.0 on my 1607 PC) should appear. Wait and make sure Windows installs it. For technical details about the security hole, read Ormandy and Silvanovich’s article on the Project Zero blog. The problem boils down to a failure of one function in a privileged kernel program to validate the argument being passed to it. As a result, a bad guy can rig nearly anything to trigger remote execution. The flaw digs into Windows using the component of MsMpEng called mpengine: Mpengine is a vast and complex attack surface, comprising of handlers for dozens of esoteric archive formats, executable packers and cryptors, full system emulators and interpreters for various architectures and languages, and so on. All of this code is accessible to remote attackers. NScript is the component of mpengine that evaluates any filesystem or network activity that looks like JavaScript. To be clear, this is an unsandboxed and highly privileged JavaScript interpreter that is used to evaluate untrusted code, by default on all modern Windows systems. This is as surprising as it sounds. Yes, you read that correctly. MsMpEng has a JavaScript interpreter that runs directly in the kernel—and it’s in all versions of Windows. While Microsoft’s solution fixed the immediate problem, it’s pretty clear there’s still a big potential security hole. A few hours ago, Vesselin Bontchev tweeted: Has anybody examined what Microsoft’s “fix” of the Defender vulnerability is? Did they just resolve the type confusion? I mean, they probably didn’t suddenly add a sandbox around it or stopped running a JavaScript interpreter in the kernel? Bottom line: Make sure Windows Defender is up to date on your system. Don’t turn off the Windows Update service. And expect to hear more about the kernel-mode JavaScript interpreter in the future. Discussion continues on the AskWoody Lounge.

Skip to content MilTech PR Distribution Menu HOME Add the press release Our team & Contact Posted on 9 May 2017 by Maciej Heyman Pembroke Pines, FL Reason #87 Why Outsourcing Your Nationwide Reputation-Management Needs and Custom Blog Content Creation to www.G3-Development.co Is Intelligent Pembroke Pines, FL — (SBWIRE) — 05/09/2017 — Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of affecting the visibility of a website or a web page in a search engine’s „natural” or un-paid („organic”) search results. In general, the earlier (or higher ranked on the search results page), and more frequently a site appears in the search results list, the more visitors it will receive from the search engine’s users. SEO may target different kinds of search, including image search, local search, video search, academic search, news search and industry-specific vertical search engines. As an Internet marketing strategy, SEO considers how search engines work, what people search for, the actual search terms or keywords typed into search engines and which search engines are preferred by their targeted audience. Optimizing a website may involve editing its content, HTML and associated coding to both increase its relevance to specific keywords and to remove barriers to the indexing activities of search engines. Promoting a site to increase the number of backlinks, or inbound links, is another SEO tactic. Webmasters and content providers began optimizing sites for search engines in the mid-1990s, as the first search engines were cataloging the early Web. Initially, all webmasters needed to do was to submit the address of a page, or URL, to the various engines which would send a „spider” to „crawl” that page, extract links to other pages from it, and return information found on the page to be indexed. The process involves a search engine spider downloading a page and storing it on the search engine’s own server, where a second program, known as an indexer, extracts various information about the page, such as the words it contains and where these are located, as well as any weight for specific words, and all links the page contains, which are then placed into a scheduler for crawling at a later date. Pembroke Pines, FL Reason #87 Why Outsourcing Your Nationwide Reputation-Management Needs and Custom Blog Content Creation to http://www.G3-Development.co/ is Intelligent By 2004, search engines had incorporated a wide range of undisclosed factors in their ranking algorithms to reduce the impact of link manipulation. In June 2007, The New York Times’ Saul Hansell stated Google ranks sites using more than 200 different signals. The leading search engines, Google, Bing, and Yahoo, do not disclose the algorithms they use to rank pages. Some SEO practitioners have studied different approaches to search engine optimization, and have shared their personal opinions.  Patents related to search engines can provide information to better understand search engines. In 2005, Google began personalizing search results for each user. Depending on their history of previous searches, Google crafted results for logged in users. In 2008, Bruce Clay said that „ranking is dead” because of personalized search. He opined that it would become meaningless to discuss how a website ranked, because its rank would potentially be different for each user and each search. In December 2009, Google announced it would be using the web search history of all its users in order to populate search results. Google Instant, real-time-search, was introduced in late 2010 in an attempt to make search results more timely and relevant. Historically site administrators have spent months or even years optimizing a website to increase search rankings. With the growth in popularity of social media sites and blogs the leading engines made changes to their algorithms to allow fresh content to rank quickly within the search results. In February 2011, Google announced the Panda update, which penalizes websites containing content duplicated from other websites and sources. Historically websites have copied content from one another and benefited in search engine rankings by engaging in this practice, however Google implemented a new system which punishes sites whose content is not unique.  In April 2012, Google launched the Google Penguin update the goal of which was to penalize websites that used manipulative techniques to improve their rankings on the search engine.

Google's Doodle in the U.S. honoring National Teacher's Day.  (Photo: Google) On Tuesday, Google is using its logo for not one, but two special occasions. In the U.S., Google pays tribute to Teachers Day with an adorable interactive showing a teacher (in this case, the second "g" in the logo), instructing the class on subjects including chemistry and astronomy. According to the National Education Association, Congress declared a National Teacher Day on March 7, 1980, but the organization changed it to the Tuesday of the first full week of May. If you are accessing Google in Canada, Australia, and parts of Europe and Latin America, you're greeted with a clever homage to Ferdinand Monoyer, one of France's most famous ophthalmologists. Tuesday marks his 181st birthday. A Google Doodle honoring Ferdinand Monoyer.  (Photo: Google) Monoyer invented the diopter, a unit of measurement that determines the distance someone must be from a text to read it. He also created the famous eye chart you see in ophthalmology offices everywhere, when you cover your eye to read rows of random letters. Google says hidden within the chart is Monoyer's name.

Intrusive Interstitials: Guidelines To Avoiding Google’s Penalty By Myriam Jessier May 9th, 2017 AnalyticsMobileResponsive Web Design 3 Comments In 2015, Google announced that mobile searches surpassed desktop searches in at least 10 countries. 56% of mobile traffic1 on major websites comes from mobile. In light of this, Google’s decision to improve the mobile user experience by various means, such as AMP pages2 and a dedicated mobile index, comes across as a sound business move. More than half of the 2 trillion searches3 Google processes each year come from mobile devices. Mobile devices have changed the way we approach search, ushering in new types of habits such as local search, voice search and more. These consumer habits have greatly affected the way search engine providers think about user search intent. A new type of mobile improvement was rolled out by Google. The search giant has decided to launch a war against interstitials that ruin the user experience. As a result, any website found guilty of showing intrusive popups, banners or overlays (called interstitials) will see its content demoted in Google’s mobile search results. We’ll be looking at what’s being penalized, what’s allowed and some workarounds to help you cope with this new penalty. Further Reading on SmashingMag: Link Is Your Responsive Design Working? Google Analytics Will Tell You4 Everything You Need To Know About Google’s Accelerated Mobile Pages5 World Wide Web, Not Wealthy Western Web6 Google’s Mobilegeddon Aftermath: Eight Months Into A Better Mobile Web7 Mobile Reality Link Two years ago, Google introduced a mobile-friendly label8 as it began prioritizing mobile websites. The aim was to push websites that offer a substandard user experience to improve their design, code and content. These guidelines are updated quite often as Google aims to keep the mobile user experience center stage: Mobile-Friendly Test9, Google Search Console AMP10 “Guidelines for Mobile Web Development11,” Smashing Magazine “Responsive Web Design Basics12,” Pete LePage, Web Fundamentals, Google Developers “Enabling Deep Links for App Content13,” Android Developers “Google Algorithm Change History14,” Moz With a dramatically levelled playing field, various elements are fighting to be displayed on one small screen. Coupons, offers, newsletter registration, ads, text, photos, social sharing buttons, and live chat are all vying for some valuable mobile screen space. Often, the visitor pays the price as their mobile experience becomes a confusing mess. Google’s latest penalty aims to change how we think about mobile advertising. Introducing The Intrusive Interstitial Penalty Link One recent change made this year is the intrusive interstitial update15. This algorithm update has one mission: to penalize for intrusive popup ads that affect the mobile user experience. The update rolled out earlier this year. Certain websites saw their mobile rankings in Google lowered. Decrypting The Intrusive Interstitial Update Link First and foremost, it’s a mobile popup penalty. Secondly, it’s an intrusive popup penalty. Google wants to make sure that ads and popups do not interfere with the user experience on a mobile screen. The intent behind devaluing pages with popups and overlays that take up most of the screen is to help users access the content they’ve requested in the first place. What Is The Impact Of This Latest Update? Link Google will no longer consider pages with intrusive interstitials as being mobile-friendly. Bottom line: Obstructing content on mobile with ads or other popups is against Google’s guidelines. The main target of this update is overlays that gray out the content, making the content inaccessible for a few seconds or until the user miraculously manages to tap the minuscule “X” with their sausage fingers to dismiss the ads. Ads displayed over content are no longer acceptable16 on mobile. This includes popups that appear when you load the page from Google or when you scroll down. For many websites, playing according to Google’s rules means removing all barriers17 that could prevent the user from reading the content on the page at any time. What Is An Interstitial? Link Interstitial spaces can be defined as a type of “web page” that appears before or after the page (in a website or an app) expected by the user. Essentially, it is something that blocks out the website or app’s main content. These spaces have served as a promotional tool for many online marketers. They can contain advertisements, surveys, newsletter signup forms, coupons and other various calls to action. What Constitutes An Intrusive Interstitial? Link Intrusive interstitials tend to block most or all of a page, leading to a frustrating experience for desktop and mobile users alike. These ads hinder the experience because they are unexpected and block the content that users seek. On the desktop, they’re annoying at best, but on mobile, intrusive interstitials can ruin the entire experience. Ever had to deal with popups gone rogue on mobile? Google has been relatively straightforward in its definition of what constitutes an intrusive interstitial. A few types of interstitials are problematic, as defined by the new guidelines18: 19 Types of intrusive interstitials, as illustrated by Google. (View large version20) a popup or modal window that blocks most or all of the content on a page (this is basically a full-screen interstitial above the header); a standalone interstitial that’s not responsive and that blocks the content; a layout in which the content above the fold has the look and feel of an interstitial and requires dismissal or scrolling in order for the user to reach the main content beneath the fold. If your popups cover the main content shown on the screen, pop up without user interaction or require a dismissal before disappearing, chances are that they will trigger an algorithmic penalty. Popups that incite users to choose their country or their preferred language are also targets because they fit the description above of what constitutes an intrusive interstitial. They bother readers and are not a necessity. What’s Not Intrusive? Link Not all interstitials are targeted by this penalty. Some exceptions exist, such as interstitials that are in place for legal or ethical reasons. The following popups do not require a change of size, design or position within a page: 21 Types of non-intrusive interstitials, as illustrated by Google. (View large version22) age-verification blockers that act as a shield for certain content, such as alcohol-related or adult content; cookies that use popups that serve as consent notifications as required by the EU; any other type of legally required popup. Gray Area Link The official guidelines provided by Google are pretty vague at times. The company’s definition of what constitutes an intrusive interstitial is not clearcut. Many elements are not addressed, such as: sticky sidebars, related posts, share buttons, live chat boxes, coupon popups. The jury is still out on whether these elements will be targeted by the algorithm update, even if they comply with the guidelines on interstitials. Navigating this gray area can be tricky. If you want to come out on top, we recommend designing these elements in a way that ensures they do not cover any of the page’s actual content. Making sure these notifications do not hinder the user experience can go a long way towards avoiding a penalty. What Is Still Permitted (But Intrusive Nonetheless) Link Make no mistake, as of 10 January 2017, interstitials are a new ranking signal for mobile SEO. It doesn’t necessarily mean that all types of popups should be banned. Intrusive Popups Are Still OK on Desktop Link This penalty targets mobile issues. Overlays, popups and other types of interstitials will live another day on desktop. 23 Atlas Obscura’s desktop website overlay. (View large version24) Interstitials Triggered by Exit Intent Are Still Allowed Link Here is Google’s John Mueller’s advice on interstitials triggered by exit intent: At the moment, those wouldn’t count. What we’re looking for is, really, interstitials that show up on the interaction between the search click and going through the page and seeing the content. So, that’s kind of the place we’re looking for those interstitials. What you do afterwards, like if someone clicks on stuff within your website or closes the tab or something like that, then that’s kind of between you and the user. Page-to-Page Interstitials Will Not Be Penalized Link Google is not looking to penalize all pages with interstitials, only the ones that searchers could land on from search results. It’s still OK to display an interstitial when a user navigates from one of your pages to another. If a user can find a page by searching for something on Google, then you’ll need to ensure that this page has no intrusive interstitials. If after landing on this page, the user decides to navigate to another page on the website that is not listed by Google, then interstitials would be allowed on that page25. Sounds a bit convoluted, but this has been confirmed by Google. Will You Be Penalized? Link Google’s main objective is to make the web more accessible, intuitive and usable, especially for mobile users. If your popups serve a real purpose that add value for the user, chances are you should be OK. How The Penalty Works? Link This mobile interstitial penalty is rolling out on a recrawling basis26. Basically, the next time Google’s bot crawls your website after 10 January 2017, it will evaluate the interstitials present on mobile. The penalty could hurt, but so far the reported impact has been minimal27. How To Identify Intrusive Interstitials Link Auditing your popups is a great way to determine whether your mobile website is compliant. Start by reviewing the mobile popups, because desktop popups are not going to be penalized. Prefer small messages such as banners, inlines and slide-ins for mobile pages. 28 Atlas Obscura’s mobile website interstitial. Testing Tool Link Google has stated that it will not release an official tool to test websites. However, there is a tool out there, Interstitial Penalty Check29, that uses image recognition to identify potential interstitials on your pages. It measures how much space popups take on the screen to flag the ones at risk. Audit Your Popups Link Identify required interstitials, such as age-verification popups and cookie notifications. Identify all other popups, and evaluate them according to the amount of space they take up. Make note of any third-party scripts present on your website that might trigger popups. You will often find these if you use a CMS. For WordPress users, check your plugins. Some plugins used to display popup messages for coupons, membership offers, promotions and other types of ads need to be reviewed. You might have to adjust the sizes using the plugins’ settings. Interstitial Design Guidelines Link Any banners that take up a “reasonable amount of space” will not be targeted. That’s great news! However, no exact guidelines have been communicated by Google. The recommended size is 15% or less, even in landscape mode, because it still allows readers to access several lines of text. Keep In Mind What Google Is Looking For In A Positive User Experience Link Popups aren’t being banned, but marketing efforts will have to adapt to these new restrictions. Let’s rephrase that: Marketing efforts will have to respect the user’s screen space. Try to redesign any interstitials that were previously considered essential to marketing efforts. You can replace them with a link to a separate page or an inline ad, for example. For instance, language-selection interstitials30 can be phased out, in favor of a banner on the website. But first evaluate whether such an element is worth that much screen space: Users arrive with a linguistic context already if they’ve come from Google. Workarounds Link If your website suffers a significant drop-off in conversion following the removal of some interstitials, then you’ll have to work around the issue. Luckily for you, only pages listed in Google’s search results are being targeted. If a user navigates to another page on your website, then a popup placed there would not be a problem for Google. The entry page is the issue for the search engine. This isn’t particularly recommended, but if interstitials remain the best way to convert users for your website, then consider keeping them on the website (and away from Google by placing a no-index tag in your code). Keep in mind that this would mean cutting off organic traffic from Google to that page. News From The War On Interstitials Link False Positives Penalties Link Some websites have been hit by Google’s mobile interstitial penalty even though they were adhering to the guidelines31. Other websites that should have been affected have not encountered any negative impact yet. So, what do you do if you’ve been hit unfairly? Head on over to the Google Webmaster Help forum to give feedback to the Google team. How to Recover From a Penalty? Link If your traffic has suffered because of this penalty, we recommend auditing your popups and removing the ones deemed intrusive. Once that’s done, you’ll have to wait until Google recrawls your pages. You can also submit your pages via the Google Search Console’s fetch and submit tool to kickstart the recrawling effort a bit. This should remove the demotion32 in mobile ranking inflicted on your website. Google’s John Mueller confirms that the demotion would be removed in real time when the pages are recrawled and reindexed. This penalty is doled out in real time, meaning that recovery will depend on how frequently Google indexes those pages. For most websites, though, “real time” means waiting until each individual page is crawled by Google and the demotion is removed. Adapt Or Die: Looking Into New Strategies Link Yes, popups are frustrating, but companies use them because they are effective. SumoMe33 shares recent findings that establish the interstitial’s track record: An average conversion rate is 3.09%, versus 9.28% on average for high-performing popups. Removing revenue-generating interstitials could hurt websites at first, but losing organic search traffic could hurt their revenues even more. Designers, developers and marketers must work together to find new, non-intrusive ways to generate revenue. A sound strategy would be to leverage content marketing to educate audiences and guide them through the buying process. This means moving away from interruption marketing towards permission marketing. The first can be defined as an annoying version of the traditional way of doing marketing via advertising, promotion and sales, whereas the latter is about promoting and selling a product to a potential client who explicitly agrees to receive marketing information. Google is aware that many websites are supported by ads. Its AdSense is based in part on this revenue model. There are pros and cons to this new update. It could mean more time on website, more page views and a lower bounce rate, but it could still harm revenue in the short to medium term. Google representatives have stated publicly that they don’t want confusing ads — so, if there’s any question about what is an ad and what is the main content, you could have a problem. Therefore, label your ads as sponsored content, make them unobtrusive, and you should be fine. In the meantime, audit your popups, cookie notifications, overlays and big banners to make sure they comply with Google’s new guidelines. Make sure they don’t take up more than 15% of the screen to avoid a penalty. If you do get penalized, don’t panic; fix the issues, and wait for Google’s bot to visit your website again. The bot should notice your efforts and remove the penalty.

First, it helps you find missed opportunities. It also clues you into shifts in your industry which could help you stay ahead of the curve. It also gives you a benchmark for growth goals. Reaching the top of the SERPs and staying there is more challenging now than ever. Although Google webmaster guidelines haven’t changed much over the years, the core algorithm has. Thanks to regular updates, in addition to major ones like Knowledge Graph, Hummingbird, and RankBrain, Google is better able to filter out websites that don’t meet their standards and boost up sites that best satisfy those guidelines. I’m not suggesting that you can “reverse engineer” Google’s algorithm. It’s far too complex. Still, a review of top ranking websites can be a good starting point for determining best practices. At the most basic level, a website can be broken down into these components: Technology Content Backlinks Here are three ways to compare your site to your competitors to see where your SEO could be doing better. 1. Website Technology A well-structured website that is fast, easy to use, and easy to crawl should be every webmaster’s goal. You don’t need a specific technology to accomplish this, but if you’re starting with a new site or considering a redesign, it’s certainly worth checking out the competition. My favorite resource for this is BuiltWith.com. They provide a ton of technology information, including: Web Server Email Services Hosting Providers Nameserver Providers SSL Certificate Content Management System (CMS) Advertising Analytics & Tracking JavaScript Libraries Mobile Widgets Content Delivery Network (CDN) Aggregation Functionality Document Information Encoding CSS Media Queries Website Architecture Knowing your competitors’ website architecture can be useful in terms of establishing parent and child page hierarchy as well as discovering potential product or content gaps. The best and easiest way to determine this is by creating a sitemap. There are several great sitemap tools available, but if you want a free tool that has stood the test of time, it’s hard to beat Xenu Link Sleuth as shown below: Page Speed With mobile devices being the most popular access point to the web, page speed is incredibly important. Google has specifically mentioned it as a ranking factor. The WebPageTest tool shows how you stack up against your competition: If you find your site is underperforming, head over to Google’s PageSpeed Insights for specific recommendations on how to speed up performance. In fact, even if you are best in class, you should still run the PageSpeed test and address any problems cited by Google. 2. Website Content Organic Keyword Research Developing the right list of keywords is still important. Chances are, your competitors have already invested a lot of time in developing a killer keyword strategy. Don’t let all that hard work go to waste. Use this competitive intelligence to drive traffic to your site. My tool of choice for competitor organic keyword research is Ahrefs. They have a large database of search rankings by website. They also make it easy to determine which phrases drive traffic and their potential for ranking. In addition to listing keywords and rankings, they also list top pages. Better still,  they include the number of keywords that a particular page ranks for as well as a list of those phrases: It fairly common to find a single page, like the one highlighted above, ranking for hundreds (even thousands) of related keywords. It can often be much more efficient to concentrate on creating a better version of a top-performing page than to focus on a single keyword or phrase. One question in the back of nearly every webmaster’s mind is, “What opportunities are being missed?” What are competitors ranking for that you are missing out on? That doesn’t need to remain a mystery. Just plug your competitors into the Content Gap Tool, as shown below: You have the option of filtering to: Show keywords that any of the targets rank for, but you don’t Show keywords that at least two of the targets rank for, but you don’t Show keywords that all the targets rank for, but you don’t This is a great way to find both highly relevant keyword opportunities as well as some potentially new business opportunities. On-page Optimization Google may not be as dependent on meta tags since the introduction of Knowledge Graph, but having a clear roadmap for both users and search engines is still important. One way to see how your pages stack up against the competition is by using SEOBook’s free WebPage Similarity Comparison Tool: This tool outputs a comparison of: Page title Meta description tag Keywords (good for competitor intel, not so much for SEO) Text and word count Top two- & three-word keyword phrases The most effective way to use this tool is to look for patterns. In this case, each title tag leads with the brand and includes mentions of SEO and search marketing in at least two of the three pages with optimized title tags. Some would argue this makes you the same as everybody else. That may be true, but if that’s what Google is rewarding, I’m OK with that. 3. Backlinks There was a time when SEOs would chase after every backlink a competitor had to neutralize the advantage that link might provide. That all changed with the introduction of Penguin in April 2012. Links that once held zero value suddenly had a negative value. All the garbage links acquired through indiscriminate backlink mining became dangerous to have in a link profile. Penguin 4.0 is much more forgiving, but who knows what the future may bring? That doesn’t mean competitor backlink mining is a bad idea. It just means you need to use your head and “score” prospective links to determine if they are worth the necessary effort to acquire. (Pro tip: If no effort is necessary, it’s almost never worth getting.) Once again, I find the Ahrefs Link Intersect tool to be highly effective in mining competitor links. (For the record, I have no affiliation with Ahrefs except for a paid subscription.) The tool offers two different filtering options: Show who is linking to all the targets Show who is linking to any of the targets Final Takeaways on Competitor Analysis Content and links will continue to be the backbone of Google’s algorithm for some time. Understanding what you are up against and neutralizing any competitor advantages is an important step when developing an effective marketing campaign. Follow that up with the development of unique and useful content and nothing can stop you from ruling the SERPs.

My Homepage Outranks a Subpage for a Keyword #AskanSEO 108 SHARES 242 READS Jenny Halasz Jenny Halasz 242 READS Editor note: “Ask an SEO” is a weekly column by technical SEO expert Jenny Halasz. Come up with your hardest SEO question and fill out our form. You might see your answer in the next #AskanSEO post! Today’s question comes from Ivan of Varna, Bulgaria: Currently, my homepage has a good ranking for a keyword. Now after the creation of a new website, I have created a page exactly for this word but Google keeps ranking the main page higher than the new one even though it doesn’t contain the keyword inside. I used 301s for all of the old pages. Is there any way to redirect the rank of the homepage for the desired keyword to my new page without redirecting my homepage? First, I have to ask why you think your homepage is not relevant for this keyword since Google clearly seems to think it is. Keep in mind, especially if it is a short-tail keyword, Google is going to want to send visitors to a page that encompasses everything about that keyword and all the tasks a user might want to complete in relation to it. That’s usually going to be a homepage or a category page rather than a product page. I don’t know if this is what happened in your case, but I’m assuming that what you’re talking about is more like this (just an example for clarity): Let’s say you had a site all about car rental. But you decided to start renting heavy equipment too, so you added that to your site and created a subpage all about car rental specifically. While your homepage is still about car rental in part, you want to send people to the more specific page because it will provide a better user experience. If your situation is like this, most likely what happened is that you had some high-value links all about car rental (perhaps even using that specific phrase) pointing to the homepage of the old site. So Google sees from all those inbound links that this site is all about car rental. This can be very frustrating when you’re trying to diversify. There are a few things you could try to fix this. The most obvious solution is that when you created your new site, you could have redirected that old homepage to the car rentals page. But if you didn’t also procure a new domain, that obviously wouldn’t work. And since you’ve already launched your site (without consulting an SEO, tsk, tsk), it’s kind of late to un-ring that bell. The next thing you could try is making sure every reference of car rental and closely related terms points to that subpage with an internal link. I’d only do this temporarily since that could easily be looked at as spamming, but if you did it short term, it might be enough for the Google algorithm to get the hint while you work on the next thing — links. The most important thing you need to do is address that link ambiguity. You could try and earn some additional car rental links directly to the car rental page, but that’s going to be an uphill climb. The more important thing is to seek out those links where you do have exact or similar keyword or topic matches and see if you can get them changed. Again, that’s a highly manual and time-consuming process. Ultimately, you may need to just accept that Google wants to send people to your homepage. While you work on all of the other strategies, you can place a prominent link or call out on your homepage to direct users where they need to go. Have a question about SEO for Jenny?

We like this definition. Pembroke Pines, FL — (SBWIRE) — 05/09/2017 — Search engine optimization (SEO) is the process of affecting the visibility of a website or a web page in a search engine's "natural" or un-paid ("organic") search results. In general, the earlier (or higher ranked on the search results page), and more frequently a site appears in the search results list, the more visitors it will receive from the search engine's users. SEO may target different kinds of search, including image search, local search, video search, academic search, news search and industry-specific vertical search engines. As an Internet marketing strategy, SEO considers how search engines work, what people search for, the actual search terms or keywords typed into search engines and which search engines are preferred by their targeted audience. Optimizing a website may involve editing its content, HTML and associated coding to both increase its relevance to specific keywords and to remove barriers to the indexing activities of search engines. Promoting a site to increase the number of backlinks, or inbound links, is another SEO tactic. Webmasters and content providers began optimizing sites for search engines in the mid-1990s, as the first search engines were cataloging the early Web. Initially, all webmasters needed to do was to submit the address of a page, or URL, to the various engines which would send a "spider" to "crawl" that page, extract links to other pages from it, and return information found on the page to be indexed. The process involves a search engine spider downloading a page and storing it on the search engine's own server, where a second program, known as an indexer, extracts various information about the page, such as the words it contains and where these are located, as well as any weight for specific words, and all links the page contains, which are then placed into a scheduler for crawling at a later date. Pembroke Pines, FL Reason #87 Why Outsourcing Your Nationwide Reputation-Management Needs and Custom Blog Content Creation to http://www.G3-Development.co/ is Intelligent By 2004, search engines had incorporated a wide range of undisclosed factors in their ranking algorithms to reduce the impact of link manipulation. In June 2007, The New York Times' Saul Hansell stated Google ranks sites using more than 200 different signals. The leading search engines, Google, Bing, and Yahoo, do not disclose the algorithms they use to rank pages. Some SEO practitioners have studied different approaches to search engine optimization, and have shared their personal opinions.  Patents related to search engines can provide information to better understand search engines. In 2005, Google began personalizing search results for each user. Depending on their history of previous searches, Google crafted results for logged in users. In 2008, Bruce Clay said that "ranking is dead" because of personalized search. He opined that it would become meaningless to discuss how a website ranked, because its rank would potentially be different for each user and each search. In December 2009, Google announced it would be using the web search history of all its users in order to populate search results. Google Instant, real-time-search, was introduced in late 2010 in an attempt to make search results more timely and relevant. Historically site administrators have spent months or even years optimizing a website to increase search rankings. With the growth in popularity of social media sites and blogs the leading engines made changes to their algorithms to allow fresh content to rank quickly within the search results. In February 2011, Google announced the Panda update, which penalizes websites containing content duplicated from other websites and sources. Historically websites have copied content from one another and benefited in search engine rankings by engaging in this practice, however Google implemented a new system which punishes sites whose content is not unique.  In April 2012, Google launched the Google Penguin update the goal of which was to penalize websites that used manipulative techniques to improve their rankings on the search engine.

Results New Mobilize App fills critical industry gap for scalable and structured mobile messaging communication to reach groups and network partners News provided by Mobilize 09 May, 2017, 09:00 ET Share this article SAN FRANCISCO, May 9, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Mobilize, developer of a next generation messaging platform for large groups, today announced the launch of its mobile application, now available for download at the app store. Existing mobile messaging solutions like Slack, Google Groups and Yammer were created for conversations between friends, families and small teams--when required to scale to facilitate conversations between thousands of people they quickly fall short. Built to enable seamless communications from tens to tens of thousands of contacts, the Mobilize App brings scale, structure and organization to mobile messaging for an increasingly mobile-first society. "Existing messaging technologies were never designed to support communication with large groups. These problems become even more urgent when attempted from a mobile device where managing a group and communicating with even hundreds becomes impossible," said Sharon Savariego, CEO and co-founder, Mobilize. "Mobilize is the ultimate messaging solution to rally groups through multi-channel communication that works at scale. Our new app allows users to send both group and targeted messages and follow ups, stay organized with topic based threads and manage multi-channel communications through our easy to use dashboard. The app is our latest step in solving for large-scale communications." Today more than 2,500 leaders at 250 organizations use Mobilize to connect, manage and empower more than 500,000 people. From marketplaces and their sellers, to on-demand platforms and their workforces, to tech companies and their developers, to the world's many volunteer-based organizations and nonprofits, the new Mobilize App will help strengthen group and network partner engagement and communication. Mobilize: Scalable Messaging for Large Groups to Take Action and Achieve Results Mobilize customers including Microsoft, Salesforce, Telefonica, Prezi, Meetup, The United Nations and the California Democratic Network, have one thing in common: they rely on large external groups and partner communities to get the word out and work done. Mobilize was created to provide a new generation of scalable messaging technologies that empowers large groups and communities to take action and achieve results. The Mobilize App makes it easy for organizations to effectively communicate with partners and communities to drive actionable results wherever they are. With sellers located all over the Bay Area, Etsy uses Mobilize to collaborate, take polls, idea share and communicate meaningfully with seller groups on ways to grow their businesses. Since switching to Mobilize, the San Francisco Etsy network has grown its membership from 1,400 to 2,200 local sellers in the last year alone. "Mobilize has been really amazing in so many different ways. It's given us the opportunity to talk to our community in ways we weren't able to with a Google Group. When we were using Google Groups to collaborate with sellers, we found the features to be very limited. There were too many hoops to jump through to effectively grow our group--which really limited our growth potential. Having a Mobilize App at our fingertips helps our community stay engaged and connected wherever they're trying to make sales happen," said Rebecca Saylor, Co-Captain, SF Etsy. Mobilize App:  Features and Benefits To take messaging technology to the next level Mobilize created the Mobilize App in close partnership with MetaLab, the leading app design firm behind Slack, and its customers. It includes: Member Management and Organization: Stores all member and contact data in one smart network directory with synced and customizable profiles that can be organized into subgroups and cohorts for more targeted communications. The app also includes the ability to publish an external registration form that makes it easy to sign up new members. Multi-Channel Communications Center for Effective Communication: Enables organizations to message their entire network or send targeted messages via regular message, SMS, email campaigns and easily see who replied. Custom call to action buttons are also included to enable organizations to move beyond a stream of unrelated posts and organize communication among large groups by topic. Frictionless Participation: With no log-in or download required, it's easy for members to join the network and participate. Most are up and running within minutes. Events and Polls to Drive Action: Mobilize posts events directly to invitees' calendars and can RSVP from their email, calendar or on Mobilize. Organizations can increase engagement and measure sentiment with quick polls which members can reply to on the fly. Group-level Analytics and Network Dashboard to Measure Success: Track member growth, post activity, engagement rates, most engaged groups and most active members. Empowers leaders to conduct targeted smart follow ups and follow up actions. Maker Faire a family-friendly showcase of invention, creativity and resourcefulness and celebration of the Maker Movement used Mobilize to organize nearly 200 Faires in 2016 alone, engaging more than 1.4 million attendees globally in 38 countries around the world. "Mobilize allows us to communicate and build community with over 200 Maker Faire event teams in 40 countries around the globe. Before Mobilize, we used Google Groups, and the lack of sub-groups or a member directory created messaging noise and limited community building. Now with Mobilize, we're more efficient and effective, using the platform to share best practices with our Maker Faire partners, segment our groups by different regions and interests and communicate vital updates to hundreds of our licensees," said, Sabrina Merlo, Program Director, Maker Faire. Now available on iOS, Mobilize is free up to 100 members with tailored non-profit, business and enterprise plans available for larger groups.

Even after the bad publicity received by the Galaxy Note 7, they have managed to release a phone that many thought would only exist in concept form. Allow me to explain. The Galaxy S8 is probably the most leaked handset to date. And it got to the point where leaks were coming out virtually every week. It became difficult to know what was legitimate and what was just rumour. Some leaks even said that the Galaxy S8 series would have no logo on the front, which many couldn't believe. From memory, all previous Galaxy smartphones have had a logo on the front. The only logical reason for the removal of it could be that the bezels would be so slim, that there would be no place for a logo. We knew early on that there would be at least two Galaxy S8 phones to hit stores, and both would have the same specs, just differing screen size and battery capacity. The S8 would have a 3000 mAh battery and a 5.8" screen, whilst the S8+ would carry 3500 mAh battery and a 6.2" screen. The screen size worried many, but it became clear that due to the bezel to screen ratio of 83.6%, things should be just fine. Fast forward to the end of March, and the Galaxy S8 is officially unveiled. It seems the leaks were rather accurate, and the design of the S8 and S8+ is a rather big directional change compared to all previous Galaxy phones. certainly a step in the right direction for Samsung at winning over consumers who love a sleek, futuristic-looking piece of technology in their hands. This review is based on an S8+ that I purchased through Samsung's online store. It is my own unit, which I upgraded to from last year's Galaxy S7 edge. I was on the fence about this phone, or the LG G6, but after some time with both, I felt that the S8 stood out as the winner, with nicer overall specifications and ergonomics, as well as fast wireless charging in Europe (honestly LG, why omit this over here?). There are five launch colours available, and no matter which one you go for, the front on all of them comes in black. Colour options include Midnight Black, Orchid Grey, Coral Blue, Arctic Silver and Maple Gold The price at the time of writing for an unlocked S8+ is sitting at an eye watering £779 / $840 / €909. Now, I know what you're thinking, as I was thinking the same thing. But this is mid 2017, and big name flagship phone prices only seem to be going up. It's a trend we will just have to deal with unfortunately. At least until less well known manufacturers can compete by matching the hardware and software experience. As this is my own handset, this review will showcase a customised approach to the look and feel of a typical Samsung Android phone. My aim is to show readers what is possible, rather than a direct out of the box experience. Where available, I have linked to, or noted any specific applications, themes or icons used.

All glass and/or metal has been the go-to for all things premium. Of course, the downside to glass on the back panel is that it is a fingerprint magnet, and because it is not coated in a hydrophobic layer like that front, the smudges appear more severe. S7 edge (left), S8+ (right) Each Galaxy flagship has seen a noticeable bump in fit and finish. The Galaxy S8+ continues this trend, with an even more flush frame to panel fit compared to the S7 edge. Whilst the Midnight Black looks the most sleek, the orchid Grey looks very elegant in the flesh. Whatever colour option you choose, the S8+ will feel like a single slab of polished glass. The black just disguises the mid-frame better. Thumbs up to Samsung for not plastering a logo on the front. As a result, the front of the S8 and S8+ is completely clean, and in normal lighting, it's hard to tell where the screen starts and ends when there's nothing on display. Hardware The USB cable and power adapter are now finally in black! It has been a much hated tradition for Samsung to bundle white cables and adapters with black phones. Powering the Galaxy S8 and S8+ is the new 10nm Exynos 8895 for those of us outside of the USA. You guys and girls living in the States get the Snapdragon 835 variant. The two chipsets may be somewhat comparable on paper, but in reality, they are mostly neck and neck. It is worth noting that even though the Snapdragon 835 supports Quick Charge 4, the Galaxy S8 and S8+ utilise only Quick Charge 2.0 regardless of chipset. This isn't a problem of course, as it still charges quickly, at around 1 hour and 30 minutes. Likewise, wireless charging takes 2 hours and 20 minutes. It also appears that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ support USB-PD. I imagine Samsung were taking no chances after the battery issues in the Note 7, where they released the findings of their investigation. Buyers have since been re-assured by Samsung and their commitment to safety. Wireless and mobile network performance were also excellent, although Exynos flagships have always been fine here. A curious observation however, I wanted to compare LAN transfer speeds between the S8+ and the LG G6, but I just could not get the G6 to connect at a similar rate. It appeared to cap out at around 350Mbps, whereas the S8+ connected 780Mbps. This was on the same AC router, and in the same room. The inclusion of a Type-C to Micro USB adapter is very welcome. It means you can retain your existing Micro USB cable, and not have to worry about getting USB-PD compliant cables and adapters like on phones such as the Pixel. Although I get the feeling that this will be the only Galaxy to use Qualcomm's standard as manufacturers like OnePlus have adopted their own fast charging methods, whilst others such as Google utilise USB Power Delivery. The use of the adapter with existing Micro USB cables will not affect the fast charging ability of course, since the standard used on the S8 and S8+ is Quick Charge 2.0, (or as Samsung likes to call it, Adaptive Fast Charge). USB Power Delivery at 5V / 3A is also supported for fast charging, which I talk about later in the review. Otherwise, fast charging rates for both wired and Qi on the S8 remain the same as the S7 and S7 edge at 9V / 1.67A. (15W). With wireless charging, the actual rate is closer to 11-12W once efficiency losses are considered. The S8s are the first phones to hit the market with Bluetooth 5. It is too early to fully realise its potential, but in the short term, you can expect longer Bluetooth range with less interference around crowded airwaves. I also noticed that Bluetooth management is more polished than what it is on the S7 edge. There is also now a dual audio mode, where you can output audio to two different devices at the same time. As well as a settings to synchronise audio volume between both the connected device, and the phone. Perhaps the most radical change though, is the removal of the physical home button. Love it or hate it, this has been Samsung's signature feature since the original Galaxy S in 2010. The Galaxy i7500 from 2009 can't be counted really, because even though it ran Android, it didn't have a dedicated home button. Thankfully, that is the only courageous removal on the S8 and S8+. In its place lies an embedded home button below the display. Press the area where you would normally expect a physical home button to be, applying the same pressure as you would on a normal button, and you are greeted by haptic feedback. It is not as high quality as the iPhone 7 haptic motor, but it's certainly good enough. Gboard with Navbar Apps set to darken the navbar to match The on-screen home button outline is on permanently when using the Always On Display feature. But even if you are not using it, the area is always active, so you can press home to wake the phone when the screen is off. Anyone afraid of screen burn-in need not worry. The home button does move about when the AOD feature is in use. You can also remap the back/task switcher buttons around to be in the "correct" order. Android purists can finally rejoice. AMOLED display 2017 is set to see a growing trend in narrow phone displays with minimal bezels. Android Nougat's multi-window mode plays brilliantly with this, by allowing two apps to run side by side with greater flexibility. Multi-window is nothing new, and I personally don't know anyone who actually uses it on their phone. Even as a power user, I rarely use it unless I'm showing someone what is possible. It remains to be seen then, whether these wide displays will guide people to using such software features. The super-wide aspect ratio makes for an immersive media experience. Compared to a phone with a 16:9 display, videos have greater depth. Much like how an ultra-wide PC monitor drops you into the action when gaming compared to a standard widescreen monitor. As MKBHD aptly put it, the video just melts over the edges. When playing 16:9 content in apps like YouTube, a little floating button appears, that when pressed, will expand the video to fit the full width of the display. Of course this means it'll get cropped a little bit on the top and bottom, but in the majority of videos, the cropped off areas are non-essential anyway from my experience. In apps where the floating button doesn't show up, you have to manually use the zoom functions in them directly. Amazon's Prime Video app is one such example, where the zoom control allows for crop and expand to make full use of the new aspect ratio. LG's G6 also has a floating button to crop in videos in the same way, but on the G6, it appears that the YouTube app doesn't allow the feature to work, which results in a somewhat average experience on its 18:9 display. The S8's new Super AMOLED display supports Mobile HDR Premium, but HDR sources for mobile are not readily available at present. Netflix has confirmed the next version of its app will support it, but Amazon's Prime Video and YouTube have no details just yet. The S7 edge was always a classy looking phone, but the S8 goes one step beyond There is a reason why DisplayMate awarded the Galaxy S8 the title of "best" display ever on a phone. I find the screen to be easily viewable in sunlight. Brightness levels are high, but then again they have to be in order to comply with HDR specifications. This is one display that's usable in nearly all conditions, even in the wet, where I found the touchscreen functions more accurately than its predecessor. Colour accuracy was also acceptable out of the box on my handset. I did tweak the RGB controls slightly to drop the red and blue tones down a shade so as to be closer to my PC monitor which is hardware calibrated. The result was quite pleasing, especially as Samsung pushed out the colour balance update to unlocked UK handsets today. There is still that AMOLED vibrancy at play of course, and you can see a touch of this in the above photo. Software Sadly, Samsung's latest only ship with Android 7.0, not 7.1.x. This is a shame, as it would have put the S8 handsets a clear step above the LG G6, which also sadly ships with 7.0. Here's hoping that Samsung are quick to release Android O for it, or at least have a beta channel like they did with Nougat on the S7 edge. Grace UX remains a familiar sight on the S8. The Samsung Experience version jumps from 8.0 on the S7, to 8.1 on the S8. There are refinements throughout, which add up to a more pleasant experience. But all of these changes could have been ported to the S7 also, Samsung just chose not to. Things like mapping the volume button so that it changes the media volume instead of ringtone volume, and having full music controls, with album art, on the lockscreen. Other changes include Smart Capture via the Edge Panel feature. This allows you to capture areas of the screen as shapes, or create gifs from videos being played. The Galaxy S8 phones could be a MEME creators best friend, then. In a nutshell, Grace UX is elegant and highly polished in its current form. The theme engine is integrated as always, and there are a number of Material/Pixel/Nougat inspired themes and icon packs to give you that stock Android feel, especially if you are using a third party launcher, such as Nova. For reference, all of the screenshots and photos in this review show Nova Launcher, and the themes, Material Design 7.1, and sd_Black. Dark shaded themes work especially well on an AMOLED display, and will typically conserve energy better, as each black pixel on such a display means that there is nothing to illuminate. I found there to be a few instances of micro-stuttering in some apps. However, there does not seem to be any stuttering in Samsung's own apps, or Grace UX itself. This is an issue that affects many other Android phones. It doesn't matter if they are flagships or budget devices. This might be why Google is said to be making its own chipset for future Pixel phones, perhaps even as early as Pixel 2. Following the Apple way by tailoring the software to a specific hardware spec means optimisation is made a whole lot simpler. Bixby Is there an elephant in the room? I'll be honest, I tried Samsung's version of Google Assistant for a day, and then proceeded to disable it. I found it to feel unpolished. For starters, whilst Bixby Vision in the camera app works for recognising images of things you show it, it finds no shopping results for those items. The voice assistant side of Bixby has only been released in Korea so far, with no details yet on a wider release. Bixby is forced on owners. At release, the Bixby button below the volume rocker could be remapped to any other app. Samsung later released an update which blocked this feature. Luckily it was brought back later by a third party. It is amusing because Google Assistant also comes enabled out of the box, and it works flawlessly. Why would I want to spend weeks/months re-training a new digital assistant my usage habits when Google is readily there and works exactly as expected? OK Google, I need a second opinion here... Camera The rear camera sensor is newer than the one on the Galaxy S7, but the specifications remain identical. It goes without saying that from everything that I have seen and tried, the images and performance are also identical. It is in the front facing camera where a couple of changes are seen. The S7 and S7 edge have a 5MP fixed focus lens, whereas the S8 has an 8MP sensor with autofocus. Unlike the LG G6, there is no dual camera lens set-up. Looks like we could be waiting for the Note 8 before we see such a configuration on a Galaxy flagship. The camera app itself has no noticeable design changes over the S7, and as such, makes no use of the extra screen width. The LG G6 allows you to put a thumbnail scroller along the left of the screen when the camera is active in order to allow quick previews of photos already taken. However, with a little help from XDA Forums, it's quite easy to expand the camera app's viewfinder to maximise the use of the wider display. It doesn't add any extra functionality, but does look cooler. For maximum effect, you also might want to set the photo resolution setting to 18.5:9 (7.9MP) if outright resolution isn't desired, since the quality remains the same. Other than this, if you are familiar with the Galaxy S7 rear camera, then there is nothing new to be seen in the S8. Both cameras are superb, especially in low light, so there is nothing to scoff at here. Biometric security The S8 and S8+ boast some advanced forms of biometric authentication for unlocking, and logging into things like Samsung Pass. The Note 7 first introduced iris scanning, and the S8 has an even faster implementation. The scanner registers 200 points on each eye, and is said to be the most secure method of authentication. The blue sensor you see is the iris camera In practice, I found the iris scanner to be so quick in most lighting conditions, that I barely have time to look at the lockscreen before the phone unlocks. Scanning works in complete darkness as well, thanks to the infrared sensor. I didn't bother using the fingerprint sensor on the S8+ due to its awkward placement. It's simply too high up, and too easy to smudge the camera lens. Thankfully the iris scanner is so convenient now, that I use that instead, and pattern/pin unlock fall-back when in strong sunlight. Audio output Samsung claimed that the bundled earphones were "High end AKG" during the S8 launch event. It later transpired that they are merely Samsung buds, just tuned by AKG, and in prettier clothing. Now this makes logical sense, since AKG is a part of Harman, and Samsung own them. Are they any good, though? They certainly look and feel good, and in most regards, this is what matters to the average person the most. They do not look like the usual earphones that get thrown into the box with any new phone purchase. The AKG branding also helps solidify the premium perception, as does the braided cable. I think the key point to be made here is that they are "tuned" by AKG, meaning they've been tweaked to deliver a better sound than basic earphones. Having listened to them, I can confirm that they are indeed better than basic earphones, but by no means are they up to par with actual premium earphones. I've owned a pair of Sennheiser CX300 in the past, and they deliver a richer sound out of the box. The ear tips provided with these earphones didn't provide the most suitable seal around my ear canal though, and this is probably why I didn't find them as great as I probably could have. I did attempt to use the Comply Premium memory foam tps that come with the Jaybird X3, but they were too big for the necks on the S8's earphones. Where I was impressed was with the DAC inside, and how it was able to power a pair of Sennheiser HD650s to loud volumes, at least loud enough to be enjoyable. There was no distortion at max volume, and both ends of the frequency range were nicely presented. This is thanks to the Cirrus Logic CS43130 MasterHIFI Audio DAC used in the Exynos S8 and S8+, a marked upgrade over the S7 edge. Whilst the S8/S8+ output won't beat the ESS Quad DAC found on the LG V20, it is very much a boost to provide a high quality audio experience. Battery life The Galaxy S7 edge has 100 mAh more capacity at 3600mAh, and in my review of that, I noted that 20 hours from a full charge with 4 hours screen on time was what I was seeing. With the S8+, I have been seeing increasing battery life as time goes on. The first couple of days, 18-20 hours per charge with around 4 hours screen on time was the norm. Now that Doze has settled in and learned my app usage pattern, I see around 25 hours per charge with the similar screen on time. This is with the exact same configuration as the S7 edge, same network, the same 104 apps and the same sync settings. Samsung say the Exynos 8895 is more efficient and uses less power than its predecessor, and my experience certainly points to this being true. Using AccuBattery Pro, the accumulated data it has collected has given me the following battery usage: The major plus in favour of the new phones is that Samsung has said the battery will retain 95% of its capacity after two years of regular charging. To put that into perspective, the S7 edge loses 20-25% of its capacity in the same timeframe. After 14 months, my S7 edge now only lasts until the middle of the day before a top up is needed due to the battery draining so fast. AccuBattery pinned the estimated capacity after a year to just over 2600 mAh. If Samsung's claim is true, then this is a huge selling point for the Galaxy S8 and S8+. I will return to this review in a year to let you know what the deal is. So far, no other manufacturer has commented on battery capacity degradation after long term use of their devices. Perhaps this is why the S8 uses Quick Charge 2.0 (9V @ 1.67A) by default, as Samsung's new battery technology to minimise long term capacity degradation might not work so well with the higher variable voltage and current delivery of QC3 or 4. Another big difference compared phones like the HTC 10, is that both S8s support USB Power Delivery. This means that USB Type-C chargers complying with the USB-PD standard, and outputting 5V @ 3A will fast charge the S8 and S8+. Power efficiency also seems very good. I took a day trip to London recently, and had the WiFi hotspot enabled. Total driving time was just shy of 8 hours, with the hotspot active for approximately 7 hours and 30 minutes. The battery was full when I left home, and was at 24% when I returned in the evening. This was inclusive of normal usage throughout the day as well. Conclusion The price might make some shoppers head towards LG's direction, but the Galaxy S8+ proves that you can have a phone with all of the features people could want, yet at the same time, retain a premium look and feel. I am having trouble thinking of another flagship phone that packs in all of the above, and offers those features globally. The Snapdragon vs Exynos differentiation isn't a big issue because they perform so much alike, and pack in the same features. It is not the same as LG's G6, which comes with wireless charging in the USA and Canada, but no HiFi DAC, and then neither of those features in Europe. I like to think of it as an evolved Galaxy S7 edge. Yes, the screen has grown and the battery has shrunk, but the screen to body ratio has improved, as has power efficiency and design. The screen is of course the major highlight. Expand any video to fill the entire display, and you're treated to something no other phone can duplicate. The LG G6 gets close, but it's no cigar next to the S8 or S8+. Ultimately it comes down to individual preference. For me, the seamless flow of the display, especially when watching videos, makes the Galaxy S8+ a winner. Samsung's claim that the battery wll retain 95% of its capacity for two years is also a tantalising prospect if it holds up to be true. The average phone contract is 24 months, and will mean a Galaxy S8/S8+ will still provide nearly new battery life throughout that period, whereas with other phones, you are going to see a noticeable drop in battery life approaching the end of the first year. The glossy back panel is a major fingerprint magnet, and I won't scar your eyeballs with how mine looked before I wiped it down and applied the d-brand leather skin. I was never a huge fan of glossy backs anyway, and wished more manufacturers adopted frosted glass panels like Sony originally did with the Xperia Z5. I have of course noticed some bugs that crop up here and there. The force touch home button sometimes activates even with a gentle touch, and charging stopped entirely, requiring the screen to be turned off, then on again to fix. These may well be software compatibility bugs, as the home button sensitivity is adjustable, and the charging may have halted due to the use of AccuBattery. Preferences aside, I think S8s look more elegant than the LG G6 We as consumers are in a strong position for 2017. There are many flagship phones coming out this year that should also be sporting thin bezels and flowing displays. If anything, they will help drive the price of the Galaxy S8 range down. For now, the Galaxy S8+ stands on its own if you want the best display experience of any phone currently available. It is not perfect, but it is the closest a Galaxy has ever been.   Tags Samsung Galaxy S8 S8plus Android Smartphone Exynos 8895 Review Phone Mobile Microsoft Like Tweet Share Share Report a problem with article Follow @TwitterDev Previous Story Get this Linux Power User Bundle for just $19 via Neowin Deals Next Story Rocket League update 1.34 brings back Neo Tokyo, adds a new Battle-Car and more Related Stories 7 Days: A week of Microsoft money, the wane of Windows phones, and fake 5G Apr 29, 2017 · Hot!

You can share your location with a contact, of course, but there's more to it. You can also create links that share your location, and they come with all the same controls as contact sharing. To create a link, simply set the length of time you want your location shared and pick an app. Choosing a contact simply connects directly to their account, but using the "More" button at the bottom (or the shortcut next to it) creates a link. They're all "maps.app.goo.gl" URLs. You can do whatever you want with the link—email it, share it in a message, even tweet it. I don't know why you would do that, but you can. The links are managed just like connections to contacts. You can deactivate them at any time and view the current status in Maps. Each one is also unique, so you can set different lengths of time for different links. It's a bit similar to the photo sharing links built into Google Photos. Neat, right?

It is now enabled for me. In the UK. The app never updated. Artem Russakovskii Yeah, it's a server side change. Total Insecurity I think you can force it, though. Here in Germany in German language I got it by doing the following: "[On my other phone] it could get activated by signing out and in again. Then you need to press the new widget and it should appear. Maybe try deleting a your cache like I did before as well! All you need to do is: Go to widgets in Android, add and click on the share location widget​." Dirge LOL. No need to jump through hoops. Just clear google map's cache and force stop, then open it again and viola! It is there. Total Insecurity Not everyone made that experience, I think. But you could be right, though. :) Ian Kumlien If you select settings from the three buttons on the right side, you can select which circles to share with but the settings can't be saved apparently demarcmj That is probably a remnant from G+. When I first went to that settings page yesterday, it complained at me that I needed a G+ profile. But today that went away and it's working. I imagine that circle sharing will probably go away entirely. Shaques So if you're sharing via a contact and not a link, that person needs to have Google Maps installed on their device (mainly thinking iOS) for it to work properly otherwise they apparently receive an email. Midas Gordon-Farleigh I think they'll need to be logged into their Google account too, obviously. I have many contacts that I can invite that definitely use Google maps, but haven't logged in - more particularly on iOS where it's not linked to the OS. Morten Ulv Just tested, no need to be logged in. JG Does it work on the web as well? If so iOS (and the few WP users) could access your location via maps.google.com via their web browser of choice without having to install Google Maps app... bulletmark Location sharing in the G+ app was poorly implemented and the web view was hopeless. This new native implementation in Maps seems to work great though, both on mobile and the web. F4LL0U7 Yeah even Latitude wasn't implemented so well. Let's hope this is something they stick with, and don't abandon it like they tend to do. demarcmj Agree, but Latitude was at least implemented better than G+ Rod Just got it. (Brazil) http://i.imgur.com/T13JaqD.png Carson Saldanha Before us US folks? Unacceptable! /s Rod Haters gonna hate. Dirge I'm in the US and I got it around Noon, Pacific Time. René Simonsen Would like to know how it works on the receiving end. Is that part integrated into Google Maps too? Can I share my location with an iOS user, and will he easily keep track of my location in his Google Maps app? ericshmerick iOS works as well, appeared on my iPhone a few hours ago. Should be platform independent as it's using Google's services/account to communicate. Giampi Working very well. I would like a persistent notification when sharing although. F4LL0U7 The option to have it would be good. They have that in Trusted Contacts. But for those of us who share indefinitely with a spouse, that would get annoying, so it would be good to be able to turn it off. Jennifercalvarez Google is paying 97$ per hour!

Jurij Turnšek Can you comment on battery drain when sharing location constantly? F4LL0U7 My wife and I have been sharing our locations with each other constantly since the feature launched, and we haven't noticed any impact on battery life. I don't think it's using any more power than usual. Your phone determines your exact location on a pretty regular basis anyway, assuming you have that enabled. All this feature is doing is taking that info that Google already knows, and sharing it with people of your choice. tofuuu630 After a month in, can you comment on the battery life? I tried it for a day but noticing my battery dropped faster than normal. But then again I'm not sure if it was placebo effect or due to the app's I downloaded around that time. Thanks! F4LL0U7 No noticeable difference in battery life whatsoever. I'm still at 20-30% by end of day. See my comment above. It's not using any extra resources, unless you didn't have location services always enabled anyway. tofuuu630 Thanks for the fast response! Yeah I figured it shouldn't use more battery since google now always knows where you are near as long as you have location services set to high accuracy (which I do) so maybe it's placebo effect that I'm experiencing. Will test it for a longer period and see! F4LL0U7 And also, if you happen to be using your phone a lot more that day due to new apps and features, your battery obviously won't last as long. I'd say give it a week of normal use to give you a better idea. tofuuu630 I left the feature on overnight and now while on my commute to work and noticed the following: while overnight and at home (wifi), my phone drained 2% in 8 hours, but when I was on my commute which is around an hour (and on LTE), my phone drained 4%. Both of these situations my phone would be left idle and I didn't use my phone at all during the commute. What was your battery life when you had this feature on and moving around while on data? F4LL0U7 Well, staying in one physical location while on wifi will drain your battery far less than moving and on LTE. Even if you're not technically using your phone on your commute, your phone's cell connection is still being handed off from tower to tower as you pass them. It's constantly searching for signal, which uses way more battery than staying in one spot on one stable connection. Also, just something else to consider. If your phone started off at 100% in both instances, and you observed it at 98% and 96% respectively, those numbers aren't exactly accurate. When your phone charges to "100%", it doesn't technically stay there. To protect the life of modern batteries, your charger will allow periodic discharges and trickle recharges towards the top capacity of the battery. However, when you take it off the charger, it will still appear at 100% regardless of where it is in that dis/recharge cycle (so consumers don't think there's something wrong with their device). Once the charge level updates to its actual level, you may see it drop lower than you'd expect. I personally don't keep that close an eye on my battery level. My phone comes off the charger at 6:30am, it charges in my car for about 20 minutes while I drive to work, then it sits on my desk all day on LTE, charges in my car for another 20 minutes on my way home, and then it's off the charger at home on wifi until 11pm or so, at which point I charge it for the night. At the end of the night, the level is anywhere between 15-30% depending on how much I've used it. If you're worried about battery life, I'd say location sharing via Google Maps is probably one of your lowest concerns. If you're looking to optimize your battery, I'd say go through your apps and see which ones are syncing in the background and pulling your phone out of Doze mode. Try using Swipe instead of Facebook. Try keeping your brightness on auto. Delete apps you rarely use, and use their mobile websites in Chrome instead. Don't use live wallpaper or widgets. Those kinds of things. The worst enemies of battery life are crappy apps that (intentionally or accidentally) remain active when they don't need to be. tofuuu630 Yeah you are exactly right! I should have mentioned before hand that I don't fully charge my phone to 100% either. I just plug it in when I need to and unplug when I don't. So when I left home, my phone was at 83% and 79% when I got to work. I should have also mentioned that previously before I had this feature enabled the drain would have only been at most 2% while idle in my pocket on my commute to work. I am not trying to refute your claim that this feature doesn't drain battery, I am just curious as to what's causing it (which may very well be other rogue apps) or the new May security patch update. Just wanted to bring my findings here to share :) As for Facebook, I don't use Facebook lol, so I don't have that app. I only have 72 apps on my phone (a lot of it are component apps by Google) and I would say the apps I use the most would be Whatsapp and Instagram (which are both Facebook apps as well I know lol). I really would like to keep this feature on which is why I am troubleshooting to see what may be causing this recent drain! Thanks for all your input! What phone do you use if I may ask? F4LL0U7 No problem! I use a Nexus 5X. Good luck with your troubleshooting, if you figure it out, post it! Benjamin Pavel When this activated they also turned off the G+ location sharing...that sucks as I've had my mother and my cousin on there and it seems these shared locations are not transitioning to this new system which sucks! Biff Wonsley Yeah, you're gonna have to set them up again from scratch. Oddly, my G+ location sharing widget is still working, even though location sharing in my Maps is live. I know where my wife is, she doesn't know where I am. Even though she's sitting right next to me. F4LL0U7 Sharing via a link is a great idea. Does your location have a persistent link? Like, could my wife and I bookmark each other's locations on our desktops? Or would we have to share to a link and bookmark that? codemonkey85 If it's your wife, why even deal with links if you can share directly through Google accounts? But anyway, the links you generate are persistent, same as Photos sharing links... until they are revoked. F4LL0U7 We are sharing that way, I'm just wondering if there's a permalink directly to the user's location, (if someone is sharing with you) for bookmarking purposes. demarcmj I think I saw something in the video they put out that said sharing via link was limited to a certain duration. Can't be set as "ongoing." JG They're all "maps.app.goo.gl" URLs. You can do whatever you want with the link—email it, share it in a message, even tweet it. I don't know why you would do that, but you can. A food truck might want to tweet a link to their location so fans could come get food... create812 I can imagine some people will come up with clever and creative uses of this feature. mwolverine If my wife and I share location with each other (until we turn it off), will this be a massive battery drain? Rod Yes. GPS + location download/upload Jeroen Kap My guess: no. Your smartphone updates your location by default on standard times. I think this will benefit from that information. Only when you force a refresh in Maps it will gain new location data Rod Sure about that? Because then, it won't be exactly "live" tracking.. KappadeX That (actual battery and GPS use) will be the case when you navigate. And send the ETA link to a friend. I was assuming you meant the daily location sharing. The Pool Man I have this exact question too. demarcmj No more than usual. Your phone doesn't check location any more or less than it normally would. It just shares whatever your most recent location was. The only additional battery implications are the sharing part of it, but that's not a lot of data to transfer. Tomáš Petrík I hope they will add a feature to turn on/off the layer with the contact heads on the map, just like I can turn on/off traffic, satellite, etc. Sure, when I want to check where somebody is, I will enable that and look. But I don't want the icons in the map permanently (from family members who share the location indefinitely). demarcmj Yea that'd be nice. When it was Latitude, they had it implemented as a layer, like satellite or traffic, so it could do just that. HSidhu The sad part is that you have to turn on location history. groid Is location history required to be able to use this? I know you are asked to turn it on when setting up the sharing, but does it have to stay on? I really don't want to keep location history on and I have no use for timeline or any other location history feature. HSidhu I think it should be ON all the time but you should try turning it OFF and see if it still tells you your friend's location. let us know too. Matt Terk My Maps app crashes every time I try to enable Location Sharing, either by link or through the menu. Anyone else experienced this? Wiped cache/davlik, on PureNexus 7.1.1 Shamu, I am in the beta for Maps.

Including speed and location history, it even shows the path they took. It also shows if the person in moving or not. Google might introduce all this in coming days. SSyar i still dont get the sharing option :/ johnforamerica Suddenly it doesn't work on my wife's iphone, and she's not getting a timeline history for the last 3 days either.

Google's "Fuchsia" operating system is taking shape with a new design Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/05/08 10:01am PDTMay 8, 2017 36 Plus 1 on G+ 285 Share on Facebook 93 Share on Twitter Total Shares414 Development Google News We first talked about Fuchsia, a new operating system being developed at Google, back in August (in fact, it was my first post here). At the time, there wasn't much to get excited about besides the potential - it only had a command-line interface. Now the project has a snazzy new, but clearly unfinished, interface. Summary of Fuchsia First, it's worth going over exactly what Fuchsia is, because it's been quite a while since we talked about it. As opposed to all of Google's other OSes, such as Android and Chrome OS, Fuchsia uses the company's new 'Magenta' kernel instead of Linux. According to the project's documentation, Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Magenta's apps and the system interface are written with Google's Flutter SDK, which was initially designed to create cross-platform apps for iOS and Android. Flutter applications are written in Dart, the company's home-grown programming language. All of the system and apps are rendered by 'Escher,' which uses OpenGL or Vulkan to display everything. The 'Armadillo' interface So, on to the new stuff. Fuchsia's system UI has a new name - 'Armadillo.' Ars Technica was able to compile Armadillo into an Android APK, since it is written with the above-mentioned Flutter SDK. The interface doesn't really do anything besides looking pretty, but it does give us an idea of what the finished product could look like. The home screen is a vertical list, with a profile picture, the time, and a battery indicator in the center. Tapping the profile picture brings up something similar to Android's Quick Settings, with toggles for auto-rotate, do not disturb, Airplane Mode, and so on. Above the profile picture is the 'Story,' which the documentation describes as "a set of apps and/or modules that work together for the user to achieve a goal." Currently, this works similarly to Android's Recents screen. Users will also be able to combine stories into a 'Story Cluster.' This is what dragging a Story card into split-screen looks like. Dragging a Story card onto another one triggers a split-screen mode. The user can split an app 50/50 vertically or horizontally, drag in another app for a 33/33/33 split, or even have a tab bar appear for using all the open apps in full-screen. You can even have two apps split vertically next to two other split apps, seen below. This is far more flexible than Android's current multi-tasking functionality, but whether or not it will stay this way is uncertain. Below the profile picture is a panel resembling Google Now, with a placeholder search bar and suggestion cards. Armadillo's documentation says, "a suggestion is a representation of an action the user can take to augment an existing story or to start a new one. [The] suggestion contains enough information to create the visual representation of that concept." So maybe they will work more like an app launcher? It's hard to tell at this point. The Google Now panel, showing Fuchsia's keyboard. Keep in mind that all of this is subject to change, as the Armadillo interface (and the rest of Fuchsia OS) is still under heavy development. It's also hard to tell what Google's plans are for the operating system. Will it be neglected to Internet-of-Things devices and other basic hardware, or will it some day replace Android altogether? We'll have to wait and see.

Suicide_Note Because Google can. Corbin Davenport Ron from Ars Technica put it best: "Fuchsia really seems like a project that asks 'how would we design Android today, if we could start over?' It's a brand-new, Google-developed kernel running a brand-new, Google-developed SDK that uses a brand-new, Google-developed programming language and it's all geared to run Google's Material Design interface as quickly as possible. Google gets to dump Linux and the GPL, it can dump Java and the problems it caused with Oracle, and Google can basically insulate itself from all of Android's upstream projects and bring all the development in-house. Doing such a thing on the scale of Android today would be a massive project." makapav Would it still be open source? Also, what would happen to all the existing APKs? Corbin Davenport Fuchisa is completely open source right now. As for running Android apps, maybe Google will add some kind of stop-gap compatibility layer for running Android apps, like Chrome OS has. destinyhud read the article Suicide_Note Perhaps instead of replacing Android, this will *become* Android, as in Android P or Q? Or be the merger of Android/Chrome? m477 I could see that as Android 10. Definitely too early for P. morteum I wonder if the reason it is called "Armadillo" is because they're starting from A again, but this time they're using animals instead of desserts. Christopher Bement I think it's a smart plan, based on the guess that there's more animals to pick from in the world than tasty desserts. teolinux Ubuntu docet Paul "Tasty treats," not necessarily desserts. That said, armadillos could be a tasty treat. I won't judge. MJ I have heard desserts and candy used before which are wrong but "tasty treats" is a new one for me. To be more accurate, Android names are actually all confectionery foods. A "tasty treat" could be a slice of pizza (aka Android S). LOL Randy Gindy Armadillo is the name of the UI not the OS build itself. Matt74UK Smooth on the inside, crunchy on the outside. Armadillo ! (a few UK people of a certain age may get that). Russell Brown That bloke's a nutter... Edit: nope, that was Dime Bar. :( Nomaan Shouldnt we compare armadillo to holo/material and not to dessert names? Or am i missing something. morteum I don't think so, those are design languages and while this is a redesign of layout and function, it is still pretty much using Material Design. I could be wrong but I don't think this is closer to a build version. John Doe Idk this is a whole new OS with a new kernel, I doubt this will be done with an OTA update for Android. Mantas Pakėnas Even nowadays, some of Android's new functionality cannot be done via OTA updates (like dual system partitions, forced encryption I believe, etc). To make a completely hard cut sometime when this is ready, and if it's meant to replace Android, is not completely unimaginable. As is updating via OTA. If apple was able to change their file system via OTA, I don't see why changing most of the parts would not be possible. However, nobody aside from Google would do it, almost guaranteed :) Suicide_Note It could likely be done for Pixel devices, and possibly for future devices released after this new version of the OS rolls out. Adrian Meredith quite possibly, after all there no reason it couldn't also run android apps jonathan What they need to do is make this googles very own os for their pixel line and leave android for the oems Suicide_Note Not a chance. To much name recognition with Android for Google to drop it in favor of something else specific to the Pixel lineup. Dallas King Android Z confirmed! Suicide_Note More like Android A for Armadillo. m477 APK plz (no, really, I want a compiled apk the demo) Maxwell “Max” Weinbach https://github.com/fuchsia-mirror/sysui MJ Your link wasn't what the OP asked for... Maxwell “Max” Weinbach the only way to get the APK is to compile it yourself, so I linked to the Github page to a place to download the files to compile. The closest they will get. MJ Than you should have replied there is no known APK or not at all. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach It does not matter that much. I am building the APK right now. Once it is done I will post it. Here is the link on how to compile it. http://www.hotfixit.net/single-post/2017/05/03/How-to-build-Armadillo MJ Don't waste your time... They updated that article with an download of the APK. Maxwell “Max” Weinbach thanks. they just did that. I still compiled it myself though. I will try to get more out of it while I have the Sysui downloaded.

No thank you, we already had enough with this Pixel crud. I hope this OS dies quicker or become a chromebook OS. m477 It's open source. Latex beats nudity It's OSS but just like Android It'll be more heavily dependent on the google APIs to make it work. Look at the Pixel SysUI, Just being OSS doesn't make it open source... It's Google's OS not a Linux Based one. If this is going to replace Android It's doomsday on multiple levels. destinyhud billions of people dont care if its running linux kernel or not. maybe very few like u might. do iphone users care why kernel it runs. none of them care. u r just noise tbh Latex beats nudity Billions of people don't code. You are being a kool-aid joke tbh. destinyhud exaclt only few code and even on that few many dont care if it runs linux or not. look at iphone there are more dev there and yet they dont care for kernel. u r delusional in ur own world m477 Android it's already been on a Google-dependent road for years. I don't think this is going to change either way. An Angry Chihuahua https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/magenta/+/master/docs/getting_started.md heres the source code. do some research my dude WitnessG Imagining this running on a Google made processor is exciting. Badouken If this was the OS for the Pixel 2 alongside a Google made processor I think id cry! WitnessG Yeah I don't see this coming out for at least another 2-3 years. Badouken Indeed, but we can dream! ha Suicide_Note Maybe the Pixel 3 or 4 will see the dream become reality. Suicide_Note I'm betting this is what we'll see in a couple years time. As another commenter stated, starting with Armadillo could be Google's way of starting from the beginning (letter A codename), since there's more animal babes to use for each letter than there are dessert names to use.

Nomaan Armadillo should be compared to holo/material and not to dessert names. nachofrand What makes you think Google would be good at making SoCs? They're a software company and don't have the hardware expertise for hardcore ASIC development like that. Granted they can hire people, but in the end, does it matter? They're going to use ARM either way. UnlikeABoss Google fanboyism. The same reason he's excited over a brand new OS. He knows absolutely nothing about it, short of the fact that it will create more fragmentation not only in the OS space, but also the kernel space. So all we know are negative things so far. This is what we call exciting now is it? Why? Just because Google is doing it? If Microsoft made this exact same announcement, would we all be excited? Oh dear. Zsolt V No, because essentially everybody loathes Microsoft. Almost nobody's life would be worse if Microsoft vanished. marcusmarcus2 Don't they design and build their own servers to use for all their websites? Seems like those hardware work well for them. Sergii Pylypenko It's one thing to assemble the server using off-the-shelf components, or even to order a custom motherboard. It's a very different thing to design and manufacture your own chips. marcusmarcus2 I'm not saying it is the same, just that they are not only software experts. Them designing and building the servers show they do have hardware expertise that could assist them in doing the same to chips. Zsolt V Except Google's servers are not assembled from off the shelf components. Haven't been for a few years now. Roy What about TPU? Owais Lone They DO design their own chips as well especially chips meant to run specialized AI (tensoflow) code Adrian Vovk Samsung Exynos devices are faster than Snapdragon, iPhones seem underpowered but are extremely snappy, etc. The point is that making both the software and hardware leads to a very fast ecosystem. Also, Google are making the TPU for neural networks nachofrand Yes, as expected. Exynos is faster than Snapdragon on the Galaxy phones, but put an Exynos in another phone...oh wait, you can't. That's the whole entire point. Snapdragon SoCs are general purpose SoCs and can be used for a multitude of phones so they're not custom tuned to every phone individually. Exynos have very specific power rails and the chip is made specifically for that phone. The thing is, sure this is better, but it's marginal and hardly worth talking about. They both use the same ARM architecture so performance gains are pretty negligible. Besides that, this is how Samsung makes money....off of device sales. Google doesn't make money that way. That isn't their business model so at this point it doesn't make sense for them to build their own SoCs when they could just work closer with hardware companies. They make their own TPUs because it aligns with their business model. Adrian Vovk The instruction set doesn't really matter? I can have a 6700k and a 6500k and the 6700k will perform much better even though they are both amd64. With what Google is doing with the Pixels (still as snappy as day one here) I'm pretty sure they can optimize it further than Samsung does. They have made it run smoother in some cases on a chip that they didn't manufacture. If they made their own chip it would allow them many freedoms that they otherwise don't have = easier design of the device. I brought up the TPUs because that is experience in chip manufacturing Jason What makes you say iPhones are under powered ? Apples chips are some of the fastest around and are extremely powerful. Adrian Vovk Specs wise. They have much worse specs on paper and it would lead to a slower experience, except Apple can optimize it because they make both the chip and the OS SHunter On their Own hardware running their software in their own eco system. You cant really fairly compare it to anything else. Stephen Sharp They could use Risc-V and have to pay to license absolutely nothing, while being able to make processors purpose built for their OS Randy Gindy That would be an interesting move. Stephen Sharp Indeed, I really want Risc-V to succeed as an open ISA nachofrand They could. But in my opinion, it's unlikely. Google isn't trying to compete with Samsung and Apple in device sales and that isn't their business model. People using their services so they can show ads is their business model. It doesn't make sense for Google to make their own SoC when others are already doing a good job. Plus, if they went to RISC-V then what? What about the modem? They have to buy a standalone modem from Qualcomm or Intel. Now you have to hire system integration and test engineers to make sure the modem is working with your SoC. Oh and then you need a whole firmware team to control the modem. At that point, buy a full blown SoC with the modem on chip. Stephen Sharp Eh you lost me at "Pixel phone" and all the other hardware they sell. Google also is a Platinum member of the Risc-V foundation, and if there is a direction they are going, more control or less control, I would guess it's "more". But that's just a guess nachofrand Hardware isn't even close to the same thing as asic development. IC design is a different world. Granted they do some custom hardware, but SoCs are a much much larger feat. It's still a possibility they do so, but it doesn't make sense with their current business model imo. Randy Gindy He said nothing about ASIC he is talking about RISC-V Randy Gindy I disagree with you completely. They are penetrating the IoT market, auto market, healthcare, phones, robotics, self driving, networking, etc. Them making in house chips could really benefit every project they have. Also building an OS from the ground up to work with in house chips would be smart. Look at Apple as an example. They also may let manufacturers to use the designs. If Android One isn't evidence for them to want to standardize their platforms I don't know what is. Captain On! 1 - Google has stated that they're going to make their own silicon for the Pixels in time. 2 - Google actually owns/operates the world's most powerful quantum computer. They know how to make chips. Randy Gindy That quantum computer was built by DWave though Angel I read (somewhere don’t remember) that they have three different quantum computers systems. One from DWave and two home-produced. From those two, one was made by engineers and not that disimilar from DWave in its operations. The other was made by physicists and uses a different approach. nachofrand 1. I could be wrong, but I've only read that they plan on working closer with chip manufacturers. 2. Google didn't make that computer. Even if they did, quantum is so different those skills don't even translate. Romario Maxwell Google made their own custom ASIC called the Tensor Processing Unit (TPU) for their AI/Machine Learning needs on their cloud platform. See https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2016/05/Google-supercharges-machine-learning-tasks-with-custom-chip.html and https://cloudplatform.googleblog.com/2017/04/quantifying-the-performance-of-the-TPU-our-first-machine-learning-chip.html nachofrand Sure, although a TPU is just an accelerator. Think of it as the hexagon DSP inside of the Snapdragon SoC. That's like 1/10 of the entire chip. SoC design is much larger. Timothy Vreeland How many examples of hardware design do people have to point out before you stop? Sure the hardware they worked on previously isn't exactly the same... But before they started the hardware they are currently working on, they worked on previous hardware that wasn't the same as what they are doing now. They have shown they are competent in designing many kinds of hardware. Or do you suggest a company can only build one kind of hardware and nothing else for all eternity? How did Samsung make it's current in-house chips? Did they go to ARM college? Have they been making ARM chips since the dawn of time? No. They put together some teams and got to work, so stop blabbing and being negative. sweenish Their AI that finally beat the world's top Go players was running on custom Google chips. It's not like they don't know how. theProffer They have enough liquid assets to do whatever they want, abandon it, and then do it again without even noticing they spent the money. (Which is actually the source of a few of their problems, I think.) Matt Is that why they gave up on fiber? Pixelexel Imagine a Google Pixel with a Google made processor, with Fuschia, with Project Fi with Google WiFi powered by Google fiber. If I'd have this, my life would be complete. Owais Lone and all our data with it :( needa At least it is only one company getting it. Iamsecond Ha, no. A Google processor? Supported for 18 months, then replaced with a new processor that performs half as well (but has stickers.) Does not fully process Android code, because at Google one hand doesn't even know the other hand is there, let alone talk to it. Has 20 cores (only 2 enabled outside US for 'reasons.') Has a dedicated co-processor to enable ads in every app, even those that previously didn't have them. the.cyber.trekker I spit my coffee out on my monitor reading this!! ROFLMFAO! Jason Google can't even get a phone out the door without issues and you want them to make the chips too...lol. I'll pass. UnlikeABoss "In house kernel instead of Linux". Yeah, hopefully this dies in a thousand pits of fire. "Hey Linux guys, you know how you've helped us make billions over the years with a free open source kernel? Well, we were just using you to get the "nerd" userbase. Now we own the market thanks to you guys promoting its use of Linux, we will gradually phase you out." .... m477 I hope not. Linux is not really a kernel made with smartphone in minds. I don't care for being a fan of a kernel over another. UnlikeABoss Yeah. I'd much rather use a brand new untested kernel (and all the teething issues that will come with it) in my smartphone than a mature, stable one that's hacked on by hundreds and thousands of people every month. I mean, it's just a smartphone, we don't need it to be a secure environment, right? Let's just make a nice obscure kernel that no one else will use, and just say "but but it's open source!!! love us because we are Google kk". ... ihsan ışık I'm sorry but it just looks like you are a huge Linux fan and are just against change to me. UnlikeABoss Looks can be deceiving. If you're going to fling around the Linux fanboy term, i'll fling around the Google fanboy term, and that will surely be a nice constructive argument that we will both want to continue. m477 So, in 10 years we should still be using an unoptimised kernel like Linux, because anything newer is, well, newer? UnlikeABoss Yeah, because Linux hasn't changed at all in 10 years... m477 Yes, it changed a lot, and it still has many of the same problems, which are intrinsically bound to its structure. It's not a kernel well suited for mobile devices. UnlikeABoss You think the solution is to throw it out the window and start from scratch? I disagree. I'd much rather continue improving the Linux kernel, simply because of all the eyes it will always have on its code. jonathan Play nice ladies lol m477 With this mentality we wouldn't have Linux at all. Why start anything, while we can continue this other thing which purpose was completely different? A mircokenel is more well suited than a monolitic kernel to a mobile devices, both in terms of performance and security. No matter how much you improve Linux, it will never be a microkernel. UnlikeABoss Smartphones don't need a micro kernel in 2017. You could make that argument 7 years ago. Linux can be compiled with the required drivers just like it always could. m477 I made that argument 7 years ago. They always needed something different from Linux. The fact that specific, even proprietary drivers have to be integrated in the kernel (since Android lacks an abstraction layer) is on of the problems of the interaction Android-Linux. destinyhud why havent the nerds made linux on pc's a bigger market share if they were the one who made android a global leader UnlikeABoss No nerd is promoting Linux on the desktop. All social media used to be full of people promoting Android over iOS, these days there's no need to. destinyhud why havent they promoted desktop?? just wondering why they did for android but not for desktop.. linux on desktop was an underdog for decades. android was not popular because of kernal. android became popular because it was opensource and was the only viable competition to ios. people dont care what kernel it runs. UnlikeABoss No nerd worth their salt would promote an environment that would be a downgrade from Windows. Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time, it had a very equal playing field. There's a difference between promoting a good solid FOSS kernel where possible, and promoting an agenda. m477 Android was not a downgrade from iOS at any point in time By this, I get that you never used Android and iOS side by side in 2009-10. UnlikeABoss You clearly value different things. The hackability alone made it an upgrade through its lifetime. m477 The same can be said for GNU/Linux on desktop. UnlikeABoss No it can't, because hackability =/= app availability. i.e. The hackability on Linux desktop doesn't make it win over it's lack of apps, where that isn't an issue on Android. m477 App availability was horrible in the early days, compared to iOS. Even Symbian had more apps. UnlikeABoss That was fine since the early days didn't consist of using your smartphone for very much, due to under powered hardware. Techies didn't go around saying "use iOS because we can all take selfies and stick filters on it". m477 iOS devices didn't have front cameras until mid 2010. The system was better, faster, smoother, the interface was coesive, there were many more apps, and the jailbreak community, to address the techie audience you like to go on about so much, was very, very good. There were tweaks and modifications that even the wildest Android custom ROM didn't have at the time. Android was objectively a downgrade, as much as Linux was on desktop. UnlikeABoss Calling jailbraik an advantage over a FOSS OS is pretty hilarious. iOS wasn't popular because it was better, it was popular because of the amount of people getting their advice from paid employees in store. "Buy iOS so we get a commission". m477 iPhone was more popular for various reasons: marketing, having 2 years of advantage, and, yes, more marketing. But it was also better than Android, as an OS. What benefit did Android bring, with it being opensource, compared to iOS, even to a "techie"? The dev community was laughable in the early days. Why GNU/Linux on desktop was not promoted by "techies" (which is false) and Android was, even if their shortcomings were identical? destinyhud u live in a dream world. even most dev dont care about kernel. what they care about the dev platform. I am a dev and i dont care for the kernel UnlikeABoss If you're talking from the perspective of an app developer then ofcourse you don't care about the kernel, you care about which platform will make you the most money... destinyhud exactly. no one care what kernel it runs.. all dev care is what platform make money. so who is this nerd who care about kernel if most dont care about the kernel.. yeah very very few.. infact rare like u UnlikeABoss Techie == Technology Enthusiast. You can sit here and tell me that you would use the best dev environment all you want but the truth is if the iOS dev environment was awful you'd still suck it up and use it to make your money. I'm not sure how you can class yourself as an enthusiast at that point. destinyhud ever wonder why no one is up voting u and upvoting many of my comments? because what u say is BS. its that simple. I am up for ditching outdated linux if the new kernal is modern and build for modern devices. most dont care for this very few techies.. i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die.. UnlikeABoss "Ever wonder why Google fanboys upvote pro Google content and not anti-Google content?" No, no I don't wonder that. How dare someone critique a pointless change by Google, causing unnecessary fragmentation. Burn them! destinyhud u must be new here.. look at anti google comments here when they make stupid changes but if they make welcome changes people tend to agree UnlikeABoss No, I've been here a long time and made many anti-Google comments as well as pro-Google. No one in the right mind would cheer on kernel fragmentation other than those that think Google can do no wrong. destinyhud open up ur comments history and let me see if u made pro google comments. i have a feeling u r a troll UnlikeABoss Yeah, this discussion is going no where. You are not the authority here and the idea that you want to browse my history to make sure I fall in line is creepy as hell. Bye. destinyhud lol i see u dont want to open ur comments history. obvious troll m477 outdated linux i hope this becomes true and linux kernel die Woah, wait a second here. Linux is not outdated, and its death would be terrible for everyone. It's just that it's not the most apt kernel for a mobile device. destinyhud maybe not outdated but not the right fit for mobile devices. destinyhud android sucked when compared to ios.. it was a downgrade compared to ios. why did dev promote android and not desktop linux? u reasoning dont even make sense. UnlikeABoss No, it wasn't a downgrade. destinyhud yes, it was back in android initial release. iOS was better and much more polished at that time. but things changed now. UnlikeABoss "Polished" is not a factor that is used to judge a better OS. There are Linux environments that are much more polished than Windows 10, but that doesn't make desktop Linux better. destinyhud it was both polished and runs better than android at that time. polished was not the only one. it was also polished. android only got better later.. i have used android at that time and it sucked big time. UnlikeABoss You are using today's standards to judge it. If you do that, they both sucked. It worked perfectly fine for the basic things people were using it for at the time. destinyhud they both sucked at that time but android sucked more than iOS at that time. SVem26 I like to think I am in the nerd userbase and I don't care what kernel is used.. can you help me understand why it matters? UnlikeABoss Do you want a brand new obscure kernel in thing that holds most of your sensitive details? TipTop I don't want something that dates back to 90s, is full of zero-days and horrible code contributed by nobodies. UnlikeABoss The idea that it is full of zero days is hilarious. You do realize that the majority of Linux exploits are local, right? Unlike Windows. Yes there is obviously code from the 90s, but very, very little of it. Not to mention that age is not a factor in deciding bad code. The idea that old code is bad code shows your inexperience. By that standard, should we dismiss Chrome because of all the exploits being found in code that was written when it first started? Are we going to create brand new software every few years to purge "old code"? Do you have any idea whatsoever how much Linux has actually changed? Do you have any idea how much of this change is because it's considered a "universal" kernel everyone can use and is focusing on? Do you really think splitting the community over onto another kernel will increase security for either of those kernels? There's a little something called code maturity. There's a reason Microsoft has way less exploits in its kernel today than 10 years ago. They didn't write a new kernel from scratch. TipTop But it is. You can be in denial all you want. Linux is the OS that is used by botnets for DDoSing websites not Windows. UnlikeABoss No sorry, come back to reality. Botnets consist of all types of OS, including Linux ofc. It is not the majority of bots in a botnet, that statement alone shows how clueless you are. Also, do you understand what Linux is? It's a kernel. The majority of Linux hosts in a botnet have been hacked through exploits in outdated software, not the kernel. The same cannot be said for Windows. Again, read the statistics for the severity of Linux exploits versus Windows. More exploits are found in Linux overall because it is open source, however, that doesn't make it worse. More critical and high severity exploits are found in Windows. That speaks a lot for the secure design of Linux. Hopefully you'll do some reading and learn. Sir_Brizz All OSes are full of vulnerabilities and horrible code written by nobodies. If that is your requirement then you must have gone full luddite by now. TipTop Windows is written by paid professionals and has QA/QC. Linux is written by fat nerds for free and has no quality control but nice try. Don't gve me the top contributors crap. Sir_Brizz Yes, tell me again how many zero day vulnerabilities are found in Windows and how long they take to get fixed. Even worse, tell me that with macOS. Being paid doesn't guarantee quality, just as being unpaid doesn't guarantee garbage. Windows and macOS have some of the crappiest insecure code. And there is nothing special about having QA or being paid to write code. Some of the worst programmers I have ever met worked at places like Microsoft and Apple. https://mobile.twitter.com/taviso/status/860681252034142208 Please continue trying to tell me how infallible paid programmers are! UnlikeABoss They are totally da bestest eva! UnlikeABoss Obviously paid products will always be better than unpaid products... right!?!? /s Oh wait we have tons of real life examples of free products being better than paid, shocking how that works. It's almost as if the best products are made by the most passionate people, and like, being paid doesn't guarantee being passionate about your creation. What a crazy crazy world! ihsan ışık Are you implying that Android got popular because of "nerds" who heard it uses the Linux kernel? UnlikeABoss If you are old enough to know the early days of android you'll know that having every single nerd on the internet promoting Android over iOS most certainly helped get the ball rolling. Once it was pushed, it snowballed into what it is today. m477 Sure. It was the nerds on the internet, not the manufacturers with ads everywhere. Most people still don't know their Galaxy runs Android. UnlikeABoss The giant billboards came YEARS afterwards, cmon. m477 Yes, and that's why Android was so unpopular in the early days. UnlikeABoss What? It was massively popular among all techies for being the open source iOS alternative. m477 You are overestimating the "techies" crowd. Even BlackBerryOS was more popular at the time. Only after the Galaxy S it started to grow, and became popular among normal people. UnlikeABoss Not really. We are talking over a decade ago now, there were far less people on the internet and it was far easier for techies to promote products because everyone was asking their "techie" friend what is best. But these days everyone is an "expert" so that's not as much of a thing. m477 Again, you overestimate how many techies there actually were. Your personal experience is anecdotal. Market shares and sell data are objective. Also, over a decade ago Android was still a camera os, and it wasn't public. UnlikeABoss No, I do not. The further back in time you go, the higher the proportion of techies there were using the internet versus others. People were only just starting to look at buying a smartphone, and asking techies what they should buy. m477 Yes, the concentration on the internet of "techies" on the internet was greater. And? What normal user at the time went to the internet, looked at reviews and said "Oh, look! The HTC magic has Linux! This random guy says its good, so I'm gonna buy it!"? You really think that a bunch of "techies">marketing? A guy saying that his toy-looking HTC G1 is better than the iPhone is more effective than billboards and tv ads? Come on, even Windows Mobile was more popular. It took Samsung's aggressive marketing to make Android popular. UnlikeABoss Windows Mobile and BlackBerry were more popular in the enterprise, that's it. The entire discussion is home users. Also I think there's been some confusion. I wasn't implying that techies on the internet were promoting Android on the internet like a marketing department. I was implying that the internet was very much a "social media" platform for techies to communicate where the majority of them would use Android and mocked the use of iOS. The actual "marketing" happened offline when a normal user would ask their "techie" friend for first time buying advice. It is nothing like that today, and the internet is nothing like the techie community it once was. m477 So, what you're saying is that the internet was a circlejerk of Android users. Ok, and? It didn't affected normal users the slightest, iOS was still more popular until Samsung took Android more seriously. The techie friend thing its only your anecdotal experience, it bears no influence on the market, in the grand scheme of things. I'd even argue that Google's very light marketing did much, much more. Also, the mindless techies that recommended half backed devices instead of better alternatives because "Uh, Linux!!" did more harm than good, both to the users and to Android. UnlikeABoss If you read my OP you'll see my original point was that Google has rode the "Android circlejerk" to popularity, and you can debate how much popularity that added as much as you want. The fact remains, it got the ball rolling. Samsung didn't pick it up "just because", it saw that a lot of people were pushing it. There were several OS at the time it could have used, including sticking to its own. Why bother with Android? Maybe because it wanted to see how much market it could take by appealing to techies? However, if you stand back and look at it, how is this any different from "embrace, extend, extinguish"? Google used that "free marketing" and has now decided to use it's massive popularity to push a different product. (Which has failed in the past and will hopefully fail again). Why hate Microsoft for doing that in the past, but we praise Google for doing it? Why are we excited for something we know nothing about that is creating fragmentation? m477 Samsung had used several OSes, it had Windows Mobile and Phone devices, Symbian devices, and proprietary devices, even Palm OS devices IIRC. They used them all. Android had was the easiest to personalise for them, and create a copy of the best selling product, which was the iPhone, and there was an app market, so they tried to release and market their flagship with it, and market it as broadly as Apple. The first Galaxy (the "non S") was was vastly ignored, because it was as little marketed as all their other devices. The techies crowd was insignificant. The free marketing is just as much as Windows 10 gets for incorporating Ubuntu's bash terminal. What you saw is not really important. I saw lots and lots of Windows Phones in 2010 and 11. Many more than Android devices. Every one I knew had one, and if I had to say which OS was the most popular only based on my personal experience, in my smallish city, I'd obviously would say Windows Phone. Why are you so attached to Linux, excluding all possibilities of giving a possibly better solution a try? The community will just fork the AOSP and continue the development of the Linux branch. UnlikeABoss Cmon, we both know Android was not easier for them to customize than simply using their own OS. No one was recommending it, techie or not, no matter how much they marketed. It's only now they are popular they are trying to slip in their own OS, and still failing. I am not attached to Linux despite people using it as an easy scapegoat to dismiss a discussion critiquing almighty Google. We currently have a situation where most kernel developers focus entirely on Linux, making it virtually the universal kernel. Why are we creating pointless fragmentation there? Why divide that community? Do we honestly believe that a divided community can produce a better kernel, or do we love it because Google is doing it? Would we love it if Microsoft did this? m477 The proprietary OS they used at the time was a Java based thing with a flash interface. Hardly able to compete against iOS. It was easier for them to use the "next Symbian" that they could customise as they wanted, and that also had an app market. If they made, say, Bada, before Android become established and popular, and marketed it as much as they did with their Galaxy S, the market would be very different today. The normal user doesn't care what OS their shiny phone runs, as long as there's facebook. I am a GNU/Linux user since the first half of the 2000s, and I've always critiqued Google for using Linux as a kernel on phones. Linux might be the universal kernel, but smartphones need a more streamlined solution. I don't care if it's Google, the MIT, or Richard Stallman in person to do it. I liked WP8 architecture. Fragmentation is not pointless if it brings benefits to the user. TipTop Nobody cares about your FSF agenda. John Q I think the chief reason Google is not using Linux is that they want a real-time OS (RTOS). Linux is at best a "soft" RTOS, possessing a real-time scheduler but this is still not nearly as real-time as an actual RTOS should be. It would take a very large effort to do that for Linux so it makes sense that Google would want to make their own kernel that they can have full control over. UnlikeABoss Let's ignore the fact that Linux is used in real time car systems for a moment. Could you elaborate on why you think Google would want/need a RTOS on their smartphones? M6 The kernel they're using, 'magenta', is opened source. So who cares if they're using linux or not? Does everyone have to use linux? UnlikeABoss No it doesn't have to be Linux. But who else will use Magenta? Probably no one. So why are we fragmenting the kernel space further? Why would you choose an immature kernel for something as valuable (your data) as your smartphone. Would you trust that? I would much rather developers continue focusing on a single kernel. WesleySmalls But wouldn't Magenta be this single kernel? UnlikeABoss If everyone decided to ditch Linux and focus purely on Magenta as the universal kernel, yes. Will that happen? WesleySmalls Could be, just not overnight. The market was already fairly well developed when Linux arrived in 1991, yet it still managed to become a very, if not the most, important player in the market. It's certainly possible, it will just require proper investment(and neglect of their alternate platforms) and patience to make it work M6 That's some straight up communist shit right there. Let's just work on one thing, because we only need one thing, everything else is redundant! Let's not allow other people to do the same thing in a different way, because competition totally doesn't spur innovation at all. WORPspeed So Andromeda definitely dead or still happening? sleepinlight Pretty sure this IS Andromeda, or at least a part of it. Andromeda was never an official name for anything, it was just the internal project name for some sort of new and/or merged OS. WORPspeed I thought Andromeda specifically referred to merging Android and Chrome OS. So is that specific merger dead or on life-support? John Q Nah, the Android/Chrome merger was just speculation from what Andromeda seemed to be. There was never any concrete evidence to imply that Andromeda was a merger. WORPspeed To quote Androidpolice : "So please, when you see Fuchsia mentioned, or speculation that it "is" Andromeda, know that it is just that: speculation. Last we heard from sources we consider extremely reliable, Android was the basis of Andromeda, and Andromeda would see its commercial debut on a new Pixel laptop later this year. It is possible Google has changed plans around Andromeda, that the initiative itself may have even been scrapped. Though, we have no reason to think so - it's more that we don't know, and haven't heard anything about Andromeda in quite some time." http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ WORPspeed http://www.androidpolice.com/2017/02/15/speculation-around-googles-fuchsia-os-and-andromeda-is-creating-confusion-and-misinformation/ That makes them seem very separate Srujan https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e7fda716dfcfdca76e200e51a9c9144c72e183c7e76d36b910c20ee0931aee79.gif destinyhud if this replaces android rather than having 2 separate codebase, I am all up for it. splitting the android community is dangerous senor_heisenberg Well if this does end up being what replaces Android or what Android evolves into, I just hope my apps and whatnot are compatible. Ain't got the time or money to be investing into another ecosystem. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman That's a tricky, double-edged sword. I can't fathom they would not support the old apps, or at least the vast majority of them, for exactly that reason. But in doing so it will likely be held back at least slightly from what it can/should be. Backward-compatibility tends to hold everything back. What I'd wager is we won't see this until hardware's powerful enough to make emulating the old system in a VM relatively cheap and easy, with back-end Play Store penalties to developers who don't shift to the new app models, and then slow phase-outs in stages of the older functionality and support until the new OS is running exclusively its own setup. senor_heisenberg That sounds good. Randy Gindy I think Google porting the Android Run-time to Chrome OS was to see if they could do it. morteum This is old news, I'm waiting for Fuchsia 2.0 Barracuda. /s marcusmarcus2 What if they aren't going by Animal names in general but by mammal names. I'd skip the Fuchsia 2.0 Bandicoot. It will probably be "Crash" prone. Alfonso Surroca Three operating systems is not nearly enough. We need at least two more announced at I/O.

Suicide_Note There is no update problem. Nexus/Pixels run the latest and greatest. OEMs who mess with the OS give their customers severely delayed updates. pfmiller Nexus and Pixels run the latest and greatest for two years. Nobody would accept this OS update situation if it was on a desktop OS. MJ Thank God it's phones we are talking about and not a desktop PC. marcusmarcus2 That is exactly why Windows XP lasted only a couple years before all computers updated to Windows 7... Seriously though. I'm fine with only getting Android version upgrades phones for 2 years. But they really need to extend out security updates beyond 3 years. Suicide_Note This isn't a desktop OS, not to mention people tend to change phones much more often than their desktops. pfmiller Sure it's not a desktop OS, but no sense pretending that what we have leaves nothing to be desired. And sure people change their phones more often that their desktops, but there's absolutely no reason to change every 2 years. Suicide_Note I change phones at least once a year, and sometimes two or three times. I couldn't imagine going two years or more on the same phone. pfmiller You can do what you look like, but there's absolutely no reason why that would be necessary. Suicide_Note It's only necessary if you want the latest and greatest, which i like to have, because phone tech is still evolving and improving at a good clip. For example, had i skipped the Pixel, I'd still be using my 6P or N6, both of which have cameras that are vastly inferior to that in the Pixel. I've taken some incredible shots with the Pixel, some of which would be literally impossible to duplicate using the camera in the 6P/N6. That alone is reason enough for me to upgrade on a yearly basis. Doby Gillis Which is a problem, Einstein. Suicide_Note Not if you're a Nexus/Pixel owner, Dilbert. Randy Gindy I would generally say there is. Android phones are not supported for nearly as long as an iPhone. The reason being that the chip set manufacturers do not release new drivers. Shelly-Man Vol 2 It's looks pretty neat for a development stage. Rami Well Android has to reach Z someday. In the case, Hello Fuchsia! marcusmarcus2 Those split-screens will be really useful for running of of Google's different messaging apps. Hopefully OS's aren't the new messaging apps of Google.

Neither, this is just a side project many developers use to test and work out the feasability of a variety of things. Android is a very well developed environment, and replacing it whole is simply a no-go. Things will just gradually evolve, as they have already done with Dalvik being replaced by ART, for example. Sir_Brizz I don't think you're wrong, but it would be in Google's best interest to start building a non-JVM runtime that apps can run inside with a native language that Google has 100% full control over like Go or Dart.

Nomaan Is this why Pixels were released in 2016 coz google tested fuchsia and magenta on existing pixels with existing qualcomm drivers and they know they could just update it in 2018 and further without having to worry about qualcomm dropping support? One can dream... yoloswag Inspired by the messaging team, Google wants to start working on a 2nd operating system. Darth Vader 3rd* JG Magenta is designed for "modern phones and modern personal computers with fast processors, non-trivial amounts of ram with arbitrary peripherals doing open ended computation." Modern personal computers huh? I've been interested in Google packing ChromeOS into a LiveCD type set up we could test/install on our own computers... (*Yes, I know of Chromium, haven't tried it yet... But I would prefer it coming direct from Google, faster updates and all that). It could be interesting to try out another of Google's OSs without having to fork over several hundred for new hardware... The only problem would be drivers to support the various hardware. If not modified too much, ChromeOS could possibly use the original Gentoo Linux drivers. But with Fuchsia using its own unique kernel... That might throw things off a bit... I know a few less tech-savey individuals who would probably be more comfortable if the same OS powered their phone, tablet and desktop (should Google opt to replace Android with Fuchsia). Especially if it could run both Android apps and Chrome extensions natively.

The Google Play Music App Has Been Wiping Downloaded / Cached Music Stored On SD Cards, Google Is Fixing It David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2015/07/07 2:53pm PDTJul 7, 2015 208 Plus 1 on G+ 76 Share on Facebook 118 Share on Twitter Total Shares284 Applications News If you've been wondering of late why exactly your cached and stored-for-offline-playback music in the Google Play Music app is disappearing every time you turn your phone off or reboot it, good news: Google knows that (now). And if you are experiencing that problem, I bet I can guess a feature of your smartphone: it has a microSD slot. And you probably have microSD storage enabled in the Play Music app. We heard from one reader who actually talked with Google Play support about this bug and initially got an extremely unsettling answer. Fortunately, that answer turned out to be wrong. For the sake of not confusing anyone by putting the full wrong statement in the post, allow me to summarize. A Google Play rep told this person that Play Music deleting cached or downloaded music on the microSD card every time it was unmounted or "unplugged" from the phone was a copyright protection feature. (Note: even the first part wasn't right - it also did it if the phone was rebooted or powered off). This person, most likely, then received a supervisorial scolding, because a second reply from Google Play made it obvious the issue was escalated, and the new rep made it clear this behavior is a bug. The reply is lengthy, so if you just want a summary, read on. I want to first apologize for the information we provided to you about the issue with subscription tracks being deleted from the SD card. After reviewing your case details, it looks like the previous agent you spoke with misunderstood the issue that you're reporting. We have taken immediate actions to address this which should prevent a situation like this from happening in the future. Again, I deeply apologize for not accurately understanding the issue you were experiencing and for not providing you with the correct information on the issue. I'd like to first explain how music is stored for offline listening. Music files that are downloaded to a device (phone or tablet) are only downloading a cached version of song's file, not the actual .mp3 file. This is done to help minimize the amount of space that the downloaded music takes up. This is also implemented to curb abuse of the subscription service as the download music is only accessible through the Google Play Music app for that device and account. This means that a user wouldn't be able to download music to an SD card and then take that SD card and use it on a different device as the music is chased to that device and account. With that said, music that has been downloaded for offline listening, either to the internal storage or SD card, should never be deleted without the user initiating the deletion. This is an actual known issue with this service. The good news is that we are aware of this issue and are actively working to get it fixed. Thanks for your effort in submitting those logs earlier, which helped make us aware of this issue.﻿ Essentially, Google Play Music shouldn't ever erase music from the microSD card unless you explicitly tell it to. That it does this is not an intended behavior and has nothing directly to do with copyright, although it does indirectly have a relationship there - more on that in a second. But the short version is if you're experiencing this problem, Google is working on addressing it, (and it sounds like that's probably mostly because our tipster, Michael, reported it to them). This statement does have some technical issues, though. Namely, the rep claims that offline-stored songs from All Access (this is important - versus music in your library) aren't kept as MP3 files when they're selected for downloading. Except he's wrong, because they are - they're just stored in a protected private folder (as a sort of basic DRM) where only Play Music should be allowed to play them (funnily enough, on Samsung devices the stock music player app also seems to be able to play them, though the metadata is stripped and the titles obscured). For songs in your library, there's no protection at all - you have access to those files on the external SD card and, so far as I can tell, they don't get wiped with a reboot or even unmounting the SD card. It's just the All Access stuff that seems affected. Anyway, the takeaway here is that Google is aware that some cached and offline music is disappearing for no reason if you use the external SD card storage in the app, and that they're looking into fixing it. Google has not replied to a request for comment on this story. Thanks: Michael Tags play music sd card not keeping songs play music sd card wiping subscribe ...

And I've 25,000 tracks up there. https://www.reddit.com/r/AndroidQuestions/comments/3c0292/google_play_music_library_appearing_empty/ Lateef Alabi-Oki When will they fix the Chromecast issue where the client only plays songs for one hour or less before stopping? Or am I the only one with this problem? Justin W I experience this with Sonos as well as Chromecast. That sucks, but it doesn't happen if I cast from my PC vs. casting from my phone, so I just change that a little bit. It's almost as if the app is killed, but the app is still active and it just pauses. George Byers So it's a problem with the cast protocol itself? Google Play within the sonos app is a little big messy to use but it certainly never drops out. Justin W Sorry, I should clarify - this only happens when streaming from within the Play Music app. Using the Sonos app or the Sonos desktop player is fine, as is using music.Google.com to cast to the Chromecast. Simon Belmont I wish my Chromecast would load YouTube instead of acting like it will and then just disconnecting. This has been an ongoing problem for weeks now, and a factory reset does nothing. The backdrop home screen also takes ages to load. I had it working correctly for a short period of time and then we briefly lost power and it got messed up again (and yes, I use a surge protector), so I'm beginning to think it's just failing hardware (it's a launch day Chromecast). enoch861 You're able to get it to stream for an hour? Impressive. I'm lucky to be able to get it to stream for more than a song. MattE303 I have problems with streaming to Chromecast from GPM randomly pausing itself or getting "hung" so I need to hit play or restart the song, very annoying. Happens with both my phone Samsung S5 and tablet ('13 Nexus 7) and only when casting to Chromecast, not over bluetooth. enoch861 Issue also occurs on iOS devices. Picaso86 Some of the tracks will skip by themselves and GPM will stop completely. This is me just using my phone over Bluetooth. IT SUCKS!!!! Maleko Yep, highly annoying! HOWEVER I fixed it by creating a Tasker profile that kept the screen on when play music was open, not good for battery and as soon as the screen turns off it eventually stops playing.... Weird as it NEVER happens on bluetooth... A A Ron It happens with my Galaxy Tab S 10.5, but I do not have this problem when using my Note4 Mi6300M I too share this pain Simon Belmont Saw this on Artem's G+ a little while ago. I was like if that's true then FACEPALM X 1000. Glad it's just a bug and that Google is on the case. I do use a device that I cache music to the SD card, but I don't reboot it THAT often. JD This explains the battery hungry nature of GPM since the last few updates. GPM has been keeping the phone awake and really draining the battery when listening and when just sitting in the background. It's also invoking media server. hp420 YUP!!! I killed 1.5gb of my plan as soon as it activated before play music even opened. I watched my network meter cranking away, trying to figure out why all my data was disappearing...checked my network usage monitor and it turns out play music just decided all by itself it needed to start caching my entire library without even being opened!! NOT COOL GOOGLE!!!! You owe me 25% of this month's bill for killing 25% of my data without even being prompted to run, let alone cache anything!!! Mik "Essentially, Google Play Music shouldn't ever erase music from the microSD card unless you explicitly tell it to. ' Or you rented the content, and its now expired .. David Ruddock pray tell, what can you rent on Play Music? mechapathy Everything in All Access is more or less a rental. You pay for it until you no longer want access to the content. Leandro Cassis I almost get a new SD card because 2 of mine 32GB and 64GB wasnt working. WTF google! Austin Spangrud Nope! This issue has been affecting my LG G3. It deletes all of my music files from my SD Card. The ones that I own and are in the cloud. It's done it about 5 times in a 6 month period of time. The SD card keeps all my regular data but just deletes all downloaded music. It could be an LG problem but I think that this goes for both owned and not owned music... jab416171 I recently had a similar problem on my Nexus 6. Instead of deleting cached/offline music, instead the app decided that all of my playlists only had about 10% of the songs they actually had. Wiping the data of the music app did fix this, but it also wiped all my offline music, making me download it all over again. Pain to fix, but it appears to be working alright now. Guest Okay, little off subject, am I the only one who thinks Google Music needs a major UI clean up and overhaul? The now playing screen the biggest mess to me. Look to the picture... I aslo can't stand the new Navigation Drawer, I rather have my music tabs there, then a divider and the top charts, new releases and the other crap. raazman Yes. Guest Yes, I'm the only one or yes in agreement? lol, sorry for the mini rant... raazman Hah, sorry. I meant yes to the picture, I agree! The app is also quite sluggish at times compared to other apps, both Google's and other music apps. icyhotmike I have all access and it only works on 4g. The keyboard doesn't pop up sometime while searching. Shitty prediction services. The UI is years old... So are the bugs. But hey, we got a chromecast fireplace now Also when using "listen for music" and u click the card it brings u to the play store.... If i'm a subscriber why the hell am i gonna pay for a single song? Stupidity. hp420 This is why I don't pay for it anymore. I've submitted sooo many bugs and suggestions and they get ignored every time because the issue tracker has nowhere to post stuff for this app. Google wants money every month, but they apparently hate that they have it because they never want anytging to do with it. Se la vie...there's always pandora patcher, I guess. José Gómez I've had this problem with my Nexus 5 deleting cached music for the past month. Before, it would keep music cached until I deleted it. Now, it seems to wipe it everyday. It's a good thing I have "unlimited" data, because now I end up using 1/2GB of data a day just on Google Music. Before you ask, I don't have Wi-Fi at work. They're archaic like that. Colin Richardson My GF is having the exact same issue (Nexus 5), I was hoping that was what the article was talking about, but it wasn't. But your situation matches it exactly. She has whole albums set to "download/cache", but only 2 or 3 songs from certain albums left, (where once she had the whole album). Hopefully the fix for the Article bug, will also fix the bug you and my GF are having. José Gómez I'm hoping that it's caused by the same bug as well. Sorry your girlfriend is having the same problem. It's very annoying. I didn't discover my phone was doing that until I took a road trip and didn't have any data the entire time and only had a handful of songs to keep me company for 2 days. Very sad! Lula Jardim hopefully they fix this before i go out on vacation! or else i`ll have to switch to another provider ellett A bit of clarification. You said, "Essentially, Google Play Music shouldn't ever erase music from the microSD card unless you explicitly tell it to." There is an exception to this if you have cancelled or allowed your All Access subscription to expire. In that case licensing policy kicks in and all the music that you no longer have rights to should be deleted by Play. Rob rollings Ah, so that's why Google Play Music is eating up all my data hp420 I've been dealing with that for months and google wants nothing to do with reimbusment. They claim that's not their responsibility. REkzkaRZ Was wondering where that MP3 went! So they are working on a bug -- what about people that get their files zapped, do they get compensation? Doode About fuarking time. This has been driving me nuts. About a month or so ago I started noticing that the cache from Play Music dropped from multiple gigabytes to never going above 700 megabytes on my Nexus 5. hp420 What they need to fix is the cache clearing every time I update with play....but it doesn't happen if I sideload the apk. Nicholas Ruiz It used to do this to me all the time. Not a new issue Itchy_Robot Either that, of they were snooping on me and hearing me curse their names because it was deleting my music too! MireilleGDavis 22333Ultra Income source by police . < w­­­w­­­w.­­­­N­e­t­C­a­s­h­­­9­­.­­­C­­­o­­­m Dimitris Kanellopoulos Had this issue exactly. Went on a 4 month eurotrip with my van. Had it for paying music in the thousands of km I had to make. Guess what? After the app was stuck it cleared all music. I was furious. I contacted Google support and asked for a refund. They refunded me. Later on after I found finally a fast WiFi I redowloaded all 30 gb. Some days after same issue. I asked again for a refund. Got it. Sorry but shitty app. If anyone is interested I got the whole conversation via support mail. Picaso86 These "temp" engineers are screwing everything up. Get some real professionals behind this app Google. vicentk Play Music rustling jimmies as always. Every week i have to force close this damn app or reboot to be able to play any song. anyway they dont get any money from me anymore. what Yep, the app is buggy as hell. The only good thing is direct billing from carrier, but looks like it can't automatically prolong the subscribition after the month is over that way. All bugreports went to garbage bin. Considering a switch. CoreRooted My subscription using direct carrier billing auto renews every month. It might be a carrier thing for you. I'm on AT&T and it happens every month with no interaction from me. Azar Al I lgot to say for this: LOL Jerseysteve Good article, NOT COMPLETELY CORRECT. I have an HTC 1 M8, and I use the SD card, because my library, all of the music is MINE, not streamed, uses too much memory to keep on internal memory. As soon as they did their update, I was no longer able to access my music from the SD card, and Google play automatically downloaded all my music to the internal memory. I had no idea what was happening, as I didn't do anything. When I spoke to Google, they told me Google play would no longer recognize music on SD cards. Then she told me there are no plans to change this new policy. Now, I have music on my phone, but many tracks are missing, and using playlists is nearly impossible. Can you do a follow-up? jak_341 I'm really questioning the competency of Google's coders of late. They have been putting out some real trash lately. wampdog29 Yep. Hangouts has been real screwed up with the notification bug. I'm really questioning why I use their services and apps lately.... Cory Music that I have uploaded has been deleted from my account. Hopefully they are working on this too. alex weird ... have this relationship with a recent problem with wakelocks with 1013 audioin ?? Robby P Yea what about the app crashing every other song for the past two months CAN NOT PLAY THIS MUSIC AT THIS TIME please fix that $9.99 a months ads up Google... Lissy Forhol WTF......they better fix this NOW or give me all my damn money back. Seriously! alberteezy Anybody have a bug when oragnizing your playlist? Everytime I start organizing songs in the order I want them on my playlist this bug sets them back how the songs use to be. I've had this bug for more than a year already and its do frustrating. Thinking of jumping to Spotify. Frank Q. Guerrero Never had a problem...all of it works and for hours,too. Nexus 6 2014, Vizio 46'' flat screen, 2014 Google Chromecast. Play Pandora for hours...also Concert video's from Crackle "Third Eye Blind Concert" Played Pandora for 4 hrs or so...No glitches. Dharma Galaxy I tried buying one song from Google. I was told I could only download it twice, and when I did download it I had to fix up all the metadata. I went back to buying all my music from Amazon. Ryan Hanna Quick fix: throw your phone in the freezer. Alternative fix: drive over your phone with your car. Thor 100 Gig of music gone. Completely gone from SD card. Unrecoverable. taxandspend It happens with ANY pushpinned music. I know, because I don't subscribe to all access, and it has happened to me multiple times. Then the app thinks it's pushpinned even though the music is gone. So you have to un pushpin it, then re-pushpin it. Six Google Music still deletes then re-downloads my music about once per two weeks. LG G4 with library on external sd. richie I used to have about 100 songs, now i have about 10. Google play keeps deleting them, ffs i dont even want google play on my phone, if i disable...it just comes back and steals more songs, not to mention my phone is virtually useless, i have 400mb ram and google products take up over 350mb sitting idle, no matter what is turned off or disabled. screw you google, i will never contribute 1 cent to global empire of evil! Mind Games Try downloading all of your music at one time and watch what happens on your HTC M9 trust me you won't like it. Yes I use a 128 gigabyte card with plenty of room. If they were concerned about copyright they wouldn't let us download in the first place. Some songs do some songs don't but everything works fine on my BlackBerry Priv. TorokLev Do you know if it has been fixed by Marshmallow? Thanks, Heath T. I have downloaded songs to my library more times than I can remember. This has been an issue from day one on my Galaxy S5. I don't delete them - they just dissappear. I have never removed the SD card, and have never authorized deletion. The bottom line is Google Play is a crap app that Google has shoved down our throats then failed to fix. Torquil Harkness June 2016 and this issue is still occurring :-( Swooper Confirmed, recently got a phone with an SD card and this is happening every time I reboot. Chris Jeske Note 5 - no SD card - same issue. I'm on Big Red with expensive data and this is a real bummer every time I don't check before I leave the house. #firstworldproblems #butyeahfuqallannoying Andreas Engels Same Problem. Really sad! Ins year later nothing changed.. Will change to spotify. Florian Müller This big is still existing! At least for me, any news on this ridiculous and annoying bug? DaktariD FWIW, this exact issue still happens to my wife on her Moto X Pure. It just happened yesterday, aamof. Her entire library of local files was suddenly gone and Google Play started re-downloading it. As you said, it is set to store to a local SD card. The SD card was not removed (it hasn't been removed for months) and the phone has not been recently rebooted. Very mysterious. MetalMusicAddict This is still an issue even now. Happens at least once a month to me. A pita when I have 30gb+ of music to re-dl. Ethan Kwan Still not fixed lol. I have a Xiaomi Redmi 3 Pro with Android 6 James Stewart LG G4 with an SD card for storage. Opened GPM this morning in the car and it told me I had no downloaded music. Never had this problem before, and the only thing I've done to GPM recently was update it earlier this week. Steven Fletcher Still not fixed. Galaxy S8, 2 restarts, 2 times music is deleted.

Some are anticipating if they will win at the Google Play Awards 2017. The developers conference will be held on May 17 to 19, 2017, at the Shoreline Ampitheater in Mountain View, California. This after years of the event always being held in the Moscone Events Center in San Francisco.

Abhijit Ahaskar Apps with spyware continue to be a major risk factor and they are not limited to apps from third-party stores or websites anymore. Photo: Ramesh Pathania/Mint. Google’s Android OS has been criticised again and again for its various privacy and security concerns. Many of the recent privacy breaches have come from harmless looking apps hiding a code designed to track the user’s habits to help advertisers target them with more specific content. Apps with spyware continue to be a major risk factor and they are not limited to apps from third-party stores or websites anymore. Using ultrasonic signals to track users Advertisers have found a new way to track user habits using ultrasonic beacons. A study by German Technical University of Braunschweig, published on 5 May 2017, claims that advertisers and marketers are embedding high-frequency sound called ultrasonic signals in TV and web advertisements. This sound is inaudible to humans, but can be detected by apps carrying specific codes to listen to them. The researchers found 234 apps which had a hidden code that listens for ultrasonic signals without the user’s knowledge. This allowed app developers to determine users’ identity, track location and, more importantly, their habits. So an app could track which advertisements were watched by users and for how long. This allowed advertisers to target users with more specific advertisements. There is no direct way to identify such apps but one can be careful while allowing microphone access to apps in future. You can block microphone access in Settings->Apps->App Permissions. Apps talking to each other A study by Virginia Polytechnic Institute, published on 4 April 2017, found Android apps can be secretly talking to each other or even sharing sensitive information about users. The researchers examined 1,10,150 apps on Google Play Store over a period of three years and found thousands of apps leaking sensitive personal information by allowing unauthorised apps access to restricted data. In a nutshell, an app which has permissions to access sensitive information was sharing them with apps which have been denied those permissions by the user. According to software security company McAfee, users should avoid apps with embedded advertising. Excessive ads can be an indicator of the presence of multiple ad libraries, which ups the possibility of collusion. Using anti-virus apps and running regular scans can also help to identify such apps. Spyware on Play Store Mobile spyware is a form of malware hidden in an app. It is mostly spread through apps downloaded from unverified app stores and websites. However, there have been a few reported cases of spywares being found on apps on the Google Play Store. For example, a spyware called SMSVova, which was spying on users’ location, was downloaded over 1 million times as an update to an app called System Update through the Google Play Store. It was finally removed by Google after a security company ZScaler reported it in April 2017. A spyware piggybacks on an app and quietly gathers and relays personal information stored in the infected smartphone to the hacker. Users can avoid spywares by simply installing an anti-virus app on their smartphone. Improper adoption of open ports A University of Michigan study, published on 8 May 2017, has found that mobile apps such as WiFi File Transfer which use open ports to allow data sharing between a smartphone and a PC are putting user data at risk. Open port refers to a communication protocol used to connect devices on the same Wi-Fi network. These open ports could be exploited to intercept personal information on the user’s device by hackers. The researchers examined 24,000 mobile apps and found poor implementation of open port in these apps. Users can protect their data by using a firewall on the home router they are using.
