Twitter Facebook Gmail will push users further away for XP and Vista Forthcoming update will drop support for Chrome 53 Blair Hanley Frank (IDG News Service) 02 February, 2017 09:05 - - - - print email Comments Google quietly announced Tuesday that Gmail will stop supporting older versions of its Chrome browser soon, in a move that will put another nail in the coffins of Windows XP and Windows Vista. Users of Chrome version 53 and older editions of the browser could start being redirected to the basic HTML version of Gmail as early as December, the company said in a blog post. Starting next week, users who will be affected by the change will start seeing a banner at the top of Gmail telling them to upgrade to an up-to-date version of Google’s browser. The affected browser versions include Chrome v49, the last version of the software that supports XP and Vista. While Microsoft officially ended support for XP more than two and a half years ago, Gmail has continued to work with it. Vista Service Pack 2 will reach the end of its extended support period on April 11. Google also pointed out that users of outdated versions of Chrome are more vulnerable to security exploits, which is of particular importance for XP, because Microsoft is no longer even releasing security patches for the operating system. Google suggested that administrators managing Chrome on behalf of their users upgrade them at this point. If they can’t be upgraded because of an incompatible OS, Google recommended admins take care of that as well. Windows XP still makes up 5 percent of the desktop browser market share worldwide, according to StatCounter’s data from December 2016. That’s a fraction of Windows 10’s still-growing share of the pie -- measured at 27.2 percent -- but shows that there are still hold-outs.

The new G Suite Enterprise offers greater control over information. Features include the ability to enforce the use of login security keys, the addition of Data Loss Prevention (DLP) for Google Drive and S/MIME (Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions) for Gmail. It also links Gmail with Google’s BigQuery cloud data warehousing service to provide more visibility into employee activity and integrates Gmail with third-party archiving solutions like HP Autonomy and Veritas. G Suite Enterprise Formerly known as Google Apps for Work, G Suite is a set of intelligent apps including Gmail, Docs, Drive and Calendar that is designed for collaboration.  “We’re giving customers the critical control and visibility they expect (and their CTOs and regulators often require),” Reena Nadkarni, product manager at G Suite wrote in a blog post Features include more powerful access control for administrators with security key enforcement and the ability to manage who can access your company’s devices and systems. For enterprises, the big addition will be the extension of DLP from Gmail to the other apps in G Suite. DLP, added to Gmail in 2015, makes it even for admins to secure sensitive data, control what content can be stored and protect users from accidentally sharing confidential information externally. Enterprises should also like the ability to enforce S/MIME encryption on Gmail and set DLP rules according to individual or team needs. Slack, Microsoft & Google Two years ago, Google appeared to have given up on its enterprise collaboration ambitions when it rebranded Google Apps as Google for Work. Clearly, it hadn't as G Suite Enterprise proves. It's a crowded space and Google, Microsoft and Slack are all fighting for a share. In November, Microsoft Teams, a chat-based workspace in Office 365, went into public preview. According to figures from Microsoft in its most recent quarterly earnings report, 30,000 organizations across 145 markets and 19 languages used Teams in November. When Teams goes on general release at an unspecified date this year Microsoft plans to add WhoBot, which uses natural language processing to offer workers insights into their organization. As of yesterday, Slack also has an enterprise edition, with enhancements including security, compliance with FINRA and HIPAA, and e-discovery functionality designed specifically for large entities. 0 Comments Top Articles Related Articles Recent Comments Why 2017 Is the Year of Cloud-First Headless CMS MailChimp Integrates Facebook Ads With Email Marketing OpenText 'Fully Committed' to Documentum, Other Dell EMC ECD Products Microsoft Teams and Yammer: Why the Two Are Fundamentally Different 'The CMS Industry Is a Mess,' Marketer Christopher Justice Says How Intranet Homepages Anchor the Digital Workplace Why So Many Large Companies Stink at Innovation Google Enhances Security in G Suite Enterprise Edition Elcom Promises 'Effortless' Enterprise Collaboration in Version 10.5 Collaborating Beyond Our Comfort Zones Useful Article?

The Aphabet subsidiary’s 2016 capex was about $10.9 billion, compared to $9.9 billion in 2015 – a 10 percent increase. Not all of Google’s capital spend goes to data centers, but the bulk of it does. On the company’s fourth-quarter earnings call last week, the company’s CFO Ruth Porat said its capital expenditures during the quarter reflected “investments in production equipment, facilities, and data center construction.” The spike in capital spending is also in line with Google’s announcement last March that it would ramp up investment in data centers to support its enterprise cloud services, a business whose growth has been a top priority for the company as it races to catch up with cloud leaders Amazon and Microsoft. See also: Who Leased the Most Data Center Space in 2016 Google’s share of the Infrastructure-as-a-Service market was 2.5 percent in 2015, according to Structure Research, while Amazon Web Services commanded 70.1 percent of the market; Microsoft Azure’s share was 10.8 percent of what was then an $11 billion market. Google was behind Alibaba, IBM, and Rackspace in terms of IaaS market share. While Google already operates a huge global network of massive-scale data centers, not all of those facilities support its cloud services. The company said in March it would add 10 new cloud data center locations by the end of 2017. It launched two in 2016 – Tokyo and The Dalles, Oregon – and said it will launch the other eight this year, which means its 2017 data center spend will likely outpace 2016.

In addition to building data centers for its cloud services, Google is also continuously expanding data center capacity to support its other businesses. Besides the two cloud regions launched last year, the company also brought online a new data center in Dublin, Ireland. While the increase in capex between 2015 and 2016 was substantial, it was not the biggest spike the company has reported in recent years. There was a much bigger increase between 2013 and 2014 (from $7.4 billion to $11 billion, a 51 percent increase), which the company attributed to expenditures related to production equipment, data centers, and real estate purchases.

LOS ANGELES >> Self-driving car prototypes appear to be getting better at negotiating California streets and highways without a human backup needing to intervene, according to data made public Wednesday by California transportation regulators. The data reflect safety-related incidents reported by 11 companies that have been testing more than 100 vehicles on public roads, primarily in the Silicon Valley neighborhoods where the technology has grown up. The reports were made to California’s Department of Motor Vehicles, which posted them online. The documents catalog the number of times from December 2015 through the end of November that humans took control from a car’s software for safety-related reasons. Waymo, as Google’s self-driving car project was recently rebranded, did far more testing than the other 10 companies combined. Waymo reported that its fleet drove itself more than 635,000 miles with 124 safety-related “disengagements” — the equivalent of two incidents every 10,000 miles. That was a notable improvement over the prior year, when there were eight incidents per 10,000 miles. A reportable disengagement happens when the technology fails or the backup driver takes control out of concern the car is malfunctioning. Though imperfect, the data are the best peek the public gets into the fiercely competitive world of self-driving cars and how the prototypes are performing. California required the disengagement reports as part of regulations governing testing on public roads. Separately, the state also requires companies to report any collisions involving its cars. The Department of Motor Vehicles has been working on regulations that will define how the technology can be rolled out to the public when companies believe it is ready. When that will happen depends on several factors, including regulators’ readiness and company confidence the vehicles are safe. While Tesla’s Elon Musk has been bullish, talking about months rather than years, companies such as Waymo have suggested 2017 or 2018 is more realistic. The state expects to release final version of the “public operation” regulations within six weeks, according to Melissa Figueroa, a spokeswoman for California’s top transportation official. The Department of Motor Vehicles made public a first draft in December 2015, nearly a year after final rules were supposed to be in place, and has since revised the language based on developments at the federal level and input from industry and other groups.

The Global 500 research, compiled annually by business valuation company Brand Finance, looks at how much a firm's brand is likely to be worth in terms of money and power over the coming months, based on categories including emotional connection, financial stability and sustainability. It found that Google's value had jumped 24% in the past year while Apple's dropped 27% - allowing the search engine to take the top spot. Google's brand value is estimated at $109,470m, while Apple is just behind at $107,141m. This is despite new company figures released on Tuesday which showed iPhone sales returned to growth at the end of 2016 following three previous quarters of decline. Speaking to Sky News, Brand Finance's chief executive David Haigh said the Global 500 report looks at the future of a company, rather than the past. "Our valuation reflects a consensus view among analysts that [Apple] have reached a zenith, and they appear to be plateauing or possibly going downwards." Online retail giant Amazon maintained its third place position with a brand valuation of £106,369m. Microsoft, Samsung and Facebook all made the top 10, clinching fifth, sixth and ninth places respectively. When looking at the power a brand possesses, however, Lego has overtaken Disney to regain the number one position it lost last year. Haigh points to the fact that Lego has recently diversified outside of its traditional market as a reason for its success, branching into areas such as film and gaming. Ferrari, Visa and Nike are among the other companies to feature in the list of the top 10 most powerful brands.

Meanwhile, Google has recently started seeding the Android 7.1.2 Nougat beta version to compatible Pixel and Nexus devices. Google’s gradual update for the latest iteration of its mobile operating system is currently available for public testing. The internet giant, via the Android Developers Blog, shared a general overview of the upcoming Nougat firmware update. “Android 7.1.2 is an incremental maintenance release focused on refinements, so it includes a number of bugfixes and optimizations, along with a small number of enhancements for carriers and users.” The beta build of Android 7.1.2 Nougat update is compatible with and now ready for Google Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel C, Nexus 5X, and Nexus Player. Unfortunately, beta testers who own the Nexus 6P still need to wait for the arrival of the firmware build for the device, as Google is still working on it. But the Android Nougat maker expects to push out Nexus 6P’s Android Nougat 7.1.2 beta soon. Those who wish to experience the Android 7.1.2 Nougat update before its official release can participate in beta testing by signing up at the Android Beta Program. The test firmware can be downloaded and installed automatically via Over-the-Air or OTA process. It could also be downloaded and flashed manually if the OTA firmware is taking too long to arrive on your device. [Image by Spencer Platt/Getty Images] The official rollout of Android 7.1.2 Nougat update is expected to happen in “just a couple of months,” according to Google. While Google Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel C, Nexus 5X, Nexus Player, and Nexus 6P are all getting this firmware update, Google confirmed to DroidLife that Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 will not get the Android 7.1.2 Nougat firmware. “That’s not super shocking, since each device is past the 2-year time frame for guaranteed version updates,” the publication noted. Even though these two Nexus devices won’t be getting OS updates anymore, they are still scheduled to receive to security patches. Android 7.1.1 was the end of the line For the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 So long—it is time This has been our Nexus rhyme ????https://t.co/1j31esPujG pic.twitter.com/NEIFMOVWrM — Android Central (@androidcentral) January 31, 2017 As for other news about the Android Nougat, the initial version of the firmware (7.0) has started rolling out to various non-Google-manufactured smartphones. The latest news revealed that Vodafone Germany just made the Nougat firmware available for its variant of the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge. Aside from bringing in the highly-anticipated OS, the new firmware update also bumps the phones’ security patch level to January 1, 2017, according to Sam Mobile. A global rollout of Android 7.0 Nougat update is currently ongoing for Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge units. India is one of the most recent countries reached by the Nougat firmware. The Inquisitr’s previous report shared that the Nougat update rolling out for Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 Edge units in the Asian country is 1.3GB heavy. It also contains the Samsung Pay app and comes with a message that reads, “The future of payments is coming soon.” While the Nougat update rolls out for various Android smartphones, it looks like HTC is still struggling to release a stable build. For the second time, the Taiwanese smartphone maker halted the European release of the firmware for its 2016 flagship device, the HTC 10. It cited technical issue as the culprit for halting the rollout. But the Product and Services director of HTC, Graham Wheeler, providing a re-release timeline of the Nougat firmware for HTC 10, shared that it could be available again in February. Android Nougat OS update brings several new features to compatible devices. Some of its major highlights include Data Saver, which prevents mobile applications from utilizing cellular data plan while running in the background; Multi-Window feature and quick switching between apps for multi-taskers; and Doze on The Go to save up battery usage while on the move. Here’s a YouTube video from Tim Schofield showing all the changes to find in the most advanced Android Nougat iteration officially available today, version 7.1.1. Waiting for the Android Nougat update to arrive on your mobile device? The Inquisitr will keep you in the loop for more news about the firmware’s release.

California regulators release safety reports filed by 11 companies that have been testing self-driving car prototypes on public roads on Wednesday, Feb. 1, 2017. The papers report the number of times in 2016 that human backup drivers took control from the cars' self-driving software, though companies argue such "disengagements" don't always reflect something going wrong. (AP Photo/Tony Avelar) Self-driving car prototypes need less human help, data show Last Modified: Wednesday, February 01, 2017 3:16 PM By The Associated Press LOS ANGELES -- Self-driving car prototypes appear to be getting better at negotiating California streets and highways without a human backup driver intervening, according to data made public Wednesday by California transportation regulators. The data reflect safety-related incidents reported by 11 companies that have been testing more than 100 vehicles on public roads, primarily in the Silicon Valley neighborhoods where the technology has grown up. The reports were made to California's Department of Motor Vehicles, which posted them online. The documents catalog the number of times from December 2015 through the end of November that humans took over control from a car's software for safety reasons. Waymo, as Google's self-driving car project was recently rebranded, did far more testing than the other 10 companies combined. Waymo reported that its fleet drove itself more than 635,000 miles with 124 safety-related "disengagements," which must be reported when the technology fails or the backup driver takes control out of concern the car is malfunctioning. The Google project's disengagement rate was the equivalent of two incidents every 10,000 miles, a notable decrease over the prior year, when there were eight disengagements per 10,000 miles. "This four-fold improvement reflects the significant work we've been doing to make our software and hardware more capable and mature," Dmitri Dolgov, Waymo's head of self-driving technology wrote in a blog post . Waymo's chief critic acknowledged the improvement, but John Simpson of the nonprofit Consumer Watchdog said the number of disengagements shows the cars still "simply aren't ready to be released to roam our roads" without human backup drivers. Cruise Automation, a startup acquired last year by General Motors, reported driving the second most test miles. Cruise said its prototypes had 181 disengagements over 9,776 miles (185 per 10,000 miles) and that it was "pleased with our progress" during testing on the complex streets of San Francisco. Though imperfect, the data represent the best peek the public gets into the secretive and fiercely competitive world of self-driving cars and how the prototypes are performing. California required the disengagement reports as part of regulations governing testing on public roads. Separately, the state also requires companies to report any collisions involving its cars. When the technology will be ready for the public depends on several factors, including regulators' readiness and company confidence the vehicles are safe. While Tesla's Elon Musk has been bullish, talking about months rather than years, companies such as Waymo have suggested 2017 or 2018 is more realistic. Tesla's disengagement report said four prototypes drove a total of 550 miles last fall, experiencing 182 disengagements — the equivalent of 3,309 disengagements every 10,000 miles. Tesla logged the miles primarily to develop a publicly posted video, set to the Rolling Stones song "Paint It Black," of the driver's seat perspective in a car where a person does not have to put their hands on the wheel or feet on the pedals. The video promoted how Tesla was shipping cars with advanced sensors that will be activated in the future. The company already is gathering tens of millions of miles of real-world data when owners engage the current Autopilot feature, which can control steering and speed but is not sophisticated enough to make the cars self-driving from the regulatory perspective. The Department of Motor Vehicles has been working for several years on regulations that will govern how the technology can be rolled out to the public when companies believe testing shows it is ready. The state expects to release final "public operation" regulations within six weeks, according to Melissa Figueroa, a spokeswoman for California's State Transportation Agency. The Department of Motor Vehicles, which is part of the agency, made public a first draft in December 2015, nearly a year after final rules were supposed to be in place. The department has since revised the language based on developments at the federal level and input from industry and other groups. The agency and the department declined comment on the reports released Wednesday.

Featuresby David Imel1 day ago 12 194 2 2016 was arguably one of the biggest years in hardware and software innovation in recent history. Through techniques like machine learning, our devices are finally beginning to understand us on a much more fundamental level than ever before. Though true artificial intelligence is still not here quite yet, contextual data storage combined with the simplicity of almost perfected speech recognition has changed the way we interact with our devices, and will only be iterated upon until technology is so seamless that we will forget we are even using it. It seems quite clear that AI will be the future, but what about AR? Will augmented reality integrate with artificial intelligence to make our lives as simplistic as possible? Let’s take a look a few possible scenarios, along with technologies on the market today that seem to be headed towards this transition. What is AI? Artificial intelligence is used to describe a technology that can make decisions based on varying efficiency algorithms. They can be low level (such as an easy mode game AI), or high level, such as AlphaGo, Google’s AI project that defeated the world Go champion this past summer. In the consumer space, AI has been a bit different. Though not a true AI, which could theoretically do everything humans can do (even write more AI software), these assistive technologies currently thriving in the market can help make our lives just a little bit easier through automation and voice recognition.

November 18, 2016 The two current leaders in the assistive technology space are Google (Google Home) and Amazon (Amazon Alexa), smart home technologies that can play music, look up facts, and control things like lighting with various voice actions. While these products may seem like magic to some, they are still in what many would consider the first generation of what assistive tech could become. Machine learning has arguably evolved more in the last 5 years than it did in the previous 20, largely due to huge developments in compute technologies that allow us to index and search for similar labeled objects in an instant. Through these developments, assistive technology can now understand a query, index that query, and return a result faster than ever before, allowing for almost instantaneous answers to questions and actions based on voice queries.

Many are thinking the next big step is AR, or augmented reality. What is AR? Augmented reality is a technology which overlays images or holograms over the real world. There are multiple tiers of this technology, with lower level implementations using a phone’s camera to add images to your surroundings, while higher level versions like Microsoft’s HoloLens measure space to a higher degree to allow for intractable overlays. This tech is still in its infancy, though many companies have attempted to make higher level and more interactive versions over the years. Quite a few have come and gone, in the last couple of years even, and it seems that many of these technologies are simply too early to market. Google Glass was a simplistic and interactive way to integrate AR overlays into our everyday lives. It connected to smartphones to allow for image projection and help us get things done in a much easier way. Though it was relatively simplistic in its first generation, it allowed for integration of technology in an almost completely seamless way. Want to record a video? You could do that in an instant. Map to a location? Google Glass showed your next turn right in front of your eyes, without having to take your attention off the road. Glass was a huge first step making AR part of our daily life, as it allowed us to utilize technology whenever we wanted to with almost no effort at all. The biggest issue with the project was its timing, along with its feature set. The public was not quite ready to deal with technology having the ability to record their every move at any moment, especially when there was no indication that it was doing so. Though the project is now effectively dead, it seems to be coming back in the form of multiple other projects from various companies that are looking to take its place. HoloLens is a holographic overlay headset developed by Microsoft. The technology has the ability to create images and objects over the real world that are intractable in various ways. Through apps like Skype, Minecraft, and others, users can projects screens onto walls, manipulate 3D objects, and more. The headset is still in a relatively early developer stage, but shows an iteration in what Google glass was originally designed to do. Check out this post over at VRSource for more information on the project. How can AI and AR work together? AI and AR are both technologies that are made to augment our lives more seamlessly with helpful technology and information. While one aims to automate our processes through simplistic speech processing and other forms of input, the other works to develop new ways of information manipulation to make our jobs, entertainment, and overall life better. So how might these two technologies work together? There are a few potential possibilities. The Iron Man ‘Jarvis’ scenario In the Iron Man series, Tony Stark has an AI system he developed called J.A.R.V.I.S. This AI is so advanced, it knows the ins and outs of Tony’s behavior better than he knows himself. It automates almost all of his processes, and is able to provide him accurate information as soon as Tony asks for it. In Stark’s Iron man suit, he has a heads up display showing multiple different metrics in the real world that could be of interest. Whether it’s a rocket flying at him at high speeds or his suit’s power levels decreasing, Tony Stark can ask Jarvis for up to date information that provides him with the power he needs to get things done more efficiently. The closest version of the AR technology we currently have is HoloLens, which, like Iron Man’s suit can overlay images and allow us to interact with them in real time. HoloLens currently doesn’t have AI technology, but could it feasibly in the future? Assistive technologies like Google Home and Amazon Alexa give us fast access to information and can help manipulate things like our homes, but if evolved enough, could be much more useful in the space. Even mobile AI like Siri and Google Assistant can remember our individual preferences, so an integration of the two technologies would essentially be a low level form of what Stark created in a comic stemming from 1968. A technology like this in our everyday lives could have a lot of potential use cases. In fact, if information is available to us right in front of our eyes, many of the wearable devices we currently use today could be completely replaced. Need to know your heart rate? It’s in the top right corner of your vision. Need an Uber to pick you up? Simple voice command. Want to know what someone’s name is? Their identity can be displayed above them at any time. In this way, the entire need for interaction with a handheld device could be removed in its entirety. Or can it? Could this technology replace our mobile devices? The Google Glass V2 scenario To make a product like this more feasible for the consumer market, it would need to be reduced to a much more feasible size, as well as form factor. Sound familiar? This sounds a lot like what further generations of Google Glass could have become, but the consumer and media fear of recording capabilities shut the project down while still in its infancy. Still, there are ways for a technology like this to re-surface in the market. Other companies like Snapchat have worked around secretive recording hysteria by adding things like lights to let people know what you are doing, and they seem to be doing alright so far. Imagine Microsoft’s HoloLens technology mixed in with an AI that can answer all of your questions, and helps you do things before you need them done. What previously sounded like a far off sci-fi comic in the 60’s is now a feasible possibility, and one that could only be a few years away. Though Microsoft has not announced any sort of consumer version of its HoloLens headset, an iteration of similar technology could very much be in the works, whether it be from Microsoft themselves, Google, or any other equally capable developer. Is this something you would like to see? As with any technology, there are some pretty substantial downsides to all this; privacy being one of the biggest concerns. Do we want to live in a world where we are so dependent on assistive technology that we don’t understand life without it? Obviously, putting that much power in the hands of one company is quite a risky move, especially when every move and metric of our daily lives are being measured to the furthest extent. You could argue that these calculations are all for the good of the end user, but sometimes it is better to be more cautious about how much data we give any one entity. I’m obviously not going to rant here about why you should be more careful with your data, but as our technologies evolve to be more and more essential to our daily lives, we need to consider who this reliance is coming from, and what we are willing to give up to use it. As we barrel headfirst into the future of computing, there are amazing technologies coming to the forefront of our culture every day. They say technology is on an exponential curve, and based on the change we’ve seen in the last 5 years alone, it’s hard not to agree. How long do you think it will be before this technology hits the market? There’s no doubt it is an interesting and futuristic venture, and there are probably loads of companies attempting to perfect it as we speak.

Increase / Decrease text size Joe Clark 1st February 2017 19 19Shares 0 15 0 3 Add to favorites Smart devices have shown that they are vulnerable to security flaws in the past, so how do we secure ourselves as we move towards smart homes? Across the world Smart homes are on the rise, with the IoT creating new technological solutions to our everyday problems. As companies like Google and Amazon roll out their smart speakers, collating our devices and apps into easily manageable hubs, smart homes will surely only increase in popularity. According to ABI Research, by 2020 there will be 40.9 billion active wireless connected devices and this will largely be non-hub devices like sensors. IDC forecasts that by 2020 the worldwide market for IoT will surpass $7 trillion. The growth of these systems in the recent and coming years is astronomical but with all of our personal data uploaded into nebulous ‘cloud’ systems how safe are we and how safe are our homes? In today’s world, it’s already fairly implicit that someone somewhere is taking our data and using it for scrupulous means. As we transition ever closer to the always online digital future, the danger of our data being exploited will only increase if security concerns go unaddressed. In 2015, Tripwire’s Vulnerability and Exposure Research Team (VERT) discovered that it was possible to gain access to smart hubs and make the changes they saw fit, such as re-configuring alarm systems, opening locks, and using hardware on the network for Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks. Similarly in 2016 it was discovered that Google and Samsung, among others, had serious flaws in receiving data transmitted from smart homes leaving it vulnerable. Direct attacks on our data are one the most immediate digital threats posed today, but when these systems are part of our very homes they take on a far more sinister role. Avast CTO, Ondrej Vlcek said: “It’s putting a lot of pressure on us. If we can protect at the router level  then we are able to protect all the devices on the network because it’s a connectivity hub.” “In a way that’s the area of focus for us because then we don’t have to worry about the specifics of the devices that are attached to the network, of course the challenge is how to provide meaningful protection on the router level without infecting the other parts of the network.” The data available to potential hackers is incredibly more personal. Knowing that a smart meter can manage your boiler and how much heating you use means that hackers could even use this data to discern when you take your bath. Again, this information is not very valuable on it’s own, but it quickly becomes a frightening situation when thinking of the wider implications. It’s quite possible that an unauthorised party could use this data to ascertain your every activity in your own home, and more importantly when you are not at home. An emerging trend in the hacking world is the use of large scale botnets. Botnets are systems in which huge numbers of internet connected devices become part of a network in order to use their shared power to send torrents of spam emails or to instigate DDoS attacks to overwhelm websites and shut them down. Perhaps the most infamous Botnet is the Mirai Malware of 2016. Mirai managed to utilise systems running Linux to initiate the 2016 Dyn cyberattack which caused the internet to become unavailable for large swathes of Europe and North America. One of the things that made this botnet so dangerous was how it utilised devices which in the past were traditionally non-digital, such as remote cameras and sensors around the house. When asked about who should secure these systems Vlcek said: “Is it the consumer? I’m not sure because what’s in it for them? I think this needs to be the responsibility of the industry that surrounds the IoT space, the hardware manufacturers, maybe in cooperation with guys like us.” “The sad reality though is that these manufacturers are under super heavy pressure on margins and additional investments in better software and security are going against their interests of cutting costs. It’s a pretty difficult problem overall throughout the whole industry that we somehow have to solve.” Machine learning could prove vital in the fight against these problems. Companies like Avast harvest user data through platforms such as AVG and Avast, which have roughly 400 million users worldwide combined,  and input them into systems that can process the best ways to tackle problems and reduce remediation time. By having access to these huge sample sizes, companies are able to help better protect users through security software. However, a large number of IoT devices found in smart homes simply lack the storage and processing capacity to run the programs necessary to ward against these digital incursions. Machine learning can alleviate the requirement for these systems by observing the data patterns from a central hub and create new behaviours designed to protect the devices. Though this is only partial security and offers limited protection, there are plenty of other methods that can be used to infect a home network. Vlcek added: “Machine learning really is a big part of what we are doing, we use the data to teach the machine network. It’s really a shift that happened in the entire industry and something most security companies today use.” “It allow us to make decisions faster and more reliably because of the vast user base that we have.” A study by Broadband Genie found that the general public is still largely opposed to smart technology and almost two thirds voiced concern regarding it’s retention of their personal data. The same study also showed that much of the public is vastly uninformed on the topic of smart technology and it could be that the lack of knowledge regarding data usage is a part of the hesitancy. Perception problems like this need to be rectified and the systems explained properly as we move further into smart home technology. Machine learning and AI can be scary concepts but if it can be clearly demonstrated how they protect us by using our data for us, rather than against us, then it stands a better chance in the eyes of the public.

 As Google protests Trump on the streets, it's trying to cozy up to Republicans behind the scenes Steve Kovach Jan. 31, 2017, 1:23 PM 29,814 facebook linkedin twitter email print Alphabet employees protested Trump's immigration ban on Monday in San Francisco.Matthew Weinberger After years of enjoying a close relationship with the Obama administration and other Democratic leaders, Google's parent company, Alphabet, is showing signs that it's cozying up to Republicans as it adapts to new leadership in Washington. But Alphabet also finds itself in a bit of a tricky position, trying to curry favor with a White House that has already put forth policies counter to the company's culture and business interests, like the executive order signed on Friday that barred people from seven predominately Muslim countries. On Monday, about 2,000 Google and Alphabet employees from around the world walked out to protest the immigration ban, and company leaders like Google CEO Sundar Pichai, cofounder Sergey Brin, and other execs spoke to those gathered. It was the biggest anti-Trump demonstration from a tech company, following the flood of statements from practically every major CEO or leader in the industry. For all the public displays of discontent, Alphabet is hardly shunning the new Republican-controlled government. As a for-profit public company with vast business interests tied to US policy, Alphabet can't afford to disengage with the government. And as a result, the company is taking a more pragmatic approach behind the scenes, ramping up lobbying efforts in Washington and looking for ways to get closer to Donald Trump's administration. Getting closer to Republicans At the end of last year, Alphabet parted ways with the Podesta Group, a Democratic-leaning lobbying firm led by Tony Podesta, the brother of Hillary Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta, Bloomberg reported. Alphabet had worked with the Podesta Group for 12 years, and Bloomberg noted that the timing coincided with a job posting at Google for someone to spearhead "conservative outreach." However, a person familiar with Alphabet's relationship with the Podesta Group told Business Insider that the lobbying firm was the one that cut ties because it was asked to do so by Oracle, another big tech client that competes with Google. The Podesta Group did not respond to multiple requests for comment. This month, The New York Times reported that Google financed a swanky party in Washington in a partnership with the right-wing news outlet The Independent Journal Review. The party was the day after the new Congress' first day, and most of the lawmakers in attendance were Republicans, The Times reported. In December, Alphabet CEO Larry Page and Chairman Eric Schmidt attended the so-called tech summit at Trump Tower with Trump, along with other notable tech leaders like Apple CEO Tim Cook, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella, and Tesla CEO Elon Musk. But that meeting wasn't the end. Schmidt was spotted in Trump Tower about a month after the tech summit, though it's unclear what he and Trump discussed. Schmidt also met with Republican Sen. John Thune, who chairs the Senate's Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee, and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy before visiting Trump Tower, according to The Times. Alphabet CEO Larry Page, second from left, at the tech summit at Trump Tower in December.Getty/ Drew Angerer What does Alphabet have to gain? Google has worked with both Republicans and Democrats in the past, and the company spends millions of dollars every year lobbying across both sides of the aisle. In 2016, Alphabet spent more than $15 million on government lobbying. For Google and Alphabet, a lot is at stake. Google was the target of a Federal Trade Commission investigation several years ago into alleged anticompetitive business practices. (The case was closed in 2013 without charges.) An unfriendly FTC in the new administration could potentially take another look at Google's business practices, especially as the company continues to face antitrust investigations in Europe. Peter Thiel, the tech billionaire and adviser to Trump, has criticized Google's power in the past and is leading the search for a new chair of the FTC, according to BuzzFeed. BuzzFeed also reported that Schmidt has had trouble gaining favor with the Trump administration and that Google's preferred candidate for FTC chair, Joshua Wright, is unlikely to be picked. But Thiel has written about the merits of monopoly power, so there's a chance his FTC pick wouldn't want to go after Google again. It wasn't always this way Although Google's Washington, DC, office has plenty of Republican staffers — including former Republican Rep. Susan Molinari, who runs the office — the perception has been that Google's activities leaned more to the Democratic side of the political aisle, especially during Barack Obama's administration. For example, Obama hired longtime Googler Megan Smith as White House CTO. Google also hired Obama's former deputy national security adviser, Caroline Atkinson to run public policy. And Schmidt served on Obama's science and technology presidential advisory board. "We've worked with both Republicans and Democrats for over a decade, advocating policies to encourage economic growth, innovation, and entrepreneurialism," Molinari said in a statement to Business Insider. "We'll continue to do exactly that." Schmidt also had ties to Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign, giving funding to a software company called Groundwork that provided technical services for the campaign. Schmidt was even spotted wearing a "staff" badge at what was supposed to be Clinton's election night victory party — something that caught the attention of WikiLeaks and conservative media outlets.

Pichai sent a memo to staff last weekend criticizing Trump's executive order that barred immigrants and refugees. Brin was spotted at San Francisco's airport protesting the immigration ban, and he spoke forcefully against the ban at a rally at Google headquarters on Monday.

(Photo from Matt Kang/Forbes) pic.twitter.com/GwhsSwDPLT — Ryan Mac (@RMac18) January 29, 2017 Monday's protest at Google campuses across the world flooded social media with photos and videos of cheering employees and company leaders slamming the Trump administration's immigration ban. Soufi Esmaeilzadeh, an Iranian-born Google employee, told her story to those gathered at the company's Mountain View, California, campus. Google Product Manager Soufi Esmaeilzadeh.Google Esmaeilzadeh was flying from San Francisco to Zurich when Trump signed the executive order. After contacting Google's immigration team, she was told it would be best to stay in Zurich indefinitely because she could risk deportation if she came back to the US. When a federal judge blocked part of the order on Saturday night, Google booked Esmaeilzadeh a flight back to San Francisco. Brin, himself a refugee who came to the US from the Soviet Union during the Cold War, delivered the strongest words during the demonstration. "I think it's important to not frame this debate as being 'liberal' versus 'Republican' and so forth," Brin said. "It's a debate about fundamental values, about thoughtful policymaking and many of the other things that I think are apparently not universally adored, but I think the vast majority of our country and our legislators and so forth support." (Here's a full transcript of Brin's remarks.) Schmidt also spoke out against the same administration he has tried to get close to at a meeting with Google employees on Thursday, according to BuzzFeed. Schmidt said he thought the Trump administration would continue to do "these evil things" like ban immigration, according to the report. And Google is donating $2 million itself and another $2 million from employees to the American Civil Liberties Union and other groups to battle Trump's immigration ban. Another fight brewing Concerns are likely to grow at Google and other large tech companies as the Trump administration considers changes to the H-1B visa program, which allows companies to hire workers from other countries and bring them to the US. As Bloomberg reported, those changes would require companies to prioritize American hires. Such an order could severely limit tech companies' ability to recruit the talent it needs. Google, Facebook, Amazon, IBM, Apple, and just about any other tech company you can think of are consistently among the top sponsors of H-1B visa holders, according to My Visa Jobs. Business Insider has reached out to major tech companies regarding potential changes to the H-1B visa program. All have either not responded or declined to comment until more information is available.

(STC), the kingdom’s biggest operator, is the Arab world’s most valuable brand, while Emirates, the world’s largest airline, continues to be most valuable brand in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), according to Brand Finance’s Global 500. The Global 500, an annual ranking from the leading valuation and strategy consultancy, ranks brands by monetary value and also calculates the most “powerful” brands, as defined by the companies whose enterprise value is most positively impacted by the strength of their brand. In order to determine a brand’s value, Brand Finance first evaluates factors such as marketing investment, familiarity, loyalty, staff satisfaction and corporate reputation to determine the ‘strength’ or ‘power’ of a brand. Brand power determines the proportion of overall business revenue that is contributed by a brand. STC of Saudi Arabia moved up to 252nd place in the rankings, making it the Middle East’s most valuable brand. The company’s brand value rose 11% during 2016 to $6.2 billion. The increase was primarily driven by STC ‘humanizing’ its marketing campaigns, and reengaging with its stakeholders with a fresh, more personable outlook. Despite an oil slump, a stronger US dollar and a slowing global economy that has impacted consumer appetite for air travel globally, Emirates secured 264th place in the rankings with a brand value of $6.1 billion. The company retained its spot as the UAE’s most valuable brand due to the carrier’s breadth of service, customer centric approach and wide global network. The company’s Brand Strength Index score even increased from 85 out of 100 in 2016 to 87 out of 100 in 2017, securing it a AAA rating once again. Brand Strength Index is the part of Brand Finance’s assessment, designed to calculate the underlying strength of a brand. It includes an analysis of marketing investment, brand equity (the goodwill accumulated with customers, staff and other stakeholders) and finally the impact of those on business performance. Etisalat, the biggest of two telecom providers in the UAE, rose to 293rd place, up from 404th place in 2016. The company’s brand value increased 45% on last year to $5.5 billion. The rise in value was on the back of growing user numbers, innovation (i.e. Etisalat was the first Middle Eastern brand to trial 5G) and strong profit results in 2016. Qatar National Bank, Qatar’s largest bank by assets, entered the survey for the first time securing 441th place with a brand value of $3.8 billion. The company’s brand value rose 56% year-on-year driven by its continued robust financial performance and its successful international expansion. Qatar National Bank now operates in more than 30 countries across three continents. Andrew Campbell, Managing Director of Brand Finance Middle East, said: “Middle Eastern brands continue to make their mark in the Global 500. The brand value of the four companies from the region represented in our 2017 ranking grew on average by 23% year-on-year, which reflects the scale of their achievements when it comes to driving brand awareness, recognition and advocacy. We expect more brands from the Middle East to enter our Global 500 in time as oil prices readjust and companies from the region continue to expand into new geographic markets.” Google replaced Apple as the world’s most valuable brand, with a brand value of $109.5 billion. Google’s brand value rose during 2016 by 24% (from $88.2 billion) whilst Apple’s declined from $145.9 billion to $107.1 billion. Google last occupied the position of the world’s most valuable brand in 2011. The company remains largely unchallenged in its core search business, which is the mainstay of its advertising income. Advertising revenues were up 20% in 2016 as budgets are increasingly directed online and Google finds more lucrative revenue streams from digital consumers. Campbell added: “Apple has struggled to maintain its technological advantage. New iterations of the iPhone have delivered diminishing returns and there are signs that the company has reached a saturation point for its brand. The Chinese market, where Apple has enjoyed a dominant market share, is becoming far more competitive with local players entering the market in a meaningful way. Samsung has also been successful in taking market share and financial analysts are projecting declining revenues and margins.” Lego (196) has regained its status as the world’s most powerful brand, with a brand strength score of 92.7. Much of it success owes to its media licensing deals and partnerships which have driven growth and introduced the likes of Lego Star Wars, Lego Harry Potter and Lego Batman. The Lego Batman Movie will premiere in February with further movies planned for the franchise. This will contribute significantly to Lego’s already significant licensing income but, as importantly, the exposure – to both children and adults – will reinforce Lego’s brand strength for years to come. Google (1), Nike (28), Ferrari (258) and Visa (57) complete the rest of the top 5 most powerful brands in the world, with the latter seeing an 8 percentage point gain in brand strength – the most of any company in the top 10. Campbell further said: “A powerful brand can protect a company’s value during turbulent market conditions or challenging times for a business. The share price resilience of Samsung and Wells Fargo, after a difficult year, is testimony to how a brand can help a company ride out a storm. This is why a brand is such an important intangible asset and should be valued as such. Particularly during M&A scenarios, the fact that brand values are not factored into company accounts can mitigate against fair value being paid. Sellers ought to recognize the full worth of their brand, whilst buyers ought to factor in how far the asset of a brand can be stretched and monetized.” Financial services companies comprise 20% of the Global 500 and, this year, China has been the big winner. Growth in brand value in China can broadly be attributed to the growth of the Chinese middle class and its maturing consumer economy. The brand value of Wells Fargo (13) fell 6% after a turbulent year for the brand and was replaced as the most valuable financial brand in the world by ICBC (10). However, it only fell 3 places on the overall ranking of most valuable brands, remaining the US’s most valuable banking brand, due to its deep roots across the country and its market share. Payment service providers Visa (57) and Mastercard’s (110) brand value grew by 81% and 58% respectively in 2016, as their core markets continued to move towards a cashless society and become increasingly reliant on the two companies’ services. Walt Disney (24) fell from the position of the world’s most powerful brand to number 6 in the power rankings. This may be because its 2016 Star Wars release was a spin-off and less successful than 2015’s reboot of the main franchise, one of the highest grossing films of all time. Furthermore, Disney’s biggest films of 2016 are all associated with sub-brands rather than Disney itself – Star Wars: Rogue One (Lucasfilm), Finding Dory (Pixar), Captain America Civil War (Marvel). Disney remains a hugely powerful brand and will be closely watched during 2017 when the eighth installment of Star Wars is released and could propel the brand up the rankings again. Of the 40 telecoms brands in the Global 500, AT&T (4) overtook Verizon (7) as the most valuable brand. Its geographical and acquisitive growth in South America and Mexico has been rewarded with continued growth in brand value and an increase in market share in the respective regions. Spectrum (83) is the highest new entrant of the Global 500. The brand created by Charter Communications which describes itself as the fastest growing TV, Internet and voice provider, counts the acquisition with Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks under its name. The behemoths of the non-alcoholic drinks industry, Coca-Cola (27) and Pepsi (67) have fallen by 13 and 12 places respectively as they continue to struggle against the trend towards healthier alternatives and greater scrutiny around marketing sugary drinks to children. Sprite (388) was the only of company in this category to grow its brand value over the past year (from $3.8 billion to $4.4 billion). Brands offering energy drinks, appear to be protected as Red Bull (227) and Gatorade (372) continue to increase their brand strength rating (by 1 and 3 index points respectively) with their marketing efforts continuing to focus on extreme sports and performance athletes. The global fast food outlets McDonald’s (16), KFC (257) and Domino’s Pizza (427) continue to drop down the rankings in the world’s most valuable brands, with heavy competition in an increasingly fragmented market with healthier challenger brands offering greater choice for consumers. McDonald’s has fallen by 4 places in the rankings with its brand value decreasing by 9%, while KFC and Domino’s Pizza declined by 27% and 16% respectively. The largest improvement within the sector, with a 45% increase in its brand value, came from Tim Horton’s (192), the fast food restaurant based in Canada, known for its coffee and doughnuts. Parent company, Restaurant Brands international, which also owns Burger King (329), has announced plans for expansion abroad with the Philippines and the UK tipped to be targets. Boeing (78) and Lockheed Martin (193) were big gainers in brand value in 2016, rising by 17% and 32% respectively, while Northrop Grumman was a new entrant to the Global 500 at 418. In an increasingly uncertain world and with a newly elected President committed to military spending, American defense and aerospace companies have benefitted. Conversely, Airbus (153) has been a big loser within the category. Its fall in brand value of 10% can be linked to the poor reception of its latest model, the Airbus A380, the company’s failure to meet some orders and reductions in staff. — SG SOURCESaudi Gazzette TAGS Etisalat STC SHARE Facebook Twitter tweet Previous articleSantner wants repeat of tight bowling Next articlePremier League clubs make first transfer profit Ajaz Ali RELATED ARTICLESMORE FROM AUTHOR Mobily offers Connect Roaming packages this school vacation Jawwy from STC launches ‘Ahlan’ to woo young Saudis Honeywell showcases IIOT solutions at Sabic STC ’16 NO COMMENTS LEAVE A REPLY Cancel reply February 2017 S M T W T F S « Jan       1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28   STAY CONNECTED 1,540,763FansLike 42,326FollowersFollow Ads Recent Posts Remarkable Discoveries Feb 3, 2017 When it snows in the Saudi north Feb 3, 2017 Drug test for marriage Feb 3, 2017 Why Makkah’s marble flooring is cool to touch Feb 3, 2017 Syria safe zones: Why, where and at what cost?

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us G Suite brings more security and control options for enterprise users By Ida Torres - February 1, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Google says that there are more than 3 million businesses that are using the enterprise version of the G Suite productivity apps. That means that they should also start strengthening their security and controls as the information of all these businesses are in their hands. That is why the newest announcement from the tech giant involves all these new features they’re offering enterprise users, including the option to use a physical security key, as well as expanding its Data Loss Prevention (DLP) service. Since Google already has a 2-step verification system, they are now adjusting it so that companies have the option of using physical Security Keys as the second step option. Instead of just receiving a code though text, users would need to plug the key in directly in your laptop or pair it with a mobile device. The admins will see usage reports and also choose which employees will have access to certain devices or information. The Data Loss Prevention (DLP) service was only previously available for Gmail, but now they’re expanding it to Google Drive. This will give admins the chance to make sure that employees will not mistakenly share sensitive data outside of the company. They will be able to set up rules not just for documents but also for images using OCR. Enterprises will now also be able to bring in their own S/MIMI encryption, as well as let third-party services like HP Autonomy and Veritas back-up and archive emails, in case companies don’t want to use Gmail and Google Vault.

Researchers from the University of Sussex led the team from around the world, including a team from Google, and say their work has the potential to revolutionise industry, science and commerce on a similar scale as the invention of ordinary computers.  If it works, it will be a real-life version of Deep Thought, the supercomputer programmed to solve the 'ultimate question of life, the universe, and everything' in The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy.   Scroll down for video Researchers from around the world, including a team from Google, have unveiled what they say is the first practical blueprint for the 'holy grail' of computing - a quantum computer. Pictured, the prototype of the core of a trapped ion quantum computer, which the team now says could be operational within two years. WHAT IS A QUANTUM COMPUTER?  The key to a quantum computer is its ability to operate on the basis of a circuit not only being 'on' or 'off' but occupying a state that is both 'on' and 'off' at the same time. This is in accordance with the laws of quantum mechanics, which allow very small particles to exist in multiple 'superposition' states until they are observed or disturbed. In a similar way, a coin spun in the air cannot be said to occupy a 'heads' or 'tails' state until it is caught. While a classical computer has 'bits' made up of zeros and ones, a quantum computer has 'qubits' which can take on the value of zero or one or both simultaneously.     They have released the plans in the hope other teams will build and test the machines. The quantum computer has to the potential to be more powerful in solving certain problems than any computer ever constructed before. 'For many years, people said that it was completely impossible to construct an actual quantum computer,' said Professor Winfried Hensinger, head of the Ion Quantum Technology Group at the University of Sussex, who has been leading this research.  'With our work we have not only shown that it can be done but now we are delivering a nuts and bolts construction plan to build an actual large-scale machine.' As a next step, the team will construct a prototype quantum computer, based on this design, at the University, and say it could be operational within two years. 'It is the Holy Grail of science, really, to build a quantum computer,' Hensinger told The independent.  'Life will change completely. We will be able to do certain things we could never even dream of before.'  Once built, researchers say the computer's capabilities mean it 'would have the potential to answer many questions in science; create new, lifesaving medicines; solve the most mind-boggling scientific problems; unravel the yet unknown mysteries of the furthest reaches of deepest space; and solve some problems that an ordinary computer would take billions of years to compute.'

'The availability of a universal quantum computer may have a fundamental impact on a vast number of research fields and on society as a whole,' the researchers wrote.  It relies on a new invention permitting actual quantum bits to be transmitted between individual quantum computing modules in order to obtain a fully modular large-scale machine capable of reaching nearly arbitrary large computational processing powers.

The effort is part of the UK Government's plan to develop quantum technologies towards industrial exploitation and makes use of a recent invention by the Sussex team to replace billions of laser beams required for quantum computing operations within a large-scale quantum computer with the simple application of voltages to a microchip. Prof Hensinger said: 'The availability of a universal quantum computer may have a fundamental impact on society as a whole.  'Without doubt it is still challenging to build a large-scale machine, but now is the time to translate academic excellence into actual application building on the UK's strengths in this ground-breaking technology.  'I am very excited to work with industry and government to make this happen.' A GIANT MACHINE  The computer's possibilities for solving, explaining or developing could be endless.  However, its size will be anything but small.  The machine is expected to fill a large building, consisting of sophisticated vacuum apparatus featuring integrated quantum computing silicon microchips that hold individual charged atoms (ions) using electric fields.  Even the fastest supercomputers today are still bound by the system of 1's and 0's which enabled the very first machines to make calculations. But experts believe that drawing on the strange properties of the quantum world can enable computers to break free from these binary shackles, creating the most powerful problem-solving machines on the planet.  Quantum supremacy is the term the company uses for its plans  to build the first quantum computer capable of performing calculations out of reach of classical computers. Firm's such as Google hope that quantum computing could be the solution for analysing huge datasets to find optimum solutions. The heart of modern computing is binary code, which has served computers so well for decades. Machines use bits which can be either a 1 or a 0 to process data, but quantum computers are instead based on quantum bits or 'qubits', which can be 1, 0 or even both at the same time. Experts believe researchers at Google are on the verge of a breakthrough in quantum computing, potentially reaching a significant milestone as early as next year and creating a machine which can outperform the most powerful classical computers in existence QUANTUM SUPREMACY  Despite the great promise, one of the major stumbling blocks for the development of quantum computers has been demonstrating they can beat classical computers – achieving what computer scientists call quantum supremacy. Google engineers reported their plans to hit the 42 qubit benchmark in a recent paper, published last month.  Moving much beyond this barrier becomes unworkable for classical computers due to the enormous amounts of memory required.  But if the team can push this to a working machine using a grid of just 50 qubits, it will have created a machine able to beat the best computers which exist today and achieved quantum supremacy.  These qubits rely on the strange quantum property of superposition, in which subatomic particles can exist in haze of no fixed state. Despite the great promise, one of the major stumbling blocks for the development of quantum computers has been demonstrating they can beat classical computers – achieving what computer scientists call quantum supremacy. But this task requires ever increasing amounts of memory. According to New Scientist, using existing classical supercomputers to simulate a 6x4 grid of quantum bits (24 qubits) needs 268 MB of memory, but upping the size to a 6x7 grid (42 qubits) takes an enormous 70 terabytes. Google engineers reported their plans to hit this 42 qubit benchmark in a recent paper, published last month.  Moving much beyond this barrier becomes unworkable for classical computers due to the enormous amounts of memory required. The theory remains a long way from the practice, with the technology firm only publicly confirming it has achieved a 9-qubit machine. Drawing on the strange properties of the quantum world can enable computers to break free from these binary shackles, creating the most powerful problem-solving machines on the planet. It has also worked with Canadian quantum computing firm D-Wave to push the boundaries of quantum computing, working with Nasa's Ames Research Centre But if the team can push this to a working machine using a grid of just 50 qubits, it will have created a machine able to beat the best computers which exist today and achieved quantum supremacy. Commenting on when Google could reach the milestone, Simon Devitt at the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science in Japan, told New Scientist: 'I'm going to be optimistic and say maybe at the end of next year.'  He added: 'If they get it done even within the next five years, that will be a tremendous leap forward.' MailOnline contacted Google for comment.  While all of this remains in the realm of the theoretical, in practice, creating powerful computers which use quantum bits would enable vastly more calculations to run simultaneously. The machines wouldn't replace a desktop computer, or necessarily be able to run software, but could help in raw processing power to process data driven problems. In an era of big data, spanning everything from genetic-based medicine to finance and insurance, finding optimum solutions for specific problems could be life changing.   GOOGLE AND NASA TEAM UP ON QUANTUM COMPUTING Pictured is the first generation of D-Wave quantum computers, the predecessor to those used being tested by Nasa and Google Nasa, Google and the Universities Space Research Association have been working together, installing quantum computers in their Artificial Intelligence laboratories. In 2013, they announced they would use the D-Wave 2X systems which have a 1000 qubit processor. The system has twice as many qubits as the previous generation of quantum computers being used by the organisations, but need to operate at temperatures of -459°F. Doubts have been raised about how effective quantum computers currently are as some research has suggested they are not able to outperform traditional computers. However, Google said quantum computing is a way of solving some of the more complex problems that current traditional computers struggle with. They say these systems are better at dealing with 'messy' sources of data where it can be mislabelled, as information often is in the real world. Writing on its blog, Google said: 'Can we move these ideas from theory to practice, building real solutions on quantum hardware? Answering this question is what the Quantum Artificial Intelligence Lab is for. 'We hope it helps researchers construct more efficient and more accurate models for everything from speech recognition, to web search, to protein folding. 'We actually think quantum machine learning may provide the most creative problem-solving process under the known laws of physics.'

The data reflect safety-related incidents reported by 11 companies that have been testing more than 100 vehicles on public roads, primarily in the Silicon Valley neighborhoods where the technology has grown up. The reports were made to California's Department of Motor Vehicles, which posted them online. The documents catalog the number of times from December 2015 through the end of November that humans took over control from a car's software for safety reasons. Waymo, as Google's self-driving car project was recently rebranded, did far more testing than the other 10 companies combined - and had much greater success. Its fleet drove itself more than 635,000 miles with 124 safety-related "disengagements," which must be reported when the technology fails or the backup driver takes control out of concern the car is malfunctioning. The Google project's disengagement rate was the equivalent of two incidents every 10,000 miles, a notable decrease over the prior year, when there were eight disengagements per 10,000 miles. "This four-fold improvement reflects the significant work we've been doing to make our software and hardware more capable and mature," Dmitri Dolgov, Waymo's head of self-driving technology wrote in a blog post . Waymo's chief critic acknowledged the improvement, but John Simpson of the nonprofit Consumer Watchdog said the number of disengagements shows the cars still "simply aren't ready to be released to roam our roads" without human backup drivers. Other companies also showed improvements. Nissan reported 28 disengagements over 4,099 miles, or 68 incidents per 10,000 miles - far better than the 106 in 1,485 miles (713 per 10,000 miles) it reported last year. Cruise Automation, a startup acquired last year by General Motors, reported driving the second most test miles this year. Cruise said its prototypes had 181 disengagements over 9,776 miles (185 per 10,000 miles) and that it was "pleased with our progress" during testing on the complex streets of San Francisco. The company did not file numbers for 2015 because it did not have a testing permit that year. Though imperfect, the data represent the best peek the public gets into the secretive and fiercely competitive world of self-driving cars and how the prototypes are performing. California required the disengagement reports as part of regulations governing testing on public roads. Separately, the state also requires companies to report any collisions involving its cars. When the technology will be ready for the public depends on several factors, including regulators' readiness and company confidence the vehicles are safe. While Tesla's Elon Musk has been bullish, talking about months rather than years, companies such as Waymo have suggested 2017 or 2018 is more realistic. Tesla's disengagement report said four prototypes drove a total of 550 miles last fall, experiencing 182 disengagements - the equivalent of 3,309 disengagements every 10,000 miles. Tesla logged the miles primarily to develop a publicly posted video , set to the Rolling Stones song "Paint It Black," of the driver's seat perspective in a car where a person does not have to put their hands on the wheel or feet on the pedals. The video promoted how Tesla was shipping cars with advanced sensors that will be activated in the future. Generally, Tesla tests on private land, not public roads. Those disengagements are not reported to the state. Meanwhile, Tesla is gathering tens of millions of miles of real-world data when owners engage the current Autopilot feature, which can control steering and speed but is not sophisticated enough to make the cars self-driving from the regulatory perspective. California's Department of Motor Vehicles has been working for several years on regulations that will govern how the technology can be rolled out to the public when companies believe testing shows it is ready. The state expects to release final "public operation" regulations within six weeks, according to Melissa Figueroa, a spokeswoman for California's State Transportation Agency. The Department of Motor Vehicles, which is part of the agency, made public a first draft in December 2015, nearly a year after final rules were supposed to be in place. The department has since revised the language based on developments at the federal level and input from industry and other groups. The agency and the department declined comment on the reports released Wednesday. ___ Contact Justin Pritchard at https://twitter.com/lalanewsman ___ Data journalist Angeliki Kastanis in Los Angeles contributed.

Rhonda Schaffler Feb 1, 2017 3:31 PM EST Apple ( AAPL)  may have had a blowout quarter, but it wasn't enough to keep it in first place as the world's top global brand. According to valuation and strategy consultant Brand Finance's annual Global 500 report, Alphabet's  ( GOOGL)  Google is now the most valuable brand, dethroning Apple after five straight years. The report uses methodology including financial performance and sustainability, among other factors.  David Haigh, CEO of Brand Finance, says Google dominates search and saw revenues increase 20% in 2016, while Apple has struggled to maintain its technological advantage. He also points to new competitors for Apple in the Chinese market. China figures predominately in Brand Finance's report, with China's bank brands now worth more than those in the U.S.  Chinese bank ICBC made the top ten most valuable brands, while no American financial institution is on the list. Following Google and Apple, the most valuable brand list includes  Amazon ( AMZN) , AT&T ( T) , Microsoft ( MSFT) , Samsung ( SSNLF) , Verizon ( VZ) , Walmart ( WMT)  and Facebook ( FB) . Brand Finance also released a list of the world's most powerful brands, which placed Lego in the top spot. Haigh says Lego has made a brilliant transition into the digital space with games and videos, and is storming ahead of its competitors.

But What's Next? THIS STORY Google Chrome for iOS Is Now Open Source LATER Women Are, Very Slowly, Getting More Seats in the Boardroom YOU ARE HERE:   HOME MOBILE INDUSTRY NEWS THIS STORY Support every customer. Anytime. Anywhere. NEWS OPS By Shirley Siluk. Updated February 1, 2017 10:40AM SHARE ALSO SEE Google Chrome iOS Chromium Browser Open Source Apple Technology News For the first time, developers have open source access to Google's Chrome code for iOS. Google built its Chrome browser on source code from its Chromium open source project, but until now that code repository hasn't included Chrome for iOS. That was because to build the Chrome browser for Apple's mobile operating system, Google needed to use two rendering engines: its own Blink engine and Apple's WebKit engine. While WebKit has been open source since 2005, Google faced "extra complexities" in having to support both engines in its code for iOS, so the company hadn't previously made it open source. By contrast, Chrome for Android has been almost entirely open source since 2015. Before that, the Chromium open source project was focused mostly on the Chrome browser for desktops. Years of Code Changes To Get Here "Historically, the code for Chrome for iOS was kept separate from the rest of the Chromium project due to the additional complexity required for the platform," Googler Rohit Rao wrote yesterday on the Chromium blog. "After years of careful refactoring, all of this code is rejoining Chromium and being moved into the open source repository." By open-sourcing the Chrome for iOS code, Google has made it possible for developers to compile that code just as easily as they can for other versions of Chrome. That will also help speed up development times for new applications built on the Chrome for iOS code. Rao noted that getting to this point has taken some time because of the fact that Chrome for iOS uses both the WebKit and Blink engines. "That created some extra complexities which we wanted to avoid placing in the Chromium code base," Rao said. "Given Chrome's commitment to open source code, we've spent a lot of time over the past several years making the changes required to upstream the code for Chrome for iOS into Chromium. Today, that upstreaming is complete, and developers can compile the iOS version of Chromium like they can for other versions of Chromium." Browser Rendering Improvements On Monday, Google also said that it had rolled out several changes to Chrome's rendering pipeline over the past few months that are designed to help Web site images in the Chrome browser "load faster, run smoother, and use less power." Those changes mean Chrome "now more intelligently skips redundant tasks, chooses optimal rendering algorithms, and better utilizes system hardware," Google painting professional Chris Harrelson said in a blog post. The improvements to Chrome are designed to make it not just faster, but smarter, Harrelson noted. Previously, on a Web page with frequent Document Object Model changes, for example, Chrome would have redrawn any image tiles if some pixels had changed. Now, Harrelson said, "If only a few pixels have changed, it's faster to copy the entire tile from the previous frame and then update the new pixels. Chrome can now intelligently choose the redraw pipeline that will be faster, reducing tile redraw time by up to 40 [percent]." The goal with Chrome's rendering updates is to help Web site displays load at an optimal rate of 60 frames per second, which "feels fast and responsive to users," Harrelson said, adding that additional improvements with that same goal are in the works. "The rendering pipeline is only one piece of the puzzle, and we've got a lot more coming," he said.

Next Article > Women Are, Very Slowly, Getting More Seats in the Boardroom By Stan Choe. Updated February 02, 2017. The number of women sitting at the table in corporate boardrooms across the country is rising very slowly, but it's rising. Just over 15 percent of all director seats at publicly traded U.S. companies were held by women as of Dec. 31, according to a study by Equilar, a corporate research firm. That's up from 14 percent a year earlier and from 12 percent in 2013. So, the trend is toward more equal representation on boards, but parity won't happen until the end of 2055 unless the pace picks up, according to Equilar. That's nearly 40 years away, which may be about when girls born today begin sitting on corporate boards. Demonstrating how far remains to go toward gender parity, 738 companies still have no women on their boards. Last year, nearly 60 companies that had no female directors since at least 2011 added one or more women. Even so, it's still much easier to find a woman in the boardroom than in the corner office, according to a separate, global survey of 3,400 companies by Credit Suisse. While women occupied nearly 15 percent of board seats at the end of 2015, only about 4 percent of CEOs are women. Companies in other countries have gotten closer to gender parity than the United States, and government pressure has played a big role. Several European countries have set quotas and targets for how many corporate board members should be held by women. That's why women held 24 percent of European board seats at the end of 2015, the highest rate in the world. Investors are taking note. Companies with at least one female director tend to have higher stock returns and better corporate performance than those with all-male boards, Credit Suisse says. Of course, this may be a case of correlation rather than causation, and better-performing companies may be more welcoming to women rather than vice versa. Regardless, having women in the most senior leadership positions has other benefits, companies say. At American Water Works Co., the largest publicly traded U.S. water and wastewater utility, five of the nine board positions are held by women. And that's something that customers, regulators and employees, both current and potential future ones, see, says BJ Holdnak, senior vice president of human resources. "We want to look like the customers and the employees that we serve in our local markets," she says. "The board, starting in 2012, really began to focus on assuring that they were diverse and looked like and represented the company." American Water's majority-female board is an anomaly. Just 21 of the 3,525 companies in Equilar's survey have half or more of their board seats held by women. Equilar based its study on the Russell 3000 index, a broad measure of publicly traded U.S. companies. It also runs counter to the male-dominated utility industry. Nearly 80 percent of workers across the industry are men, according to Labor Department statistics. Like American Water, Connecticut Water is another utility that has a majority-female board. It also says it didn't start with the explicit intent of having more women than men on its board. Instead, it happened as the byproduct of looking for a more diverse group to represent its shareholders, customers and employees. Five of the company's eight director seats are held by women. "It's a bit of an arduous process, looking for someone that fulfills what we're driving for in our cultural focus," says Kristen Johnson, corporate secretary and vice president of human resources at Connecticut Water. "We've been super-lucky to find individuals that populate the board like that, and it just so happens that five of them are women." © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

Digital Trends Home > Mobile > T-Mobile may be following Sprint and Rogers to… T-Mobile may be following Sprint and Rogers to offer RCS in Google Messenger By Julian Chokkattu — February 1, 2017 10:35 AM Subscribe Share Don't Fall Behind Stay current with a recap of today's Tech News from Digital Trends Why it matters to you RCS messaging is better than SMS/MMS, and the sooner carriers support Google's open-source platform, the easier it will be for third-party apps to adopt it. T-Mobile may be joining the ranks of carriers like Sprint and Rogers with support for Rich Communication Services (RCS) messaging, an evolution of SMS and MMS. While the company has offered RCS since 2015, the new rollout utilizes Google’s Universal RCS platform. RCS is the next-generation of text messaging — you can send messages longer than 160 characters, have improved group chats, read receipts, high-resolution photo sharing, typing indicators, and more. It’s essentially modernizing text-messaging to be on par with Internet Protocol-based messaging, such as apps like iMessage and Facebook Messenger. More: Google rolls out RCS support for Rogers customers in Canada Google acquired Jibe in 2015, and promised a standardized RCS text-messaging platform that would work with non-Android devices. Unlike IP-based messaging systems, RCS requires carrier implementation — which explains the slow adoption rate. The application that will make use of RCS features on Android is Google Messenger — an app that’s preinstalled on many Android smartphones. When Sprint announced support for Google’s RCS platform, the carrier also said it would preinstall Google Messenger onto every Android phone it sells starting in 2017. T-Mobile hasn’t made any announcements yet, but some customers are reporting that T-Mobile is starting a limited rollout. We are unable to verify whether T-Mobile is rolling out support, though the company has previously stated it will add Jibe support early 2017. We have reached out to T-Mobile and will update this article when we learn more. Other texting apps, like Textra, have announced plans to also support the platform — so you’ll have more options rather than only having to use Google’s app. More: From 5G and bezel-free phones to Android 2.0, these mobile trends will define 2017 We don’t know yet what Verizon’s plans are for RCS, even though it is a signatory for the GSMA Universal Profile. AT&T, on the other hand, offers RCS messaging in its own texting app, but it’s not compatible with Google’s Jibe platform.

By PTI  |  Updated On : February 01, 2017 04:50 PM Sundar Pichai (Getty images) Washington :   Top executives of Silicon Valley, constituting India-born CEOs Google's Sundar Pichai and Microsoft's Satya Nadella, slammed US President Donald Trump's immigration ban on people from seven Muslim-majority countries, claiming that the move is capable of troubling their own staffers and stop bringing amazing talent to the US. Executives from Microsoft, Google, Apple, Netflix, Tesla, Facebook, Uber and other top American companies slammed Trump's immigration order that sparked widespread protests across the US. Trump has signed a sweeping executive order to suspend the arrival of refugees and impose tough new controls on travellers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen, as part of new measures to "keep radical Islamic terrorists" out of America. Condemning the move, Nadella, in a post on LinkedIn, said "As an immigrant and as a CEO, I've both experienced and seen the positive impact that immigration has on our company, for the country, and for the world. We will continue to advocate on this important topic," Microsoft President Brad Smith said as many as 76 Microsoft employees are affected by this new executive order. "We appreciate that immigration issues are important to a great many people across Microsoft at a principled and even personal level, regardless of whether they personally are immigrants. Satya has spoken of this importance on many occasions, not just to Microsoft but to himself personally. He has done so publicly as well as in the private meetings that he and I have attended with government leaders," Smith said. "As a company, Microsoft believes in a strong and balanced high-skilled immigration system," he said. Pichai also criticised Trump's controversial immigration order saying it will create "barriers" to bringing great talent to the US. The Internet search giant also ordered its travelling staff to return to America. Pichai in an email to staff said the US ban on foreign nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries will hit nearly 200 Google employees.

We?re upset about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the US," Pichai said. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was one of the first to address the ban publicly. "We need to keep this country safe, but we should do that by focusing on people who actually pose a threat. Expanding the focus of law enforcement beyond people who are real threats would make all Americans less safe by diverting resources...," he wrote on Facebook. Zuckerberg called for keeping doors open to refugees and those who need help. "That's who we are. Had we turned away refugees a few decades ago, Priscilla's family wouldn't be here today," he said.

Priscilla's parents were refugees from China and Vietnam. The United States is a nation of immigrants, and we should be proud of that," he asserted.  Twitter's CEO Jack Dorsey also condemned the immigration order, saying the "humanitarian and economic impact of the ban is real and upsetting." "Twitter is built by immigrants of all religions. We stand for and with them, always," Twitter said. "We benefit from what refugees and immigrants bring to the US," Dorsey said. Also Read: Travel Ban on Muslims: Trump fires acting attorney general for refusing to defend immigration order Apple CEO Tim Cook expressed concern over the order, saying his company's success is because of the immigrants. "I've heard from many of you who are deeply concerned about the executive order issued yesterday restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. I share your concerns. It is not a policy we support," he wrote to his employees. "There are employees at Apple who are directly affected by yesterday's immigration order. Our HR, Legal and Security teams are in contact with them, and Apple will do everything we can to support them," he said. The Internet Association president and CEO Michael Beckerman said the internet industry is deeply concerned with the implications of Trump?s executive order. "While this order impacts many companies outside of the tech industry, internet companies in particular thrive in the US because the best and the brightest are able to create innovative products and services right here in America," he said. "While we support President Trump's efforts to grow our economy and allow ?people of great talent? to come into the US, the executive order signed yesterday has troubling consequences," Beckerman said. Internet Association member companies ? along with companies in many other industries ? include legal immigrant employees who are covered by these recent executive orders and will not be able to return back to their jobs and families in the US, he said. "Their work benefits our economy and creates jobs here in the United States. We maintain our support for immigration reform and will work with Congress and the Trump Administration on this important issue for families and our economy,? Beckerman said. Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick said he will raise the issue with Trump when he along with other business advisers will meet the US President. "The blanket entry ban on citizens from certain primarily Muslim countries is not the best way to address the country?s challenges," tweeted Elon Musk of Tesla. "Many people negatively affected by this policy are strong supporters of the US. They've done right, not wrong and don't deserve to be rejected," he said. Reed Hastings of Netflix in a Facebook post said Trump's actions are hurting Netflix employees around the world. "Worse, these actions will make America less safe (through hatred and loss of allies) rather than more safe. A very sad week, and more to come with the lives of over 600,000 Dreamers here in a America under imminent threat. It is time to link arms together to protect American values of freedom and opportunity," Hastings said.

Emily Fortuna / Twitter Share Share Tweet Share Comment Email Print advertisement Business is anything but usual for some of America's largest companies, as they question — or blatantly decry — President Trump's immigration ban. Google, Amazon, Starbucks, and Facebook are just a few of the big names to have stepped forward and denounce Trump's executive order, which restricts the entry of refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries, and indefinitely bans Syrian refugees altogether. In the latest scuffle, Apple CEO Tim Cook told the Wall Street Journal on Tuesday his company was considering taking legal action to have Trump's executive order reversed, noting that hundreds of Apple staff had been affected by the travel ban. "More than any country in the world, this country is strong because of our immigrant background and our capacity and ability as people to welcome people from all kinds of backgrounds," Cook told the WSJ. "That's what makes us special. We ought to pause and really think deeply through that." The following Fortune 500 companies have either publicly challenged or expressed concern over the order: Amazon Apple Citigroup Expedia Facebook Ford Goldman Sachs Alphabet Intel JPMorgan Chase MasterCard Microsoft Netflix Nike Procter & Gamble Salesforce Twitter, Square, Airbnb, Github, Etsy, Lyft, Uber, Tesla, and TripAdvisor have also protested the ban, as have pharmaceutical companies sych as Allergan and Perlara. Actions Speak Louder Than Words With so many firms lending their voice to the cause, it must be asked: Is each company genuinely invested in seeing the ban dissolved because of their values — or are some brands just riding the wave of a big marketing moment? The answer is multi-faceted: On one hand, any U.S. company speaking out against the president is taking a risk; on the other hand, it comes down to what actions these brands take beyond their statements. "A lot of people do approve the ban, so these companies are taking a risk just by taking a stance against it," said Margaret Wolfson, founder and creative director at River + Wolf. "But there seem to be three levels involved: The first is in making a statement that brands you as a compassionate believer in American values; the second is in employers looking out for their employees so they feel protected, and the third level — the hardest of all because of the logistics it entails — is going beyond the verbal to the visceral and investing time, energy, and money." Google, Starbucks, Lyft, and Airbnb, are among those companies putting their money where their values are, so to speak. Related: Silicon Valley Has Visceral Reaction to Trump's Ban "We're concerned about the impact of this order and any proposals that could impose restrictions on Googlers and their families, or that could create barriers to bringing great talent to the United States," a Google spokesperson told NBC News. "We'll continue to make our views on these issues known to leaders in Washington and elsewhere." To make its views not only known, but felt, Google created a $4 million crisis fund for those affected by the ban, pledging $2 million that can be matched by up to $2 million from employees to fund organizations such as the ACLU and the International Rescue Committee. Starbucks announced it was developing plans to hire 10,000 refugees over five years in the 75 countries around the world where Starbucks operates. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment, instead referring to chairman and CEO Howard Schultz's public letter to Starbucks partners. Lyft has pledged to donate $1 million to the ACLU over the next four years. A spokesperson for the company declined to comment beyond co-founder and CEO Logan Green's three tweets and Lyft's ACLU blog post. Soon after the ban was issued, Airbnb announced that it would provide free temporary housing to refugees and others impacted by the ban. "This initiative is a part of Airbnb's longstanding commitment to addressing the needs of refugees," said an Airbnb spokesperson, citing the company's past pledge to match up to $1 million donations to UNHCR. Also to be noted is Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos' assertion that Amazon is prepared to support a lawsuit against Trump and his administration over the order, while Twitter's Jack Dorsey released a short film about Syrian refugee and entrepreneur Yassin Tehrou. Thinking on a Global Level Companies campaigning against the ban may not only be looking to protect American values, but their global relationships as well. "A lot of organizations that have and will come out against [Trump's ban] are global firms that need support in other parts of the world," said Ronald Hill, a professor of marketing and business law at Villanova School of Business. "I wouldn't be surprised if global firms coming out against it do business in areas such as Western Europe that have high Muslim populations. You have to think from a global and not just a local perspective." Hill anticipates that more businesses will be chiming in against the ban, particularly those that have a history of prioritizing corporate social responsibility — despite the backlash they may receive. "Some fashion companies came out in support of people with AIDS relatively early on when there was still backlash against that," said Hill. "This is a continuation of that corporate social responsibility, but it's a new, unexplored avenue." How the Work Pays Off While companies embark upon this new avenue, organizations such as the ACLU are prospering more than ever. "Historically, the ACLU doesn't get much support from companies. We're often viewed as a thorn in the government's side because we challenge them on issues," Mark Wier, chief development officer at the ACLU, told NBC News. "But we are seeing some companies create formalized gifts, and hundreds of thousands of small businesses have offered to share proceeds of sales." From last Friday, when Trump issued the immigration ban, to the following Monday, Wier says that the ACLU raised a record $35 million. Related: Celebs and VIPs Donate to ACLU to Fight Trump "We've never seen that kind of outpouring so quickly," said Wier, adding that the ACLU will use the funding to hire over 100 employees including litigators, advocates, and communications specialists. "We need to power up the grid up we've already established with more force," said Wier. "Since the ACLU was able to get a stay on that executive order in federal district court, people are really seeing that it is possible to do something — and to actually win."

Not only is it loud and 360-degree, but it’s also a fairly high-quality speaker. Of course, this was by design as Google Home can be used with some streaming services such as Spotify, Google Play Music, Pandora, and YouTube Music. However, there are many apps that Google Home doesn’t natively support. Luckily, there’s a way around that if you have an Android phone. Google Home shares a lot of aspects with Google’s Chromecast devices, including what essentially equates to having a Chromecast Audio inside of the device. Just like with a Chromecast Audio, you can push audio from a smartphone or tablet directly to Google Home in a number of ways. Cast all Android audio to Google Home If you’re looking to mirror the audio coming out of your smartphone, perhaps for social media or music apps without Chromecast support, like Apple Music, you can do so using the built-in casting functionality. On Google’s Pixel and Nexus smartphones, as well as many other devices running near-stock Android, you can do this through your device’s quick settings menu. However, on any other smartphone, you’ll want to follow the steps below. Ensure your Android device is connected to the same WiFi network as your Google Home Open the Google Home app for Android Access the side-menu of the app and tap Cast Screen/Audio  Tap the “Cast Screen/Audio” button Select the Google Home device you want audio to play from Start playing audio on your Android device To stop audio casting, simply pull down your notification shade, and tap the “Disconnect” option. Unfortunately, there’s not currently a way to mirror all device audio like this using an iOS device (iPhone/iPad/Apple Watch). Cast Google Play Music, PocketCasts, other Chromecast apps If all you want to do is play music from an app, odds are that app already has full support for Chromecast streaming, so the above workaround isn’t necessary. Popular apps like Pandora, Google Play Music, and PocketCasts (and more) all have that support built in, making it easy to push audio over to a Google Home device. Simply open the app, find the Chromecast icon (pictured below), and select the Google Home device you want to stream to. Cast audio from Spotify to Google Home One popular streaming app that does officially support casting audio (but doesn’t make it obvious) is Spotify. To cast through Spotify, you need to begin playing a song on your device, open the “now playing screen” and select the “devices available” option at the bottom of the screen. From there, you should see a list of Spotify-compatible devices on your network, and any Google Home devices on that network will be listed as well.

Google built its Chrome browser on source code from its Chromium open source project, but until now that code repository hasn't included Chrome for iOS. That was because to build the Chrome browser for Apple's mobile operating system, Google needed to use two rendering engines: its own Blink engine and Apple's WebKit engine. While WebKit has been open source since 2005, Google faced "extra complexities" in having to support both engines in its code for iOS, so the company hadn't previously made it open source. By contrast, Chrome for Android has been almost entirely open source since 2015. Before that, the Chromium open source project was focused mostly on the Chrome browser for desktops. Years of Code Changes To Get Here "Historically, the code for Chrome for iOS was kept separate from the rest of the Chromium project due to the additional complexity required for the platform," Googler Rohit Rao wrote yesterday on the Chromium blog. "After years of careful refactoring, all of this code is rejoining Chromium and being moved into the open source repository." By open-sourcing the Chrome for iOS code, Google has made it possible for developers to compile that code just as easily as they can for other versions of Chrome. That will also help speed up development times for new applications built on the Chrome for iOS code. Rao noted that getting to this point has taken some time because of the fact that Chrome for iOS uses both the WebKit and Blink engines. "That created some extra complexities which we wanted to avoid placing in the Chromium code base," Rao said. "Given Chrome's commitment to open source code, we've spent a lot of time over the past several years making the changes required to upstream the code for Chrome for iOS into Chromium. Today, that upstreaming is complete, and developers can compile the iOS version of Chromium like they can for other versions of Chromium." Browser Rendering Improvements On Monday, Google also said that it had rolled out several changes to Chrome's rendering pipeline over the past few months that are designed to help Web site images in the Chrome browser "load faster, run smoother, and use less power." Those changes mean Chrome "now more intelligently skips redundant tasks, chooses optimal rendering algorithms, and better utilizes system hardware," Google painting professional Chris Harrelson said in a blog post. The improvements to Chrome are designed to make it not just faster, but smarter, Harrelson noted. Previously, on a Web page with frequent Document Object Model changes, for example, Chrome would have redrawn any image tiles if some pixels had changed. Now, Harrelson said, "If only a few pixels have changed, it's faster to copy the entire tile from the previous frame and then update the new pixels. Chrome can now intelligently choose the redraw pipeline that will be faster, reducing tile redraw time by up to 40 [percent]." The goal with Chrome's rendering updates is to help Web site displays load at an optimal rate of 60 frames per second, which "feels fast and responsive to users," Harrelson said, adding that additional improvements with that same goal are in the works. "The rendering pipeline is only one piece of the puzzle, and we've got a lot more coming," he said.

Microsoft Saved from RHEL Disaster Next Article > AT&T Launching Ultra-Fast 5G Networks in 2 US Cities By Shirley Siluk / Sci-Tech Today PUBLISHED: FEBRUARY 02 2017 During its Innovation Summit in San Francisco yesterday, AT&T unveiled plans to begin moving toward 5G wireless Internet services with launches in Austin and Indianapolis in the coming months. The move toward faster, next-generation connection speeds is part of a larger network innovation program that AT&T is kicking off with the nonprofit Linux Foundation. That program, also announced yesterday, was set into motion when AT&T transitioned its network automation platform, called ECOMP, into an open source software project led by the foundation. The project "will allow software, network, IT and cloud providers and developers to rapidly create new services in response to evolving customer requirements," according to the foundation. AT&T's ECOMP platform takes its name from the software service areas it covers: enhanced control, orchestration, management and policy. '5G Evolution Markets' Meanwhile, as part of its latest network upgrade plan, AT&T will roll out faster wireless services to customers in Austin and Indianapolis over the next few months. Initially, those first "5G Evolution Markets" will offer wireless connectivity with theoretical speeds of 400 Mbps (megabits per second) or higher, AT&T said. "As we continue densifying our network and deploying technologies, like carrier aggregation and LTE-License Assisted Access (LAA), we expect to enable theoretical peak speeds up to 1 Gbps [gigabit per second] in some areas in 2017," the company noted in a statement. As part of its transition to next-generation network services, AT&T said it also expects two new 5G test beds now in development at its labs in Austin go "on-air" this spring. Those testbeds will explore 5G deployment at both indooor and outdoor locations and will feature "flexible infrastructure to allow modifications and updates as 5G standards develop," the company said. The "massive bandwidth and low latency" that 5G technologies will make possible will help advance applications ranging from virtual reality headsets and mobile augmented reality to self-driving cars, AT&T added. AT&T 'Indigo' also Uses AI, Machine Learning AT&T's ECOMP platform, which is now open source, forms the foundation for AT&T Network 3.0 Indigo, the company's new software-defined network service. In addition to 5G technologies, Indigo also uses big data, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning, AT&T said. According to the Linux Foundation, the fact that AT&T open-sourced its ECOMP software "represents one of the company's most important open source contributions to create a fully open network automation platform." Besides AT&T, other organizations participating in the new Linux Foundation project include Amdocs, Bell Canada, Brocade, Ericsson, Huawei, IBM, Intel, Metaswitch and Orange. "The launch of this project is one of the most momentous steps forward for open source networking," Linux Foundation executive director Jim Zemlin said in a statement. "With over two years of production experience, ECOMP allows users to create new services in an automated manner." The Linux Foundation said it expects to present more details about the open source project during its Open Networking Summit, scheduled for April 3-6 in Santa Clara, Calif.

She's grounded. Her mom took away her phone.— Jennifer Iacopelli (@jennifercarolyn) January 31, 2017 The story, as told to Twitter, goes: When Iacopelli asked why the crying student was grounded, she claimed that someone had “hacked” her English paper, adding “inappropriate things” to the assignment, which her mother believed she had written.  She says that someone "hacked" her English paper and wrote very inappropriate things in it. When she and her mom sat down to work on it last— Jennifer Iacopelli (@jennifercarolyn) January 31, 2017 night, her mom saw it and FREAKED on her (rightly so IMO). The student is 12 and if my 12yo had written this it would have been DEATH.— Jennifer Iacopelli (@jennifercarolyn) January 31, 2017 The student insisted that the inappropriate additions to her paper, which she’d been working on using Google Docs, were not her own. Intrigued by the alleged hacking, Iacopelli went on the hunt to figure out how the paper ended up in this condition. However, student INSISTS that she didn't write it. So I go into her Google Doc account and see that the changes were made at 2:16pm.— Jennifer Iacopelli (@jennifercarolyn) January 31, 2017 Student says, "I was on the bus then!" So I pull up the camera security footage we have in the library computer lab for 2:16pm.— Jennifer Iacopelli (@jennifercarolyn) January 31, 2017 There are three boys sitting around a computer, two hovered over another who is typing. I rewind the footage and see Student!— Jennifer Iacopelli (@jennifercarolyn) January 31, 2017 She turns away from her desk at the end of the previous period, monitor times out, she gets up and walks away. 5 minutes later boys sit down— Jennifer Iacopelli (@jennifercarolyn) January 31, 2017 After parsing through edits on Google Docs and diving into library security footage, Iacopelli realized that the student had used a library computer to work on the paper ― and that the computer she used earlier in the afternoon was used by three boys after her. The security footage showed that the boys had tampered with the paper after the student likely left Google Docs open. One nudges the mouse and the screen lights up, still on Student's Google doc, which they hover over a for a good 15 minutes typing.— Jennifer Iacopelli (@jennifercarolyn) January 31, 2017 After showing the footage to another library aide, Iacopelli realized they could track the boys down. I wait the footage out, see them turn around a few times and screenshot it. Ask one of the library aides. She knows one of them!— Jennifer Iacopelli (@jennifercarolyn) January 31, 2017 Then I check my sign-in records for the period! Three boys about the same age signed in together. Look up their student records and SHOCK!— Jennifer Iacopelli (@jennifercarolyn) January 31, 2017 Actually not shock, because BAM their pictures match the kids in the surveillance footage. All 3 written up, in school suspension.— Jennifer Iacopelli (@jennifercarolyn) January 31, 2017 Long story short, all three boys were punished for their paper sabotage, all thanks to the librarian’s expert investigative work. But that wasn’t the only good news: Student's grounding has been lifted and Mom said that she'll be returning her phone to her when she gets home today!— Jennifer Iacopelli (@jennifercarolyn) January 31, 2017 Clearly, Iacopelli is a badass.  Lesson: your friendly librarian is better at technology than you, so don't pull crap like that.

Tech Culture by Michelle Meyers February 1, 2017 10:45 AM PST @meymichelle Up Next Tech companies newest cause celebre? Boycott Breitbart Lewis carves out a name for herself with "The Death of Cleopatra." Google The Google Doodle celebrating American sculptor Edmonia Lewis is vibrant, just as she was known to be in reshaping convention. Google kicked off Black History Month on Wednesday by saluting Lewis, a New York native who was the first female of black and Native American descent to become a renowned sculptor in the western tradition. The doodle depicts her with one of her most famous works, "The Death of Cleopatra," which is housed in the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, DC. Lewis, whose Native American name was Wildfire, is perhaps best known for incorporating her own cultures into her Neoclassical style sculpture. She was born in 1844 and lived into the early years of the 20th century. "Her work paid homage to the abolitionists and Civil War heroes of her day, including John Brown and Col. Robert Gould Shaw," Google's description of her reads. "Decades later, Lewis' legacy continues to thrive through her art and the path she helped forge for women and artists of color. Today, we celebrate her and what she stands for -- self-expression through art, even in the face of adversity." Tech Enabled: CNET chronicles tech's role in providing new kinds of accessibility.

Josh Edelson / AFP/Getty Images View Slideshow 2 of 2 Until recently, a phone number at the top of Google search for "Facebook customer service" led callers to a scam, NPR has found. Google / Screenshot by NPR Listen Listening... / Imagine that one day you're kicked off Facebook. It happens, regularly. You may not know why exactly. It looks like an algorithm may have done it — and now you need to reach a human being at the company to get back on. NPR has interviewed more than two dozen users in that situation — all people who rely on Facebook to do their work, make their living. Their stories, which we'll share in a separate article, made us wonder: If you needed to reach Facebook, what would you do? Many people would go online and search for "Facebook customer service." We tried that, and got this number: 844-735-4595. It was prominently displayed as the top search result on Google. Google even made it a "featured snippet" — that is, a result highlighted in a box at the top, enhanced to draw user attention and lend credibility. Please do not call it. You will get someone real — just not from Facebook. The first time NPR called, someone picked up and then put the phone down — maybe on a table. You could hear mumbling in the room. It felt suspicious. So NPR gave the number to Pindrop, a company that specializes in phone fraud. A Pindrop researcher, who has to remain anonymous for his work, called up and recorded as he pretended to be a Facebook user in distress. A call center operator named "Steven" — who, according to Pindrop analysis, is based in India — says: "Thanks for calling Facebook." He is pretending to be a Facebook employee. The Pindrop researcher plays along and explains he is locked out of his Facebook account. He needs help getting reactivated. "Steven" gives him very unusual advice: Go to a Wal-Mart or a Target. "Just walk up over there and tell them to provide you an iTunes card. OK? And on the backside of that iTunes card there would be a 16-digit security code." Maybe you see where this is going. Steven continues: "You need to call us back on this same number and provide me that 16-digit security code so that I can activate that access and we'll be giving you the password for your new — for your old account." This is a scam. The top Google search result for "Facebook customer service" led to a person asking for codes on iTunes gift cards. This is a well-known method of stealing from innocent people online. (Both Apple and the Federal Trade Commission have issued alerts about it.) That toll-free "Facebook" line was not just on Google. That number and others have been circulating on Facebook itself, on pages where users are asking for help, for at least a year. In one instance, a user asked whether the number was valid and a member of the company's Help Team responded: "There isn't a number to contact Facebook. ... It sounds like the email or notification you saw is likely a scam." It's unclear whether the Help Team member reported it to her superiors to investigate. "Wow. Wow. Wow. That's crazy," says Marty Weintraub, founder of Aimclear Marketing. He wrote a leading industry book on Facebook advertising, long before the rest of the world realized the company would dominate the Internet economy. "This is an astonishing result." He also wrote a book on how to manipulate search results, to get your brand or product up on top. He knows that companies monitor their search results, to see what their customers want, and that criminals and competitors try to exploit powerful brands. These are standard practices. What Weintraub finds astonishing is that a term as basic as "Facebook customer service" slipped through the cracks. "It's not like somebody's searching for 'Hey, what color are Mark Zuckerberg's socks?' It's not like it's something that's off the beaten path," Weintraub says. "So one would think that a company as large as Facebook would be monitoring [the] search engine results page for a major query surrounding their services." According to Google data, "Facebook customer service" gets searched, on average, about 27,000 times a month in the U.S. Weintraub says that is sizable, that Facebook should have known about it "almost the first minute" it came up, and that the company should have guarded its users. "I'd be so scared," he says. "These are people who are looking for help with the product and they're getting scammed. OMG." NPR informed Facebook and Google about the scam line. Facebook said that it has been investigating the group associated with this toll-free number for some time; that this group is targeting many platforms; and that it's up to Google to explain why it displays certain search results. A Google spokesperson said in a statement that the company has taken steps to remove the fraudulent number. Neither company explained how the prominent search result went unnoticed. And to be clear, Facebook does not have a phone number for regular users to call. It does have an online help center, located here. (Facebook pays NPR and other leading news organizations to produce live video streams.) NPR's Aarti Shahani has started a page on Facebook for people to share concerns about the platform. It's called Tell Zuck. If you use Facebook for work, and find you're unable to reach the company, tell her your story at www.facebook.com/tellzuck. Copyright 2017 NPR. To see more, visit http://www.npr.org/. STEVE INSKEEP, HOST: Here's something that Americans experience quite often - they get kicked off of Facebook. They don't know why. They try to ask the company for help and can't get it. NPR's Aarti Shahani has been talking with people in that situation. AARTI SHAHANI, BYLINE: I've been speaking with Facebook users who rely on the platform to make their living. Their stories, which we'll share later today, made me start to wonder if I needed to reach the company, what would I do? Facebook pays NPR and other news organizations to produce live videos, we have a direct relationship. But if I were just a regular user, I'd Google Facebook customer service. I tried that, and I got this number - 844-735-4595. Do not call it. STEVEN: Thanks for calling Facebook. This is Steven (ph), how can I help you? SHAHANI: You will get someone real, just not from Facebook. This is a recording of a phone call made by the company Pindrop which specializes in phone fraud. The first time I called the toll-free number, someone picked up and then put the phone down, maybe on a table. I could hear mumbling in the room. It felt suspicious, so I asked Pindrop to look into it. A Pindrop researcher, who has to remain anonymous for his work, decided to record as he pretended to be a Facebook user in distress. UNIDENTIFIED MAN: Actually I'm having trouble with my Facebook account. SHAHANI: He says he needs help logging in. Steven, who according to Pindrop analysis is based in India, tells him to go to a Wal-Mart or a Target. STEVEN: Just walk over there and tell them to provide you an iTunes card, OK? UNIDENTIFIED MAN: OK. STEVEN: And on the backside of that iTunes card there will be a 16-digit security code. SHAHANI: Keep listening. STEVEN: And you need to call us back on the same number and provide me that 16-digit security code so that I can activate that access and we'll be giving you the password for your new - for your old account. SHAHANI: This is a scam. The top Google search result for Facebook customer service led to a man asking Facebook account holders to buy iTunes gift cards and hand over the codes. Apple and federal regulators have issued warnings about this kind of scam. And that toll-free number was not just on Google, it and others have been circulating on Facebook on pages where people are asking for help for at least a year. MARTY WEINTRAUB: Wow. Wow. Wow. That's crazy. SHAHANI: That's Marty Weintraub with Aimclear marketing. He wrote a leading industry book on Facebook advertising long before the rest of the world realized the company would dominate the internet economy. WEINTRAUB: This is an astonishing result. SHAHANI: Weintraub also wrote a book on how to manipulate search results to get your brand or product up on top. He knows that companies monitor their search results to see what their customers want, and that criminals and competitors try to exploit brands. These are standard practices. What Weintraub finds astonishing is that a term as basic as Facebook customer service slipped through the company's cracks. WEINTRAUB: Well, it's not like somebody searching for, hey, what color are Mark Zuckerberg's socks? It's not like it's something that's off the beaten path, so one would think that a company as large as Facebook would be monitoring search engine results page for major queries surrounding their services.

The value of Google’s brand was put at £86.7billion, an increase of 24 per cent on the previous year. Apple’s slumped 28 per cent to £84billion. Alamy 2 Google has taken over as most valuable brand in the world The 2017 rankings came from Brand Finance, whose chief David Haigh said: “Apple has struggled to maintain its technological advantage. “New versions of the iPhone delivered diminishing returns. “There are signs the company has reached saturation point for its brand.” The consultants’ report said Google remained largely unchallenged in its main search business with ad revenues up a fifth. Coca-Cola was down 11 places to 27th and Pepsi fell 13 to 67th as scrutiny around the marketing of sugary drinks to kids gained pace. Alamy 2 Apple have lost the top spot after five years But Visa (up 44 places to 57th) and MasterCard (up 55 places to 110th) gained in the move to a cashless society.

Brian Solis / Flickr By John Wenz Jan 5, 2016 Facebook is no stranger to "Is this in my terms of service?" experiments, like when they performed a psychology experiment on unsuspecting users. But a report from The Information  indicates they didn't quite learn their lesson. In order to test the limits of how much their user base would put up with constant app crashes, the company intentionally crashed the app multiple times.  Partly, the move is over a contentious relationship Facebook has with Google. The search engine giant alleges that the social networking site deployed a series of apps within the app over Google's terms of service for the Google Play store. Facebook wanted a contingency plan in case the app was taken off of Google Play. Instead, the app would come preloaded on Android phones through deals between Facebook and phone manufacturers like Samsung. Advertisement - Continue Reading Below Most of the article from The Information is about the bickering between Facebook and Google, and the information about the experiment is buried near the end. Amir Efrati writes: Facebook has tested the loyalty and patience of Android users by secretly introducing artificial errors that would automatically crash the app for hours at a time, says one person familiar with the one-time experiment. The purpose of the test, which happened several years ago, was to see at what threshold would a person ditch the Facebook app altogether. The company wasn't able to reach the threshold. "People never stopped coming back," this person says. Most Popular Efrati also notes that the company temporarily took the app out of the Google Play store in some regions to test audience reaction, then providing a link to those users on how to install the app through a backdoor in the phones. There were some hiccups along the way, but the experiments results weren't disastrous, according to an anonymous interviewee for the story. So yeah, Android users. There's why your Facebook app crashed.   Source: The Information More from Popular Mechanics: More From Apps Apps Share This App Simulates Vintage AOL Instant Messenger GIF Apps Share Listen to the Nightmare Babbling of a Computer Learning to Talk GIF Apps Share Go Download Your Vines Before It's Too Late Apps Share Facebook Is Buying Data on Your Offline Activities Apps Share How to Find and Play All of Facebook's Hidden Games Apps Share Now You Can Tell Uber to Take You to a Person Instead of a Place Apps Share University of Michigan, Google Team Up On Flint Water Crisis App GIF Apps Share This Simulation Is So Good It's Hard to Believe It's Not Real GIF Apps Share Amazon Go Could End Checkout Lines for Good Apps Share The 16 Best Android Apps You Should Download Right Now New Technology Apps google facebook Facebook False Alarm Frightens Users Who Were Nowhere Near Bombing How Facebook Will Keep Its Future Drones From Crashing This Is Google's Latest Ploy to Lure Apple Users to Android Dead Facebook Users Could Outnumber the Living by 2098 The Most Abundant Material on Earth Has Been Seen for the First Time Elusive Black Seadevil Anglerfish Has Been Captured on Video for the First Time More From Apps PM_Logo Created with Sketch.

Digital Trends Xiaomi Mi Mix review Xiaomi’s exquisite Mi Mix is the future of smartphones, no time machine needed Share Innovative, exquisite, and powerful: The Mi Mix is a vision of smartphones to come. Innovative, exquisite, and powerful: The Mi Mix is a vision of smartphones to come. Innovative, exquisite, and powerful: The Mi Mix is a vision of smartphones to come. Highs Stunning bezel-less screen Beautifully built ceramic body Powerful processor Massive battery Lows Slippery and fragile Limited connectivity options Import only, and expensive DT Editors' Rating 6.0 Scores Explained Home > Product Reviews > Phone Reviews > Xiaomi Mi Mix review By Andy Boxall Posted on 01.30.17 Research Center: Xiaomi Mi Mix This is the Xiaomi Mi Mix, and you’re allowed to say “wow.” It may look like concept phone, a vision of the future, but you can actually buy it right now. The most striking feature is the almost bezel-less screen, which takes up almost the entire front of the device, and extends right up into the top corners. The technology to make this possible is amazing, but has Xiaomi come up with a usable phone that represents the future of smartphone design? We’ve been finding out. Drop dead gorgeous You can’t stop staring at the Mi Mix. It’s beautiful in a way that other smartphones simply aren’t. Designs tend to follow the same trend, and although other phones may be attractive, they don’t even come close to the pure visual excitement generated by the Mi Mix. Why? Because it’s all screen. The 6.4-inch IPS LCD has an unusual 17:9 aspect ratio and covers more than 90 percent of the front panel. The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge manages 76 percent screen. A 14 percent difference may not sound much, but just look at the pictures. It’s an absolute world away from the S7 Edge. Look at the top corners, for instance. They don’t end in a right angle, but actually curve with the body. It’s not visual trickery either, the edge of the screen is really curved. Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Andy Boxall/Digital Trends The Mi Mix is otherwise a very simple shape, and its glorious minimalism doesn’t stand out until you start examining the subtleties, from the “Mix designed by Mi” wording on the back, to the absolute lack of speakers or sensors on the front. Instead, the speaker is behind the screen itself and uses specially designed piezoelectric technology to transmit sound to your ear. Xiaomi has taken away the regular proximity sensor, too, making way for an ultrasonic module, which is located behind the screen. The Mi Mix isn’t all looks, it’s also an impressive technical achievement. More: Xiaomi Redmi Pro review The body is superbly built. It’s made from ceramic, rather than metal and glass. Our review model came in glossy black, but Xiaomi now makes a white version, too. It’s stunning, but unless you carry a cloth around with you, or wear white gloves like you’re cradling a priceless artefact every time you pick the phone up, it’s going to get covered in fingerprints and smudges. Really, really covered. The Mi Mix isn’t all looks, it’s also an impressive technical achievement. Fingerprints aren’t the only problem. The Mi Mix is so slippery, it’s like it’s actively trying to escape. No matter how you hold it, it slips, wriggles, and slides around in a continuous bid for freedom. The ceramic body offers no resistance, and there’s no texture or ridges down the side. Engage in just about any activity from taking photos to checking your email, and you run the gauntlet of the Mi Mix taking a dive. It’s almost essential to wrap the phone up in a case, unless you like the feeling that an awfully expensive accident is about to happen every second of the day. Not to worry, owning the Mi Mix is like having a partner you absolutely adore. You’ll make ridiculous concessions just to be with them. We’ve taken to wearing a pair of grippy rubber kitchen gloves all the time. No more fingerprints, and no more worrying about accidents. Sure, people stare when you wear the pink ones, but when the Mi Mix is in your hand, you’ll be so smitten you won’t care. Stellar performance Our Mi Mix came with 6GB of RAM and a Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor running at 2.35GHz, but when clearing the RAM, only about 4GB of RAM was ever listed as available for use by apps. A cheaper alternative model with 4GB of RAM as standard is also available, but you won’t get the 18k gold accents around the camera lens and fingerprint sensor, either. The Snapdragon 821 chip has proved to be an excellent performer, and we’ve enjoyed using it before in the OnePlus 3T and the Google Pixel phones. It’s equally superb here, keeping the operating system zipping along, making web browsing and app use fast and fault free, plus it has superb gaming ability. Games are more fun on the Mi Mix’s big, bright, and beautiful screen. I hesitate to say more immersive, because it doesn’t seem possible; but the right game is definitely more engrossing here. Danmaku Unlimited, an all-action bullet-hell game, plays beautifully in HD on Hard mode; yet despite being a game I’ve played many times, it was just that little bit more exciting, due to the Mi Mix’s combination of no bezel and a large screen size. Andy Boxall/Digital Trends Xiaomi hasn’t gone mad with the display, opting for an IPS LCD panel and a 1,920 x 1,080 pixel resolution. It doesn’t suck the battery dry in moments, and is perfect for online video. Watch YouTube, tap the fullscreen button, and videos take up the whole of the display, curved corners included, rather than being squeezed down into an unusual format, or not supporting the full display. It’s a real treat. Put the Mi Mix through a couple of benchmark tests, and AnTuTu 3D gives it an incredible 153,637, putting it in the top five overall results. Xiaomi has stuffed a whopping 4,400mAh battery inside the Mi Mix, which by most modern standards, is huge. It’s an equally large benefit, too, and we easy got two days regular use out of the phone before feeling the need to plug it in the charger. This was more down to battery anxiety than any alerts the phone sent out. More: Facebook’s new head of virtual reality is former Xiaomi, Google man Hugo Barra In case it’s not obvious, there’s more than enough power, energy, and speed for everyone inside the Mi Mix. Highly customized Android Marshmallow Disappointingly, but not surprisingly, the Mi Mix has Android 6.0 Marshmallow installed. It’s not the latest version 7.0 Nougat, mainly due to MIUI, Xiaomi’s own user interface. It modifies Android extensively, to the point where Android Pay won’t work because it considers MIUI a custom version of the operating system. Does the interface make it unpleasant? Not really. Version 8 of MIUI is installed, and our imported version came with Google Play all ready to go. That means you don’t have to deal with Xiaomi’s app store, and can install all the usual Google apps — from Maps to YouTube — directly from Play. Early setup takes a while, but we’ve never had any issues with installation or updates on a Xiaomi device. Our review model came with a selection of pre-installed Xiaomi tools — including a QR code scanner, a compass app, a voice recorder, and the usual contacts, mail, music, file explorer, and calendar apps — but that’s all. Standard phone operation is dealt with by Xiaomi’s dialer, messaging app, and web browser. Anyone who has used Android on a Nexus or Pixel phone, will notice alterations to the notification shade and the settings menu, plus that app icons are spread across home screens and not in an app drawer. There are a few decent apps provided by Xiaomi. The standard web browser is fast, the weather app is pretty and information packed, and the calendar app is easy to use. If you don’t like the minimalist look of MIUI’s app icons, or want to change a variety of aspects, there are many different themes available to download and apply. Dig deeper, and MIUI can be customized to an even greater degree. Yes, we’d rather the phone ran regular Android, but MIUI is easy to use and attractive to look at. It’s also the price you have to pay for importing a phone from China, where Google services are barred, and we vastly prefer it over most other Chinese manufacturer user interfaces. We do worry about security threats on outdated versions of Android, and we hope to see the Mi Mix get the Nougat update sooner rather than later. However, Xiaomi doesn’t have a good track record with updates, so don’t hold your breath. If you care about security and up-to-date Android, this phone isn’t the one for you. Average camera performance Xiaomi hasn’t gone mad with the Mi Mix’s camera setup, so you get a 16-megapixel rear camera and a specially produced 5-megapixel selfie cam under the screen. That’s right, under the screen. Let’s talk about that one first. Xiaomi had to source a really small module for its front camera, because it has to fit in a very small space in the only bezeled area on the phone, just below the screen. This isn’t the ideal spot for a selfie cam, unless taking photos with a great view up your nose is your thing. To get around the awkward placement, when you swap to the front cam the phone tells you to rotate it so the camera is in a more traditional position, and the app rotates accordingly. That’s fine if you only use Xiaomi’s camera app, but not if you want to use Instagram, Snapchat, or any other photo app’s camera mode. Sure it works, but the camera gets blocked by your hand, or your picture comes out at a weird angle. Flip the phone on its head, and the app doesn’t follow, so it’s upside down, making it awkward to tap a shutter release button. The volume button sometimes activates the shutter to make life easier, but not in every app. The quality is only average once you do snap a selfie, but there are some fun live filters to try out, and a very good beauty mode with a pro and smart setting. Smart is the way to go, and it actually enhances the shot. Around the back is a 16-megapixel camera with a Sony IMX318 sensor, an f/2.0 aperture, and phase-detection autofocus. Sadly, there’s no optical image stabilization, but there is electronic stabilization. The specs may not be stellar, and although we’ve been spoiled by some great dual-lens cameras recently, the Mi Mix’s rear camera takes good pictures. However, the HDR mode is aggressive — pushing out shadows and really enhancing blue skies, — and although we found the pictures pleasing, some may prefer the way the camera performs without it. More: Xiaomi’s Mi Box Android TV streaming box is now available in the U.S. The Mi Mix is happy to blur the background of images very effectively, leading to some great bokeh shots without the need for a second lens. The same set of filters for the selfie cam can be applied to the rear camera, plus there’s a panorama mode, a tilt-shift setting, and a manual mode. It’s not a standout camera, but it’s not a failure, either. We’ve been happy with the overall results from the Mi Mix. Calls and connectivity How do you hear people during a call if the Mi Mix doesn’t have a speaker? Xiaomi has used special piezoelectric technology behind the screen to transmit sound through it, similar to how bone-conducting sound works. The effect is unusual, but there’s no noticeable drop in quality of volume. The Mi Mix is so slippery, it’s like it’s actively trying to escape. In fact, it works really well, and is arguably better than a traditional speaker. Why? It doesn’t really matter where the Mi Mix is held against your ear, the top, middle, or lower part of the display still delivers the same amount of volume and clarity. The ultrasonic proximity sensor doesn’t seem to be quite as successful. It rarely shut down the screen when the phone was against my face, and sometimes accidentally activated an app. It doesn’t dim the screen if you put your hand over the screen though, which is good. Because the Mi Mix is an imported phone that’s not really designed for use outside of Xiaomi’s regular territories, it doesn’t come with all the necessary bands to connect to all the usual U.S. networks. Use an AT&T or T-Mobile SIM card and you’ll mostly see 3G data speeds, with 4G unlikely. We tested the Mi Mix in the U.K. with the O2 network, and primarily connected at 3G, too, although there is a better chance of 4G using EE. This is a common issue with imported smartphones, not just Xiaomi’s devices. Warranty, availability, and price Just because the Mi Mix sounds like a concept phone, doesn’t mean it’s not for sale. You can buy it right now, if you’re prepared to pay a hefty price, and do some searching. Our review Mi Mix was supplied by GearBest, a popular importer of Chinese electronics, where the new white model is priced at just over $1,000. Yes, $1,000. Don’t forget, this is a cutting-edge smartphone, produced in small numbers, and that means you pay a premium for the pleasure of owning one. Xiaomi Mi Mix Compared To LeEco Le S3 Huawei Mate 9 ASUS Zenfone 3 Deluxe Special… Lenovo Phab 2 Pro Meizu M3 Max ZTE Axon 7 LeEco Le Pro3 HTC Bolt Google Pixel Google Pixel XL LG X Power Lenovo Moto G4 Play Lenovo Moto Z Alcatel Idol 4S Samsung Galaxy S7 Active The black version isn’t in stock at GearBest at the time of writing, but that is likely to change regularly, along with the final price, which depends on the currency exchange rate. If you want a Mi Mix, you’ll need to have patience and put in some effort to find one. There are other importers, but GearBest has always delivered a faultless service, and provides a comprehensive warranty should your phone breakdown. This consists of a three-day dead-on-arrival warranty, a 45-day money back guarantee if the phone should be faulty during that time, plus a one-year warranty to cover against defects. You’ll still have to get support from China primarily by email and snail mail, but it really shouldn’t put you off. If you break the phone due to mistreatment, drop it in the bath, or change the software and brick the phone, it won’t be covered. Our Take Exquisite to look at, vastly powerful, and technically compelling: The Xiaomi Mi Mix represents the future of smartphones, and it’s available right now. Is there a better alternative? If you want the Mi Mix’s amazing screen, then no, there isn’t any alternative. The Mi Mix is unique. If you want a phone with a stunning ceramic body, then you won’t find one of those, either. The camera, processor, and operating system aren’t unique, and in two of those three areas, the Mi Mix isn’t top of the class. The camera is strong, but there are considerably better choices out there. MIUI isn’t as nice as the standard Android Nougat found on a Google Pixel XL. The Pixel XL is our top Android phone recommendation. Its regular software updates, 24/7 customer support, strong specs, and great camera make it the best Android phone you can buy. The Huawei Mate 9, the iPhone 7 Plus, and even a cheaper flagship phone like the OnePlus 3T are all phones you should buy instead of the Mi Mix. The DT Accessory Pack Original Xiaomi Mi Band 2 heart rate monitor $35.72 Luanke Transparent TPU soft phone case $2.82 Xiaomi Mi Mix case $7.99 Although none of these alternatives come close to matching the intoxicating style and bleeding edge tech of the Xiaomi phone, they are your best options right now. However, we recommend waiting to buy a new phone until April at the earliest, because several other major flagships — including the LG G6, Samsung Galaxy S8, and iPhone 8 — are all rumored to offer similar bezel-free designs. All of these phones will also be compatible with U.S. networks and sold through official channels and carriers. How long will it last? If the Mi Mix takes a tumble, it won’t last very long at all. Screens that go all the way to the edge of the body may strike any hard surface sharply, and it’s unlikely to survive. When the phone in question is more slippery than a haddock that has been bathing in baby oil, it’s a recipe for disaster. Wrap the Mi Mix in a case, or suffer the consequences. Xiaomi updates MIUI regularly, but the basic version of Android underneath is still 6.0.1 Marshmallow, and the security patch is from September 2016. That’s absolutely horrible. If you buy this phone, you won’t be safe from hacks and security flaws so long as Xiaomi delays security patches. Should you buy it? Should you be an early adopter of any new technology? No, of course not. Should you buy a high-tech two-seat sports car over a solid, reliable hatchback? Not if you’re sensible. It’s the same story with the Mi Mix. No, we can’t recommend it, because it’s ultimately a shockingly expensive concept phone. You can buy a Pixel XL and still have $350 left in your pocket for the same cost as a Mi Mix. It’s the sensible choice, and wearing our sensible hat, it’s the phone we’ll tell you to buy. However, the Mi Mix is not a phone for anyone wearing a sensible hat. It’s not even for people who own a sensible hat. The Mi Mix is for people with silly hats. It’s Google Glass for the smartphone world. A technical experiment that’s unlike anything else available, and that fact alone will make many, many smartphone fans absolutely desperate to own one. It also has the potential to become quite collectible, due to its limited numbers, high price, and being an import only device. You won’t retire on any proceeds from it, but it will certainly have more cache in the future than a regular Android smartphone. One thing is for sure, if you do buy the Mi Mix, just be really, really careful with it.

Skip to: Start of Article. Author: Lily Hay Newman. Lily Hay Newman Security Date of Publication: 02.01.17. 02.01.17 Time of Publication: 1:43 pm. 1:43 pm Tech Can Do More to Help Survivors of Abuse. Here’s Where to Start Google For adults dealing with abuse from an intimate partner, technology can be both an empowering tool and a potential source of risk. But a team of Google researchers hopes to spur the tech community to make their products easier to use for survivors—and build more potentially life-saving tools into their products. An intimate partner abuser is in a unique position to turn someone’s technological world against them. They may know passwords, or be able to get them, and may even be in a position to place spyware on mobile devices to monitor web browsing, or get real-time location data. For those suffering abuse, a home computer may help connect with outside resources for help, but it can also reveal an escape plan. The challenge of using technology in a secure and private way can make an already traumatic situation even more stressful for abuse survivors. To study this dynamic, a team at Google collaborated with organizations like Community Overcoming Relationship Abuse (CORA) to gather data about survivors’ technology use, create a framework to describe this digital engagement, and draw some conclusions about how developers can build or improve their technologies with survivors of intimate partner abuse in mind. One team member, Sunny Consolvo, is presenting the findings today at the Enigma security conference in Oakland. (The group will release its paper at the Association for Computing Machinery CHI conference in May.) “We couldn’t find much in the literature that was focused on helping technology designers address this population, so that’s a big reason we’re focused on it,” says Consolvo, whose user experience research at Google focuses on usable privacy and security. “The better we can design for folks in these situations, the better [technology] becomes for everyone.” It’s also a large population to address. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that in the US one in three women, and 1 in four men, have been victims of intimate partner abuse at some point in their lives. “It’s not a mild social issue, it’s an epidemic,” says Cindy Southworth, founder of the Safety Net Technology Project at the National Network to End Domestic Violence, who was not involved in the Google research. “It’s a staggering number of people.” A Range of Solutions The Google team’s study looks specifically at adult intimate partner abuse (domestic violence more broadly also includes things like child abuse, and teens can also experience intimate partner abuse), and identifies three phases of technology use by survivors: Physical control, Escape, and Life Apart. In the first phase, the survivor uses technology while still living with, or regularly interacting with, their abuser. This means the abuser probably has regular physical access to a victim’s devices. The second phase addresses the transition period away from an abuser—full separation often takes multiple attempts—which combines periods of physical proximity with periods of being apart. In the third phase, the survivor has separated from their abuser, and wants to avoid being found while strengthening their support network. Even if you haven’t been in an abusive relationship, it’s not hard to imagine the ways in which using technology can quickly become thorny. Text messages, social networks, and email can be indispensable for preventing an abuse survivor’s isolation, but can also become oppressive if and when an abuser finds a way to log into those accounts or do other types of surveillance. A browser can be key for planning an escape, but a search history can also betray those plans. ‘The better we can design for folks in these situations, the better technology becomes for everyone.’ Google's Sunny Consolvo Though the study found, and experts agree, that there are many generalizable aspects of technology use for survivors, it’s also clear that technology needs to be flexible enough to account for the nuance of people’s lives. “We found lots of ways that technology is already working for survivors,” Consolvo says. “But these situations are often unique, it’s really complicated. And this is a population that’s motivated to look into those more advanced privacy and security features even though they’re available for anyone.” In its recommendations, the study emphasizes the importance of designing privacy and security tools that are easy to use. Survivors are often already under intense strain when they use digital tools, which can contribute to errors when attempting to browse privately, clear a search history, or delete data. The study found that privacy and security tutorials that walk users through available options are valuable for helping survivors understand what’s possible. Offering granular controls in the first place is another crucial element, especially in the Life Apart phase when a survivor wants to use technology relatively normally, but still has potential digital overlap with their abuser. Awareness First Google already incorporates some of these conclusions in features like two-step verification, Chrome’s Incognito Mode, the Google Account Privacy Checkup, and the Security Checkup. Other companies like Facebook offer privacy and security walkthroughs, too. And services that provide sign-in logs, like Google and Twitter, can help survivors know if someone else logs into their accounts, what the IP address was, and where the sign-in took place. But not all companies offer such a full suite of tools, and few technology products on the market today were built with specific user-interface consideration for abuse survivors. Even the valuable tools that already exist might be tweaked or designed differently if intimate partner abuse were being taken into consideration. These takeaways may seem somewhat self-evident, but the important step is the work to compile and codify them in a way that is specifically accessible to the tech community. “We’re domestic violence experts so we work with survivors all the time, but we’re not technology experts and technology changes so quickly,” says Cori Manthorne, the director of programs at Community Overcoming Relationship Abuse, who worked on the study. “We all do our best to keep up, but things are out of date within moments. And there are so many things that we just can’t really understand that happen behind the scenes of how information gets transmitted.” The researchers emphasize that this study is only a first step to exploring how technology can best support survivors at each phase of their lives. And other organizations like the National Network to End Domestic Violence have done extensive work since the early 2000s to create tech-use resources. This new effort, though, is an important and even unprecedented step toward raising awareness of something the tech community has never broadly considered. “People don’t often think about enlightening developers on the nuances of what domestic violence is. It’s not just about a punch, it’s much more insidious and pervasive and it explains why it’s so hard for survivors to escape,” says NNEDV’s Southworth. “So to have really smart, creative, committed tech folks looking at this is huge.” Go Back to Top.

Google last occupied the position of the world’s most valuable brand in 2011. The company remains largely unchallenged in its core search business, the mainstay of its advertising income. Ad revenues were up 20% in 2016 as budgets are increasingly directed online and Google finds more innovative ways to monetise users. David Haigh, CEO of Brand Finance, said: “Apple has struggled to maintain its technological advantage, with new iterations of the iPhone delivering diminishing returns, while the Chinese market is now crowded with local competitors. Apple has been living on borrowed time for several years by exploiting its accumulated brand equity. This underlines one of the many benefits of a strong brand, but Apple has finally taken it too far.” Every year, leading valuation and strategy consultancy Brand Finance values the brands of thousands of the world’s biggest companies. Brands are first evaluated to determine their power / strength (based on factors such as marketing investment, familiarity, loyalty, staff satisfaction and corporate reputation). Brand strength is used to determine what proportion of a business’s revenue is contributed by the brand, which is projected into perpetuity to determine the brand’s value. The results of this analysis are ranked, with the world’s 500 most valuable brands featured in the Brand Finance Global 500. View the full list of the world’s 500 most valuable brands here Lego has regained its status as the world’s most powerful brand. The building blocks for Lego’s brand strength have always been present but the release of the Lego Movie in 2014 provided the final push required to make Lego the world’s most powerful brand in 2015. The first sequel, the Lego Batman Movie will be released on February 9th. Its predicted impact has helped Lego regain its top position, lost to Disney in 2016. Further planned releases will continue to build the brand for years to come, while contributing significantly to Lego’s already vast licensing income. David Haigh adds: “Unvalued brands can lead to undervalued companies that are more vulnerable to takeover, struggle to secure adequate financing and miss market opportunities. Meanwhile a powerful brand can protect a company’s value during turbulent market conditions, create new market opportunities and increase profit margins. All companies should therefore not just know the value of their brands, but also understand what drives that value and how it can be harnessed to benefit the business as a whole.” You can find more detailed insights into brands from industries such as TMT, Oil & Gas, Tech, FMCG, Banking, Fashion, and Aviation in the Brand Finance Global 500 2017 Report, highlights include: China’s bank brands are now worth more than those of the United States ICBC is the world’s most valuable banking brand AT&T has overtaken Verizon to become the world’s most valuable telecoms brand Emirates is no longer the most valuable airline brand, having been overtaken by American, United & Delta Coca-Cola, Pepsi, McDonalds, KFC & Subway all see brand values fall, undermined by healthy eating trends Nokia’s brand is back from the brink and back in the top 500, following takeover and rebrand of Alcatel and launch of the Nokia 6 phone Read the full report on the world’s 500 most valuable brands here   Back to List Publications Handbook Online Exchange Handbook Trading Places World Exchanges Media & Resources Press Events News FTSE Mondo Visione Exchanges Index Glossary Acronyms White Papers Twitter Legal and About Us About Mondo Visione Terms and Conditions Privacy Policy Cookies Disclaimer Contact Us Sitemap © Mondo Visione 2017 About Us Terms & Conditions Privacy Policy Disclaimer Contact Us Careers Sitemap Back to Top News RSS Site by Red Ant

(NASDAQ:AAPL) as the world’s most valuable brand, according to the latest annual report by research firm Brand Finance. Google sits atop this year’s Brand Finance Global 500 list due to its “unchallenged” search engine dominance, which is in essence a legal monopoly and its chief revenue driver. Google earns top dollar for ads placed in its search engine, along with display ads across a wide variety of other websites. Brand Finance estimates Google’s 2017 brand value at $109.5 billion, p from $88.2 billion last year. The company even pays itself a handsome sum for the top search spots for its own product lines. Meanwhile, Apple’s 2017 brand value plunged 27% from last year to $107.1 billion, said the researchers. “Put simply, Apple has over-exploited the goodwill of its customers, it has failed to generate significant revenues from newer products such as the Apple Watch and cannot demonstrate that genuinely innovative technologies are in the pipeline,” the firm said in its report. Coming in third place this year was Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), which saw a massive 53% brand value increase to $106.4 billion in 2017 from $69.6 billion last year. “The firm is growing strongly as it continues to both reshape the retail market and to capture an ever larger share of it,” said Brand Finance. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL) was trading at $813.53 per share on Wednesday afternoon, down $6.66 (-0.81%). Year-to-date, GOOGL has gained 2.66%, versus a 1.73% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period.

Google built its Chrome browser on source code from its Chromium open source project, but until now that code repository hasn't included Chrome for iOS. That was because to build the Chrome browser for Apple's mobile operating system, Google needed to use two rendering engines: its own Blink engine and Apple's WebKit engine. While WebKit has been open source since 2005, Google faced "extra complexities" in having to support both engines in its code for iOS, so the company hadn't previously made it open source. By contrast, Chrome for Android has been almost entirely open source since 2015. Before that, the Chromium open source project was focused mostly on the Chrome browser for desktops. Years of Code Changes To Get Here "Historically, the code for Chrome for iOS was kept separate from the rest of the Chromium project due to the additional complexity required for the platform," Googler Rohit Rao wrote yesterday on the Chromium blog. "After years of careful refactoring, all of this code is rejoining Chromium and being moved into the open source repository." By open-sourcing the Chrome for iOS code, Google has made it possible for developers to compile that code just as easily as they can for other versions of Chrome. That will also help speed up development times for new applications built on the Chrome for iOS code. Rao noted that getting to this point has taken some time because of the fact that Chrome for iOS uses both the WebKit and Blink engines. "That created some extra complexities which we wanted to avoid placing in the Chromium code base," Rao said. "Given Chrome's commitment to open source code, we've spent a lot of time over the past several years making the changes required to upstream the code for Chrome for iOS into Chromium. Today, that upstreaming is complete, and developers can compile the iOS version of Chromium like they can for other versions of Chromium." Browser Rendering Improvements On Monday, Google also said that it had rolled out several changes to Chrome's rendering pipeline over the past few months that are designed to help Web site images in the Chrome browser "load faster, run smoother, and use less power." Those changes mean Chrome "now more intelligently skips redundant tasks, chooses optimal rendering algorithms, and better utilizes system hardware," Google painting professional Chris Harrelson said in a blog post. The improvements to Chrome are designed to make it not just faster, but smarter, Harrelson noted. Previously, on a Web page with frequent Document Object Model changes, for example, Chrome would have redrawn any image tiles if some pixels had changed. Now, Harrelson said, "If only a few pixels have changed, it's faster to copy the entire tile from the previous frame and then update the new pixels. Chrome can now intelligently choose the redraw pipeline that will be faster, reducing tile redraw time by up to 40 [percent]." The goal with Chrome's rendering updates is to help Web site displays load at an optimal rate of 60 frames per second, which "feels fast and responsive to users," Harrelson said, adding that additional improvements with that same goal are in the works. "The rendering pipeline is only one piece of the puzzle, and we've got a lot more coming," he said.

Chrome for iOS Is Now Open Source Next Article > Women Are, Very Slowly, Getting More Seats in the Boardroom By Stan Choe PUBLISHED: FEBRUARY 02 2017 The number of women sitting at the table in corporate boardrooms across the country is rising very slowly, but it's rising. Just over 15 percent of all director seats at publicly traded U.S. companies were held by women as of Dec. 31, according to a study by Equilar, a corporate research firm. That's up from 14 percent a year earlier and from 12 percent in 2013. So, the trend is toward more equal representation on boards, but parity won't happen until the end of 2055 unless the pace picks up, according to Equilar. That's nearly 40 years away, which may be about when girls born today begin sitting on corporate boards. Demonstrating how far remains to go toward gender parity, 738 companies still have no women on their boards. Last year, nearly 60 companies that had no female directors since at least 2011 added one or more women. Even so, it's still much easier to find a woman in the boardroom than in the corner office, according to a separate, global survey of 3,400 companies by Credit Suisse. While women occupied nearly 15 percent of board seats at the end of 2015, only about 4 percent of CEOs are women. Companies in other countries have gotten closer to gender parity than the United States, and government pressure has played a big role. Several European countries have set quotas and targets for how many corporate board members should be held by women. That's why women held 24 percent of European board seats at the end of 2015, the highest rate in the world. Investors are taking note. Companies with at least one female director tend to have higher stock returns and better corporate performance than those with all-male boards, Credit Suisse says. Of course, this may be a case of correlation rather than causation, and better-performing companies may be more welcoming to women rather than vice versa. Regardless, having women in the most senior leadership positions has other benefits, companies say. At American Water Works Co., the largest publicly traded U.S. water and wastewater utility, five of the nine board positions are held by women. And that's something that customers, regulators and employees, both current and potential future ones, see, says BJ Holdnak, senior vice president of human resources. "We want to look like the customers and the employees that we serve in our local markets," she says. "The board, starting in 2012, really began to focus on assuring that they were diverse and looked like and represented the company." American Water's majority-female board is an anomaly. Just 21 of the 3,525 companies in Equilar's survey have half or more of their board seats held by women. Equilar based its study on the Russell 3000 index, a broad measure of publicly traded U.S. companies. It also runs counter to the male-dominated utility industry. Nearly 80 percent of workers across the industry are men, according to Labor Department statistics. Like American Water, Connecticut Water is another utility that has a majority-female board. It also says it didn't start with the explicit intent of having more women than men on its board. Instead, it happened as the byproduct of looking for a more diverse group to represent its shareholders, customers and employees. Five of the company's eight director seats are held by women. "It's a bit of an arduous process, looking for someone that fulfills what we're driving for in our cultural focus," says Kristen Johnson, corporate secretary and vice president of human resources at Connecticut Water. "We've been super-lucky to find individuals that populate the board like that, and it just so happens that five of them are women." © 2017 Associated Press under contract with NewsEdge/Acquire Media.

In the Doodle by Sophie Diao, Lewis is sculpting “The Death of Cleopatra,” one of her most famous works. The colors of the letters reference the name Lewis was given by her mother’s nomadic family, “Wildfire.” The sculptor was known for “incorporating African American and Native American cultural themes into her Neoclassical style sculpture.” Passionate about art, Lewis enrolled at Oberlin College at age 15 and faced brutal discrimination–she left for Boston without finishing her final term after a brutal assault. She then had challenges finding an apprenticeship until she met sculptor Edward A. Brackett. Lewis’ works include sculptures of abolitionists like William Lloyd Garrison, Charles Sumner, Wendell Phillips, John Brown, and Colonel Robert Gould Shaw. With this success, she traveled to Europe and settled down in Rome where she established a studio and continued to create highly-acclaimed work until her death. Past doodles on this day have featured Langston Hughes (today is his 115th birthday), Harriet Tubman, and Frederick Douglass.

Subscribe to Ubergizmo on Youtube We’ll get to see some amazing new commercials during Super Bowl 51 this Sunday. We know that Google is going to spend $5 million to air a 30-second spot about the Google Home. Nintendo is going to capitalize on the biggest TV event of the year as well to push its very own commercial that’s going to promote its next-generation gaming console, the Nintendo Switch. The console provides a glimpse at the many ways you can play games on the Switch. The Nintendo Super Bowl commercial is a first for the company, according to Nintendo itself, and it also mentions that this is going to air in the fourth quarter of the game. The televised version of this commercial is posted above. As previously mentioned, the Nintendo Super Bowl commercial aims to highlight the many ways you can play games on the Switch console. It can either be on the couch with friends during a lazy afternoon or with the entire family in the living room. It will even enable users to squeeze in quick gaming sessions between college classes. Nintendo Switch is unlike PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. It can double as a handheld and a docked console so owners will get the best of both worlds. It’s a good decision by Nintendo to air a commercial for its latest console during the big game as the console will go on sale not too long after that. Nintendo Switch will be available starting March 3rd for $299. Filed in Gaming. Read more about Nintendo, nintendo switch and super bowl.

We are able to build products for everyone because we attract talent from around the world. Immigration is a strength for this industry and our country — it’s one of our defining characteristics.” This doesn’t touch on his view of Donald Trump’s order specifically, but he has already made clear his concern about “the personal cost” the executive order and its implication on Google’s business. Sundar Pichai reportedly spoke at the protests at Google’s headquarters earlier this week, declaring that the “fight will continue.” Sergey Brin is also said to have spoken, saying that “it’s a debate about fundamental values.” And there’s no reason to believe that these aren’t his actual convictions on the issue, especially seeing as he was born and raised in India before coming to the US for higher education. His colleague and Alphabet President Sergey Brin showed up at the SFO airport last Saturday to protest Trump’s executive order “in a personal capacity.” He told Forbes that “I’m here because I’m a refugee.” In the memo that Pichai sent over the weekend, he said that more than 100 Google staff (a number which we later found out is closer to 200) are impacted by the order, and recommended they get back the US as soon as possible. The executive order restricts citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen from entering the US for 90 days.

SiliconValley.com Twitter Facebook Google+ RSS   Social Web Mobile Cloud Gadgets Cleantech VC Data Games Policy Media   Google’s legendary former HR chief Laszlo Bock attacks Trump’s Muslim-nations ban By Ethan Baron / February 1, 2017 at 9:18 AM The refugee camp in Austria that sheltered a young Laszlo Bock, long before his rise to power and fame as the architect of Google’s human resources program, is now, Bock says, home to Syrians fleeing war. “From there we applied for political asylum in a number of countries, and came to the United States,” Bock said in an interview slamming President Donald Trump’s 90-day travel ban for citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries. “And then both my parents started their own businesses. My brother started his own business. They employed lots of people.” Tech firms must speak out against Trump’s targeted tightening of U.S. borders, the former refugee from Communist Romania told Fast Company. “It’s in their interests to actually make sure there is freedom — both in terms of markets, but also in terms of how people can behave and act,” Bock said. “Innovation and creativity come from the freedom to have lots of ideas; it comes from having people literally from all over the world bringing their best ideas to this country.” That need for the broadest possible talent pool has driven a number of companies to take a stand against the executive order Trump used to ban visitors from seven nations. “It’s important that the tech industry be vocal about it,” Bock said. “As a company, there are clear incentives not to speak up because you don’t want to get pilloried in the press. You don’t want to offend whatever regulators there might be … on the issue of immigration, the industry needs to keep pushing. “If you’re a company that wants to keep the best people — even if you don’t care about immigration — the best people generally want to work for companies that do care about these kinds of issues. And they’re going to end up there.” Bock, who announced his retirement from Google in December, saying he was founding a startup, urged business leaders to leverage connections with the Trump administration, and make their opposition public. “It’s important to make public statements because it sends a signal to the rest of society about what’s important,” he said. “Silence sends a signal about what is not important. It’s important for companies to take care of their own people. And it’s important for them to support efforts to advance not just what’s right, but also what is in their own business interest in the long term, and in the interest of their employees.” Silicon Valley’s tech firms face another major talent-acquisition problem in the controversial H-1B visa program that many rely on for skilled foreign workers. The Trump administration has pledged to overhaul the system, which has become a flashpoint in the immigration debate. On Feb. 1st, the White House announced the travel ban would not apply to green card holders. Initially after Trump issued the order, more than 100 green card holders were detained upon arriving at U.S. airports, according to Politico, which said the detentions had contributed to cross-country protests against the ban.   Photo: Two men walk past a building on the Google campus in Mountain View (Jeff Chiu/AP) Share this: Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn Reddit Google More Pinterest Tumblr   Tags: ban, Google, HR, Laszlo Bock, Muslim, Trump   More Posts in Big Tech Apple hit with class-action lawsuit for allegedly ‘breaking’ FaceTime video-calling on iPhones to save money February 2, 2017   Google eyes office drones for virtual ‘telepresence’ meetings February 2, 2017   Google may benefit on U.S. antitrust issue if Trump picks right FTC head: analyst February 1, 2017       Share this Post Tweet       Captain Obvious Legendary?

But if you rely on Google Voice in Hangouts should you switch? By Andy Wolber | February 1, 2017, 8:49 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: Andy Wolber / TechRepublic In January 2017, Google updated Google Voice on the web, Android, and iOS after years of minimal public changes. The update: Embraced Material Design elements on all three platforms, to provide a simpler, more streamlined user experience Added group and photo MMS capabilities Offered 3D touch support for the iPhone, with options to place a call, send a message, or search within Google Voice Included a new app built for the iPad. The redesign places the emphasis of the app solidly on messages, calls, and voicemail. Those three options feature prominently on the web, Android, and iOS, with a dialing pad also added as a fourth option in the mobile apps. The updated Google Voice app offers 3D Touch support on the iPhone. All the standard features of Google Voice remain, including the ability for an incoming call to ring on multiple phones (or devices), if you choose. The service still provides text transcriptions of voicemails, and lets you receive both the audio recording and text in an email. And, you can still screen calls by requiring a caller to state their name, so you can choose to either take the call or send it to voicemail after you hear what they say. Many core Google Voice features, such as voice transcription, remain — and are easier to use as a result of the redesign. (Android screenshot) The new Google Voice app makes some things simpler. Now there's a single "Filter Spam" setting. Turn it on to help block spam calls, messages, and voicemail. The three-dot menu allows you to block a caller, mark a number as spam, and archive or delete a conversation. In the mobile apps, there's also a "Do not disturb" option, which sends all calls to voicemail when selected. The 'More" menu on the web, Android, and iOS offers call block, mark as spam, and conversation archive and delete options. (Chrome OS screenshot) But, some features of "Legacy Google Voice," as the menu item calls it, aren't yet found in the new apps. Most notably, Wi-Fi calling isn't yet in the app. When I place an outbound call on my Chromebook, I see a prompt that asks me to place the call either via my phone or Hangouts. A similar thing occurs on my iPad: The app rings my phone, rather than just placing the call over Wi-Fi. You also can't yet star a conversation, which some people used to mark and process messages. On a WiFi-only iPad (left), Google Voice relies on a phone to place calls, and on Chrome OS (right) the system uses either Hangouts or your phone. If you've been using Google Voice integrated with Hangouts, you have options. You can choose to disconnect the two, which would mean incoming calls now go to the Google Voice app, with Hangouts relegated to handling messages, voice, or video calls to other Hangouts users. Most Hangouts users who rely on integrated Google Voice should continue to do so. On Chrome OS, you'll need Hangouts (or your phone) to place an outbound call anyway. On iOS, Hangouts still supports calls placed over Wi-Fi, so you can place a call in Hangouts from your Google Voice number on a WiFi-only iPad. Hangouts also allows you to send your location as long as you're at a Google-recognized place. Google Voice only supports sending a photo. The refresh does nothing to clarify the direction of Google's messaging strategy. While the company has hinted that the future role of Hangouts is in the enterprise, the current capabilities of apps display overlapping features: Hangouts offers messaging, calls, and video calls Google Voice offers messaging and calls You can configure settings to use Google Voice features within Hangouts Google Duo offers video calls Google Allo offers messaging, but not SMS or MMS On Android, there's Messenger, which offers SMS and MMS If you want to select an app from Google for voice communications, the best option will depend on your needs. If you make calls mostly from your smartphone—and don't need video-conferencing—then the new Google Voice app will likely work well for you. But, if you already use Hangouts and use multiple devices or make video-calls, stick with Hangouts with integrated Google Voice. And, if you're an enterprise looking for a phone system that integrates with G Suite, look at a third-party solution like Dialpad or RingCentral. If you've tried the new Google Voice app on Android, iOS, or the web, let me know what you think of it in the comments or on Twitter.

The traditional construction toy, which dominated the play charts last year, scored 92.7 out of 100 compared with Disney’s slide to sixth with 91.3. According to a company superleague compiled by Brand Finance Global 500, Danish owned Lego took the power brand crown following the success of movie spin-off merchandise from Star Wars and Harry Potter to its own Lego Batman Movie out this month. Its best selling playsets are a favourite with pop star Ed Sheeran who immortalised the brand in his top ten smash Lego House and recently revealed he built a Lego Pirates of the Caribbean ship on a date - and took it home.

Brand Finance chief executive David Haigh said: “Disney remains a hugely powerful brand and will be closely watched during 2017. Lego has leapt to the top of the league (Photo: Splash News) “A powerful brand can protect a company’s value during turbulent market conditions or challenging times for a business.” To compile the power list, Brand Finance looked at factors including consumers’ emotional connection, the company’s financial performance and sustainability and marked each category out of 100. Google scooped joint second place in the power league along with Nike with a score of 92.1 and Ferrari was third with 91.9. But Google took a bite out of Apple’s supremacy to be named the most valuable brand in the world.

Trend setting gadget king Apple slipped to second in the Brand Finance Global 500 after it’s brand value tumbled by 27% from £115.2 billion to £84.8 billion in 2016. According to the Brand Finance Global 500 league, Google’s value soared 24% from £69.8 billion to £86.7 billion over 12 months, giving it a AAA+ rating compared with Apple’s AAA. Online retailer Amazon was third with a brand value of £84.2 billion, American telecoms company AT&T fourth with £68.9 billion and Microsoft fifth with £60.4 billion. Mr Haigh said Apple’s stranglehold on the global market had loosened as it “struggled to maintain its technological advantage”. And he felt the world had hit “saturation point” with Apple products like iPhones and iPads. He added: “The Chinese market, where Apple has enjoyed a dominant market share, is becoming far more competitive with local players entering the market in a meaningful way. Samsung has also been successful in taking market share and financial analysts are projecting declining revenues and margins.” Like us on Facebook Follow us on Twitter Daily Newsletter Follow @DailyMirror Subscribe to our Daily newsletterEnter emailSubscribe Comments Show more comments More On The Walt Disney Company Google Nike, Inc.

An email from an NHS trust's IT department seen by The Register confirmed that the US search giant has mistaken the current traffic levels for a botnet. The email headed "Google Access" stated: "Google is intermittently blocking access due to the amount of traffic from NHS Trusts Nationally (This is not being blocked by the IT Department). "This is causing Google to think it is suffering from a cyber-attack. "We are advising staff to use an alternative search engine i.e. Bing to bypass this problem. "If you have 'Chrome' on your desktop the page will display correctly but if you 'should' get a CAPTCHA pop up, please follow the instructions to continue." The source said they did not know why Google had suddenly decided to block access to the NHS net, but confirmed it was the "go-to resource" for a lot of clinicians. The Register has contacted NHS Digital and Google for a comment. Controversially, Google is also attempting to drum up business with the NHS through its DeepMind AI business. Last year it emerged that the Royal Free NHS trust had signed a deal with DeepMind to give the outfit access to 1.6 million patient records, without explicit permission from patients. It has since won a deal with Moorfields Eye Hospital to access one million anonymous eye scans. The NHS is one of the biggest employers in the world, with 1.2 million people working for the organisation. Earlier this week it emerged that a reply-all NHS email fail in Croydon resulted in 500 million emails being sent across the NHS in just 75 minutes. Google refused to comment but said: "It is not correct to say we have blocked the entire NHS network." ® Updated at 12:31 UTC on Wednesday 1 February to add: An NHS Digital spokesman contacted The Reg to say: “We are aware of the current issue concerning NHS IP addresses which occasionally results in users being directed to a simple verification form when accessing Google. This would appear to be due to the high number of people using our systems and trying to access Google at peak times. We are currently in discussion with Google as to how we can help them to resolve the issue.” Tips and corrections 96 Comments More from The Register Google DeepMind inks 5-year agreement with NHS for 'Streams' app Patient data access concerns prompts ICO probe 16 Comments Ransomware brutes smacked 1 in 3 NHS trusts last year One was hit 19 times over 12 months 29 Comments UK NHS 850k Reply-all email fail: State health service blames Accenture Cause was system 'bug,' not user error, claims mouthpiece 52 Comments 90 per cent of the UK's NHS is STILL relying on Windows XP And a load of them say they'll keep using it in 2017 140 Comments NHS reply-all meltdown swamped system with half a billion emails Accenture blamed for system swamp 62 Comments NHS advertises for digital director at £131k A Reg expert would sort them out, right?

Plus, you can use these great features within an easy-to-use interface. Color-Coding Notes Color-coding is one of the nicest features to help you organize your Google Keep notes.

Reply Anthony Foister February 2, 2017 at 1:37 am I am heavily ingrained into Google's ecosystem. I want to use Google Keep, but the lack of password protected notes and no real way to organize notes into notebooks has led me to use Zoho Notebook. I would use Keep if they updated with my 2 needs. Reply Adam February 2, 2017 at 12:53 am I still feel I decided between Keep and Trello. Part of my wishlist for Keep is to be able to add attachments to a note. Keep's add a note widget is definitely better than Trello and I like text recognition for pictures of meeting notes. I also like Keep's integration with Google tools.

A flurry of social media posts seemed to indicate yesterday that a rollout was in the works, but 9to5Google dug into the situation and realized that news of the rollout stemmed from a series of misunderstandings, rather than T-Mobile actually launching the new feature. RCS (rich communication services) has been hailed as the savior of texting — a next-generation messaging standard for sending text and pictures without the limitations that SMS currently has. You can, for instance, send messages longer than 160 characters, which is still impossible to do through SMS. Unlike services like Facebook Messenger or iMessage, RCS requires carrier-side implementation. Google has been pushing this for the last couple years, but it’s been slow moving. So far, Sprint is the only major US carrier to have added the feature, having done so inside of Google’s Messenger app late last year. T-Mobile does offer RCS, but the carrier uses its own standard, which means it can’t be used to message phones connected to other carriers. AT&T also offers support for RCS on some Android phones through its own Messenger app, but that’s not compatible with Google’s implementation either. And Verizon — Google’s exclusive carrier partner for the Pixel — has so far been silent on any RCS plans, Google-integrated or otherwise. Correction February 1st, 5:50PM ET: This article initially pointed to social media posts indicating that T-Mobile was rolling out support for Google’s RCS standard; those now appear to be inaccurate. We’ve updated the article accordingly.

By Brandon Vigliarolo | February 1, 2017, 8:37 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStock/Aleutie Anyone who's tried digging through a website for a customer support number knows how hard it can be. Finding the number isn't always a solution either: Half the time the lines are automated or you find out you called the wrong one for your particular needs. How do you find the right support line then? Turn to Google. NPR did just that for Facebook and it found a startling result: The top hit is a scam. More about IT Security Special report: Cyberwar and the future of cybersecurity (free ebook) Video: Top 5 ways to secure your IoT Interview with a hacker: Kapustkiy from New World Hackers Subscribe to our Cybersecurity Insider newsletter NPR went on to report that Facebook and Google were both aware of the problem and were taking steps to correct it. Neither, however, says it knows how the number got to the top of search results. Why customer support scams matter to tech professionals The fake Facebook customer support number didn't appear overnight: It's been popping up on Facebook pages and in search engine results for over a year and they're targeting other websites too. Facebook should have known about the scam—and reported it to the public—as soon as it appeared. That it didn't shows yet again that data security's biggest flaw isn't systems: It's people. SEE: A visual map of emerging cybersecurity trends (TechRepublic) One of two things happened: Facebook knew about the problem and did nothing, which put its customers at risk, or it didn't know because it's been lax about how its site shows up for various Google searches. Neither is acceptable. Cybersecurity isn't self-contained. It's a web of risks and pitfalls that extends down to the lowest ranking person in an organization. Facebook might not be directly responsible for this kind of scam, but it enabled it. Covering all your bases It can seem like busywork to audit every little bit of organizational cybersecurity, but it's necessary. That includes regular audits of search engine results that come back to your site. Any suspicious results should be reported to Google immediately, and it's not a bad idea to release an official statement as well. SEE: Experts predict 2017's biggest cybersecurity threats (TechRepublic) A good security audit involves examining every single point of contact your system has with the internet, search engine results, and especially humans. It takes a lot of effort and skill to hack into a properly secured server. It's much easier to scam someone into giving out sensitive data. This latest Facebook-related scam is small, but it contains an important lesson about security: There are holes everywhere, and if you don't find them someone else will. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers NPR reported a new Facebook scam involving a false customer service number being the top Google result for Facebook support. The scam is another reminder of security risks: Even Google results can be turned against an organization. A comprehensive cybersecurity audit includes examining search engine results.

Lewis was a 19th-century sculptor nicknamed "Wildfire". Michael CavnaThe Washington Post To kick off its celebration of Black History Month, Google turns to a 19th century artist who burned so bright that her twin gifts of blazing talent and steely determination could not be denied even in the face of her era's discrimination. Time and again, sculptor Edmonia Lewis — nicknamed "Wildfire" — faced obstacles and setbacks, yet she persevered as if her greatness were already cast. Lewis was orphaned at age 9, when she was adopted by maternal aunts and joined their Mississauga tribe. GOOGLE-DOODLE Google Google's salute to Edmonia Lewis, by Sophie Diao. Google's salute to Edmonia Lewis, by Sophie Diao. (Google) She endured bitter racial bias at Oberlin College, which she began attending at age 15; she was falsely accused of poisoning classmates and was beaten, and was ultimately denied the chance to graduate. She then was refused apprenticeships in Civil War-era Boston, until she encountered the well-connected sculptor Edward Brackett, whose clients included well-known abolitionists. And she would then run a small art studio in Rome (a space formerly used by neoclassicist Antonio Canova), eschewing assistants because she was often without the means of fellow expat artists in Italy. Yet she would shine as the first woman of American Indian and African-American descent to discover international renown in the arts.

Get the full story: newsfeed.time.comRead the story Wednesday's Google Doodle, by artist Sophie Diao, salutes Lewis and her great work "The Death of Cleopatra," which rests today in Washington at the Smithsonian American Art Museum. (Her work "Forever Free" resides nearby, with the Howard University Gallery of Art.) And the ribboned "Google" wording shines bright, befitting Lewis's nickname. Lewis is also freshly represented in Google's "Arts & Culture" section, which spotlights some of her most iconic marble works, including "Anna Quincy Waterston," "Old Arrow Maker," "Poor Cupid" and "Young Octavian," as well as sculptures inspired by the words of Longfellow, whom she met in Rome. Mary Edmonia Lewis was born near Greenbush, New York, circa 1844, and died in 1907. Her great "Death of Cleopatra," carved in 1876, was believed lost to history till more than a century later, when it resurfaced like a Phoenix, fittingly rediscovered by a fire inspector. It was donated to the Smithsonian in 1994. Lewis shines as brilliant as a cultural beacon, entirely befitting an American trailblazer.

You can head over to the Play Store right now and check out the chart of the Top 500 free apps and you’re not going to find Allo. Chart data provided by App Annie clearly shows that this isn’t the first time that Google Allo has fallen out of the chart. It has done that multiple times over the past few weeks. The overall trajectory is downward and there haven’t been any big spikes to suggest that there’s renewed interest in the app. Historical data shows that Allo’s ranking has been in free-fall since December last year. If it continues like this, Google may very well have to chalk Allo up as yet another one of its obscure services that not many people use. If the company wants to reignite interest in the app it may have to come out with some big feature updates that get people excited about Allo once again. Google hasn’t really confirmed at this point in time how it’s going to further improve its new communication apps that include Allo and Duo. The company is likely to make efforts to turn this around and it will be interesting to see what it pulls out of its hat this time. Filed in Cellphones. Read more about allo, Apps, duo and Google.

Europeans can request that information that is "inaccurate, inadequate, irrelevant, or excessive" be removed from the search engine.  SEE ALSO: Google's PR team penned the mother of all replies In Europe, Google has adjusted its search engine to comply with the right individuals have to remove themselves from Google searches. The European Union wants the rule to apply globally, and a ruling in France last year determined that it would apply to Google's worldwide domains, not just Google.fr.  In Japan, however, the court wasn't committed to the concept. The court determined that Google results are a form of speech and that restricting them could be a restriction on speech, according to the Wall Street Journal. Instead, the court decided that requests to remove search results should be weighed on a case-by-case basis that would evaluate the benefit of having information available to the public compared to any damage suffered by the person appearing in the search results. The ruling didn't directly mention the European Union's term for the concept.  SEE ALSO: Google Home starts catching up to the Amazon Echo “We’re pleased that with these latest rulings, the Supreme Court has unanimously recognized, based on existing privacy and defamation laws, that any decision to delete information from search results should prioritize the public’s right to information," a Google spokesperson told Mashable.  BONUS: Elon Musk's Hyperloop dream is closer to becoming a reality Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next In Donald Trump’s White House, Female Staffers Must ‘Dress Like Women’ 2821 messages6%67%27% The New Face of Marijuana Investing MONEY MORNINGSponsored Lady Gaga Remains Mysterious on Super Bowl Halftime Show Details 7 messages0%60%40% Trump Supporter Fired Over Twitter Exchange With Patton Oswalt 4007 messages5%60%35% #2 of 10 Most Popular News Galleries of 2016: 9/11: Then and now - 15 years later 1135 messages5%58%37% How to keep more of your 1099-MISC money TurboTax Self-EmployedSponsored Former Giants Kicker Josh Brown Speaks Out After Domestic Abuse Allegations Quadruple Homicide of Washington Family Is ‘Not a Random Act,’ Police Say 155 messages3%68%29% New Israeli Settlements 'May Not Be Helpful' in Achieving Peace With Palestinians, White House Says 234 messages4%71%25% Get a $100 AT&T Visa® Reward Card DIRECTVSponsored How This Woman Got Her Bubble Butt 82 messages7%68%25% #8 of 10 Most Popular News Galleries of 2016: Deadly attack at Istanbul's Ataturk Airport 1007 messages9%20%71% Free Speech Questions After Canceled Milo Yiannopoulos UC Berkeley Event 4 messages0%78%22% Wall Street "Poster Boy" Makes A Big Prediction Banyan HillSponsored This Man Slays Walking in Heels Like No Other 91 messages3%70%27% Beyoncé's full pregnancy photoshoot has landed and it's insane 922 messages6%60%34% House Democrats demand Trump boot Bannon from NSC r: Want to know what happens next?

By Jason Murdock February 1, 2017 17:31 GMT IT email: 'Google is intermittently blocking access due to the amount of traffic from NHS Trusts'iStock Staffers on the UK's National Health Service (NHS) networks are reportedly having trouble using Google services because the internet giant is mistakenly identifying the amount of traffic being generated as a botnet – a malicious collection of hacked computers. In an internal email, headed "Google Access", an NHS trust IT worker confirmed the health service's networks – used by roughly 1.3 million employees – were bring blocked, at least until the user entered additional information to prove they were human. "Google is intermittently blocking access due to the amount of traffic from NHS Trusts nationally (This is not being blocked by the IT department). This is causing Google to think it is suffering from a cyberattack," read the email, obtained by The Register. It added: "We are advising staff to use an alternative search engine i.e. Bing to bypass this problem. If you have 'Chrome' on your desktop the page will display correctly but if you should get a Captcha pop up, please follow the instructions to continue." In a statement, an NHS digital spokesperson said: "We are aware of the current issue concerning NHS IP addresses which occasionally results in users being directed to a simple verification form when accessing Google." The statement continued: "This would appear to be due to the high number of people using our systems and trying to access Google at peak times. We are currently in discussion with Google as to how we can help them to resolve the issue." A Google spokesperson said: "Our systems are simply checking that searches are being carried out by humans and not by robots in order to keep web users safe. Once a user has filled out the Captcha they can continue to use Google as normal." Botnet traffic can be used in large-scale cyberattacks. In one example last year a botnet called Mirai was able to take down large swathes of the internet in the US, after it was powered by a slew of hacked internet-of-things (IoT) devices including CCTV cameras and routers. Google and the NHS have a strong working relationship. Last year, the two partnered to produce landmark research using the web giant's DeepMind artificial intelligence department. The NHS handed Google 1.6 million hospital records to work with. Yet the British health service has come under fire in the past for its cybersecurity protections. In one study, based on Freedom of Information (FoI) requests, it emerged that seven trusts failed to spend a single penny on online security in 2015. The service was also hit with a slew of ransomware attacks over the past 12 months. In one major incident, roughly 1,000 patients were impacted by cancellations at three hospital facilities as they were forced to shut down vital computers used for administration.

Technology Google Stock Falls For Fifth Day; Trump's FTC Eyed Google owner Alphabet has a lot riding on who President Trump names to head the FTC. (EPA/Newscom) REINHARDT KRAUSE 2/01/2017 Reprints If the Trump administration plans to target Google parent Alphabet (GOOGL) on antitrust grounds, the Federal Trade Commission is the agency for investors to watch. President Trump has named Maureen Ohlhausen acting chairman of the FTC. She's a Republican member of the agency. Democratic Chairwoman Edith Ramirez, who has resigned, leaves the FTC on Feb. 10. Josh Wright, a former FTC commissioner, is also said to be in the running to replace Ramirez as chair, though he's also under consideration for a top Department of Justice post. Also said to be on Trump's FTC list is Sean Reyes, the attorney general of Utah. The FTC in 2013 ended a Google probe after the internet search giant agreed to voluntary changes to its business practices. The European Commission, though, is continuing an antitrust investigation. IBD'S TAKE: Netflix, Amazon, Dave & Buster's and Broadcom are on IBD's Leaderboard, which follows top stocks from their work on forming bases, through their breakouts, to their post-breakout action, up to the point where they start topping. If the European Commission takes action vs. Google in 2017, it would give president Trump an opening to restart a Google probe. Utah AG Reyes joined other state attorneys in 2016 in asking the FTC to consider reopening its antitrust probe of Google. Both commissioner Ohlhausen and Wright, on the other hand, "have made statements that would seem encouraging for Google should either become FTC chair," said Paul Gallant, a Cowen & Co. analyst, in a research report Wednesday. Google stock fell 0.6% to 815.24 on the stock market today. Google stock now has fallen the past five trading days, going back to Jan. 26. Google stock has undercut its breakout at a buy point of 824.40 first touched on Jan. 6. Google stock traded down for six consecutive sessions following President Trump's Nov. 8 win, but it's up a fraction overall since then. Google has been aiming to improve relations with Republicans since Trump's election, the New York Times reported on Jan. 27. The article said Trump's advisors "have debated" whether Google deserves more antitrust scrutiny. Trump and tech industry leaders, meanwhile, clashed over new immigration policies. "Google is still viewed as a Democratic company in a Republican town, and (Alphabet Executive Chairman) Eric Schmidt's campaign efforts for Hillary Clinton may make Google more of a target," noted Gallant in the report. Aside from the FTC, the Federal Communications Commission may be another worry for Google. Trump has named Republican Ajit Pai as its new chairman. While a Republican-led FCC is expected to erase utility-type "Title II" regulation of the internet, another possibility is that Pai shifts net-neutrality enforcement to include companies like Google and Facebook (FB) as well as broadband service providers like AT&T (T) and Comcast (CMCSA). Europe's regulators, meanwhile, have charged Google with unfairly promoting its own services over rivals in shopping-search results and have been looking into its online advertising business. European antitrust regulators are also probing whether Google has abused its dominant market-share position with the Android mobile operating system.

MSPU Windows Phone Windows 10 Surface Xbox Enterprise Tip us Settings Text Input: Windows 10 Windows Phone Surface Xbox Enterprise Settings Tip us Forum Text Input: Google announces support for SQL Server Enterprise and Windows Server Core on Compute Engine 0 by Pradeep  @pradeepviswav Feb 1, 2017 at 17:22 GMT2 days ago Google is getting serious about its enterprise business day by day. In the past few months, they have made several improvements to their cloud platform to make it attractive to large enterprises. They added support for building an ASP.NET application with Visual Studio and PowerShell, and more recently they added support for deploying Windows Server onto Google Compute Engine. Today, Google announced the availability of pre-configured images for Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise and Windows Server Core on Compute Engine. Google also announced support for SQL Server AlwaysOn Availability Groups and persistent disk snapshots integrated with Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) on Windows Server. Finally, all their Windows Server images are now enabled with Windows Remote Management support, including their Windows Server Core 2016 and 2012 R2 images. You can now launch Compute Engine VMs with Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise Edition pre-installed, and pay by the minute for SQL Server Enterprise and Windows Server licenses. Customers can also choose to bring their own licenses for SQL Server Enterprise. Mission-critical SQL Server workloads require support for high-availability and disaster recovery. To achieve this, GCP supports Windows Server Failover Clustering (WSFC) and SQL Server AlwaysOn Availability Groups. Being able to take snapshots in coordination with Volume Shadow Copy Service ensures that you get application-consistent snapshots for persistent disks attached to an instance running Windows — without having to shut it down. This feature is useful when you want to take a consistent backup for VSS-enabled applications like SQL Server and Exchange Server — without affecting the workload running on the VMs. Check out cloud.google.com/windows and cloud.google.com/sql-server for more information on this release.

Text size comment share tweet email Print more Share on: Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on Pinterest Copy shortlink: Purchase: Order Reprint When Heidi Zak was getting dressed for work one foggy March morning in 2012, she peered into the drawer that housed her undergarments and sighed sadly. “I pulled out my bras and realized they were so stretched out, and then the dread set in,” Zak said. “It’s the dread of having to go out and buy new bras.” At the time, Zak was a product marketing manager at Google in San Francisco, but she had always toyed with the idea of building a brand. That morning she figured out what it would be. A self-described fitness fanatic who prefers running outside to shopping at malls, Zak wasn’t passionate about lingerie, but she realized that if she hated bra shopping, other women must, too. She left Google later that year and in 2014 introduced ThirdLove, an e-commerce site offering basic but stylish underpinnings designed for women by women. With her new business, Zak would seek to solve the plight of bra shopping, which often involves fluorescent lighting, three-way mirrors and a mess of straps and hangers. “Bras should have been the first item to go online,” she said. “You don’t do it with friends; women don’t like the in-store experience, and the market is filled with old-school brands run by middle-aged men who think they’re targeting women.” She says the line has had 20 percent growth month over month since its introduction. ThirdLove joins a growing number of lingerie lines that are reinvigorating an otherwise staid market. Through sleek websites, hip campaign imagery, savvy fit options and compelling social media feeds, companies like Lively, Lonely and Adore Me are making it easier than ever for the online set to shop innerwear. Moreover, the new lines are changing the message behind lingerie from one of oversexualized fantasy to empowerment, confidence and comfort. This vision marks a contrast with Victoria’s Secret, the bubble-gum-pink retailer that, according to the research company IBISWorld, encompasses 62 percent of the $9 billion lingerie market in the United States. That means that a majority of women are buying their most intimate apparel next to life-size photos of supermodels, whose come-hither looks and propped-up underpinnings embody a male fantasy. Emerging lingerie brands are determined to change that association and bring the focus back to women. Provided An undated handout photo shows a model in Lively lingerie. Like ThirdLove, Lively is a bra and underwear label that prides itself on being made for women by women. Its founder, Michelle Cordeiro Grant, a former senior merchant for bras at Victoria’s Secret, introduced Lively in April to bridge the worlds of athletic wear and innerwear. She coined the term “leisurée” (a cross, of sorts, between “athleisure” and lingerie) to describe 11 styles of bralettes, push-ups and T-shirt bras offered in a mix of neutrals and bold prints. “I admire Victoria’s Secret as a business, but I stopped relating to the fantasy and the push-ups and the armor; it was too much for me,” Grant said. “I wanted to create something more authentic for the modern woman, where she doesn’t have to choose between style and comfort. Victoria’s Secret is the mind-set of ‘How do I feel when a man looks at me?’ versus ‘How do I look when I’m feeling confident, comfortable and ready to take on the day?’ ” Lively uses Instagram to communicate with consumers on matters of fit, design and packaging, then turns the feedback into content. When a shopper tweets #needthis about a specific bra, the hashtag becomes an e-mail headline. And while it celebrates famous fans like Khloe Kardashian and Gigi Hadid, it scours its social feeds to find ambassadors who are everyday women living regular lives. Much like ThirdLove’s fit models, who deliberately look down at themselves instead of posing sensually for the camera, Lively’s fit guide features real customers in sizes ranging from 32A to 38DD. “The intimate apparel business has been sluggish in keeping up with consumers,” said Marshal Cohen, the chief industry analyst at NPD Group. “It’s already a product that’s difficult to fit, so if you can find a way to make it a more appealing shopping experience, it’s a home run every time. We’re seeing these emerging brands reach consumers on an emotional level, and now stores are going to have to play catch-up.” This emerging market is also capturing the Hollywood audience. In August, Lena Dunham and Jemima Kirke posed for a photo shoot in Lonely, a lingerie and ready-to-wear label based in Auckland, New Zealand. The actresses joined what Helene Morris, a founder of the line, calls the “Lonely Girls Project,” an artistic photo series of real women wearing the label in a range of places, from their bedrooms to the beach. “We’re trying to show women as they are and not trying to change them,” Morris said.

Google Cloud takes aim at Microsoft customers with new Windows VMs Posted yesterday by Ron Miller (@ron_miller) 0 SHARES Next Story iPhone 7 sales helped Apple reclaim the top spot in the global smartphone market Google announced several new products today aimed at luring IT pros who are using Windows in their data centers to the Google Cloud Platform. With that in mind, Google introduced support for Microsoft SQL Server Enterprise and Windows Server Core on the Cloud Platform. In addition, the company announced support for SQL Server Always-On Availability Group for customers who are concerned about high availability and disaster recovery when running critical operations in a cloud setting. What this means in practical terms is that IT pros can now launch pre-configured virtual machines running any of these products on Google Cloud Platform, and pay for them by the minute — or they can bring an existing SQL Server license they have already paid for. Chris Sells, lead product manager for Google Cloud Developer Tools says this is part of a broader strategy to support Windows products on GCP. First of all, he says, it shows Google’s ready to take on enterprise customers running these Windows products. Secondly, it’s part of a bigger effort that began last year when Google began supporting other Windows products such SQL Server 2008 and 2012. Today’s announcement is just an extension of that. Perhaps more importantly, it also provides an alternative for companies that don’t want to necessarily be tied to Microsoft but still need to run Microsoft products. “Microsoft provides these capabilities and they own Windows and SQL Server, but we are finding that lots of customers are looking for alternatives to Microsoft,” notes Sells. By providing these kinds of products, GCP is hoping to lure these people to their platform. Related Articles Windows Server On Google Compute Engine Hits General Availability Diane Greene wants to put the enterprise front and center of Google Cloud strategy Google combines all of its cloud services under the 'Google Cloud' brand It’s part of a bigger story that began when Diane Greene came on board to run Google Cloud at the end of 2015. Greene brought with her years of enterprise experience, including her stint as co-founder and CEO at VMware. As Greene told TechCrunch last spring, the enterprise is “becoming a super interesting place” and she clearly wants to lead Google Cloud Platform to get a piece of that action. Sells says they see this announcement as part of bringing Greene’s enterprise vision to fruition, and while it’s only a small piece of that overall enterprise push, it is part of a deliberate effort to capture more traditional enterprise marketshare and move it to Google’s cloud. “We want to make sure we have a great place to put their data. If it’s in SQL Server and they want to keep it there, we support them,” he says. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Google Cloud Platform Founded 2012 Overview Google Cloud Platform enables developers to build, test and deploy applications on Google’s highly-scalable and reliable infrastructure.

PHOTO: Tracy Lundgren Google has displaced Apple as the world's most valuable brand to retake a spot it last occupied in 2011. Amazon, AT&T, Microsoft, Samsung Group, Verizon, Walmart, Facebook and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) also rank among the Top 10 brands on the planet. That's the word from London-based Brand Finance, an independent branded business valuation consultancy. Google Up, Apple Down Google’s brand value rose by 24 percent last year (from $88.2 billion to $109.4 billion) while Apple’s brand value declined nearly 27 percent (from $145.9 billion to $107.1 billion), according to the latest Brand Finance Global 500 report. Brand Finance first evaluates brands to determine their power/strength (based on factors such as marketing investment, familiarity, loyalty, staff satisfaction and corporate reputation). Brand strength is used to determine what proportion of a business’s revenue is contributed by the brand, which is projected into perpetuity to determine the brand’s value. The results of this analysis are ranked, with the world’s 500 most valuable brands featured in the Brand Finance Global 500. PHOTO: Brand Finance Google did well in this year's analysis, even though analysts noted its brand architecture is "somewhat more complicated than Apple’s" and further acknowledged it is attracting growing scrutiny over personal privacy issues and its "potential monopolistic behavior." "Google remains largely unchallenged in its core search business, which is the mainstay of its advertising income. Ad revenues were up 20 percent in 2016, despite a fall in cost per click, as ad budgets are increasingly directed online," the report stated. The Google name is so strong that it drives reputation by association: "Multiple brands have been created or acquired that are merely ‘endorsed’ by the Google brand such as Android and Chrome. There are also brands that merely sit within the Google stable, such as YouTube, which has retained its brand long after acquisition." Apple Fans 'Losing Faith' But analysts took a big bite out of Apple's meticulously constructed image. "Apple was once a paragon of branding excellence," Brand Finance CEO David Haigh noted in the report. But he warned Apple’s evangelists are beginning to lose their faith, as "snaking queues of early adopters have shrunk almost to the point of invisibility." They said Apple has failed to maintain its technological advantage while repeatedly disillusioning its advocates with tweaks rather than innovation in the form of material changes. "Put simply, Apple has over-exploited the goodwill of its customers, it has failed to generate significant revenues from newer products such as the Apple Watch and cannot demonstrate that genuinely innovative technologies desired by consumers are in the pipeline," the report noted. PHOTO: Brand Finance Haigh said Brand Finance bridges the gap between the marketing and finance. "We understand the importance of design, advertising and marketing, but we also believe that the ultimate and overriding purpose of brands is to make money," he said. Based on a recent share price study, Brand Finance’s concludes it pays to invest in companies with strong brands. It found the most highly branded companies have a return almost double that of the average for the S&P 500 as a whole. 20 Tech/IT Services Companies There are 20 technology/IT services company among the 100 top rated companies in this year's Brand Finance Global 500 report.

Image: justin sullivan/Getty Images By Emma Hinchliffe2017-02-01 16:34:30 UTC The "right to be forgotten" isn't guaranteed worldwide, according to a new court ruling.  Google on Tuesday won the latest lawsuit over its search results when a court in Japan ruled that the company did not need to remove links to articles written about a man arrested on child pornography charges, the Wall Street Journal reported.  The "right to be forgotten" is a term coined by a European Union court in 2014. Europeans can request that information that is "inaccurate, inadequate, irrelevant, or excessive" be removed from the search engine.  SEE ALSO: Google's PR team penned the mother of all replies In Europe, Google has adjusted its search engine to comply with the right individuals have to remove themselves from Google searches. The European Union wants the rule to apply globally, and a ruling in France last year determined that it would apply to Google's worldwide domains, not just Google.fr.  In Japan, however, the court wasn't committed to the concept. The court determined that Google results are a form of speech and that restricting them could be a restriction on speech, according to the Wall Street Journal. Instead, the court decided that requests to remove search results should be weighed on a case-by-case basis that would evaluate the benefit of having information available to the public compared to any damage suffered by the person appearing in the search results. The ruling didn't directly mention the European Union's term for the concept.  SEE ALSO: Google Home starts catching up to the Amazon Echo “We’re pleased that with these latest rulings, the Supreme Court has unanimously recognized, based on existing privacy and defamation laws, that any decision to delete information from search results should prioritize the public’s right to information," a Google spokesperson told Mashable.  BONUS: Elon Musk's Hyperloop dream is closer to becoming a reality Topics: Business, Google, japan, right to be forgotten About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

The website activated a shield for NHS staff that is designed to stop cyber attacks from flooding Google with traffic. It means whenever an NHS employee wants to use one of Google's internet services, such as search or Gmail, they have to check a box to confirm they are "not a robot".  Google's defences are designed to stop large volumes of internet traffic coming from one address and launching attacks that can shut sites down. Such an attack, called a distributed denial of service, was used to knock a number of the internet's most popular websites offline at the same time last year.   DDoS explainer graphic The shields have caused concern among NHS employees, including clinicians who use the internet regularly through the day for their work. As a warning, the health service sent an email to employees that advised staff to avoid using Google.  "Google is intermittently blocking access due to the amount of traffic from NHS Trusts Nationally (this is not being blocked by the IT Department)," an NHS email to staff said, according to the Register. "This is causing Google to think it is suffering from a cyber-attack. "We are advising staff to use an alternative search engine such as Bing to bypass this problem." The NHS and Google are aware of the problem with the health service's IP address and are in discussions to resolve it.   "We are aware of the current issue concerning NHS IP addresses which occasionally results in users being directed to a simple verification form when accessing Google," said a spokesman for NHS Digital. "This would appear to be due to the high number of people using our systems and trying to access Google at peak times." The NHS is one of the biggest employers in the world and has more than a million staff members.  Google has said it is not purposefully singling out NHS traffic, and that there are a number of reasons its filtering system can be activated. "There are many reasons why users might see a CAPTCHA window when they do a Google search. Our systems are simply checking that searches are being carried out by humans and not by robots in order to keep web users safe. Once a user has filled out the CAPTCHA, they can continue to use Google as normal," Google said.

Cyber attack hits Xbox and Playstation, details of 2.5 million gamers hacked Cyber SecurityBusiness Back to Home Google blocks entire NHS network in a case of mistaken traffic identity Increase / Decrease text size Tom Ball 1st February 2017 5 5Shares 0 0 0 5 Add to favorites Reports have surfaced that Google has mistaken the entire NHS network for a cyber attack. The entire NHS network has allegedly been blocked by Google, with the US search giant viewing traffic generated by the NHS network as a cyber-attack. The NHS confirmed that its network had been disrupted, with 1.2 million employees impacted due to the restricted service. News of the NHS block by Google broke via The Register, who were given an email reportedly from the NHS IT Department. It read: “Google is intermittently blocking access due to the amount of traffic from NHS Trusts Nationally (This is not being blocked by the IT Department). This is causing Google to think it is suffering from a cyber-attack.” “We are advising staff to use an alternative search engine i.e. Bing to bypass this problem. “If you have ‘Chrome’ on your desktop the page will display correctly but if you ‘should’ get a CAPTCHA pop up, please follow the instructions to continue.” It seems that Google may be mistaking the entire NHS network for a DDoS cyber-attack, an attack which involves hackers battering the target with malicious traffic via hijacked computers linked in a botnet. Additional reports have stated that Google are denying the blocking of the NHS network, which sits at odds with the disruption currently being experienced at trusts nationwide. UPDATE Google released a statement to CBR, refuting the claims made in initial reports. “There are many reasons why users might see a CAPTCHA window when they do a Google search. Our systems are simply checking that searches are being carried out by humans and not by robots in order to keep web users safe. Once a user has filled out the CAPTCHA, they can continue to use Google as normal,” said a Google spokesperson. Google went on to state that they were ‘satisfied that our systems are working correctly in this case; our systems are able to handle huge volumes of innocuous queries coming from one network. The tech giant said that it was not blocking the entire NHS network as reports suggested, instead giving the following as reasons as to why the NHS may have seen disruption on its network: Users will sometimes see a message that says “Our systems have detected unusual traffic from your computer network” if it seems like a computer or phone on the network is sending automated traffic to Google; Automated traffic could be things such as sending searches from a robot, computer program, automated service or search scraper. Or using software to send searches to Google to see how a website or webpage ranks on Google; It could also be related to the use of a VPN browser plugin or program, or the presence of malware on a computer within the network which is sending automated searches to Google; In most cases, users will see a CAPTCHA page – to continue using Google, users should type the CAPTCHA word into the box, to prove to Google that the user is a human and not a robot. Once the CAPTCHA has been entered correctly, the message will disappear, and the user will be able to access Google again.

REUTERS/Bobby Yip    5455967 Eric Schmidt, the executive chairman of Google’s parent company, Alphabet, told employees last week that President Donald Trump and his administration are going to do “evil things.” “I can tell you that the tone of this government is very much economic growth,” Schmidt said, according to BuzzFeed News, in an apparent attempt to criticize Trump. “And so I think at the end of the day, they are going to do these evil things as they’ve done in the immigration area and perhaps some others.” Schmidt, who was formerly the CEO of Google, was speaking during the tech company’s weekly meeting at its headquarters in Mountain View, California. Reports of Trump’s incoming executive orders on immigration restrictions were just starting to circulate at the time. (RELATED: Google Parent Company Chairman Spotted Wearing Clinton Campaign Staff Badge) “But the core focus is going to be to get the growth rate in the country — which is roughly one and a half to two percent — up another point by simply pushing through increases in federal spending and overcoming the tea party,” continued Schmidt, in reference to the Trump administration. Google’s current CEO, Sundar Pichai also voiced his extreme disapproval over Trump’s executive orders. (RELATED: Silicon Valley Seems To Love Burying Conservative News) “It’s painful to see the personal cost of this executive order on our colleagues,” Pichai said over the weekend, according to Bloomberg News. “We’ve always made our view on immigration issues known publicly and will continue to do so.” Pichai and Schmidt aren’t the only ones in the industry to criticize the policy–a plethora of tech executives proclaimed their condemnation in recent days. In fact, a number of tech bigwigs were reportedly invited to all meet Tuesday in order to discuss how to combat the new executive orders, even with the possibility of filing or supporting lawsuits. (RELATED: Amazon CEO: We Are Exploring ‘Other Legal Options’ In Response To Trump’s Immigration Ban) Google isn’t just trying to push back with words, but also with money and demonstrations. The company recently established a $2 million crisis fund for four organizations that are battling the Trump administration’s executive orders and providing assistance to refugees and immigrants. The reserve can be matched with up to $2 million in donations from employees, according to USA Today. Roughly 2,000 Alphabet and Google employees around the world protested the immigration ban over the weekend by walking out of their offices and rallying on the streets. Pichai and Google co-founder Sergey Brin spoke to the crowds of workers at one point.

The company’s official motto and mantra was “Don’t Be Evil” for quite some time. Follow Eric on Twitter Send tips to eric@dailycallernewsfoundation.org.

PhoneDog Android And Me TodaysiPhone NEW Call T-Mobile at (855) 668-8976 TmoNews Unofficial T-Mobile Blog, News, Videos, Articles and more Navigation Home Submit News 700MHz LTE map Upcoming Phones HOT TOPICS: Samsung Galaxy Note 7 LG V20 Google Pixel Extended Range LTE Android 7.0 Nougat You are here: Home > Some T-Mobile customers getting RCS support in Google Messenger app Some T-Mobile customers getting RCS support in Google Messenger app January 31, 2017 Alex Wagner 18 Comments UPDATE: T-Mobile responded to me and said “T-Mobile was the first U.S. operator to launch RCS with our Advanced Messaging in July 2015. We don’t currently support Google’s RCS offering.” 9to5Google found that the supposed sources of this report turned out to be one person.   ORIGINAL: Some T-Mobile customers are getting a new messaging feature to play with today. RCS, which stands for Rich Communication Services, appears to have gone live in Google Messenger for some T-Mobile customers. Those folks are getting a notification in the Messenger app to tell them about the “enhanced features” that come with RCS, including messaging over Wi-Fi and data, high-res photo sharing, and read receipts. These features can be toggled on or off in an “Enhanced features” section of the Messenger app’s settings. T-Mobile launched its own RCS-based Advanced Messaging feature back in July 2015. That feature is now available on several T-Mo devices, including the LG G5, LG Aristo, Samsung Galaxy S7, and Samsung Galaxy Note 4. The RCS that’s hitting some T-Mobile customers’ Google Messenger app is different. Google acquired Jibe Mobile in September 2015 and began backing that RCS profile, but so far Sprint is the only US carrier that has officially adopted it. With today’s news, it looks like T-Mobile may soon adopt it as well. The bad news is that it’s currently unclear how you can get Google’s universal RCS profile in your Google Messenger app. One Reddit user suggested that T-Mobile is testing this feature with early Digits users, but T-Mo hasn’t made any official announcements about this news. I’ve reached out to T-Mobile for more info on the matter, and I’ll be sure to update this post when I hear back. Utilizing Google’s universal RCS profile in Messenger would be an interesting move from T-Mobile. While T-Mo’s RCS works between supported devices on T-Mo, adding support for Google’s RCS profile would enable T-Mo customers to also use RCS when messaging customers on other carriers that support it. That’s currently only Sprint, but it’s possible that other carriers could adopt it as well in the future. Have you ever used RCS, like T-Mobile’s Advanced Messaging?

Joseph Cathey Apple has made no mention of supporting it. T-Mobile may support the universal profile, but it’s useless if Apple doesn’t make use of it on their devices. Bonedatt I’ve had the advance messaging (aka RCS) on my Note 4 and LG G4 for a while now and on the S7 Edge since March 2016. Sometimes it works well where the recipient can see you typing your response and other times it doesn’t function as it’s supposed to. Don’t use SMS as much anymore. Almost everyone I know seems to be on whatsapp or Telegram these days. Phil7474 Been using this fire a while now on my galaxy J7. Works when another smartphone has it on tmobiles network. Doesn’t when you don’t. Eh….. Joseph Cathey That’s why this is important. Their migrating support away from individual devices and making it a carrier feature. Your phone just has to an app that supports the standard. It also means interoperability between carriers, which was not possible before. Mariano Moreira Been using on Sprint as RCS in Google Messaging started rolling out with Sprint 1st. It made SMS/MMS delivery more convoluted as at that time only other Sprint Android devices were compatible. Hopefully it will be better with more Carriers using RCS. However the cross-platform issue still arises: Hangouts, BBM, Facebook Messenger, What’s App, etc.. were able to address different OS platform. Google made things more worse by basically deciding to move away from Hangouts. (They even removed Threaded Merged Hangouts/SMS &MMS to where these are now treated as separate accounts) BBM had end-to-end encryption and somehow let their advantage completely slip…Allowing iMessage and even Allo to catch up and compete.Yet BBM is better for iOS to Android encryption because it works cross-platform. steveb944 Great news, but is it the same originally supported devices only? Joseph Cathey T-Mobile is launching Google’s universal RCS profile on the backend. The big news is that it’s no longer device specific, the messaging app itself just has to support it. Philip I use Whatsapp alot. Asian people use Wechat alot. Viber is in the middle. lion7718 I’ve used Chomp for years, but have turned Messenger back on. Have to wait & see if notice shows up on my Nexus 5X. TylerCameron Try signal. Best app I’ve used for messaging. As long as the other person uses signal, it’s fully encrypted bkat11 I’ve been using my S7’s native messaging app and noticed yesterday that customers on Metro PCS now have advanced messaging support not just T-Mobile customers. Some sort of software update was released for them. Also my S7 should be getting Nougat this week as its been in “testing” for about a week now. iCn2u T-mobile owns Metro PCS. Zach Mauch Wow, there are so many commenters here who don’t get the difference between this and T-Mobile’s previously released advanced messaging. This is despite it being clearly spelled out in the article. Sigh… SpookyTunes Another report that claims it’s all a hoax: https://9to5google.com/2017/02/01/nope-t-mobile-isnt-rolling-out-support-for-googles-rcs-offering-in-messenger/ TylerCameron How about support for Signal private messenger?

Although, if you got a deal with a mobile operator, you might be stuck with Android Marshmallow.

Android Nougat Galaxy S7 Update: what's in 7.0 Android Nougat carries with it a number of major improvements and upgrades, highlighting Google's most advanced software release to date. The upate includes a number of new emoji, Google's new GIF keyboard, and launcher shortcuts, which adds 3D-Touch-like features to the homescreen. To check if your Android phone is ready to be updated, go to Settings > About device > download updates manually.  Android Nougat Galaxy S7 Update: 7.1.2 beta Meanwhile, as Android 7.1.2 Nougat beta rolls out, Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge owners are still struggling with the original Android 7.0 Nougat update. Google Pixel and Nexus 5X device owners can download the latest software upgrade. (via Express UK) The latest Android Nougat update centers on small reworks and improvements, rather than a total overhaul. According to an official blog post from Google, the new update includes a number of bug fixes and optimizations, along with a small number of enhancements for carriers and users. Sony stops update due to some concerns Meanwhile Sony has stopped the launch of the new update on its Xperia range after a number of users reported problems.

Morochos.net Just another NEWSPress site Home Sports Business World Science Uncategorized Entertainment Technology Google employees got urgent message to return to US February 1, 2017 admin Science & Technology 0 After Trump signed his executive order, Google recalls its employees with CEO Sundar Pichai expressing his disappointment.Advertisement Microsoft President Brad Smith said in a company-wide email posted on LinkedIn that 76 company employees were citizens of the seven countries in question and held USA work visas, and thus were directly affected by the order. The EO stalled the admission of refugees to United States from Syria indefinitely along with the denying entry to residents from the Muslim countries of Iraq, Syria, Iran, Yemen, Sudan, Libya, and Somalia, for three months. Still, Google’s criticisms come even as the company has sought to forge stronger ties with the new Republican administration. Google CEO, Sundar Pichai, fears Trump’s immigration order may affect businesses, as he recalls more than 100 employees travelling overseas to avoid probable immigration issues. The details of the president’s order remain to be seen, he said. It is not a policy we support. In an email to employees Apple CEO Tim Cook said his company has contacted the White House to explain the “negative effect” the restrictions will have on workers. Among the most well known: Apple co-founder Steve Jobs was the son of a Syrian immigrant. “This was in direct response to the immigration action”, Hossain said. I share your concern. Zuckerberg highlighting about his immigrant grand parents and about parents of his wife Priscilla, he imposed America is a nation of immigrants and it should be proud of it. He added: “They are our future too”. The controversial move, signed a week after he was sworn- in as the President, fulfills the vow Trump made on the campaign trail to limit Muslim immigration to the US. But some of the Silicon Valley’s top leaders took a blunter stance on the ban. It is unclear just how many of them managed to make it back. The immigration ban, however, has ran in to a temporary roadblock after a U.S. district court put a stay on the executive order last Saturday. It is no small matter that Sundar Pichai was born and raised in India. Advertisement Dean Garfield, CEO of the Industry Technology Information Council said: “This decision came without comment or advance notice and has injected a tremendous amount of uncertainty for a wide range of people, including employees within the tech sector”.

Google Is Battling a Russian Spammer Over the Use of the Letter 'G' Vitaly Popov wants to keep control of his domain that looks nearly identical to Google.com. Google is probably pretty pissed off. An alleged Russian spammer recently used a domain strikingly similar to Google.com to flood websites' analytics with unwanted pro-Trump messages, and Google is now trying to wrest control of the URL. But Vitaly Popov, the site's owner, is not giving up without a fight, no matter how unlikely he is to win. Late last month, Google filed a complaint with an arbitration forum over Vitaly's ɢoogle.com domain. As you might notice, the "G" in ɢoogle.com looks a little off. That's because Popov registered the website back in March 2016 with the Latin version of the letter, meaning he can produce a URL that looks very similar to Google.com, but that sends visitors elsewhere. Popov has done the same for the "K" in lifehacĸer.com. "Google requests that the Panel issue a decision that the Domain Name registration be transferred to Google," the company's complaint, provided to Motherboard by Popov, reads. (A member of the arbitration forum, called ADR Forum, confirmed that there was an ongoing dispute between Google and Popov). In its complaint, Google claims that Popov's phony domain redirects visitors to a landing page with a slew of dodgy pop-ups, including one that asks for a Windows username and password. "Upon inspection and belief, the warning messages created by the landing page are fake, not associated with or genuinely put out by Microsoft Office and are designed to distribute malware and scareware, display unwanted pop-ups, and lure unsuspecting Internet users to divulge personal or sensitive information," the complaint adds. Naturally, Google is concerned that there is a high likelihood of confusion between their own website and Popov's domain. Google also points to Popov's recent wave of messages on Google Analytics, in which he produced referrals using the domain that looked like they came from Google itself. Popov, for his part, is determined to point out every alleged falsehood in Google's complaint. In another document, out of over a dozen that Popov shared with Motherboard, he has highlighted paragraph by paragraph supposed inaccuracies with Google's complaint. A section of Popov's response to Google's complaint. "Lie! Not my domain!" Popov writes in bright red text regarding the site with dodgy pop-ups. "Lie! I'm not a spammer!" he continues. Much of Popov's argument seems to revolve around that he doesn't send traditional spam emails. "There is no one fact of mailing me advertising messages which can be identified as SPAM in accordance with the opinion of officials of the United States. Not one proof!" Popov writes, and points specifically to the Can Spam Act, which spells out when businesses can send messages en masse. But Popov has flooded plenty of peoples' Google Analytics with unwanted messages, including blurbs supporting Donald Trump in the run-up to the US election. He even bombarded sites with a link to a Motherboard article covering his activity. Popov also claims that ɢoogle.com never sent visitors through to the sites Google points to. Instead, it redirected to another domain, ilovevitaly.com, Popov claims. A Google spokesperson told Motherboard in an email that "We don't comment on pending legal matters."

Stanford students never have to apply for summer jobs or internships. They simply show up at Google and are hired on the spot. In fact, Google arrives on prospective freshmen’s doorsteps as soon as they receive their admissions letters, offering lifetime employment and a guaranteed path to CEO-hood. Most Stanford students actually refuse this offer because they prefer the more exciting journey of entrepreneurship. However, they keep the free Google shirts and water bottles anyway as a reminder of the job waiting for them as soon as they strike it rich with a startup. 2. Stanford offers an equal number of job fairs and opportunities for its STEM and humanities majors. In fact, Stanford’s Humanities Job Fair is among the largest in the world, and those with no interest in writing thousands of lines of code will never feel pressure to do so. 3. Stanford has the lowest number of Title IX cases of any peer institution. In fact, make that the entire United States. Stanford is so incomparably safe that it scarcely needs to deal with any sort of incident reports. The last time that Stanford sent out a Community Alert was in 1884, which was a telegram to inform the Stanford family of Leland Jr.’s death. 4. No individual named “Brock Turner” ever attended Stanford University. 5. Because of (3) and (4), the hard alcohol ban instituted over the summer could not have been related to Title IX. However, it was also not related to hospital transports, because everyone at Stanford is impeccably responsible, and no one has ever been transported for alcohol-related reasons. Former President John Hennessy simply enacted the ban as a means of facilitating the transition of power by eliminating undue references to the incorrect president. 6. The Band was no longer performing because all of its members spontaneously chose three straight quarters of nonstop Full Moon on the Quad, even when there was no full moon. The choice of Band members to forgo music cannot be attributed to administrative actions; thus, the administration is not responsible for the disbanding of Band. The recent decision to reinstate Band, however, is to the administration’s credit, for it has a deep appreciation of True Music and Free Stanford Culture. Die Luft Der… freedom! 7. Stanford has a famously vibrant social life, and the long-term dating scene is excellent. Most students seem to fall in love from the first day of NSO. A recent survey found that 99 percent of Stanford students are in a relationship. 8. The weather at Stanford is perpetually sunny. It has not rained in nearly 20 years, but Stanford has also been a drought-free oasis. The palm trees simply grow of their own accord, and due to the lack of rain, students can bike blissfully without fear of large puddles of mud and rusted locks. Never invest in so much as a raincoat; it will be a waste of money. 9. Lake Lagunita is always filled with water. At its center, it is almost a mile deep, and the Stanford Scuba Diving club has been hunting for such treasures as Satisfactory/No Credit units, lost sleep and the beepers left by Karel the Robot. 10. There is always food available in every dining hall. Especially in FloMo, which offers “continuous dining,” the food is particularly delicious on Fridays and Saturdays, and the staff does not even need to be present to cook it. Food also abounds during holidays; West Campus students are never left to trek to Arrillaga, since there is so much food that they could stuff themselves with the ramen noodles that grow alongside the orange trees. 11. There are exactly the right number of meal plan dollars and dining swipes on every student’s card. Not a single dollar or meal swipe ever goes wasted, especially because the dining halls are always consistently open and accessible. 12. Stanford has no minimum SAT or ACT score requirements for prospective applicants, because it welcomes everyone! The bar to entry is set incredibly low, set at the fair price of only $90. Everyone has an equal chance of getting in! However, Stanford is also a prestigious, selective institution. These two facts are not at all contradictory. Everyone should apply!   Contact Xinlan Emily Hu with more alternative facts at xehu ‘at’ stanford.edu.

And Google is marking the occasion with new Google doodles every day. The first doodle celebrates a little-known sculptor named Edmonia Lewis, the first woman of African-American and Native American heritage to become a globally renowned fine arts sculptor, according to Google. “Today, we celebrate her and what she stands for — self-expression through art, even in the face of adversity,” Google wrote. Lewis enrolled in Oberlin College at age 15 in 1859 but could not complete her degree because of discrimination, even though Oberlin was one of the few colleges at the time to admit women and people of color. Instead, she apprenticed to a Boston sculptor named Edward A. Brackett, a man who was known to work with abolitionists at a time when slavery was still legal, in the mid 1800’s and found her artistic legs. Later in life, Lewis was based out of Rome, sculpting with marble in the Neoclassical style until her death in 1907. The Google doodle depicts Lewis in the process of sculpting one of her most famous pieces, The Death of Cleopatra, which has been called “the most remarkable piece of sculpture in the American section” of the Smithsonian American Art Museum. Additionally, the colors and style pay homage to her Native American name, “Wildfire.”   Related Posts President Trump and Arnold Schwarzenegger trade insults Trump’s proposed religious freedom order could legalize discrimination Republicans plan outreach to Historically Black Colleges and Universities Trump threatens to pull Berkeley’s funding over campus protest CNN commentator says Trump ‘doesn’t care about black people’ Tamron Hall turned down multimillion dollar deal to leave NBC Post navigation Previous Previous post: Russell Simmons cuts ties with former friend Donald Trump Next Next post: Anthony Weiner may face child pornography charges Get news in your inbox TheGrio Favorites Worst NFL players who won the Heisman Trophy 15 richest NBA players of all time The 25 Most Influential Black American Leaders of All Time The top 10 greatest black quarterbacks of all time Infamous celebrity mugshots 15 films that hurt black America President Trump and Arnold Schwarzenegger trade insults Trump’s proposed religious freedom order could legalize discrimination Without strategy, Democrats fighting all fires won’t help anyone Republicans plan outreach to Historically Black Colleges and Universities Steve Harvey hires ‘Scandal’ fixer to repair his image Trump threatens to pull Berkeley’s funding over campus protest Main menu Skip to primary content Skip to secondary content Terms of Service Privacy Policy About Intern with theGrio Advertise with TheGrio How to pitch to theGrio Main menu Skip to primary content Skip to secondary content Politics Living Video Inspire Health Entertainment News Terms of Service Privacy Policy About Intern with theGrio Advertise with TheGrio How to pitch to theGrio ©2017 Entertainment Studios LLC Powered by PressHarbor.com theGrio Proudly powered by WordPress Theme: TheGrio Theme Prod (nbcthegrio).

Following its launch in Charlotte almost exactly a year ago, Fiber is further expanding in North Carolina to Raleigh… Fiber in Raleigh is now available both in the Morrisville and North Hills areas of the city, and Google plans further expansions through Raleigh and the greater “triangle” area. Both TV and internet services will be available, with plans ranging from $50 a month up to $160 a month. Small business plans are also available starting at $70 a month. Along with the new service, Google has also opened up a new Fiber Space in Raleigh in the historic 518 West Jones building in Glenwood South. Community members and potential customers will be able to visit to test out Fiber’s speeds on their own devices, view Fiber TV services, as well as ask staff members questions about the service. The space will also host community events, including one during this week’s “Raleigh First Friday” event. Local residents can check to see if their address is eligible at fiber.google.com/triangle, and can check regarding apartment buildings at fiber.google.com/cities/triangle/apartments. This shouldn’t come as a surprise, as the Raleigh-Durham area has been on Google’s short list for quite some time. However, this announcement comes as a comfort considering the future of Fiber was completely unknown just a few months ago. Hopefully, Google will continue to further expand Fiber to other cities over the coming months, but the company has yet to announce anything on that front. Currently, Google lists Huntsville, AL, Louisville, KY, and San Antonio, TX as the next stops.

As you can probably imagine, an ad spot during the Super Bowl costs quite a lot, a 30-second spot goes for $5 million and Google is going to spend that much money to promote Google Home. On the surface, Google Home might look like just another connected speaker but it can do much more than that as it’s powered by Google Assistant. It’s a “Made by Google” product that highlights the company’s ability to make great hardware on its own. The Google Super Bowl 51 ad comes after the company’s absence from the big game in 2016. Google hasn’t disclosed the details about its ad spot so we’ll have to wait until Sunday to find out just how effectively it’s going to use that $5 million ad spot to promote Google Home. Rival Amazon aired an ad for its artificial intelligence assistant Alexa during last year’s Super Bowl. It already has a dominant position in this market as Google arrived with its product later, so now it’s going to put its resources to good use to try and get as many people as possible to pick up Google Home.

Powered by Android TV and being 4K ready, it obliterated the competition with Ultra HD video support and offered a tasty sideline in enhanced gaming to boot. It was pricy though – already more expensive than its peers and the remote control had to be bought as a £50 optional extra. That made it very much a premium purchase and one that was never going to make much of a dent in the sales figures of Roku or Amazon's Fire department. Now a new version of the box is available and Nvidia is confident enough to keep it around the same price: £190. This time, however, you get a game controller with a mic for Google Assistant voice control (pending a software update), plus an improved version of the wireless remote included the box. When you compare the Shield TV's talent to others on the market, the extra spend is justified. Here's why the 2017 Nvidia Shield TV really is the daddy of media streaming. Nvidia Shield TV (2017) review: What's new? 98 x 159 x 26mm; 250g Smaller than 2015 model Comes with new Shield Controller and Shield Remote Those with the previous model don't need to consider an upgrade to this one. Bar a couple of design features and enhanced accessories, the 2015 Shield TV offers the exact same experience as the 2017 edition. Pocket-lint It now has identical software to the 2017 model, thanks to a downloadable update. And all the apps and menu systems are the same, including (pending a forthcoming software update) Google Assistant voice control and SmartThings smart home support. You do need the new Shield game controller for Assistant, as explained below, but that's available to buy separately and works fine with the old Shield too. Both boxes run on Android 7.0 Nougat and have access to 4K HDR (high dynamic range) programming through Amazon Video, as well as Netflix and, ultimately, YouTube. You can also GameStream games in up to 4K HDR from a PC running a capable Nvidia GeForce graphics card. What is HDR (high dynamic range) and which TVs support it? If you're new to the device though, the latest version is the only one available and you're getting a better deal than before. It's smaller than before – considerably so. And while it still looks very "gamey", with its angled exterior panels and glowing green LEDs, at least you can hide it away more easily should you not like that sort of thing. Pocket-lint The game controller has also been redesigned. Not only is it now low-latency Bluetooth rather than Wi-Fi Direct, which should improve battery life, it fits far more comfortably in the hand. We're not entirely sure what's going on with the polygonal casing, which isn't as ergonomic as other gamepads out there, but it is lighter and less chunky than the previous version. Nvidia Shield TV (2017) review: Google Assistant Google voice assistant compatible Samsung SmartThings and wider smart home support The controller also doubles as a wide-field microphone. This will be important come the full integration of Google Assistant through a future update, as the game controller will be the device to pick up your voice commands. What is Google Assistant, how does it work and when can you use it? Google Assistant will eventually enable the Shield TV to be controlled almost entirely by voice, and Samsung SmartThings support will add the ability to control smart devices around the house. It will effectively turn your Shield into a Google Home or Amazon Echo, albeit one that plays media through a TV rather than speaker and has the ability to bring up visual, on-screen results too. Pocket-lint We've seen it work with a Nest thermostat, coffee maker and lighting in an early demo, so it's an excellent addition when it comes. Nvidia chose to use the game controller as the mic, however, so you do need to leave it lying around within earshot, which might not please all home owners. Nvidia told us that was necessary though. Putting the mic in the Shield TV box meant that it would have to be proudly displayed instead. Many owners want to hide it away in an AV cabinet or TV unit. And using the wireless remote was a no-no because of its size. You might lose it down the side of the sofa or the like, interrupting its voice pick-up capabilities. The game controller is the most likely part of the package to be left on the top of the stand or somewhere to the side. We prefer to keep our game controllers in a drawer, but hey, horses for courses. Pocket-lint The wireless remote control does have a microphone, too, which works with the Shield TV's already-implemented voice search. It is contextual and works well, finding content across multiple apps in the one search session. This is more a feature of the Android TV platform and is nothing in comparison with Google Assistant when that arrives. You ain't seen nothing yet. Or heard it. One excellent improvement to the remote is that it has a cell battery rather than rechargeable version. The former remote lasted about two weeks to a month on a charge, which was hugely annoying when all you wanted to do is watch an episode of Stranger Things. The new one lasts a year or so before needing a new, cheaply sourced battery. It also has an IR transmitter this time, which can be set to control your TVs volume as well as switch it on or off. The game controller can too. Nvidia Shield TV (2017) review: Connections and storage HDMI 2.0b port with HDCP 2.2 and CEC support Two USB 3.0 ports Ethernet and 802.11ac Wi-Fi The back of the Shield TV box is uncomplicated but well stocked. There is an HDMI 2.0 port that supports the HDCP 2.2 copy protection standard – essential for most Ultra HD content. It can also control your other home entertainment tech through HDMI CEC – allowing different devices to talk to each other and do things like switch on together with just one button press. Pocket-lint Importantly, it is also HDR capable – something few boxes on the market can do at present and a real game changer for those with compatible televisions. It can also handle Dolby Atmos and DTS-X audio streams, which will become more important as a greater number of soundbars and speaker systems adopt them. What is HDR (high dynamic range) and which TVs support it? There are two USB 3.0 ports on the rear too. These allow for connection of external drives or accessories, such as a keyboard. We advise getting a USB 3.0 hard drive or memory stick if you do fancy expanding the storage – especially from the meagre 16GB of the standard, non-Pro Shield TV. The data transfer rate of USB 3.0 is noticeable and if you store media files on an external USB 3.0 HDD, playback is far quicker. There is a Shield TV Pro version available too, with 500GB of internal solid state drive storage, but at £280 it's considerably more expensive than the standard Shield and an external drive. You can even get a 1TB USB 3.0 drive these days for less than £50. You can also use your Shield TV as a Plex media server these days (both the new and old models) so using a USB 3.0 drive means you'll be able to stream your content around the home efficiently too. Pocket-lint The last port on the back of the box, save for the mini-USB power input, is for Gigabit Ethernet. You don't necessarily need to cable the internet connection, with 802.11ac Wi-Fi supported too, but we thoroughly recommend it if you want a stable 4K HDR video flow from Netflix and Amazon Video. Nvidia Shield TV (2017) review: Video and apps Up to 4K HDR at 60fps Google Chromecast support built-in Dolby Atmos support The main purpose of the Nvidia Shield TV is to play video and play it well, whether you are streaming your own films and TV shows stored locally or through services, such as Netflix and Amazon Video. It is the only set-top-box available that plays both Netflix and Amazon Video in 4K HDR. The Amazon Fire TV plays Amazon's own content and Netflix in 4K, but no other external box supports HDR for both too. Pocket-lint This might not sound as good to you if you already own a 4K HDR television with both Netflix and Amazon Video as part of its smart functionality, but we've also found that the Shield TV plays them more efficiently. It locks down the highest resolutions faster than our 2016 LG E6 OLED TV, for example, which is no mean feat. The thing missing is Dolby Vision on Netflix – content plays in standard HDR – but that's only relevant to a small handful of people who have the enhanced high dynamic response tech on their TVs. Until spring 2017, LG's OLED sets are the only tellies that support it and, even then, few others are currently planned for release. It's one of those things that would've been a nice-to-have, but largely irrelevant; HDR is more than good enough. What is Dolby Vision? Dolby's own HDR tech explained While Ultra HD resolutions are noticeably sharper than Full HD, high dynamic response tech is revolutionary and a real game changer. Higher brightness, greater contrast and a wider colour gamut result in distinctly better and more involving images. There are plenty of HDR-ready TV shows available on both Amazon Video and Netflix these days, and they almost always look superb. We're also waiting for YouTube to start streaming HDR content through its apps on a more universal basis. And for Google Play to introduce its 4K movie service for rental or purchase in the UK. But the support of the big two streaming services is welcome and more than enough to be getting on with. The box is Chromecast enabled too, which means it works just like Google's own media streaming dongle. However, from our tests it doesn't replicate the Chromecast Ultra's ability with YouTube HDR content. It'll play YouTube 4K videos fine, when cast from an iPhone, iPad or Android device, but not in HDR. Pocket-lint Also disappointing, in a video sense, is that terrestrial TV catch-up is still poorly supported by Android TV and, therefore, the Shield TV box. While BBC iPlayer is available, ITV Hub, Demand 5 (My5) and All 4 are not. You can stream the three services from your mobile device through Chromecast support, but many rival devices support them natively, including the Amazon Fire TV and Roku boxes – a more elegant solution by far. Android TV has support for some other media apps though, including DisneyLife – Disney's own Netflix-style service. Few other boxes can access it at present. And, as we've mentioned, the Plex app on the Shield TV is superb. Not only can it play your locally stored media with great metadata and cover art support, it can make your box a media server for all other devices to stream content from. The Kodi media player app is also available, for those without a Plex subscription. Nvidia Shield TV (2017) review: Games and platform Android 7.0 Nougat operating system GeForce Now cloud gaming Nvidia GameStream supported While we feel the Nvidia Shield TV box betters its peers in video quality and support for the highest resolution and picture tech standards, those might not be enough to justify its price alone. Add its games-playing prowess though and you start to realise why you're paying a premium. There's a good reason this box comes bundled with a game controller. Like its predecessor, the Shield TV uses its Nvidia Tegra X1 processing to enhance Android gaming and stream fully-fledged PC games locally or over the internet, with little perceptible lag on the latter. The Android TV platform, updated to Android 7.0 Nougat in this case, offers plenty of games through the Google Play store – hundreds in fact. They have all been optimised to be played on a television, using a gamepad, but are generally the same games you've also played on an Android phone or tablet. Indeed, if you've bought them for your mobile device already, you can also play them on the Shield. Pocket-lint Nvidia also makes deals with some Android developers, who have enhanced some titles to make use of the improved graphics tech afforded by the Tegra X1 chipset. Versions of games, such as Portal 2 and Half-Life 2, are available for the Shield TV only, and they play just like their PC equivalents. But for the best gaming experience, you can also subscribe to Nvidia GeForce Now, the company's cloud gaming service, or stream your own PC games over a home network. What is Nvidia GeForce Now? The former is a service that has been available for a while now, with more than 40 games available to play as part of a monthly £7.49 membership fee. In addition, you can buy recently released games for one-off fees and play them over the cloud too. The benefit to doing so is the games are hosted and played on high-end gaming PCs with the latest Nvidia GeForce GTX 1080 graphics cards so will run in their highest settings. The video is sent over the internet to your Shield TV, while your controls are fed the other way. There is very little lag and it effectively feels like you are playing the game locally. Video is displayed on your TV at up to 1080p in 60 frames per second, depending on your broadband speed, and we've rarely had any image issues. Nvidia's GameStream tech is similar, but you host the games yourself. You need GeForce GTX graphics, preferably one of the newer models, and not all games are supported, but if both boxes are ticked you can play some of your best PC titles in resolutions up to 4K at 60fps. It even supports 4K HDR game streaming, but we're yet to encounter any HDR content in that sense. During a demo using a very high-end gaming PC, running a GTX 1080 card, we managed to play Titanfall 2 in 4K and 60fps. It looked as if the computer was directly plugged into the TV and we didn't notice any controller lag at all. Considering it is a Bluetooth controller and running the game over a home network, that's impressive. You do need to hardwire the internet connections of your Shield TV and PC to get the highest quality, but it still works over Wi-Fi in lower resolutions. Pocket-lint Regardless of how you do play your games, be they Android, over GeForce Now or GameStream, they are now all grouped together on the homescreen. Nvidia's previous, lightly customised menu system used to segregate them, but now just has a single section for games – in much the same way as there is an all-encompassing apps section. Games will be tagged if they are housed on PC or in the cloud, after all, you'll need your computer on if you want to play them through GameStream, but we like the fact that there's a one-stop location to find titles. You can deep dive into specific types a bit more in a dedicated Nvidia Games app, which keeps the homescreen clutter free. Other aspects of the menu screens have been simplified too, mainly thanks to Android 7.0, such as settings, although it retains a similar aesthetic to before. The top strip of the homescreen shows suggested and current content across different app. Voice search runs along the very top. Verdict The Shield TV is expensive, but its cost is relative. An equivalent Apple TV, for example, is only £50 less. And that's restricted to 1080p. It doesn't have half the bells and whistles of the Shield either. The Nvidia Shield TV is pricey because of the tech. The Tegra X1 chipset is the most powerful you'll find inside a mass-market media streamer to date. And how many set-top-boxes are capable of not only streaming games but in 4K and 60fps? If gaming is important to you then Nvidia has the ideal solution here. There are a few video apps and services notably missing from Android TV in general, which leaves room for improvement. But its Netflix and Amazon Video support is second to none in a set-top-box thanks to 4K HDR support for both. It's also an excellent way to add a Plex media server to your home network – just add a USB 3.0 storage device full of content. And when you consider that Google Assistant and SmartThings support will both be implemented in the coming months, it's clear the Shield TV has the potential to be far more than a mere media streamer. It really could be the digital hub of your home, just as Nvidia promised many moons ago. And what price would you put on that? The alternatives to consider Pocket-lint Amazon Fire TV Amazon's Fire TV 4K box might not have HDR, but it's a great access point to Amazon Video and even Netflix in Ultra HD. There's also gaming and other content for a cut of the price of the Shield. Amazon Fire TV 4K review Buy on Amazon.co.uk for £79.99 or Amazon.com for $89.99 Pocket-lint Apple TV No 4K to be found here, which makes Apple's offering feel a step behind. There are, however, plenty of games, Apple compatibility, catch-up apps and Siri voice control.

Read More have subsided. A dispute between Microsoft and Google had made it difficult for users to view their Google Calendars in the native Windows calendar app. Now it’s once again possible to operate your diary using built-in Windows tools. But just because you can use the Windows app, it doesn’t mean you should. You have options! Depending on your workflow, some of them might even be preferable to using the default Calendar app. Here’s a look at seven ways to view Google Calendar on your Windows desktop. 1. Windows Calendar App Before I discuss alternative methods, let me quickly recap how to add your Google Calendar to the Windows Calendar app. You’ll find the Calendar app in your Start menu. To add your Google account, click Settings (gear icon, bottom left-hand corner) > Manage Accounts > Add Account. The app will prompt you to select your account provider. Google is listed as one of the options. Click Google and fill in your credentials. Windows will take care of the rest. You should now see all your Google Calendars listed under “Gmail” in the left-hand panel of the app’s main screen. You can edit appointments and add new entries in the standard way. 2. Create a Browser Bookmark Another obvious method is to add a bookmark to your browser. If you’re using Microsoft Edge, navigate to your Google Calendar, click the Star icon in the address bar, select where you want to save the link, and hit Add. For easy access, you can make your Favorites Bar visible at all times. Go to Settings > View Favorites Settings > Show Favorites Bar and toggle the switch to On. If you’re on Chrome, the process is even better. Head to the Chrome Web Store and install the Calendar app. It will let you access your calendar from the Apps link within the browser or the Chrome App Launcher in your taskbar. 3. Create a Shortcut Using Chrome If you’ve followed the previous steps and installed the Calendar app from the Chrome Web Store, it’s easy to add a link to your Windows desktop or taskbar. Open Chrome’s app menu by clicking Apps in the Bookmark Bar or typing chrome://apps/ into the address bar. Locate the app, right-click on the icon, and choose Create Shortcuts. A new window will ask you to confirm your decision. Click Create and return to your desktop. You should now see a shortcut. If you don’t like a cluttered desktop, you can right-click on the shortcut and select either Pin to Taskbar or Pin to Start. You can then delete the desktop shortcut. 4. Add Your Google Calendar to Outlook 2016 If you have a copy of Outlook 2016 installed The New Outlook.com Is Here: Everything You Should Know The New Outlook.com Is Here: Everything You Should Know Microsoft has overhauled Outlook.com. If your account hasn't been migrated yet, it will happen by the end of this year. Have a look at what's new in your Outlook.com inbox. Read More on your machine, you can import your Google Calendars into the app. If done correctly, you’ll never need to use the Google web app. Note: You need to repeat this process for each individual calendar in your Google account. Firstly, you need to grab your Google Calendar’s private ICAL web address How to Share Your Google Calendar With Anyone How to Share Your Google Calendar With Anyone We show you three options for sharing your Google Calendar. Using iCal, even Apple Calendar and Outlook users can view your schedule. We also explain how to revoke access to your Google Calendar. Read More . Log into your Google Calendar and navigate to My Calendars > [Calendar Name] > Calendar Settings. Scroll down to Private Calendars and click ICAL. A new window will pop up containing a link. Copy the link as you’ll need it later. Next, fire up Outlook 2016 and go to File > Account Settings > Account Settings. In the new window, follow internet Calendars > New and paste the ICAL address from Google. You’ll now see some subscription options. Give the calendar a suitable name, customize the other choices to suit your requirements, and click OK. You can find your freshly-added agenda by clicking on the Calendar icon in the bottom right-hand corner of Outlook’s main window. 5. Use the Outlook Web App If you don’t have the Outlook desktop app and rely on the web app instead Microsoft Outlook Web Vs. Desktop: Which One Is Best for You? Microsoft Outlook Web Vs. Desktop: Which One Is Best for You? Outlook.com is a powerful online email client that comes free with Office Online. But can Outlook on the web compete with its desktop counterpart? Our Outlook comparison will help you decide for yourself. Read More , don’t worry. It’s still possible to add your Google Calendar. Repeat the above steps until you get your calendar’s private ICAL address. Next, open the web app and go to App Menu (top left-hand corner) > Calendar. To add your Google Calendar, head to Add Calendar > From internet and paste the copied ICAL address. After a few seconds, you’ll be able to access it via the Other Calendars sub-menu in the left-hand pane. Third-Party Tools I’m going to leave you with a couple of third-party tools. 6. GMinder GMinder is an open source app that runs quietly in your system tray. It has one purpose: to remind you about upcoming events from your Google Calendar. Unlike the methods I’ve already discussed, GMinder does not require you to share your calendar with another app. Just download the installer, input your login details, and let the app take care of the rest. Every time you’ve got an upcoming event, the app will send you a notification via the Action Centre. 7. Calendar Sync The previous approaches all leave your Google Calendar and your Outlook calendar as separate entities, even if they’re both accessible via the same app. The free Calendar Sync tool can merge your Outlook and Google Calendars together, thus giving you one unified agenda. You choose a one-way sync or a two-way sync and determine how often you want the sync process to run. The free version will only keep events for 30 days. The $10 pro version will keep your appointments forever and adds extra features such as multiple profiles, a way to skip reminders, multi-calendar syncing, and synchronized categories. How Do You Access Google Calendar? I’ve shown you seven ways to access your Google Calendar from your Windows desktop How to Sync Your Google Calendar with the Windows 10 Taskbar How to Sync Your Google Calendar with the Windows 10 Taskbar Sync your Google Calendar with the Windows Calendar app wasn't always possible. Since the Windows 10 Anniversary Update, you can even manage your Google, iCloud, and Outlook calendars from the Taskbar. We show you how. Read More , but the list is not exhaustive.

Google wrote: Today’s Doodle art depicts Lewis sculpting one of her most famous works, The Death of Cleopatra, which is on display at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C. Her realistic portrayal of Cleopatra’s death received acclaim from critics, who called it “the most remarkable piece of sculpture in the American section" of the show. The vibrant colors of the Google letters also pay tribute to Lewis’s Native American roots - her Native American name was Wildfire. Decades later, Lewis’s legacy continues to thrive through her art and the path she helped forge for women and artists of color. Today, we celebrate her and what she stands for – self-expression through art, even in the face of adversary. She was born on July 4, 1844 in Greenbush, New York and died on September 17, 1907 at the age of 63 on in London, England. Here is a photo of The Death of Cleopatra illustrated in the Google Doodle above: Forum discussion at Google+.

Ginny Marvin covered it yesterday but the SEM community is buzzing about it. It is called "ads added by AdWords" and it is exactly that. Google says "Ads Added by AdWords create these variations of your ad for you, potentially improving your campaign performance." Google said this can increase your ad campaign performance by 5 to 15%. "Ads Added by AdWords are created by Google based on elements of your existing text ads, such as your headlines, keywords, or other information found on your ads’ landing page," Google added. Here is how Google labels ads they created on their own, with the "added by AdWords" green label in your campaigns: We knew AdWords was doing machine learning for bidding but for creating new ads for you? That is another level. You can learn a heck of a lot more in this help document. In fact, Aaron Dicks at @impressiontalk built a script that disables this from happening. Forum discussion at Twitter.

Home > Google News > Google SEO > Google: No Plans Or Desire To Remove The Site Command Google: No Plans Or Desire To Remove The Site Command Feb 1, 2017 • 8:01 am | (1) by Barry Schwartz | Filed Under Google Search Engine Optimization Prev Story Next story Tweet Pin It   Prev Story Next Story On the heels of the link operator being killed off by Google, some SEOs are worried that Google will drop the site operator/command. The site operator lets you quickly do a site only search, such as site:www.domain.com [keyword here] and it will search that site only for that keyword. While we know the site command doesn't give an accurate page index count, we are told to use the Google Search Console reports for that, it is still useful for within site searches. Google's Gary Illyes said on Twitter that they have "no such plans" to drop the site command and added that "some of us would fight against it pretty hard if we had." That is a pretty strong message that Google is not ditching the site command, don't you think? Forum discussion at Twitter.

Most Popular Google has overtaken Apple as the world's most valuable brand, as the search giant returns to the No. 1 spot after a six-year hiatus, according to Brand Finance Global 500 report. Apple plummeted 36% to $107 billion in 2016, the report said, while Google jumped to $109.4 billion, up from $88.2 billion in 2015. "Apple has struggled to maintain its technological advantage, with new iterations of the iPhone delivering diminishing returns, while the Chinese market is now crowded with local competitors," David Haigh, CEO of Brand Finance, said in a statement. "Apple has been living on borrowed time for several years by exploiting its accumulated brand equity. This underlines one of the many benefits of a strong brand, but Apple has finally taken it too far." The former No. 1 brand received plenty of flack for ditching the headphone jack with the iPhone 7. More so, many creatives felt alienated after seeing the specs for the topline MacBook Pro. The backlash has clearly affected Apple's brand, Mr. Haigh said. Meanwhile, Lego regained its status as the world's most powerful brand ahead of the "Lego Batman Movie" release. In a digital era, Lego found a way to maintain relevancy with its Lego brand video games, which helped pave the way for 2014 surprise hit "The Lego Movie," which generated more than $469 million globally, according to Box Office Mojo. Three other movies are slated for release by 2018. "Unvalued brands can lead to undervalued companies that are more vulnerable to takeover, struggle to secure adequate financing and miss market opportunities," Mr. Haigh said. "Meanwhile a powerful brand can protect a company's value during turbulent market conditions, create new market opportunities and increase profit margins. All companies should therefore not just know the value of their brands, but also understand what drives that value and how it can be harnessed to benefit the business as a whole." Other tidbits from the report: AT&T has overtaken Verizon to become the world's most valuable telecoms brand Emirates is no longer the most valuable airline brand, having been overtaken by American, United and Delta Coca-Cola, Pepsi, McDonalds, KFC and Subway all saw their brand values fall, undermined by healthy eating trends In this article: Consumer Electronics Digital Mobile Search Technology Become a Member Register Now Renew Membership Benefits Datacenter Advertising Age     Facebook Twitter LinkedIn Google+ Pinterest Instagram YouTube Tumblr Copyright © 1994-2017 Crain Communications Privacy Statement Terms of Use About Us Advertise Reprints Contact Us AD AGE Creativity LookBook Datacenter Resources Events Jobs On Campus Site by AREA 17

Business & Tech Lightsabres and blasters from the 'Star Wars' franchise are part of the problem, the researchers claim [Lego] 15:00 1 Feb 2017 Craig Fitzpatrick 1 day ago Lego has replaced Disney as the most powerful brand in the world, according to Brand Finance, as licensing deals with franchises such as Batman, Harry Potter and Star Wars see it replace Disney at the top.  It fended off competition from Google, Nike, Ferrari and Visa on this year's list, with the fact that many of Disney's biggest blockbusters last year were produced by sub-brands (Lucasfilm's Star Wars: Rogue One, for example) cited as the reason for it tumbling out of the top 5. The world's most valuable When it comes to the most valuable brands overall, Google is king. The search engine giant overtook Apple in this year's headline rankings, with Brand Finance factoring in brand loyalty, familiarity, power corporate reputation and marketing investment when they create the Global 500. Google is now worth $109 billion, adding $21bn to its value and 20% to its advertising revenue over the past year alone to hit pole position for the first time since 2011. The Global 500 describes Google's standing as "largely unchallenged" with Brand Finance chief executive David Haigh saying of the iPhone maker's fall: "Apple has struggled to maintain its technological advantage. "New iterations of the iPhone have delivered diminishing returns and there are signs that the company has reached a saturation point for its brand." brandirectory.com Haigh also noted that American brands are increasingly following out of favour with global consumers: “There was a period when American brands were considered to be very aspirational. Gradually goodwill towards American brands has been eroded,” he said. “One of the interesting dimensions at the moment is the extent to which Trumpism is actually going to accelerate this negative view about American brands.” 15:00 1 Feb 2017 Craig Fitzpatrick 1 day ago most popular latest sport Consumer agency warning after Irish man loses €9,000 How to delete Facebook Ireland enjoy unprecedented success at the Sydney 7s Tiger Woods withdraws from the Dubai Desert Classic site terms privacy advertise with us contact competitions apps appliancesdelivered.ie © Copyright 2015 - Newstalk Ltd.

By Conner Forrest | February 1, 2017, 6:16 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: iStockphoto/cofotoisme Google has taken another formal step to fold Webpass into its overall plans for Google Fiber, announcing Webpass eligibility for customers in the following six metro areas: Chicago, Boston, Miami, San Diego, San Francisco, and Oakland. Webpass is a wireless ISP that operates its own Ethernet network utilizing both fiber optics and point-to-point wireless. In the summer of 2016, Google entered into an agreement with Webpass to acquire the company, and formally made it a part of Google Fiber last October. According to a Google blog post, customers in the listed metro areas "may be eligible to use Webpass if their building has at least 10 units, and is wired with Ethernet cabling." The post goes on to note that copper Ethernet wiring is an affordable alternative to coaxial cable or fiber to achieve gigabit speeds. SEE: Why Google Fiber failed: 5 reasons It's interesting to note that all of these cities are areas that Webpass was already operating in, and many of them are locations of company offices. So, in a sense, this is a rebranding of sorts in making Webpass more available to Google customers. More about Networking How the NFL and its stadiums became leaders in Wi-Fi, monetizing apps, and customer experience (PDF download) 3 ways to connect your private network to the public cloud Video: What's in store for the next generation of software development Subscribe to our Data Center Trends newsletter It's also interesting to see that Google's Fiber map still lists "upcoming" and "potential" Fiber cities, and the company just opened a new Fiber Space in Raleigh, North Carolina. The real question that the Webpass announcement poses is whether or not Google will bring Webpass to some of its current or future Fiber cities. Using wireless technologies to boost its last-mile efforts is nothing new for Google Fiber as, in addition to the Webpass acquisition, the company also filed with the FCC to begin testing wireless broadband with experimental transmitters. Being that wireless deployments could be cheaper than physically laying fiber in some instances, it could mean that Google Fiber might be switching its strategy away from fiber to the home (FTTH), in exchange for a wireless-first approach. If so, this could be evidence that Google Fiber isn't actually failing, as I previously wrote. If Google does indeed switch its approach, it will be facing increased competition not only from established providers, but also from Silicon Valley giants. In late 2016, AT&T began looking for a trial location for its Project AirGig, aiming to provide multi-gigabit wireless internet to urban regions. Also in late 2016, Elon Musk's SpaceX detailed a plot to launch thousands of satellites to build out a global broadband service. Additionally, Webpass doesn't offer just gigabit service. The provider offers speeds as low as 10 Mbps, geared toward multi-tenant buildings. So, in the end, this could also just be as simple as Google wanting to offer more options to its customers in terms of speed and delivery. The 3 big takeaways for TechRepublic readers Google Fiber recently announced formal support for wireless provider Webpass in six major metro areas in the US, which were already supported by Webpass. The announcement could signal a shift in Google Fiber's strategy to pursue a wireless-first approach, but it is unclear if Webpass will be coming to future Fiber cities. AT&T and SpaceX have both begun plans to provide their own wireless, high-speed internet, increasing competition for Google Fiber.

TechRadar The source for Tech Buying Advice Search RSS Reviews How To Phones TVs Laptops Deals Photography More Car Tech Wearables Tablets Components Audiovisual Gaming Computing Downloads News Pro Trending Buying Guides MWC 2017 LG G6 Samsung Galaxy S8 iPhone 8 Nintendo Switch iOS 10.2 News Best unlocked smartphones in the US Best unlocked smartphones in the US By Lewis Leong Mobile phones   These SIM-free phones can be used with no contract Shares Buying an unlocked smartphone in the US can be a smart move, whether you want to travel the globe or simply don’t want to be tied to a single carrier like AT&T, Verizon, T-Mobile or Sprint. You’ll be able to swap in SIM cards between various carriers and use the phone anywhere in the world. Say goodbye to expensive roaming charges. However, there are a few drawbacks with these no contract, unlocked phones. They’re typically expensive since you don’t sign up for a normal two-year contract. You're no longer subsidizing the full price of the phone (no, it doesn't really cost $199), so the upfront cost will be much higher.  There's a second caveat: most SIM-free unlocked phones support only GSM networks like AT&T and T-Mobile. There are only a few CDMA-capable unlocked phones that can also connect to Verizon and Sprint, and we’ll cover those notable exceptions in our comprehensive list. If you want the freedom of buying a new phone without a contract that binds you to one carrier and one country, these are the best unlocked smartphones you can buy in the US today. 13. HTC 10 Not 10/10, but the best phone for music by far Carriers: AT&T, T-Mobile, other GSM networks | Weight: 161g | Dimensions: 145.9 x 71.9 x 9 mm | OS: Android Nougat | Screen size: 5.2-inch | Resolution: 1440 x 2560 | CPU: Snapdragon 820 | RAM: 4GB | Storage: 32GB/64GB | Battery: 3,000mAh | Rear camera: 12MP | Front camera: 5MP Excellent audio quality Fantastic design Camera isn't impressive Speakers aren't stellar If you’re a music lover, you’re going to love the HTC 10. This Android smartphone is capable of playing back Hi-Res audio with its 24-bit DAC. This means the HTC 10 is capable of playing back music like it was supposed to sound in the recording studio.  HTC didn’t skimp on video and image quality either. The HTC 10’s 5.2-inch 2K display features gorgeous colors and is high enough resolution to enjoy VR on the go. Combined with the powerful Snapdragon 820 processor and 4GB of RAM, the HTC 10 should fly through any task you throw at it. The HTC 10 is also extremely well built with an all aluminum unibody design. HTC nails the look and feel of the device as the phone features a subtle curve to make comfortable in the hand. Will it work for me? Unlocked, the HTC 10 supports GSM networks like AT&T, T-Mobile and MetroPCS. There are two separate CDMA-capable versions for Verizon and Sprint, but they’re locked to their respective networks even if you buy them at full price through Best Buy or their respective carrier stores. Check out the full list of supported carriers before buying. Read the full review: HTC 10 12. OnePlus 3T A genuine flagship killer Carriers: AT&T, T-Mobile, other GSM networks | Weight: 158g | Dimensions: 152.7 x 74.7 x 7.4 mm | OS: Android Nougat | Screen size: 5.5-inch | Resolution: 1080 x 1920 | CPU: Snapdragon 821 | RAM: 6GB | Storage: 64GB/128GB | Battery: 3,400mAh | Rear camera: 16MP | Front camera: 16MP Premium design Dash charging Mediocre camera No waterproofing A flagship killer for $440? The OnePlus 3T offers tremendous value for the money when comparing performance to flagship phones that cost twice as much. OnePlus may be a burgeoning company but it’s already disrupted the market with the OnePlus 3T.  Performance is impressive and on par with flagship phones. That shouldn’t be a surprise as the 3T takes advantage of the new Snapdragon 821 chip and a ridiculous 6GB of RAM. OnePlus didn't skimp on design or materials either. Some may think it looks too similar to an iPhone or HTC, but its aluminum unibody feels great in the hand. Just don’t dunk the OnePlus 3T in water, as the phone isn’t water resistant like some of the competition.  Will it work for me? Unlocked, the OnePlus 3T supports AT&T and T-Mobile as well as MVNOs that use their infrastructure. There’s an unofficial worldwide carrier support list in the OnePlus forums so check that out before buying.  If you’re on a budget but want flagship performance, the OnePlus 3T should be at the top of your list. Read the full review: OnePlus 3T 11. ZTE Axon 7 A cheap Android phone that doesn't cheap out on specs Carriers: AT&T, T-Mobile (Sprint & Verizon pending) **Weight:** 175g | Dimensions: 151.7 x 75 x 7.9 mm | OS: Android Marshmallow | Screen size: 5.5-inch | Resolution: 1440 x 2560 | CPU: Snapdragon 820 | RAM: 4GB | Storage: 64GB | Battery: 3,250mAh | Rear camera: 20MP | Front camera: 8MP Inexpensive, yet well designed Generous 64GB of internal storage Slippery in the hand Not on all US carriers Continuing with budget flagship killers, the ZTE Axon 7 rivals the best phones on the market today, and even outdoes the OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T when it comes to features. The Axon 7 packs the same Snapdragon 820 and 4GB of RAM like many other phones on this list, but its 1440 x 2560 pixel screen one-ups the OnePlus 3T, which has a 1920 x 1080 display. This phone is ready for Google Daydream View VR. The ZTE Axon 7 also features front facing speakers and 64GB of on-board storage with the ability to add more via microSD. The all-metal body is also beautifully constructed, though it is slippery in the hand so be careful.  Will it work for me? Unlocked, the ZTE Axon 7 has all of the necessary radios to support AT&T, T-Mobile, Sprint and Verizon, but Sprint and Verizon are not officially supported.  ZTE could one day release a software update to enable support on all four major US carriers, but it’s really up to Verizon and Sprint to certify the patch. Unofficially, users have gotten the phone to work on Verizon, but there are some quirks. Read the full review: ZTE Axon 7 10. Huawei Honor 8 An extraordinarily shiny Android phone that’s extra ordinary Carriers: AT&T, T-Mobile, and other GSM carriers | Weight: 153g | Dimensions: 145.5 x 71 x 7.5 mm | OS: Android Nougat | Screen size: 5.2-inch | Resolution: 1920 x 1080 | CPU: Kirin 950 | RAM: 4GB | Storage: 32 or 64GB | Battery: 3,000mAh | Rear camera: Dual 12 MP | Front camera: 8MP Alluring reflective glass design Neat fingerprint sensor gestures Illogical software choices No OIS on the camera Another top contender for best budget unlocked smartphone is the Huawei Honor 8. This all glass and metal phone looks and feels premium, and features dual cameras and takes better pictures than the mid-range competition.  Where the Honor 8 lets us down is in its software. Huawei chose to load up the Honor 8 with its own Android skin, creating a confusing mess with few benefits. For example, Huawei decided to get rid of the iconic Android app drawer, replacing it with an iOS-like approach of dumping all of your apps onto the home screen. However, we did enjoy the fingerprint reader gestures.  Although the phone uses Huawei’s own Kirin 950 chip, its performance is comparable to that of the Snapdragon 820 found in other Android flagship phones. We found the graphics chip to be weaker than the competition, so mobile gamers and VR enthusiast should look elsewhere.  Will it work for me? Currently, the Honor 8 only supports GSM networks like AT&T and T-Mobile and other GSM-based carriers. It’s another phone that misses Verizon and Sprint compatibility. Read the full review: Honor 8 review 9. Huawei Honor 6X Honor updates one of its best Carriers: AT&T, T-Mobile, and other GSM carriers | Weight: 162g | Dimensions: 150.9 x 76.2 x 8.2 mm | OS: Android Marshmallow | Screen size: 5.5-inch | Resolution: 1920 x 1080 | CPU: Kirin 655 | RAM: 3 or 4GB | Storage: 32 or 64GB | Battery: 3,340mAh | Rear camera: Dual 12 MP | Front camera: 8MP Premium build Powerful processor set up Outdated software No USB-C If $400 is still too much to pay for a “budget” flagship killer, then the Huawei Honor 6X should appeal to you. This $250 phone packs great value for the money as it still packs a fingerprint sensor, dual cameras and a 5.5-inch full HD display. Where Huawei compromises is in screen quality, lack of USB-C and slower hardware than the flagship Honor 8. Huawei’s awkward to use and clunky software still remains on the Honor 6X, so Android purist would be happier with the lightly skinned Moto G4 Plus. Will it work for me? Unlocked, the Honor 6X, like its non-identical sibling, the Honor 8, only supports GSM networks in the US like AT&T and T-Mobile. Sorry, Verizon and Sprint customers.

Moto Z An ultra-thin modular phone from Motorola Carrier support: AT&T, T-Mobile, and other GSM networks | Weight: 136g | Dimensions: Height: 153.3 x 75.3 x 5.19 mm | OS: Android Nougat | Screen size: 5.5-inch | Resolution: 1440 x 2560 | CPU: Snapdragon 820 | RAM: 4GB | Storage: 32/64GB | Battery: 2,600mAh | Rear camera: 13MP | Front camera: 5MP Best modular phone ecosystem Incredibly thin No 3.5mm headphone jack Short battery life The Motorola Moto Z is an incredibly thin smartphone that also happens to have the best ecosystem of modular phone accessories. Whether you want to attach the Moto Z to a pair of extremely loud JBL speakers or a projector to share your videos with, the Moto Z’s Moto Mods have you covered. As with other flagship smartphones, performance is excellent from the Snapdragon 820 chip and 4GB of RAM. The Moto Z flies through any task you throw at it. Motorola has also brought the latest version of Android, 7.0 Nougat, to the Moto Z which brings increased battery life, split-screen multitasking and more. It’s not a perfect phone, as its slim body means the phone houses a smaller battery than the competition. This means mediocre battery life which can thankfully be solved with a Moto Mod battery pack. The Moto Z also ditches the 3.5mm headphone jack, but does include an adapter in the box. However, don’t expect to listen to wired headphones while charging. Will it work for me? The unlocked Moto Z works on GSM networks like AT&T and T-Mobile. Check out Motorola’s full list of compatible US networks to see if your carrier is supported.  Read the full review: Moto Z review 7. Moto G4 Plus It's a Plus, but not in the way you think Carrier support: AT&T, T-Mobile, and other GSM networks | Weight: 155g | Dimensions: Height: 153 x 76.6 x 9.8 mm | OS: Android Nougat | Screen size: 5.5-inch | Resolution: 1920 x 1080 | CPU: Snapdragon 617 | RAM: 2, 3 or 4GB (larger storage options get more RAM) | Storage: 16, 32 or 64GB | Battery: 3,000mAh | Rear camera: 16MP | Front camera: 5MP Smooth performance Good camera No NFC for Android Pay Plastic body In addition to its pricey Moto Z flagship, Motorola released the Moto G4 Plus as an affordable mid-range phone. The Moto G4 Plus may not have the latest or greatest processor, but the Snapdragon 617 is still plenty capable for everyday tasks. There are three variations of the phone that include different amounts of storage and RAM. The 16GB model gets 2GB of RAM, the 32GB model gets 3GB or RAM and the top of the line 64GB model gets a whopping 4GB of a RAM. Not bad for a budget smartphone. At $250, the Moto G4 Plus is an incredible value and shows that the performance gap between flagship and budget phones is continuing to shrink. Will it work for me? The unlocked Moto G4 Plus is compatible with all four of the major US carriers. The G4 Plus includes radios for both GSM and CDMA networks, making it one of the most versatile phones on this list.

Google Pixel XL The iPhone 7 killer made by Google Carriers: All major US networks | Weight: 168g | Dimensions: Height: 154.7 x 75.7 x 8.5mm | OS: Android 7.1 Nougat | Screen size: 5.5-inch | Resolution: 1440 x 2560 | CPU: Snapdragon 821 | RAM: 4GB | Storage: 32/128GB | Battery: 3,450mAh | Rear camera: 12MP | Front camera: 8MP One of the best smartphone cameras Useful Google Assistant Expensive No stereo speakers or waterproofing The Pixel and Pixel XL are smartphones that are designed entirely by Google. The search giant has finally taken the reigns with the Pixel phones to take on Apple’s iPhone. As a result, the Pixel phones are some of the best smartphones you can buy period. The Pixel XL features one of the best smartphone cameras on the market today, taking images in low light without problem. The Pixel is powerful thanks to the Snapdragon 821 processor and 4GB of RAM. And since Google has tight control over the software on the Pixel, the phone avoids that nasty slowdown you may experience with other Android phones. The Pixel XL is the model you should choose if you want a bigger screen and better battery life. And if you intend to buy the Google Daydream View VR headset, the XL's higher resolution screen automatically makes it the better choice – the screen is much less when it's two inches from your face. If none of that matters to you, save your money by getting the smaller version. Will it work for me? Unlocked, the Google Pixel XL works on all four of the major US carriers. It contains radios for both GSM and CDMA networks, despite the fact that it's marketed with Verizon-branded commercials. Read the full review: Google Pixel XL review 5. Google Pixel The perfect phone for Android aficionados Carriers: All major US networks | Weight: 143g | Dimensions: 143.8 x 69.5 x 8.5mm | OS: Android 7.1 Nougat | Screen size: 5-inch | Resolution: 1080 x 1920 | CPU: Snapdragon 821 | RAM: 4GB | Storage: 32/128GB | Battery: 2,770mAh | Rear camera: 12MP | Front camera: 8MP Buttery smooth performance Excellent display and camera Mediocre battery life Under baked Google Assistant If you want a smaller phone than the plus-sized models in this list but don’t want to compromise on features, the Google Pixel is for you. The Pixel is Google’s answer to the Apple iPhone and it's one of the most polished smartphones you can buy right now. Google’s control over the hardware and software means the phone simply flies. The Pixel features the latest Snapdragon 821 chip with 4GB that make split-screen multitasking is Android 7.0 Nougat a reality. It also has one of the best smartphone cameras on the market today. The only major downsides the smaller Pixel are slightly shorter battery life and less pixel-packed display. The 2,770 mAh battery will get you comfortably through most days, but you’ll want to bring a charger if you’re using the phone heavily. The 1080p Full HD screen won’t impress you as much as the XL’s Quad HD display when trying out Google Daydream View VR content. But the price is why we have it one space ahead. Most people won't need extras like a VR-ready display when, at most, they're just flirt with Google's budding virtual reality platform. Save yourself $100. Will it work for me? Yes. While the Google Pixel only sold on contract in Verizon stores, you can buy an unlocked version from Google’s site that works with all major US carriers.  Read the full review: Google Pixel review 4. iPhone 7 Apple's one-handed masterpiece Carriers: All major US networks | Weight: 138g | Dimensions: 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1mm | OS: iOS 10 | Screen size: 4.7-inch | Resolution: 750 x 1334 | CPU: Apple A10 Fusion | RAM: 2GB | Storage: 32/128/256GB | Battery: 1,960mAh | Rear camera: 12MP | Front camera: 7MP Great camera in low light Water resistant Unimpressive battery life Lacks clear upgrades While the iPhone 7 series has gotten flack for being iterative, it’s still the best iPhone you can buy today. Apple’s legendary build quality remains with the iPhone 7, and does one better by making it all waterproof. You won’t have to worry about spilling a drink on your iPhone, but you shouldn’t swim with it. Camera performance has always been impressive on the iPhone and that remains true with the iPhone 7. While its bigger brother, the iPhone 7 Plus, gets a fancy dual-lens camera setup, the single lens iPhone 7 still manages to take excellent shots, especially in low light. If you want fancy zoom functionality, you’ll have to step up to the iPhone 7 Plus. If you’re upgrading from an older iPhone, you’ll love the iPhone 7. Just remember to bring your wireless headphones or wired headphone adapter, as Apple got rid of the 3.5 mm headphone jack in the iPhone 7. Will it work for me? You can buy the iPhone 7 unlocked from the Apple Store, or at least get the Verizon version. The reason? The Verizon version contains Qualcomm’s modem that supports both CDMA and GSM networks. You can cross over anytime with the any SIM card. Sprint's iPhone 7, also a CDMA-based network, has the same modem and antenna advantage, but the carrier's unlocking rules can trap you into a temporary, 50-day contract, even when it’s bought at full price. Unlocked iPhone 7 models from AT&T and T-Mobile feature Intel’s modem, which only supports GSM networks, making them more limited if you ever decide to switch to a new carrier, or give it to a friend or family member when the iPhone 8 comes out. It’s also less valuable when it comes time to sell.  Read the full review: iPhone 7 review iPhone 7 Plus The best iPhone available right now Carriers: All major US networks | Weight: 188g | Dimensions: 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3mm | OS: iOS 10 | Screen size: 5.5-inch | Resolution: 1080 x 1920 | CPU: A10 Fusion | RAM: 3GB | Storage: 32/128/256GB | Battery: 2,900mAh | Rear camera: 12MP+12MP | Front camera: 7MP Speedy performance Excellent camera Very expensive No headphone jack The iPhone 7 Plus is the best iPhone you can buy right now. The larger brother of the iPhone 7 has an advantage in the battery life and camera departments since there’s physically more space in the phone. The iPhone 7 Plus features a 2,900 mAh battery versus the 1,960 mAh battery you get in the smaller iPhone 7. The Plus also gets a dual-lens camera system that allows you to seamless zoom in on subjects. The iPhone 7 Plus is an excellent performer thanks to Apple’s latest A10 Fusion chip and seamless iOS 10 software. Combined with slick hardware, water resistance and an excellent camera, the iPhone 7 Plus is the phone to beat. There are a few downsides with the iPhone 7 Plus though. First of all, it’s very expensive. Secondly, it removed the 3.5mm headphone jack so you’ll be forced to buy wireless headphones or use the included headphone adapter that prevents you from charging at the same time. Will it work for me? You can buy the iPhone 7 Plus unlocked and SIM-free from Apple, but if you have to lean toward one carrier, get the Verizon version. That’s because the phones from Verizon (and Sprint) contain Qualcomm’s modem that supports both CDMA and GSM networks, and Verizon has a less stringent contract (Sprint has a 50-day activation period before it can be unlocked). The unlocked iPhone 7 from AT&T and T-Mobile contains Intel’s modem, which only supports GSM networks, making them more limited and less valuable when it comes time to resell your no contract smartphone.  Read the full review: iPhone 7 Plus review 2. Samsung Galaxy S7 One of two five star phones from Samsung Carriers: All major US carriers | Weight: 152g | Dimensions: 142.4 x 69.6 x 7.9 mm | OS: Android Marshmallow | Screen size: 5.1-inch | Resolution: 1440 x 2560 | CPU: Exynos 8890 | RAM: 4GB | Storage: 32GB/64GB | Battery: 3,000mAh | Rear camera: 12MP | Front camera: 5MP Improved, waterproof design Fantastic screen and performance Expensive Fingerprint magnet Sure, the Samsung Galaxy S7 may look nearly identical to the Galaxy S6 but it’s the subtle tweaks that make the Galaxy S7 an improved experience. The Galaxy S7 still features a glass back but is now curved, making the phone feel extremely comfortable in the hand. Samsung even made the Galaxy S7 slightly thicker to accommodate a larger battery. But the biggest change from the Galaxy S6 is waterproofing. The Galaxy S7 can survive a dunk in a pool or spilled drink without problems. Not happy with 32 or 64GB of internal storage? Samsung brought back microSD card support to the Galaxy S7, meaning you can add up to an additional 200GB of storage. Performance is excellent, even with Samsung’s TouchWiz skin on top of Android. The company has worked to make TouchWiz less intrusive but you’ll still be waiting months for the latest Android version. The good news is that the phone flies and its camera is excellent, even when compared to newer phones like the Google Pixel. Will it work for me? Unlocked, the Samsung Galaxy S7 (SM-G930U) supports all major US carriers. The advantage of buying an unlocked Galaxy S7 is that you won’t get any carrier branding or bloatware installed. Plus, Samsung Pay will work, unlike unlocked international variants. Read the full review: Samsung Galaxy S7 review 1. Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge The best smartphone in the world - it's a work of art Carrier support: All major US carriers | Weight: 157g | Dimensions: 150.9 x 72.6 x 7.7 mm | OS: Android Marshmallow | Screen size: 5.5-inch | Resolution: 1440 x 2560 | CPU: Exynos 8890 | RAM: 4GB | Storage: 32GB/64GB | Battery: 3,600mAh | Rear camera: 12MP | Front camera: 5MP Incredible camera Beautiful screen and blazing performance Expensive Slightly plastic feel Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge features the same curved screen as the Galaxy S6 Edge, but there are subtle changes beneath the sloped glass that help refine the experience. The hardware feels better in the hand thanks to a curved back and slim bezels. This means the Galaxy S7 Edge feels smaller than its screen size would suggest. Samsung packed the Galaxy S7 Edge with the same excellent camera found in the smaller Galaxy S7, which focuses quickly and captures lots of lights in dim environments. It doesn’t have the fancy dual lens systems of other phones on this list but the image quality speaks for itself. On the software front, Samsung still offers its TouchWiz skin on top of Android, but the company has worked to scale back the intimidating amount of options and customizations. You’ll still be waiting months to get the latest version of Android, but the tweaks and features Samsung offers over stock Android may be worth it to some. Will it work for me? Unlocked, the Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (SM-G935U) supports all major US carriers, including Verizon, Sprint, AT&T and T-Mobile. The other advantage of buying an unlocked Galaxy S7 Edge is that you won’t get any gaundy carrier branding or bloatware installed and Samsung Pay works without a hitch.

Born to a father of Afro-Haitian descent and a mother of Mississauga Ojibwe and African-American heritage in 1844, Lewis was considered the first woman of African-American and Native American heritage to become a globally renowned fine arts sculptor, according to Google. “Today, we celebrate her and what she stands for — self-expression through art, even in the face of adversity,” Google wrote. Edmonia Lewis Enrolled in Oberlin College at age 15 but unable to complete her degree because of the discrimination she faced, she later apprenticed under after Edward A. Brackett, a Boston sculptor who worked with some of the era’s best-known abolitionists, and found success. Later, she would be based in Rome, where she started sculpting with marble, and was known to fuse those cultural themes with the Neoclassical style in her works. She continued to win praise for her artwork until her death in 1907. In the Google Doodle, Lewis is shown sculpting The Death of Cleopatra — one of her best-known pieces, which received acclaim as “the most remarkable piece of sculpture in the American section” of the Smithsonian American Art Museum.

It happens, regularly. You may not know why exactly. It looks like an algorithm may have done it — and now you need to reach a human being at the company to get back on. NPR has interviewed more than two dozen users in that situation — all people who rely on Facebook to do their work, make their living. Their stories, which we'll share in a separate article, made us wonder: If you needed to reach Facebook, what would you do? Many people would go online and search for "Facebook customer service." We tried that, and got this number: 844-735-4595. It was prominently displayed as the top search result on Google. Google even made it a "featured snippet" — that is, a result highlighted in a box at the top, enhanced to draw user attention and lend credibility. Please do not call it. You will get someone real — just not from Facebook. The first time NPR called, someone picked up and then put the phone down — maybe on a table. You could hear mumbling in the room. It felt suspicious. So NPR gave the number to Pindrop, a company that specializes in phone fraud. A Pindrop researcher, who has to remain anonymous for his work, called up and recorded as he pretended to be a Facebook user in distress. A call center operator named "Steven" — who, according to Pindrop analysis, is based in India — says: "Thanks for calling Facebook." He is pretending to be a Facebook employee. The Pindrop researcher plays along and explains he is locked out of his Facebook account. He needs help getting reactivated. "Steven" gives him very unusual advice: Go to a Wal-Mart or a Target. "Just walk up over there and tell them to provide you an iTunes card. OK? And on the backside of that iTunes card there would be a 16-digit security code." Maybe you see where this is going. Steven continues: "You need to call us back on this same number and provide me that 16-digit security code so that I can activate that access and we'll be giving you the password for your new — for your old account." This is a scam. The top Google search result for "Facebook customer service" led to a person asking for codes on iTunes gift cards. This is a well-known method of stealing from innocent people online. (Both Apple and the Federal Trade Commission have issued alerts about it.) That toll-free "Facebook" line was not just on Google. That number and others have been circulating on Facebook itself, on pages where users are asking for help, for at least a year. In one instance, a user asked whether the number was valid and a member of the company's Help Team responded: "There isn't a number to contact Facebook. ... It sounds like the email or notification you saw is likely a scam." It's unclear whether the Help Team member reported it to her superiors to investigate. "Wow. Wow. Wow. That's crazy," says Marty Weintraub, founder of Aimclear Marketing. He wrote a leading industry book on Facebook advertising, long before the rest of the world realized the company would dominate the Internet economy. "This is an astonishing result." He also wrote a book on how to manipulate search results, to get your brand or product up on top. He knows that companies monitor their search results, to see what their customers want, and that criminals and competitors try to exploit powerful brands. These are standard practices. What Weintraub finds astonishing is that a term as basic as "Facebook customer service" slipped through the cracks. "It's not like somebody's searching for 'Hey, what color are Mark Zuckerberg's socks?' It's not like it's something that's off the beaten path," Weintraub says. "So one would think that a company as large as Facebook would be monitoring [the] search engine results page for a major query surrounding their services." According to Google data, "Facebook customer service" gets searched, on average, about 27,000 times a month in the U.S. Weintraub says that is sizable, that Facebook should have known about it "almost the first minute" it came up, and that the company should have guarded its users. "I'd be so scared," he says. "These are people who are looking for help with the product and they're getting scammed. OMG." NPR informed Facebook and Google about the scam line. Facebook said that it has been investigating the group associated with this toll-free number for some time; that this group is targeting many platforms; and that it's up to Google to explain why it displays certain search results. A Google spokesperson said in a statement that the company has taken steps to remove the fraudulent number. Neither company explained how the prominent search result went unnoticed. And to be clear, Facebook does not have a phone number for regular users to call. It does have an online help center, located here. (Facebook pays NPR and other leading news organizations to produce live video streams.) NPR's Aarti Shahani has started a page on Facebook for people to share concerns about the platform. It's called Tell Zuck. If you use Facebook for work, and find you're unable to reach the company, tell her your story at www.facebook.com/tellzuck. Copyright 2017 NPR.

Try our quiz It’s a term with a lot of pejorative and partisan baggage, but ‘fake news’ describes a real problem: Media that’s custom-made to fool you. Globe digital editor Evan Annett offers some pointers on how to avoid falling for hoaxes PHOTOS BY EVAN ANNETT/THE GLOBE AND MAIL EVAN ANNETT The Globe and Mail Last updated: Wednesday, Feb. 01, 2017 10:12AM EST Share via email Share on facebook Share on twitter Share on LinkedIn Comments Why we’re talking about ‘fake news’ now During and after the 2016 U.S. election, Americans learned the campaign had been a gold rush for hoaxsters catering to Trump supporters’ tastes and beliefs. Some of the best-performing fake election stories outperformed stories by trusted major news outlets. For companies like Facebook and Google, it was a wake-up call to crack down on fraud; for Democrats, it suggested voters had been tricked and the election was a sham; and for President Donald Trump and his supporters, “fake news” became an epithet to use against journalists whose reporting they didn’t like. In a Pew Research Center study last month, Americans acknowledged that fake news stories caused “a great deal of confusion” in the election. Most were confident in their ability to spot fake stories, but about one in four acknowledged that they had also shared stories that they knew at the time or discovered later were fake. On The Globe’s live news desk, telling real breaking news from the fake stuff has been an important part of my job as a digital editor. Discerning the truth is tricky enough as it is with the usual hazards of rumour, incomplete facts, spin and simple misunderstandings; hoaxes make it even harder. This is an attempt to pin down the definition of “fake news” more precisely, and offer some tips on how to spot it. Pay close attention: There’s a quiz at the end to see if you can tell hoax stories from real news and satire. (You can skip ahead to it here if you prefer.) What fake news is Disinformation for profit: Craig Silverman, the news media editor at BuzzFeed, has documented dozens of examples of for-profit hoax sites, based in Eastern Europe and elsewhere, who engineered U.S. election coverage that would be widely shared on Facebook so they could reap digital advertising revenue. Disinformation for political gain: Rulers from Julius Caesar to Joseph Stalin have used biased state media to charm their allies and confuse their enemies. Until recently, we’d just call that propaganda, but in the current context, “fake news” often means something more specific: state-funded fraudulent websites set up by one country to sow confusion in another. Russians call it dezinformatsiya, or disinformation. Disinformation for crime: Hackers can sometimes gain access to the websites or social media accounts of reputable news outlets and disseminate fake stories. Though they may be motivated by profit or politics, sometimes it’s just to sow confusion for the hell of it. Viral pranks: Even without nefarious motives or illegal tactics, individuals or group can spread hoaxes for fun, falling somewhere in the no-man’s-land between fake news, pranks and publicity stunts. Consider “Golden Eagle Snatches Kid in Montreal,” a video created by three Montreal animation students in 2012 as a class project. The video appeared to show a golden eagle (a real species, though not one native to Quebec) grabbing a small child in its talons and flying away. Some media outlets initially reported on the video as fact. So if something that isn’t really a news report is fake, but makes the news, is it fake news? Probably, though it would depend on how many outlets fell for the hoax. Speaking of which … Uncritically reporting a hoax as fact: If a well-crafted hoax spreads widely enough, credible news outlets can boost their credibility if they report it without checking the facts or including the usual caveats that it might be only rumours. What fake news isn’t Stories from satire sites: Websites like The Beaverton are intentional news parodies, and different sites have different standards for labelling their content as such. But readers who don’t know it’s satire may mistake it for fact, even if it’s clearly labelled as satire (especially if that labelling isn’t as clear when stories get shared on Twitter or RSS feeds). Satirical stories from regular news sites: Opinion and feature writers in mainstream media will sometimes use satire or fanciful hypothetical examples to make a point. Check to see if it’s labelled as satire or opinion. Honest reporting mistakes: Even the best reporters sometimes get things wrong, report things as fact before they’re confirmed or get spun by sources who aren’t telling the whole truth. But if there’s no intention to fool anyone, it’s not fake news. Critical reporting to determine if something is a hoax or not: If a viral story seems too good to be true, news organizations can still report on what the public knows so far with skepticism and caveats as they try to figure out what’s really going on. Journalism you don’t like: Enough said. How do I spot fake news? Google and Facebook have begun testing out new tools to help users better spot and flag fake news sites. Google is now barring hoax sites from its advertising platform and is testing fact-checking labels in Google News, and Facebook implemented a new system for users and fact checkers to report suspicious stories. Those tools aren’t available in Canada yet, though the companies say they will be soon. But the most reliable media-literacy tool is your own common sense. Here’s a checklist that can help. 1. Eliminate the usual suspects Do you trust the source of the information? It helps to keep a mental checklist of the organizations you trust and check often (like this one, we hope); the ones you don’t check often but know by reputation (local newspapers or TV stations outside your community or country); the ones you know are parody sites; partisan or gossip outlets that you don’t trust most of the time; and the sites that you know purport to be real news but aren’t (i.e. known fake-news-for-profit sites). Once you exclude those, you’re left with the outlets you don’t know about and don’t know if you can trust. That’s where the hardest work of verification happens. 2. Trust, but verify Even it looks sort of like a news outlet you trust, you should still check for signs that it might be a hoax. Is it written in a strange way that you wouldn’t normally expect from that source? Check the URL and the design of the website for signs of misleading mimicry; maybe it’s a URL that’s sort of like the one you know, but with an unusual country code or a typo in it. As with websites, some Twitter accounts mimic mainstream media by switching letters that are hard to tell apart (@globeandmail versus @globeandmai1, for instance) or using a plausibly similar-sounding name. Look for Twitter’s blue verification checkmark to make sure the account is real. 3. The smell test If you don’t know the source, look around for clues to whether it’s reliable or not. a) If it’s a Twitter account, how many followers does it have, and is it a verified account? b) If it’s a webpage, do the URL, main page and “about” page look credible? c) If it’s an e-mail notification, does the sender’s address look right? Is it worded strangely? Is it asking you to reply immediately with sensitive information? (Be cautious when clicking on links you don’t trust; it might be a phishing scam to install malware on your computer. Keep your browser up to date and consider using extensions that protect you from known phishing sites.) 4. A second opinion If the source seems like a legitimate news organization, it’s time to look around a bit at the rest of the media landscape. Is the information also being reported by news outlets that you do trust? How many, and which ones? Do the details of their report match up with the information you saw originally? Are they citing reputable, named sources? Try our quiz Okay, so you think you have an idea of what fake news is and how to recognize it. Let’s test that. Don’t consider it cheating if you Google these stories to see if they’re legitimate or not; that’s part of the exercise. We’re not going to link to any of the stories shown (if they’re fake news, they shouldn’t get the traffic), but you can enlarge the screenshots provided to get a closer look. 1 It’s Jan. 22, 2017, and you see this tweet. What is it? a. Real b. Fake c. Satire Answer: Fake. The Twitter account, @nytvideo, is a real New York Times account, but something’s off. If Russia were planning to attack the United States with missiles (which is pretty unbelievable, and which they so far haven’t done), why would the Times break that story on their video Twitter account and not the main one? Also, New York Times tweets are typically written in full sentences, but this tweet doesn’t capitalize the first letter or end on a period. It also puts “breaking” and the hashtags on their own lines, which Times social media editors don’t usually do. The reason it looks so strange is because hackers wrote it, hijacking the account and writing subsequent tweets attributing the attack to the hacker group OpenMine. The Times deleted the tweets. 2 You see this story appear on your Facebook feed. What is it? a. Real b. Fake c. Satire Answer: Fake. ETF News, or EndingTheFed.com, emerged as one of the more notorious fake-news sites during the election, and often republished content word for word from other right-wing sites. (In this case they’re attributing the information to another website without citing sources. Even if the story were true, this is a sign to be skeptical: They’re not presenting the information as firsthand.) 3 You see this story on globeandmail.com. What is it? a. Real b. Fake c. Satire Answer: Satire. Konrad Yakabuski wrote a column set 25 years in the future, so if you read the first paragraph and say, “Wait! Canada’s only 150 years old!” you didn’t read the headline and missed the joke. 4 It’s Dec. 29, 2016, and you see this tweet. What is it? a. Real b. Fake c. Satire Answer: Fake. First of all, if the Queen was dead, you’d be hearing about it in a lot more places than just this one tweet. Second, while the BBC’s U.K. news feed is named “BBC News (UK),” its handle is @BBCNews, not @BBCNewsUKI. The superfluous extra “I” at the end, which a reader in a hurry might mistake for a parenthesis, is a giveaway that the account’s not real. 5 You see this story on Twitter. What is it? a. Real b. Fake c. Satire Answer: Fake. The source may be legitimate, but the photo is fake. The raccoon-riding-an-alligator story went viral in 2015, spreading from Florida media to global news outlets like the BBC. But it all turned out to be a hoax by American performance artist Zardulu, who staged the photo with taxidermied animals. 6 It’s Sept. 29, 2011, and you see this tweet. What is it? a. Real b. Fake c. Satire Answer: Satire. Discerning readers know tweets from The Onion are parody, though the satirical site pushed the limits with this tweet and got in some trouble for it. The tweets were setting up a story satirizing the partisan budget feuds in Congress at the time, in which lawmakers held a group of schoolchildren hostage for $12-trillion in cash. U.S. Capitol police issued a statement calling the “breaking” tweets “false information.” 7 A friend e-mails this story to you. What is it? a. Real b. Fake c. Satire Answer: Real, improbably, though the health benefits of vaginal jade-egg use likely aren’t. 8 Your aunt sends you this story on Facebook. What is it? a. Real b. Fake c. Satire Answer: Fake. The story is top-to-bottom false, misidentifying the gunman in the March 28 Capitol Hill shooting and quoting a fake analyst blaming the violence on Donald Trump supporters. The site is trying to look like ABC News, right down to the logo with “ABC” in a black circle, but it’s not a good enough imitation. The URL is wrong, too; the real ABC is abc.go.com, whereas this is abc.com.co (the .co is a country code for Colombia, whose domains are easy to register). 9 You’re skimming the headlines on RSS reader Feedly and see this. What is it? a. Real b. Fake c. Satire Answer: Satire. “The Borowitz Report” is a regular satirical column in The New Yorker. On the magazine’s website, the story itself is labelled “satire from The Borowitz Report” above the headline, and the column’s main page has a subheading saying “not the news.” But in Feedly, stripped of the context the New Yorker website provides, a reader unfamiliar with Mr. Borowitz’s work might miss the warnings that it’s satire. 10 Somebody sends you this story over Facebook Messenger. What is it? a. Real b. Fake c. Satire Answer: Fake. The idea of Russian hackers meddling in the U.S. election is plausible and topical; in a report last year, U.S. intelligence services were fairly certain that Russian hackers did indeed compromise Democratic National Committee servers to leak information that might help Mr. Trump win. But a story about one of those hackers confessing everything is a little too good to be true, especially when the story’s only source, “World News Daily Report,” also publishes stories like “Pyramids were built with help from dinosaurs, claims top Egyptologist.” How well did you do?

Close share panel Image copyright PA NHS staff using Google's search engine has triggered one of its cybersecurity defences. NHS Digital confirmed so many NHS staff use the search engine that it had started asking them to take a quiz to verify they were "not a robot". News site the Register reported one NHS Trust had told staff to "use Bing" instead. Google indicated its systems were designed to spot unusual traffic and were working as intended. Detecting suspicious traffic from one network can help defeat potential cyber-attacks, such as attempts to try to overwhelm a website. The BBC understands Google is not deliberately singling out NHS traffic. A Google spokeswoman said: "Our systems are simply checking that searches are being carried out by humans and not by robots in order to keep web users safe. Once a user has filled out the Captcha [security check], they can continue to use Google as normal." The NHS is one of the biggest employers in the world, with more than a million members of staff. An email sent by an NHS system administrator suggested the number of staff using the search engine was "causing Google to think it is suffering from a cyber-attack". NHS Digital told the Register: "We are aware of the current issue concerning NHS IP addresses which occasionally results in users being directed to a simple verification form when accessing Google. "We are currently in discussion with Google as to how we can help them to resolve the issue." NHS Digital was unable to suggest what NHS staff may be searching for using Google.

(VZ) Shouldn’t Even BLINK on Yahoo Deal View All Posts Disruption is everywhere. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) disrupts how we shop, while Airbnb disrupts where we stay. Tesla Motors Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) disrupts what we drive, and Uber even disrupts whether we drive. If a teen with 2 million Instagram followers can disrupt how billion-dollar businesses find customers, the rest of us need to dive in and start swimming … or at least buy the one stock which has its hands in all of the above: Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Source: Shutterstock Simply put, GOOGL stock is the most innovative, most disruptive and cheapest $800 equity I know. Let me explain. Silicon Valley money manager Michael Moe and his team at GSV Asset Management produce a provocative weekly newsletter dedicated to highlighting where they think the world is going. While doing research for my Bullseye Brief, one of their recent pieces got me thinking about innovation in more tangible terms. The team ranked eight global technology companies based on their involvement across 22 cutting-edge categories. Hands down, Alphabet ranks No. 1, capturing 21 of 22. Innovation Leaders Curiously, all eight GSV-highlighted companies have dedicated efforts in the areas of artificial intelligence, big data and cloud services, making these three the Holy Grail of innovation. The first two come as no surprise, as data gathering and analysis are critical to predicting behavior, enabling companies to target consumers accordingly. Web services, which is now the fastest-growing segment for Amazon, is less obvious but nonetheless a clear indicator these innovators want to get bigger by serving as the backbone for other companies. This is key, and since Google already commands 49% of the global online advertising market according to Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser, I’ll bet on GOOGL. Moonshot Much of Google’s innovative efforts happen at its off-site research center called Google X, aka the Moonshot Factory. It’s run by a futurist named Astro Teller, and I highly recommend his TED Talk explaining how Google X approaches innovation: Identify a problem affecting millions of people. Find or propose a radical solution for solving that problem. Move full speed ahead if there’s reason to believe technology for such a radical solution could actually be built. He says Google X people spend most of their time “breaking things and trying to prove they’re wrong” but believes that’s their secret … what makes Googlers different. By “killing” more projects than they approve, their success rate rises. Alphabet spent $13.8 billion last year on research and development — the second highest number of any company in the world behind Amazon, and second highest as a percentage of sales among the eight innovation leaders. R&D as % of Revenue Alphabet invests a staggering amount of money to fund R&D, both because it can and because it has to. With three times more online advertising than its next closest competitor, GOOGL is a cash cow. By the same token, it has significant overlap with all seven competitors in the most obvious categories — like robotics and AI– and each of these companies is hungry to dominate. There’s no letting up in this crowd. Innovate or die. What’s GOOGL Stock Worth? Ultimately, the question is value: What do we pay?

Society Economy Sport Arts & Showbiz Overview    News    Articles    Interviews  Calendar Invalid query Google wins "right to be forgotten" battle in Japan February 1, 2017 - 16:36 AMT PanARMENIAN.Net - Google has won a long-standing battle in Japan that drew parallels with Europe’s “right to be forgotten” ruling, TechCrunch says. The Japanese Supreme Court on Wednesday, February 1 dismissed four cases against the U.S. company seeking the removal of allegedly defamatory comments in its Google Maps service, including one high-profile case involving a medical clinic. Back in April 2015, the Chiba District Court ruled that Google must delete the comments, but the search giant appealed that decision and has now prevailed. The ruling dismisses the cases, which were troubling because the comments in question appeared to be legitimate. In the instance of the medical clinic, two comments made about the business via Google Maps seemed to document negative customer experiences. However, the clinic had sought to scrub them from the web via a defamation suit against Google. While there are similarities with Europe’s “right to be forgotten” ruling, the legal cases are not the same. The Europe’s case, the issues center around the freedom of individuals, but, in Japan, the suits against Google came a small number of plaintiffs that included both businesses and individuals. “We’re pleased that with these latest rulings, the Supreme Court has unanimously recognized, based on existing privacy and defamation laws, that any decision to delete information from search results should prioritize the public’s right to information,” Google told TechCrunch in a statement. The U.S. firm previously argued against the removals, stating that they did not violate its terms and served an important purpose for the public. “While we provide tools that allow business owners to respond to reviews, and we take down posts that violate our policies, we believe online reviews, positive and negative, are a critical tool for people to give and read direct feedback about businesses,” it said in 2015.

Share Tweet Share Tags : Interesting facts-Interesting facts+ Even if you have lived under a rock for the past few days, you've still probably heard of President Trump's immigration ban — the executive order, which now blocks citizens from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen from entering the U.S. for the next 3 months. Naturally, this move ruffled some feathers (putting it lightly) and caused quite the controversy. Executives from large tech companies also jumped in the skirmish, speaking out against the immigration ban. Microsoft's Satya Nadella went on to say "As an immigrant and as a CEO, I’ve both experienced and seen the positive impact that immigration has on our company, for the country, and for the world" in a lengthy message opposing the president's order; Facebook creator Mark Zuckerberg noted how both he and his wife are descended from immigrants and refugees and expressed hope that the Trump administration would come forth with a more balanced solution soon. Google's co-founder Sergey Brin and CEO Sundar Pichai even took part in a protest against the ban, both speaking out against the order. My great grandparents came from Germany, Austria and Poland. Priscilla's parents were refugees from China and Vietnam....Posted by Mark Zuckerberg on Friday, January 27, 2017 According to Mr. Pichai, 187 Google employees could be affected by the ban in one way or another. Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and other tech giants have their legal teams at the ready to assist affected employees to their ability. Viber went on to offer free phone calls between the US and the seven affected countries via the Viber Out call feature. To top their words, Amazon, Microsoft, and Expedia have declared that they support a suit led by the Washington state attorney general against President Trump's executive order. Apple's Tim Cook first addressed company employees in a letter (press button below to read in full), then later gave a few interviews, saying that Apple believes in the importance of immigration and that it doesn't support the new policy. A lot of Apple employees and their families were affected by the ban, said Cook, and continued to say that the HR, Legal, and Security teams of the company are in contact with them. +- Press Release Team, In my conversations with officials here in Washington this week, I’ve made it clear that Apple believes deeply in the importance of immigration — both to our company and to our nation’s future. Apple would not exist without immigration, let alone thrive and innovate the way we do. I’ve heard from many of you who are deeply concerned about the executive order issued yesterday restricting immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries. I share your concerns. It is not a policy we support. There are employees at Apple who are directly affected by yesterday’s immigration order. Our HR, Legal and Security teams are in contact with them, and Apple will do everything we can to support them. We’re providing resources on AppleWeb for anyone with questions or concerns about immigration policies. And we have reached out to the White House to explain the negative effect on our coworkers and our company. As I’ve said many times, diversity makes our team stronger. And if there’s one thing I know about the people at Apple, it’s the depth of our empathy and support for one another. It’s as important now as it’s ever been, and it will not weaken one bit. I know I can count on all of you to make sure everyone at Apple feels welcome, respected and valued. Apple is open. Open to everyone, no matter where they come from, which language they speak, who they love or how they worship. Our employees represent the finest talent in the world, and our team hails from every corner of the globe. In the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, “We may have all come on different ships, but we are in the same boat now.” Tim When asked whether Apple is looking at some kind of legal pressure it could apply, as others have done, Cook replied that the company wants to be "constructive and productive". The CEO has spent his weekend meeting with officials at Washington, discussing the importance of immigrants to the tech industry and the country's economy. sources: Satya Nadella; TheIndianExpress; BusinessInsider; TechCrunch Huawei casts Apple's "Get a Mac" actor for new US ad campaign 01 Feb Prev news Dear Android users: don't trust your VPN app 01 Feb Next news Close newer posts EU prepares to abolish mobile roaming charges starting mid-2017 01 Feb Huawei Mate 9 battery life test results are out: beats iPhone 7 Plus, Galaxy 01 Feb Nintendo launches "Gold Goombas" mega event for Super Mario Run 01 Feb Dear Android users: don't trust your VPN app 01 Feb Now reading: Tech industry vs immigration ban: Google protests, Amazon sues, Tim Cook pressures Washington officials Tech industry vs immigration ban: Google protests, Amazon sues, Tim Cook 01 Feb Huawei casts Apple's "Get a Mac" actor for new US ad campaign 01 Feb Samsung Galaxy S8/Plus vs S7/edge specs and design: preliminary comparison 01 Feb Apple App Store grows to 2.2 million apps, records double the revenue of 01 Feb T-Mobile testing Android Nougat for the Samsung Galaxy S7 and S7 edge 01 Feb Google Allo no longer among the top 500 most popular Android apps 01 Feb older posts Featured stories   Photo of the LG G6 in the wild shows its glossy back   Best retro camera apps for Android and iOS   The most anticipated gadgets of 2017   Welcome to Apple, the Camera Company   LG G6 vs LG G5, LG G4: preliminary comparison   7 awesome Android and iOS games you've probably never heard of 99 Comments Follow Following Options Close Always view all comments Show comments: default hide low rated show moderated comments Display mode: Threaded Chronological Newest first Save 1 2 3 4 Next » posted on 2 days ago, 05:59 11 Reply 1.

Because your average citizen is a high profile target for those that would love to do your company harm. Because the average citizen is going to attract crazies and nutjobs just by virtue of what they do for a living.

And that's why ancient civilization remains 5000 years in China. While Greece philosophy and teachings barely survive because whole Greece civilization genocided due to poor border control.

The ability for Trump's wives to fly over walls demonstrate that a wall is a waste of taxpayer money. Most illegal immigration is done with visa over stays, not border crossing. posted on 2 days ago, 08:02 7 in response to #7 in response to #7 Hide Reply 10.

Lets make America great again by treating black people like we use too. By not hkring them and paying them, but putting a gin to their heads and forcing them. Lets go back to rapong their woman and hangimg them from trees, thisnis what made America great. In fact Trimp voiced this very thing at one of his rallies becsuse i saw the video.

X Brands on the run: healthy eating is bad news for fast food firms Google beats Apple to become ‘most valuable brand’ globally, as KFC, McDonald’s slump Wed, Feb 1, 2017, 13:22 Updated: Wed, Feb 1, 2017, 13:23 Charlie Taylor The LEGO Batman Movie comes out next week and will likely increase the strength of the toymaker’s brand.         Google has overtaken Apple to become the world’s most valuable brand, while Lego is deemed to be the most powerful, according to a new survey. In a sign of the times, tech-related brands dominate the most valuable index with Amazon, Microsoft, Samsung and Facebook among other companies included in Global Finance’s rankings. Google’s brand value rose by 24 per cent last year, increasing from $88.2billion to $109.4billion, putting it in first place in the “most valuable” rankings, a position it hasn’t held since 2011. Apple, which has held the top spot for the past five years, dropped one place after its brand value fell by 27 per cent in 2016, from $145 billion to $107.1 billion. David Haigh, chief executive of Brand Finance, a consultancy with headquarters in London, said while Google was finding new innovative ways to monetise users, Apple was struggling to maintain its technological advantage. “Apple has been living on borrowed time for several years by exploiting its accumulated brand equity. This underlines one of the many benefits of a strong brand, but Apple has finally taken it too far,” he said. The latest rankings show AT&T has overtaken Verizon to become the world’s most valuable telecoms brand, while Emirates was overtaken by American, United and Delta in the airline category. ICBC is the world’s most valuable banking brand and Chinese banks are now worth more than those of the US, the survey finds. A focus on healthy eating globally has led to a decline in brand value for Coca-Cola, Pepsi, McDonald’s, KFC and Subway. Elsewhere, Nokia is back from the grave and has returned to the top 500 ranking, following its takeover and rebrand of Alcatel and launch of the Nokia 6 phone. Lego has regained its status as the world’s most powerful brand from Disney, ahead of the new Lego Batman film, which comes out next week. ADVERTISEMENT Under Global Finance’s rankings, brands are first evaluated to determine their power and strength based on factors such as marketing investment, familiarity, loyalty, staff satisfaction and corporate reputation. Brand strength is then used to determine what proportion of a business’s revenue is contributed by the brand, which is projected into perpetuity to assess overall value.       Topics: David Haigh Alcatel-Lucent Amazon Apple Brand Finance Coca Cola Disney Facebook Google ICBC Kentucky Fried Chicken McDonalds Microsoft Pepsi Samsung Subway Verizon Nokia United States Read More Paddy Power to sponsor UK horse racing on TV3 Irish boardrooms ignoring importance of marketing – report Irish companies plan to spend more on marketing in 2017 JC Decaux signs €30m national bus shelter contract Converge-Digital seeks up to €500,000 to focus on ad-buying tech Moore Stephens Dublin office plays role in Mourinho and Ronaldo tax avoidance Cristiano Ronaldo accused of using Dublin to avoid Spanish taxes Marketing experts focus on reinventing the brand Nielsen launches digital advertising research tool in Ireland Conor McGregor sponsor barred from operating in France Subscribe.   More from The Irish Times Financial Services Allianz to buy out minority shareholders in Irish subsidiary Technology Millionaire start-up owners must be crackers to do it all again Golf Tiger Woods withdraws from Dubai Classic with back injury Innovation VirtueBrush: clean teeth with a clear conscience?

Forums Join   Google Fiber Now Selling Gigabit Fixed Wireless Via Website by Karl Bode Wednesday Feb 01 2017 07:40 ESTTipped by Revcb The folks over at 9to5 Google note that Webpass wireless broadband service is now listed as available in six markets via Google Fiber's availability map. Alphabet/Google acquired Webpass last October as part of the company's pivot toward next-generation wireless broadband. Webpass is a smaller ISP founded in 2003 that delivers gigabit connectivity to select apartment complexes and MDUs. Before the acquisition, Webpass already served roughly 20,000 business and residential customers in San Francisco Bay Area, San Diego, Chicago, Boston, and Miami. Clicking on one of the Webpass-enabled cities on Google Fiber's map now directs you over to the Webpass website, where users are informed they can sign up for service -- if their building meets select criteria: quote: Customers in six metro areas -- now marked by a green pin -- may be eligible to use Webpass if their building has at least 10 units, and is wired with Ethernet cabling. Copper Ethernet wiring can allow for blazing gigabit speeds, making them an affordable alternative for building owners to install vs. coaxial cable or even fiber. Google Fiber's future direction has been murky of late; the company eliminated its CEO and a number of employees last year as part of a rumored pivote toward wireless. Several reports suggested a number of Google executives had grown weary of the slow pace, high cost and relatively low adoption numbers of traditional fiber deployment, and had become enamoured by next-generation wireless broadband technologies like millimeter wave. tags: Fiber · business · alternatives · Google · Google Fiber · gigabit News Jump Forum Topic: Which Router Provides Consumers The Best Value?Comcast Gives Employees Time Off to Protest Trump Travel BanComcast Confirms It Will Charge Users a Fee to Watch TV on RokuTime Warner Cable Execs Gamed FCC Speed MeasurementsWall Street Thinks a Big Deal Involving Dish is LoomingThursday Morning Links Nielsen: T-Mobile Now Tops in Customer ServiceGoogle Fiber Sign Ups Begin in RaleighNew York Attorney General Sues Charter for Slow SpeedsForum Topic: Puma 6 Chipset Still Causing Modem Latency Issues----------------------this weeklast weekmost discussed Forums → Google Fiber Now Selling Gigabit Fixed Wireless Via Website view: topics flat nest  karpodiem Hail to The Victors Premium Member join:2008-05-20 Detroit, MI·RocketFiber ·Xfinity ·WOW Internet and.. 2 edits karpodiem Premium Member 2017-Feb-1 8:26 am LOL "Customers in six metro areas -- now marked by a green pin -- may be eligible to use Webpass if their building has at least 10 units, and is wired with Ethernet cabling." Show is over folks, time to go home. Google, the ADHD adolescent with the vast majority of PhD's in the software industry, couldn't figure out how to make a dollar on something tangible that exists outside of a datacenter. PS - Remember Loon? God I wish Steve Jobs was still alive. In the last remaining years of his life, he saw this coming, wanted to explore wifi mesh networks. Not saying he would have deployed FTTH, or that being an ISP is in Apple's wheelhouse, but there's one thing that drove everything he did with Apple - control. We are controlled by the ISPs, a captive audience. He would have found a way to break that control, with Apple's $250 billion in cash & marketable securities war chest. 2017-Feb-1 8:26 am: · hey mods · silbaco Premium Member join:2009-08-03 USA silbaco Premium Member 2017-Feb-1 11:41 am Re: LOL Webpass was always about delivering wireless service to MDU's or apartment building.

The division is Google Access if I recall but sounds like they'll continue branding Google Fiber for now with Webpass under it. Webpass only targets apt/condo buildups (MDUs) for now. Google also testing another flavor of fixed wireless in KC for homes and small biz. Maybe they'll market and brand as Google Access in the future - that is if they even stay in the ISP biz long term. 2017-Feb-1 9:42 am: · hey mods · openbox9 Premium Member join:2004-01-26 Springfield, VA openbox9 to somms Premium Member 2017-Feb-1 10:00 am to somms Why?

Must be buddies with Goodmans. Anyway, what Rick failed to mention is that the Raleigh area is one of the FCC test site locations for Google to test Fixed Wireless. Smith would know that if he bothered to do real research for their paywall tech site. Seeing as that Google has as application for a FCC license test, I'm almost sure they will use the existing Google Fiber and Hut infrastructure to run some Webpass like tests in this area. If you control the back end fiber and connection, you can get a good sense of how the actual wireless performs. I know the new Huts have wireless radios in addition to the OLT and routing/switching gear. The Thermobond engineers that were in my neighborhood when they set Fiber HUT RDU-127 told me these also have RF gear installed. They didn't give me specifics but they were nice. They built the Hut for Google and wired up the inside. Erik Garr is the head for GFBR in the Triangle. I'm going to see if I can get an interview with him for the fiber forums. Because streets in my neighborhood sit along the feeder path for RDU-127, Duke Energy has replaces almost every pole in the area with newer taller poles. I've also finally seen them running fiber for the trunk like to the hut. Soon I suspect they will start pulling the distribution fiber on the poles and conduit that was set in August. There is still major work needed in the Triangle though. The Chapel Hill site at the Library has not started at all. Same with a few other huts. So until they built all the Huts on the original fiber ring map, I'm always cautious as to what can change with a company like Google. 2017-Feb-1 10:57 am: · hey mods · Takuro join:2016-10-17 Chapel Hill, NC 1 edit Takuro to NetArchitect Member 2017-Feb-1 11:33 am to NetArchitect said by NetArchitect: There has been a definite pick-up in construction activity in Raleigh since they announced a freeze on expansion plans.I hope so. I live in an apartment complex where paper hangers were put on our door *a year ago* saying service was coming. They ran fiber to each building, but the project had ground to a halt within a couple months. More recently, every now and then, I see a small unmarked trailer pulled up on the side of the road with one of the access panels pulled open to the fiber they ran last year. It's still dark though... EDIT: Alright, so apparently if I enter my address on their availability checker site, I can now order it.

And the trunk ring that feeds Carrboro from Pinney Woodpark in SW Durham has not been finished yet as far as I can tell. I live near NC54 in Durham and drive to Campus along the part for that route. They have been working on it almost daily. They could always use some temp line I guess because the Hut is ready. Go ahead and connect the drop to residences and such.

They still appear committed to deploying FTTH in the markets that have been started with FTTH. Future markets likely to be mostly fixed wireless, unless markets build their own fiber framework that Google can use (like Huntsville model). Google has a good reason to stay in the ISP biz given ISP behavior impacts their core biz. But if they can't balance the uptake rate with cost to deploy, they could sell off. Google Fiber is a solid service that is well engineered, especially the Gigabit connection. Few Gigabit ISPs can sustain near Gbit up/down speeds at long distances thanks to a longhaul network that is dedicated to Google Fiber service, not shared with other Google services. 2017-Feb-1 9:51 am: · hey mods · michieru Premium Member join:2009-07-25 Miami, FL·Xfinity michieru Premium Member 2017-Feb-1 9:43 am A solid plan Wireless makes more sense as 5G approaches with actual tests showing speeds up to 12Gbps.

Stumbled LinkedIn Vine Reddit Delicious Newstrust Tell my politician Technocrati Short URL| Email Article| Comment| Contact| Print|     A   A    Google co-founder Sergey Brin told thousand of company employees he was "outraged" over President Donald Trump's executive order on immigration, revealing rising tension between the technology industry and new administration. Google employees in multiple cities across the U.S. and beyond held rallies Monday against Trump's executive order banning refugees and immigrants from seven countries from entering the United States Monday afternoon. "So many people were obviously outraged by this order, as am I myself, being an immigrant and a refugee," Brin told the crowd at a rally on Google's campus in Mountain View, Calif. that included employees directly affected by the order as well as Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Brin's family came to the US as refugees from the Soviet Union when he was a child, at the height of the Cold War, Business Insider reported. "I'm glad to see the energy here today and around the world to know that people are fighting for what's right out there," Brin continued. "I think it's important to not frame this debate as being 'liberal' versus 'Republican' and so forth," Brin told the crowd. "It's a debate about fundamental values, about thoughtful policymaking and many of the other things that I think are — apparently not universally adored — but I think the vast majority of our country and of our legislators and so forth support." The protests came after executives from multiple technology companies had spoken out against the executive order this past weekend. Google also responded by offering matching grands of up to $2 million for donations raised by its employees for the American Civil Liberties Union and other civil and refugee rights organizations. One of the speakers, Iranian-born product manager Soufi Esmaelizadeh, retold how she was temporarily stuck in limbo this past week after traveling to Zurich for work reasons, only to find her phone buzzing with messages about the order as soon as her plane touched ground. "I just thought this couldn't be true," she said. Esmaelizadeh contacted the Google legal team to figure out whether she could return to the United States, and was initially advised against it. Only after a judge had struck down the order, she was told to board a plane immediately, and made it back safely Sunday. "This executive order is racist, unconstitutional and needs to be revoked," Esmaelizadeh said to loud cheers of the crowd.   So proud that I work for @Google right now. Fight the Muslim Ban. #googlersunite pic.twitter.com/U9uQ69FZV1 — Rachel Been (@rachelbeen) January 30, 2017 Another speaker, a U.S. citizen or Iranian descent identified only by her first name, told the crowd in an emotional testimony that she met her husband during a trip to Iran two years ago. The two continued a long-distance relationship, and went through the legal process to have him join her in the U.S. this spring. "We were planning to get married this March," she said. Her husband had already been approved for a visum, which was cancelled indefinitely after Trump's executive order was instituted last Friday. Google CEO Sundar Pichai told the crowd that it had been difficult for the company to figure out how to respond to the order and deal with cases like this one, but that he felt encouraged by Googlers standing up and taking part in protests. "Every step, I felt the support of 65,000 people behind me," he said. "There are some values that you should never be compromising on," he continued, imploring Googlers to continue to speak out. "We need to stand together," he said. "The fight will continue." Several people at Google had raised concerns about the company's response to Trump's policy at a company-wide meeting on Thursday, a day before the order was signed, according to people familiar with the matter. At the time, some employees underestimated the severity of the order, thinking it would only impact new visa applications, one of these people said. The disruption comes at a delicate time for Google. The company, which had close ties to the Obama Administration, is determining its broader policy approach to Trump on a myriad of issues, including net neutrality, taxes and competition law.

Google Appears to Think the UK's Health Service Is a Botnet Or at least something weird is going on, since NHS network users are being forced to verify they're human before using Google. Everyone makes mistakes, but Google's latest gaffe is something to behold. Google search users trying to connect from a UK National Health Service network are being limited from visiting the site, because the internet giant has seemingly interpreted the NHS' huge influx of traffic as malicious. "Google is intermittently blocking access due to the amount of traffic from NHS Trusts Nationally (This is not being blocked by the IT Department). This is causing Google to think it is suffering from a cyber-attack," an email from an NHS Trust, an organization that oversees a hospital or specific area, seen by The Register reads. A spokesman from NHS Digital, part of the UK Department of Health, told Motherboard in an email, "We are aware of the current issue concerning NHS IP addresses which occasionally results in users being directed to a simple verification form when accessing Google. This would appear to be due to the high number of people using our systems and trying to access Google at peak times. We are currently in discussion with Google as to how we can help them to resolve the issue." According to the email, users may be presented with a CAPTCHA when visiting Google.com. Visitors can obviously try to solve the CAPTCHA, but the NHS Trust's IT department has another, much more controversial suggestion too. "We are advising staff to use an alternative search engine i.e. Bing to bypass this problem," the email continues. Although this mishap does not appear to be the NHS's fault, the organization has something of a bumpy history with cybersecurity. Motherboard found that NHS hospitals are running thousands of computers on unsupported versions of Windows XP. In an email, Google disputed The Register's characterization that the activity was a "block." In an email to Motherboard, Google said it was satisfied its systems were working correctly in this case, as the company can handle huge volumes of queries from a single network. The cause might be from services automatically making requests to Google or a piece of malware on an NHS machine trying to reach the site. "There are many reasons why users might see a CAPTCHA window when they do a Google search. Our systems are simply checking that searches are being carried out by humans and not by robots in order to keep web users safe. Once a user has filled out the CAPTCHA, they can continue to use Google as normal," a Google spokesperson wrote in an email to Motherboard. This article has been updated to include a response from Google.

Just like Apple opened the app market to allow developers to write their own apps back in 2008, this revolution has now begun for AI and bots. In 2016, tech companies finally released platforms that allow third parties to start building and deploying solutions for the technology. From Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Google and even enterprise tools such as Slack, the SDKs and tools have been rolled out. Today, developers don’t need their own platform to create an Alexa skill – it is made available to them by Amazon. Each of these vendors is now looking to create an economy to proliferate their tools and maximise value for their users, giving power to the masses. >See also: Besting the bad bots: how advanced persistent bots are attacking sites, and what to do about them Just as we have seen major change to the mobile sandboxes in the last ten years as products roll out, the rules of engagement will change so what is to come is a combination of what is possible and what is allowed. Based on the promise of making our lives easier, bots will impact our lives more than ever in 2017. Here are five ways they will make a difference. 1. In the workplace: from meeting scheduling to resolving IT issues Bots will reshape the way that work environments operate and streamline traditionally administrative tasks, from simple meeting scheduling to more complicated tasks, such as IT support. For example, companies that use shared messaging systems can now add an intelligent agent bot to their system that has access to their calendars. If a meeting needs to be scheduled, the bot will then check people’s calendars and take care of all the scheduling. Chatbots will also enhance the effectiveness of IT departments. Instead of tickets being logged and IT consultants having to keep track of them, bots can access typically available enterprise datasets very quickly and message the correct point of contact to resolve an issue within seconds of an incident taking place or a customer reporting a system issue on social media. For example, if a company’s website is down and somebody reports it on Facebook messenger, a chatbot will be able to pick up the query and check it against historical data, such as network and server availability. It will then be able to direct a documented analysis to the company’s operations personnel, helping to resolve the issue far quicker. Not only will this increase the speed at which issues can be dealt with, the chatbot will also provide a documented response should anyone need to access it. Furthermore, analysts can initiate automated responses or actions, meaning that IT teams can in future focus on core tasks. 2. When shopping for goods: loyalty and customer service The days of automated voice response customer service hotlines are hopefully soon coming to an end thanks to bots. Rather than making a customer dial a number, hold the line and respond their way through a confusing number of options via voice command, bots can be implemented across a range of messaging platforms from social media to onscreen webchats, enabling the consumer to communicate with a company comfortably in the environment of his choice. This offers brands unique opportunities to create a more personal and meaningful relationship with customers. Based on tailored conversations between the brand and their customer, bots can communicate with customers, generate interest and awareness in products and services, and help customers complete purchases, for example by suggesting payment and delivery options. By analysing past customer behaviour and building a detailed consumer profile, the bot will then also be able to activate the most suitable loyalty programme for the customer, thereby deepening the mutual relationship. In addition to the valuable opportunity that chatbots will provide brands in creating more personalised engagements with customers, they will also drive down the cost of customer servicing, meaning a better, quicker service can be provided to more customers. 3. At home: playing music, ordering food In recent months, some of the big tech giants have released AI-enabled devices for the home such as home speakers that respond to voice commands. Whilst these are marketed as fully functional artificial intelligence for the home, they operate on basic bot principles based on voice rather than textual commands. Voice command will make these devices particularly popular, meaning that the user can multitask hands-free. For example, the user can ask the bot to play a particular song when cooking without having to wipe their hands and complete this action manually. For those who don’t want to cook, skills that connect the device to other businesses enable the user to order food for home delivery simply by talking and without ever having to look up a menu or pull out a payment card. As more skills and functions are made available by the manufacturers, these home assistants will become more widely adopted, creating the fully functional personal home assistant of the future. 4. When making decisions and lifestyle choices Given that bots will soon be supporting us more prominently on numerous devices and platforms such as mobile phones, when shopping online and as home assistants, we will rely on them more to provide us with information that they deem relevant. However, just as our choice of newspaper or car can affect the way we process information and experience the road, the built-in capabilities and resources of bots will affect the decisions and choices we make in life. >See also: Why machine learning will impact, but not take, your job For example, if a user asks a chatbot built into an online shopping tool to suggest black wool scarves, the chatbot will show scarves that are pure wool and those that are made up of a wool mix. If the user does not specify their query, they might end up ordering a mixed material scarf that they didn’t really want. Experience will therefore show how the reliance on robots will affect our ability to obtain the products and services we really want. Sponsored bot skills could also become a possibility in future, meaning that if a user does not have time to search for the best holiday deal themselves, they will opt for whatever the bot suggests. 5. Moving away from screens Desktop computer usage has steadily decreased over the last few years, giving rise to increased mobile usage, and whereas a user was happy to bank online via the bank’s website, they are now increasingly banking via mobile app. With the introduction of voice-enabled devices, screens will no longer dominate the future of interactions. Voice-enabled devices will shape a transition away from traditional screen-based interactions and open up new ways of completing everyday tasks, sourcing entertainment and making choices that impact our daily lives.   JP Lucchetti, consultancy director, Mubaloo Related Topics artificial intelligence bot chatbot machine learning Comments (0) Leave a Reply Cancel replyLogin to comment Prev Next Read More Latest Popular Staying ahead of the digital wave Predictive analytics: good governance holds key to accurate forecasting Businesses are at a database crossroads Groundhog Day: what can IT professionals learn?

The first is the organic listing of websites that you will find displayed vertically. These rankings are decided by Google's unique algorithms. The second is a paid listing, which shows as a sponsored result. There is a green square box beside the advertisement of such websites that display the word "Ad". This is Pay Per Click or PPC, wherein the advertising website agrees to pay Google for each click and visit to the web page. Google is the most popular PPC engine, but there are Pay Per Click models of other search engines such as Yahoo and Bing as well. Biphoo Marketing Solution is the Leading PPC Advertiser Company, Here find What are the main advantages of PPC management services? The main reason why advertisers decide to go for ppc advertising is to receive immediate web traffic. SEO or search engine is time consuming. It can take months to attain high search engine ranks. Most businesses cannot afford to wait for months. Plus, the ranks may drop as well if the search engine changes its algorithm. With PPC, there are no such issues. You just set up the campaign, run the ads, and your website will be displayed. Everything can be done in minutes. The results are guaranteed. PPC can be very effective if done well by a service such as Biphoo marketing solution. But there are several challenges. For instance, since the business is spending money to receive traffic, it can leak a lot of funds if the campaign is not closely monitored. Every good service like Biphoo marketing solution should intervene at the right time and make the correct changes to keep the campaign in track. There is a lot to do. For instance, the campaign should include the correct keywords, and should have good ad. Copy with the keyword in them to make sure that the Click Through Rate (CTR) is high. The bid value for each keyword should be so managed to ensure that the advertisement is high enough to make sure that it is visible. However, a balance is often needed here. If you are spending too much and high an extremely high CTR, and if the landing page is not converting, then you will end up spending a lot of money, without getting the desired results – revenues from sales or leads by form fill-outs. The PPC management services of Biphoo marketing solution thus includes working on the landing pages as well to make sure that visitors in the page take the required call-to-action. This is the only way to make sure that the ROI is high. Once the landing page conversion rate is high, you can go ahead and spend more on each keyword. Your website will be ranked higher than the competition. It will receive more traffic, and increased number of leads or sales. Biphoo marketing solution also researches "negative keywords" regularly to make sure that the advertisements are firing for the right terms. This is the only way to ensure that the PPC advertising service are effective.

SUBSCRIBE Edmonia Lewis Google doodle honors 19th century artist behind “The Death of Cleopatra” sculpture Google recognizes Lewis as the first female of African-American and Native American descent to become a world-renowned sculptor. Amy Gesenhues on February 1, 2017 at 8:15 am More As we kick off Black History Month, Google is continuing to spotlight Americans who have pushed boundaries, with today’s doodle celebrating American sculptor Edmonia Lewis. Born in New York in 1844, Google recognizes Lewis as the first US female of African-American and Native American descent to become a world-renowned sculptor. The doodle depicts Lewis with one of her most famous works, “The Death of Cleopatra,” which is kept at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, DC. Google says the vibrant colors of the Google letters within the doodle pay tribute to Lewis’ Native American heritage. From the Google Doodle Blog: At age 15, Lewis enrolled in Oberlin College, which is where she became passionate about art. Unfortunately however, her time at Oberlin was fraught with discrimination by many of her peers and the surrounding community. It was due to this that she was prevented from enrolling in her final term, and therefore was unable to receive her degree. Fortunately, Lewis was able to find an apprenticeship position under Edward Brackett and eventually had a solo exhibition of her work in 1864. She later moved to Rome, where she surrounded herself with other ex-pat artists and built her own studio. “Lewis’s legacy continues to thrive through her art and the path she helped forge for women and artists of color. Today, we celebrate her and what she stands for — self-expression through art, even in the face of adversary,” writes Google on its Doodle blog. Designed by Sophie Diao, the doodle leads to a search for “Edmonia Lewis” and includes a sharing icon to post the doodle on social pages or send via email. This is the second doodle in less than a week to celebrate a woman of African-American and Native American descent who rose above the odds. While Bessie Coleman was a first-class aviator and Lewis an artist, both chose to leave the US early in their careers in order to create the life they wanted.

That’s where Hexlock comes in. Read More , but it was always a chore to draw a pattern or type a passcode every single time you opened an app (which was probably dozens of times a day). Thanks to fingerprint scanners, there’s no excuse for skipping on added security. Launch an app, rest your finger on the sensor, and in a split-second, it’s unlocked (even if it might not be the most secure method Why Passphrases Are Still Better than Passwords & Fingerprints Why Passphrases Are Still Better than Passwords & Fingerprints Remember when passwords didn't have to be complicated?

The apps listed here use Android Marshmallow’s default fingerprint API, so you don’t need to worry about security. You’re not providing your fingerprint to the app you use.

App Lock Chalk this one up to the obvious category. Now that you’re used to unlocking your phone with your fingerprint, the next step is to secure your apps. No matter if it’s a messaging app or payment app, an extra layer of security goes a long way. App Lock by Keep Safe makes this really easy. When you launch the app, toggle the fingerprint option from the bottom, and as a fallback, select a pattern or a passcode. You’ll need to enable usage access for the app to work. Once you’re in, enable App Lock for the apps you want. Next time you open the app, you’ll be met with a lock screen. Simply put your finger on the sensor (the one you’ve already scanned and enabled to unlock your device). It will be recognized and you’ll be in. Download — App Lock (Free) 2.

DuckDuckGo's ambitious plans to be more than a search engine Founder Gabriel Weinberg says DuckDuckGo could build more services than just a search engine By Matt Burgess 1 day ago By Matt Burgess Wednesday 1 February 2017 DuckDuckGo doesn't collect any user information or create databases of customers iStock / sorbetto When Gabriel Weinberg became sick of Google search results and being tracked everywhere he went online, he took action. The developer created add-ons to limit his personal information being collected, and this small list evolved into the increasingly popular anonymous search engine DuckDuckGo. DuckDuckGo: what is it and how does it work? DuckDuckGo: what is it and how does it work? DuckDuckGo 1 day ago ADVERTISEMENT Almost seven years after founding the company, DuckDuckGo has become a staple search engine for the privacy-conscious. In January, Weinberg and his now 35-person strong team, announced DuckDuckGo had provided answers to more than ten billion search queries. These numbers are nowhere near those celebrated by Google, Bing, or Yahoo; Google alone has 3.5 billion searches a day, but the 38-year-old has ambitions to grow beyond search. "We've had a very narrow focus for the life of the company because it has been hard to get the product to where it needs to be," Weinberg told WIRED. "We're thinking of what else we can do to expand the proposition and give people more of a holistic privacy solution. We haven't made any total move but it's where we're heading; we're thinking more generally how can we do more to protect your privacy when you're browsing around the web." READ NEXT DuckDuckGo: what is it and how does it work? DuckDuckGo: what is it and how does it work? By Matt Burgess DuckDuckGo was founded by internet entrepreneur Gabriel Weinberg in 2008 as a privacy-focussed alternative to Google DuckDuckGo Weinberg didn't elaborate on any specific products or services, but said it "probably won't" be email. The development may, instead, be closer to a web browsing experience. "Like when you click off the search engine and you're taken to somewhere else on the web," he explained. "If we can make that experience more private for you, that's what we're thinking of". What is the IP Act and how will it affect you? What is the IP Act and how will it affect you? Surveillance 10 Jan 2016 The rise of DuckDuck go has been slow, or "steady", as Weinberg describes it. He admits one of the dominant challenges for the firm is marketing itself in a populist way. In 2011, Weinberg purchased a billboard for $7,000 (£5,600) pointing out the company, unlike Google, does not track those who use its search functions. ADVERTISEMENT Despite difficulties in getting the firm widely known, DuckDuckGo has seen a number of mainstream successes: Apple included it as a default search option with iOS 8 in Safari in September 2014, Mozilla followed suit, including DuckDuckGo in Firefox in November of the same year. It also exists on Tor. For now, Weinberg says development will continue on the core search features of DuckDuckGo. Like Google, the service tries to provide instant answers to your questions. If you're looking for a local cinema the firms will try to show the number and opening times; if you're searching for who was the UK prime minister in 1973 they will try to tell you. ADVERTISEMENT "When you're looking for more things like breaking news or a phone number for a restaurant, especially internationally, we're making that experience better for users," he continued. The entrepreneur expects the popularity of anonymous search to continue to grow and says he is worried about online surveillance laws around the world, including the UK's Investigatory Powers Act. Unsurprisingly, for the creator of a privacy-enhancing website, he says laws around the world are "unsettling". "For the majority of people, I think they're just looking for simple ways to be tracked less online".

He is currently General Partner of Crazy Peak LLC, an early technology business investment and advisory firm, and holds a degree in Computer Science from Harvard. “I couldn’t be more excited about joining FINCAD’s board,” he commented. “Buy-side firms need more sophisticated tools for pre-trade decision making and post-trade risk management. FINCAD has been meeting that need since 1990 with truly innovative solutions, and I look forward to helping guide the direction of FINCAD’s technology and growth.” Philip spent the first half of his career as an entrepreneur CEO, founding and running three start-up firms. He went on to Bloomberg, where he built the Foreign Exchange trading business. At Google, Philip oversaw Google Finance and managed a portion of the Google Local Search offering. In 2011, he joined Thomson Reuters, where he successfully turned around their flagship financial desktop, Eikon, and then went on to unite a fragmented software development and operations effort.

It happens, regularly. You may not know why exactly. It looks like an algorithm may have done it — and now you need to reach a human being at the company to get back on. NPR has interviewed more than two dozen users in that situation — all people who rely on Facebook to do their work, make their living. Their stories, which we'll share in a separate article, made us wonder: If you needed to reach Facebook, what would you do? Many people would go online and search for "Facebook customer service." We tried that, and got this number: 844-735-4595. It was prominently displayed as the top search result on Google. Google even made it a "featured snippet" — that is, a result highlighted in a box at the top, enhanced to draw user attention and lend credibility. Please do not call it. You will get someone real — just not from Facebook. The first time NPR called, someone picked up and then put the phone down — maybe on a table. You could hear mumbling in the room. It felt suspicious. So NPR gave the number to Pindrop, a company that specializes in phone fraud. A Pindrop researcher, who has to remain anonymous for his work, called up and recorded as he pretended to be a Facebook user in distress. A call center operator named "Steven" — who, according to Pindrop analysis, is based in India — says: "Thanks for calling Facebook." He is pretending to be a Facebook employee. The Pindrop researcher plays along and explains he is locked out of his Facebook account. He needs help getting reactivated. "Steven" gives him very unusual advice: Go to a Wal-Mart or a Target. "Just walk up over there and tell them to provide you an iTunes card. OK? And on the backside of that iTunes card there would be a 16-digit security code." Maybe you see where this is going. Steven continues: "You need to call us back on this same number and provide me that 16-digit security code so that I can activate that access and we'll be giving you the password for your new — for your old account." This is a scam. The top Google search result for "Facebook customer service" led to a person asking for codes on iTunes gift cards. This is a well-known method of stealing from innocent people online. (Both Apple and the Federal Trade Commission have issued alerts about it.) That toll-free "Facebook" line was not just on Google. That number and others have been circulating on Facebook itself, on pages where users are asking for help, for at least a year. In one instance, a user asked whether the number was valid and a member of the company's Help Team responded: "There isn't a number to contact Facebook. ... It sounds like the email or notification you saw is likely a scam." It's unclear whether the Help Team member reported it to her superiors to investigate. "Wow. Wow. Wow. That's crazy," says Marty Weintraub, founder of Aimclear Marketing. He wrote a leading industry book on Facebook advertising, long before the rest of the world realized the company would dominate the Internet economy. "This is an astonishing result." He also wrote a book on how to manipulate search results, to get your brand or product up on top. He knows that companies monitor their search results, to see what their customers want, and that criminals and competitors try to exploit powerful brands. These are standard practices. What Weintraub finds astonishing is that a term as basic as "Facebook customer service" slipped through the cracks. "It's not like somebody's searching for 'Hey, what color are Mark Zuckerberg's socks?' It's not like it's something that's off the beaten path," Weintraub says. "So one would think that a company as large as Facebook would be monitoring [the] search engine results page for a major query surrounding their services." According to Google data, "Facebook customer service" gets searched, on average, about 27,000 times a month in the U.S. Weintraub says that is sizable, that Facebook should have known about it "almost the first minute" it came up, and that the company should have guarded its users. "I'd be so scared," he says. "These are people who are looking for help with the product and they're getting scammed. OMG." NPR informed Facebook and Google about the scam line. Facebook said that it has been investigating the group associated with this toll-free number for some time; that this group is targeting many platforms; and that it's up to Google to explain why it displays certain search results. A Google spokesperson said in a statement that the company has taken steps to remove the fraudulent number. Neither company explained how the prominent search result went unnoticed. And to be clear, Facebook does not have a phone number for regular users to call. It does have an online help center, located here. (Facebook pays NPR and other leading news organizations to produce live video streams.) NPR's Aarti Shahani has started a page on Facebook for people to share concerns about the platform.

Thanks to the brightest minds in Silicon Valley, however, they're rapidly becoming science fact. Google is nearing the final stages of testing for its autonomous car programme, Tesla drivers can enjoy an 'Autopilot' feature for hassle-free motorway driving, and Pittsburgh residents can hail an Uber that drives itself. But how do driverless cars work? Are they safe? When can we expect to try one out for ourselves? We answer all these questions, and more, below. Latest news 01/02/2017: A deal with automaker Mercedes-Benz will see its range of vehicles join Uber's ever-expanding fleet of self-driving cars. The partnership will see Germany's Daimler join forces with the popular ride-hailing service to introduce and operate its own self-driving cars on Uber's network. "Auto manufacturers like Daimler are crucial to our strategy because Uber has no experience making cars," said Uber chief executive Travis Kalanick. "This became very clear to me after I visited an auto manufacturing plant and saw how much effort goes into designing, testing and building cars." "That's why instead of building them ourselves, we want to partner with the best auto manufacturers in the world," he added. "We can combine Uber's global ridesharing network with the world-class vehicles of companies like Daimler, so that Uber riders can have a great experience getting around their cities." Uber has so far declined to offer the financial details of the new deal, however Daimler represents the first company to take advantage of Uber's new policy allowing third-party manufacturers to add their own self-driving cars. As a result of a $300 million deal with automaker Volvo, vehicles have already been piloted in Pennsylvania and Arizona using self-driving kits developed by Uber. However unlike previous deals, Uber will not own or manage the new fleet of Mercedes-Benz vehicles, or be responsible for the research and development of the AI led software. Instead, Uber has simply added the Daimler manufactured cars to its self-driving vehicle range. 20/01/2017: Tesla semi-autonomous cars won't be recalled in US Tesla semiautonomous cars won't be recalled in the US, despite the technology inside one of its cars resulting in the death of a customer. Joshua Brown was killed when the Tesla he was driving collided with a lorry in May 2016. However, Tesla had claimed this wasn't because of its Autopilot technology failing, but rather user error, because although the autonomous system can be used as an assistance to the driver, drivers should never take their hands off the wheel. The US National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which conducted an investigation into the crash, said data from the car's onboard tracking system revealed Brown had not made any attempt to brake, steer or do anything else to avoid the collision. He would have seen he was going to hit the lorry for seven seconds, which was enough for him to take action and override the Autopilot system, but he decided not to. "These systems require continual and full attention of the driver," Bryan Thomas from the NHSTA said. "It's not enough to put [information] in the owner's manual and hope drivers are going to read that. "Manufacturers must anticipate how drivers would use the functionality, and that some don't read the manual." The NHTSA said it would not take any action against Tesla, and found no faults with the vehicle, but would be monitoring the situation carefully to ensure it does not pose a risk to drivers. 04/01/2017: Oxford driverless car firm releases camera mapping Oxford self-driving car company Oxbotica has announced that the localisation and mapping software used in its prototype vehicles is now ready for general release. Comprising one part of the company's Selenium OS for autonomous cars, the firm has used its Dub4 software tool in the GATEway pods operating in Greenwich and in the company's own prototype vehicles, which were demonstrated in Milton Keynes last year. Oxbotica is competing in the same space as Google and Uber, but what sets it apart from other projects is that rather than the expensive laser and GPS systems seen in other cars, Oxbotica's mapping system can rely purely on vehicle-mounted cameras. "The software uses a single stereo camera mounted onto the car to determine its precise position and orientation in the world," the company explained in a statement. "With this localisation information, the software is then able to create and navigate using vision-based maps in highly unstructured environments without any reliance on GPS or expensive laser-based techniques." By negating the need for costly LIDAR systems, Dub4 has the potential to make self-driving technology much cheaper to produce, while Oxbotica claims it doesn't require specialised equipment to run; it can be installed and operated on off-the-shelf commodity PC hardware. "We're excited to be working on deployment of our class-leading Dub4 software solution, as part of our mission to achieve Level 4 autonomy by 2020," said Oxbotica CEO Graeme Smith. "What we've done with Dub4 has never been done before and it represents a seismic shift for the self-driving vehicle industry, enabling a move away from GPS and 3D laser-based approaches. We're paving the way for more affordable and accurate solutions in the industry." How do self-driving cars work? Self-driving cars use a battery of sensors to detect their surroundings, including radar, lasers and camera arrays. The vehicle's onboard computer then uses specialised software to react to this input in real-time, adjusting the car's steering and acceleration to suit the situation. While some vehicles, such as the Google prototypes which have popularised the idea, are totally autonomous, other cars only automate certain aspects of driving. Tesla's Autopilot feature, for example, features adaptive cruise control, which maintains a safe speed and distance from other vehicles when driving on the motorway. It also features basic automated steering to ensure you don't accidentally drift into the wrong lane, and although it can perform basic steering maneuvers automatically, it is not intended to replace a human driver altogether. Are self-driving cars safe? There is still much debate over whether or not fully autonomous cars should be made widely available. Some say that their safety record is impeccable, while others argue that automobiles are simply too dangerous to be operated by an algorithm. This debate has been reignited by a number of high-profile Tesla crashes, one of which has been blamed on an Autopilot malfunction. The incidents have raised questions over whether or not self-driving technology is ready for implementation. On the other hand, Google has emphasised how safe its fleet of self-driving cars are. As part of the testing programme for its autonomous vehicles, the company has posted regular safety logs detailing any crashes the vehicles are involved in, with the vast majority being caused by human drivers in other cars. Experts remain divided, however, and if self-driving cars are ever likely to be widely commercially available, they will doubtless be heavily regulated, monitored and tested. When will self-driving cars hit the road? In many cases, they already have. Some high-end luxury vehicles already feature 'assisted driving' elements that are close to fully autonomous driving, with Tesla being the obvious example. Elsewhere, testing of various driverless car projects is underway in the US, with California, Texas, Seattle and more all hosting autonomous vehicle test runs. The UK government has also given the green light for similar trials in Britain, so UK commuters may soon be sharing the roads with autonomous shuttles. As for when driverless cars will become commercially available, however, that is yet to be seen. As the technology is young and comparatively untested, it is likely that substantial tests will have to be conducted in partnership with government and regulatory bodies before the vehicles are available for public purchase. There is also a question as to whether or not the average driver will be able to purchase one at all. Even if fully autonomous cars are allowed to be sold, the price of each vehicle is likely to be prohibitively expensive due to the large amount of sophisticated technology that goes into them. As such, it's likely to be at least a few years before autonomous cars are approved for general road use, and most likely another few years after that before they become a commonplace sight. Are driverless cars legal? As no fully autonomous cars have yet made it to the mass-production phase, no legislation currently exists to govern their public use. However, transport authorities both in the UK and in the US are currently in the process of drawing up new laws or amending old ones to account for driverless vehicles. In the UK, for example, companies need no permits or authorisation to test autonomous vehicles on public roads. "Real-world testing of automated technologies is possible in the UK today," the government's Pathway to Driverless Cars report reads, "providing a test driver is present and takes responsibility for the safe operation of the vehicle; and that the vehicle can be used compatibly with road traffic law." The UK also plans to amend the Highway Code to allow vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems to change lanes on the motorway and be parked via remote control. Changes to car insurance would extend it to cover product liabilities for automated vehicles. Insurers would pay out to victims, then reclaim the money from the manufacturers. The US has also granted testing permits for driverless cars in four states, as well as publishing a 15-point safety checklist for manufacturers of autonomous vehicles in order to better regulate the emerging industry. Published by the National Highway Transportation Safety Agency, the Federal Automated Vehicles Policy also marks the agency's move to the SAE scale, which measures a vehicle's level of autonomy. The scale runs from zero, where the driver has total control of the vehicles, all the way to five - a totally autonomous car requiring no human input. Vehicles that measure two or three on the SAE scale - such as the Tesla and other semi-autonomous vehicles - are already road-legal both here and in the US, as the human driver is considered to be in control for the majority of the time. While many countries have committed to fostering a supportive environment for the development of autonomous cars, concrete legislation governing their use is still likely to be some years away, as the technology itself has not yet been fully finished. Who manufactures self-driving cars? The most well-known companies exploring self-driving cars are Google and Tesla, but there are very few companies connected to the automotive industry that aren't exploring the technology. Ride-hailing company Uber, for example, is currently testing its own fleet of autonomous taxis in Pittsburgh. Apple has also long been rumoured to be exploring the self-driving car field in some form, and has been linked to multiple different auto manufacturers, including McLaren. In addition to tech companies, however, regular car makers are also getting in on the act. Audi, Ford, BWM, Honda, Daimler, Volvo and more have all been dabbling in some form of autonomous driving project. Luxury passenger vehicles have also been experimenting with using the tech in industrial vehicles such as heavy goods lorries.

The iPhone generates almost two-thirds of Apple’s wealth. The latter task was easily accomplished yesterday, as this was the first quarter in which new model iPhone revenue was booked. Apple said it had sold 78.3 million iPhones, an “all time record an increase of 5 per cent over last year. Customer demand was even higher than our reported results, as iPhone unit sell-through was up 8 per cent,” said CFO Luca Maestri. Apple put the prices up, so it got more revenue, recording a higher ASP (average selling price) But the iPhone rarely sets out with anything other than a loud bang. Rather like Jorgen Klopp’s Liverpool, it’s too early to tell if the team is exhausted: in Apple terms, it’s still September and the players are gegenpress-ing with the enthusiasm of spring lambs. We’ll have a better how appealing the iPhone 7 really is at the end of April, and whether "iPhone fatigue" is really a chronic condition. So Apple talked up other parts of its business. It’s interesting for what this excluded – the Watch, the car (driving nowhere), AI and VR, and what it included. So it was unusual to hear such an emphasis on enterprise partnerships, with namechecks for Cisco, SAP, and IBM. That rarely gets a mention, and even more rarely from the CEO himself. It’s a sign of both Google’s encroachment into the dull but lucrative enterprise IT business, and a reminder that Apple’s business isn’t so reliant on the fickle consumer fads as you might think. Look at our stable recurring income, said Apple, and marvel! China crisis China is a historical sore point, with analysts persistently demanding that Apple produce more competitively priced models for the world’s biggest market. Apple has consistently argued against this, saying as that more Chinese got richer, the more iPhones it would sell, and without sacrificing its margins. The calls from investors are more anxious this year, given the unstoppable growth of budget Android and the ever-improving quality of home-grown phone brands. And it isn’t just about the sticker price. Rivals offer stronger sales incentives through their much more extensive sales channels, and pack the phones with Chinese services and social networks. (The latter isn’t a challenge unique to Apple: Google isn’t really in China at all). If you see an Apple Store in China, it’s probably fake. Here’s one I snapped in Shenzhen. There are plenty more in the mall: In all emerging markets, Apple is fighting an overvalued dollar – meaning prices are “20 per cent, 30 per cent, 40 per cent” higher than they were, says Apple. But analysts didn’t see much cause for cheer. Mainland China, claimed Luca Maestri, matched previous revenue, and iPads on the mainland saw double digit growth. But this a glass half full argument. China revenue actually fell 12 per cent, and it was the only reason to see a decline. Lots of lovely lolly in the bank Apple wouldn’t give any hints about its much rumoured video strategy at its quarterly conference call yesterday. With 150 million active subscribers, Apple already has a formidable base in which to fling original content: the formula that worked wonders for Netflix and set the trend for “cord cutting”. With a mind-boggling $246.1bn in cash plus marketable securities, the perennial question is how Apple will invest it. The most widely tipped is muscling into content. Recently big telcomms companies and media giants have been mating, to take on Internet pure plays like Google and Netflix. Apple already makes a huge amount from slinging content already: it logged $7.2bn in the Christmas quarter from apps, music and taking a cut of payment transactions. The app store was $3bn of that. CEO Tim Cook described Apple’s content business as a “toe in the water” (he used the phrase twice) but wouldn’t give anything away, other than stating that cord-cutting was a trend that was hear to stay. Apple has plenty of reasons for staying out of content, however: it isn’t an area where it’s technology or design or brand bring any particular benefits. Keen movie buffs may disagree, but few movie studios ever built up a recognisable brand, with the fan thinking “There’s a new movie from Paramount – I must see it.” Figures were more elusive for Apple Pay, but it’s early days, operating in 13 markets. The Apple Watch was rapidly passed over (“best quarter ever… we couldn’t make enough”) – Cook was far keener to talk about the HomeKit ecosystem of Siri-controlled doors, windows, heating and alarm systems. Tim Cook said it would have sold more Macs, but was supply constrained on the Pro through the quarter and are only just now getting the parts they need to fulfil demand. Cook had some detailed observations on its litigation against Qualcomm: “They were insisting on charging royalties for technologies that they had nothing to do with. And so we were in a situation where the more we innovated with unique features like Touch ID or advanced displays or cameras, just to name a few, the more money Qualcomm would collect for no reason and the more expensive it would be therefore for us to innovate,” he said. So the grumbles are likely to continue. Wearables, the mythical Car, AR all look like experiments. Only hits satisfy the market. ® Tips and corrections 13 Comments More from The Register Apple Watch exec Bob Mansfield 'gets into secret Apple car' Here in iCar, iCan only receive, iCan listen to you... 42 Comments Apple kills activation lock check, possible dirty stolen device hack Video Hardware hack steals serial numbers from legitimate users 8 Comments Apple, Amazon smash audiobook cabal after European pressure EU antitrust bod nods in approval as another market opens up 6 Comments Apple's Airpod wireless earbuds finally go on sale after six-week delay In limited quantities, some time next week.

 The NHS says Google mistook its 1.2 million employees for a huge cyberattack and blocked it Rob Price, Business Insider UK Feb. 1, 2017, 7:31 AM 2,955 facebook linkedin twitter email print It's not a cyberattack — it's just a lot of doctors.Christopher Furlong/Getty Images The NHS' 1.2 million employees provide some of the best healthcare on Earth — but dealing with that many people can throw up some tricky technical challenges. In an email obtained by the The Register on Wednesday, the NHS (National Health Service) alleges that the search giant has mistaken the NHS' network for a cyber attack — and is "intermittently" restricting the million-plus NHS employees' access to the search engine. The NHS confirmed to Business Insider that it is having technical issues — but Google says that its systems are working normally. In the email, the NHS IT department reportedly wrote: "Google is intermittently blocking access due to the amount of traffic from NHS Trusts Nationally (This is not being blocked by the IT Department). This is causing Google to think it is suffering from a cyber-attack." In other words, the IT department argues, Google is getting hit with so much traffic from the NHS' network that it thinks it is being attacked by hackers, and is "blocking" it to defend itself. Hackers often use denial-of-service attacks to try and take down websites and online services. They bombard the target with an overwhelming amount of malicious traffic (often harvested from hijacked computers linked in a "botnet"). If successful, this blocks legitimate traffic from getting through, and crashes the target. Google, however, denies this. It said that its systems were working correctly, and that it is designed to handle large amounts of traffic — suggesting the problem is on the NHS' end. "There are many reasons why users might see a CAPTCHA window when they do a Google search," a spokesperson said in an emailed statement. "Our systems are simply checking that searches are being carried out by humans and not by robots in order to keep web users safe. Once a user has filled out the CAPTCHA, they can continue to use Google as normal." In a statement sent to Business Insider, the NHS confirmed that that its users were having issues. "We are aware of the current issue concerning NHS IP addresses which occasionally results in users being directed to a simple verification form when accessing Google," it said. "This would appear to be due to the high number of people using our systems and trying to access Google at peak times. We are currently in discussion with Google as to how we can help them to resolve the issue.” In the email seen by The Register, the NHS advises staff "to use an alternative search engine i.e. Bing to bypass this problem." Alternatively, they can use Google's Chrome web browser and pass a "captcha" test to prove they're not part of a botnet. This isn't the first NHS tech headache recently. In November 2016, its employees were trapped in a "reply-all" email chain — resulting in the sending of hundreds of millions of pointless emails, slowing the network to a standstill.

Google Doodle Honors African American Sculptor To Kick Off Black History Month By Seerat Chabba @crat074 On 02/01/17 AT 7:28 AM Close As the United States kicks off its Black History Month, Google has chosen Feb. 1 to celebrate the life of 19th century African American sculptor Edmonia Lewis. Lewis was born in New York in 1844 to a father of Afro-Haitian and a mother of Mississauga Ojibwe and African-American descent. Her parents died when she was nine, leading to her adoption by her maternal aunts. Lewis enrolled in Oberlin College at the age of 15 but could not receive her degree because of the discrimination she faced at the hands of those around her. She overcame the setback to pursue a career as a sculptor and went on to serve as an apprentice under a Boston sculptor, Edward A. Brackett. It was while she was working under Brackett that she carried out her first solo exhibition, paying tribute to abolitionists and those who fought in the Civil War. Edmonia Lewis, Albumen print, c.1870. Photo: Wikimedia Commons/Henry Rocher Related Stories Google Doodle Honors Japanese Civil Rights Activist Bessie Coleman, First Black Woman Pilot, Honored By Google Lewis was also commissioned to work on a portrait of U.S. President Ulysses S Grant in 1877, reports say. Her work was greatly appreciated and she travelled to Rome, Italy, which she chose to make her base later in her life. It was in Rome that she started sculpting with marble, amalgamating the Neoclassical style with her cultural experiences. After receiving great amounts of praise for her work, Lewis died in September 1907in London. However, for years she was thought to have died in 1911 in Rome, according to  Cowan’s Auctions report. “Decades later, Lewis’s legacy continues to thrive through her art and the path she helped forge for women and artists of color,” Google wrote in its celebration of her life. “Today, we celebrate her and what she stands for — self-expression through art, even in the face of adversity.” Join the Discussion Most Read Everything You Need To Know, Right Now.

Published on February 01, 2017. Most Popular Pinterest said Wednesday that it is introducing a search advertising product with a dozen new clients, who join a batch of brands such as Home Depot, Target, Garnier, eBay and Barilla that were already testing an early version. The offering includes keyword search and shopping campaigns that appear very similar to the product listing ads found on Google. Search advertising generated $16.3 billion in the first six months of 2016, but the majority of that revenue went to Google, as it saw 96% of all search-ad clicks on mobile devices in the fourth quarter, according to digital marketing shop Merkle. If Pinterest could capture even a small slice of that pie, it would translate to massive media dollars for the brand. Marketers haven't been able to decide how to best spend their ad dollars with Pinterest, as its newest offerings include video, social e-commerce and search. Still, the platform sees more than 2 billion queries each month, and given the strength of the signals about consumer intent that searches provide, marketers may have their best use for the platform right there. Pinterest says that its users turn to Pinterest three months before making a big purchase and that 97% of queries performed on its platform do not mention brands. Its pitch is that this activity represents a prime opportunity for marketers to capture new customers. "People don't know exactly what they want, but there is high commercial intent in our search queries," said Jon Kaplan, global head of partnerships at Pinterest. "Search ads on Pinterest will enable our marketing partners to reach those customers when they are in discovery mode." Pinterest declined to name the new marketers that are using its search ad product. Although bidding on certain keywords is done in a fashion similar to Google's familiar keyword search auctions, there are several important differences that advertisers should be aware of with Pinterest, according to Jessica Schank, consumer engagement manager at Barilla. "It's a visual platform, so creative is very important," Ms. Schank said. "We also learned that on Pinterest, search queries are pretty broad." That means advertisers can seek consumers in the more open-minded "upper middle" marketing funnel, she said, as opposed to platforms where consumers are closer to purchase and accordingly enter pretty specific searches. Barilla has found success focusing on keywords like "quick and easy recipes" or "pasta dishes" on Pinterest, Ms. Schank said. Its cost-per-click was lower and clicks led to 50% more event actions on its website when compared to Google, she added. "We like it because it fills both social and search, but you have to take into account the context of everything," she said. "Immediately after we saw results we definitely felt this was a compliment to Google." "For instance, we are very focused on recipe content on Pinterest where on Google, we can expand into more things like product, FAQs and things like that," she added. Pinterest is not opening up its search offerings to just anyone yet, adding that it needs to fine-tune and develop its algorithm before it can deploy it at a larger scale. Ad Age first reported in July that Pinterest was updating its advertising strategy to place more focus on expanding its keyword search offerings. The company is building its infrastructure and also announced a partnership with Tel-Aviv based marketing outfit Kenshoo to help bring demand to its search platform. "What Pinterest is doing is actually something we think has the potential to be really big marketplace for our class," said Todd Bowman, director of SEM and feed management at Merkle. "The general in-house information we have on them is the volume is good, but not great. But the ROI is positive and that isn't surprising because there isn't a lot of competition."

Dylan McGrath, Contributing Editor 1/31/2017 02:30 PM EST  5 comments   post a comment NO RATINGS Login to Rate Tweet Consumer electronics and appliances makers are pushing to add voice control to their products in the wake of the success of Amazon Echo and Google Home. The surprising success of digital personal assistants such as Amazon Echo and Google Home has semiconductor vendors and others asking where voice recognition capability can go next. Amazon said it sold millions of Echo and Echo Dot digital personal assistants over the holiday season, up 9X from last year. The company hasn’t disclosed exactly how many Echo products it has sold since the introduction in late 2014, but some analysts believe it’s in the neighborhood of 10 million. The Consumer Technology Association’s (CTA) estimates are slightly lower. The Consumer Technology Association (CTA) estimated earlier this month that a total of 5 million digital voice assistants like Echo and Home have been sold in the U.S. alone to date, with another 5 million forecast to sell this year. So, voice control is a big deal. Amazon Echo Dot. Source: Amazon The next wave appears to involve cutting out the middleman—the hub that interfaces with the user and controls the devices—and adding voice control capability directly to appliances we use everyday. This trend was evident at the Consumer Electronics Show (CES), where voice control interfaces emerged as one of the stars of the show.  At CES, Amazon and Google announced that they are making available the capability to allow developers to add their virtual assistants to any connected device. Nvidia also announced a similar capability. Chip vendors such as NXP Semiconductors are offering devices, reference design and design kits intended to help vendors of appliances and home entertainment equipment add voice capability directly to their products. Imagine rolling into your kitchen and talking directly to your refrigerator, toaster, oven, microwave and dishwasher. Leonardo Azevedo, NXP Leonardo Azevedo, director of consumer and industrial applications processors at NXP, said in an interview with EE Times that the company is seeing broad interest from makers of all kinds of products in adding voice recognition capability to their products. At the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas earlier this month, NXP introduced the i.MX 8M family of applicaitons processors for smart home and smart mobility applications, including supporting voice control and voice assistance applicaions. With chipmakers and appliance vendors scrambling to add voice control to everything in the kitchen and the living room, is it only a matter of time until we are regularly conversing with all of our appliances and entertainment devices? “That’s a good theory, but it really depends on the user experience,” said Tom Hackenberg, principal analyst for embedded processors at IHS Markit. Bottom line, Hackenberg said, it all depends upon the execution. If the voice control works well, it will catch on. If it doesn’t, it won’t.

If we have more and more devices listening out, and a significant false positive rate, then we'll be in a position where any conversation is being interrupted by our digital "assistants. To reduce this to a very low error rate, at a cost where you can put it in a microwave oven, will be challenging indeed. There's also a question of the personality of the assistants - one person's light breakfast conversation is another person's trigger to introduce the toaster to the waste disposal and a four pound lump hammer.

Join For Free Read about the story and evolution of the data warehouse, as well as the major challenges that these systems are currenly facing.  Brought to you in partnership with Panopoly. The basic free Google Analytics (GA) functionality is great for small and medium websites and mobile applications, but as your online business expands, you will start looking to get more of this data. However, GA lacks advanced capabilities such as automated user segmentation, anomaly detection, and predictive modeling. That is why users are looking to integrate their GA within their data warehouses, for example, AWS Redshift. But can these be easily integrated? Over the last few months I was in charge of creating our Google analytics extension here at Panoply.io that helps in loading, transforming and analyzing the data to our platform. As we developed this feature, we learned how to use GA custom dimensions, manually export the data using GA Reporting APIs, and finally get this data loaded into Redshift. This article provides step-by-step guidelines on how to extract and load data to Amazon Redshift and use it for comprehensive web analytics. For the purpose of illustration, I would like to check the number of pageviews per client, based on the source traffic country and corresponding network service provider. This will help us to determine which client is using what kind of network service providers, according to country, and how many pages have been viewed per network service provider or country. To show you how to do this, I have created three custom GA dimensions. First, I created two Session scope custom dimension names, Client ID and Session ID, as well as a hit scope custom dimension name, Hit Timestamp. The purpose of creating these custom dimensions is to generate session and hit scope data together, so we can assign Client IDs and Session IDs based on browser, along with a Hit Timestamp based on pageviews. We’ll then load the results of our queries to Redshift and combine them to generate detailed tracking of pageviews both by client and session. Creating Custom Dimensions and Tags with Google Tag Manager To create your custom dimension, sign into your GA account, then perform these steps: Set up some custom dimensions. For our example, create three custom dimensions named Client ID, Session ID, and Hit Timestamp. The first two dimensions are session-based, the last one is Hit-based. Next, sign into Google Tag Manager to tag the custom dimensions. The details are given in this article. Once the custom dimensions are setup and defined tags using Google Tag Manager, it’s time to collect the data from GA. Pulling the Data From GA Pulling the data from GA is not a straightforward task. Although the Google Reporting API allows us to view metric values for a number of dimensions, it doesn’t provide any built-in dimension for incoming hit stream data. So here you can use a Python script, which will extract the raw data off GA and save it to a CSV file. You can obtain the Python code and full instructions here. From our custom dimensions, you’ll create two different CSV files. For the Client ID custom dimension, customize the following lines in the Python script: return service.data().ga().get(
  ids=table_id,
  start_date='2016-11-24',
  end_date='2016-12-24',
  metrics='ga:sessionsPerUser',
      dimensions='ga:Country,ga:ServiceProvider,ga:ClientID',
  sort='-ga:sessionsPerUser',
  start_index='1',
  max_results='25') Then save the output to a CSV file named pageviews.csv. The output will resemble the following: For our Session ID custom dimension, customize the following lines and save to a file called sessions.csv: return service.data().ga().get(
  ids=table_id,
  start_date='2016-11-24',
  end_date='2016-12-24',
  metrics='ga:pageviews',
      dimensions='ga:Country,ga:ServiceProvider,ga:SessionID',
  sort='-ga:pageviews',
  start_index='1',
  max_results='25') The output will resemble the following: Next, upload these files to your S3 bucket and from there to Redshift. Loading the Data to Redshift Before loading data directly into Amazon Redshift, it is important to decide how the raw data will be structured within Redshift. In our example, we issued the following SQL commands to create our clients and sessions tables: CREATE TABLE client
(
 Country  VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
 ServiceProvider  VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
 ClientID INTEGER NOT NULL,
 sessionsPerUser INTEGER NOT NULL,
 );

CREATE TABLE session
(
  Country  VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL,
 ServiceProvider  VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL
 SessionID  VARCHAR(64) NOT NULL
 pageviews INTEGER NOT NULL,
); Next I copied the data from our S3 bucket into those tables. To do so, we executed the following commands: copy pageviews from 's3://awssampledbuswest2/clients.csv’
credentials 'aws_access_key_id=<Your-Access-Key-ID>;aws_secret_access_key=<Your-Secret-Access-Key>'

copy usertype from 's3://awssampledbuswest2/sessions.csv’
credentials 'aws_access_key_id=<Your-Access-Key-ID>;aws_secret_access_key=<Your-Secret-Access-Key>' Once the data has been copied to our tables in Redshift, I can execute, for example, a query to join the two tables into one: Select client.Country, client.ServiceProvider, client.ClientID, client.sessionsPerUser, session.SessionID, session.pageviews from session join client on session.Country = client.Country The sample output will resemble the following: Note: To keep the data up to date, a cron job should be set up to update the Redshift table at regular intervals. I hope this article has helped you. I am already working on next week’s article, and continuing this example showing how to analyze the data loaded to Redshift using Tableau.

Google has finally done what some iOS users have been wanting for a long time, and has made the Chrome browser for iOS open source While the Google Chrome browser has been open source since its launch, through the Chromium dev project), there’s been no such luck for iOS users. Apple’s developer policy insists that browsers on the platform use WebKit and not their own rendering engines. This created a stumbling block for Google, but all that’s about to change. The company has finally added its Chrome code for iOS to the Chromium project. Developers who want to experiment with building mods for the browser on iOS, or just examine its security, should have no trouble anymore. In addition, since all of Chromium’s usual tests are now applicable to the iOS code, it makes it easier for developers to implement cross-platform features. That also means the Google Chrome browser for iOS is likely to see more frequent updates from here on out.

Apple App Store Records Double the Revenue of Google Play Store GO App Store reaches 2.2 million apps, less than on Play Store Feb 1, 2017 11:47 GMT  ·  By Alexandra Vaidos  ·  Share:  Apple’s latest financial results show that the company is surely on the right track, after recording all-time record sales for iPhones and Apple Watches. But that’s not the only department in which Apple excels, as revenue from Services grew strongly during the last year. Apple Services grew considerably and outsold the iPad, while on track to soon overtake even Mac sales. The Services category incorporates the App Store, Apple Pay and iCloud. Apple’s chief executive Tim Cook states that the App Store now incorporates 2.2 million apps. According to Statista, Google’s Play Store incorporated 2.6 million applications in December 2016. Although the Play Store has a much larger number of applications than Apple’s App Store, the latter managed to record double the revenue. This doesn’t come as a surprise, considering that the situation in Q1 2016 was the same. Apple’s App Store had double the revenue compared to Google’s Play Store, in part due to in-app subscriptions for HBO Now, Spotify and Netflix services. Google does record more downloads and more apps in its store, but it seems that Apple is better at monetizing its resources, which in the business world is all that matters. Apple wants to double Services revenue until 2021 In total, Apple recorded a total of $7.17 billion revenue from its Apple Services, amounting to an 18% growth compared to last year. It seems that Apple’s Services recorded the highest gain among all company segments. Tim Cook expects Apple’s Services to be the size of a Fortune 100 company by the end of the year, and it seems that developers share the same sentiment, as some prefer to launch the iOS version of their apps first and then the Android. This was the case of Nintendo’s Super Mario Run, which was announced on iOS back in September and still hasn't arrived to all Android users. Truth be told, the App Store is comprised mostly of paid games and applications, while Google's Play Store focuses on offering free apps and alternatives to meet user needs. The Play Store will continue to expand over the coming months, especially since Google is expected to introduce Instant Apps, to allow users to check out apps before installing them. This will surely attract more consumers, while developers would get the opportunity to reach more users. Apple also announced that there are 150 million paid customer subscriptions, over 2 million small businesses support Apple Pay and the company intends to double the services business in the next four years. #Apple#App Store#Google Play#Apple Pay#iCloud subscribe feedly old reader newsblur digg reader rss feed reddit it! flip it share it tweet it Related  ·  Hot right now  ·  Latest news Apple Says iPhone 7 and Apple Watch Set All-Time Sales Record in Q1 2017 Apple to Record Historic iOS Revenue, Faces Lawsuit over iOS Apps iPhone 7 Plus Cameras Turn Black and Stop Working, Users Complain Super Mario Run for iPhone and iPad Now Available for Download Zero-Day Windows Security Flaw Could Crash Systems, Cause BSODs Oops: Windows 10 Starts Going Down on Steam Microsoft Releases Windows 10 Mobile Build 15025 Avast Releases Three New Decryption Tools to Fight Ransomware Windows 10 Start Menu Redesigned with Project NEON Transparency Google Photos 2.8 Gets Redesigned UI and Changes to Device Folders iOS Cracking Tools Allegedly Stolen from Cellebrite Get Dumped Online by Hackers Windows Is Becoming a Bigger Threat for Apple on Tablets    App Store logo New Mac Apps Tresorit: A light, low-key and user-friendly utility that enables you to store, share and synchronize your confidential data across multiple devices Anastasiy’s Extension Manager: Manage the extensions of your Adobe applications and install new ones easily, with this straightforward and simple to use utility Smartmockups: Create beautiful presentations for your projects with the help of predefined digital, print, and screen mockups that can integrate screenshots or URL captures pdf2csv Convert: Convert the bank statements that you receive in PDF format to CSV files in order to import them into various finances management applications QOwnNotes: Text note manager that integrates Markdown formatting capabilities and enables you to sync the database to other devices via an ownCloud server QuickBuild: Professional software solution that provides support for creating a comprehensive build automation and management server on Mac OS X Manager: Versatile accounting software solution for Mac OS X that offers you the possibility to manage multiple businesses, to track all transactions, to generate reports, and so on Reader comments Apple Readies Laser Polishing System for Ceramic iPhone more on: Apple i softpedia®     Like 202K    +1 56K     Follow 13K © 2001-2017 Softpedia.

Google's homepage features artwork depicting Edmonia hard at work on her most famous piece, The Death of Cleopatra which is on display at the Smithsonian American Art Museum in Washington, D.C. The Google logo is colored vibrantly as a homage to her Native American name, Wildfire. Lewis' journey began at Oberlin College at age 15 where she became passionate about art but was unable to complete her degree due to the discrimination she faced. It was then that she moved to Boston to pursue a career in sculpting. "She was consistently denied apprenticeship until she met Edward A. Brackett, a sculptor whose clients included some of the most well-known abolitionists of the time," Google stated. "Lewis worked under Brackett until 1864, when she launched her first solo exhibition. Her work paid homage to the abolitionists and Civil War heroes of her day, including John Brown and Colonel Robert Gould Shaw. Her work was very well received and with her success, she traveled to Rome, Italy," they continued. Lewis would then go onto establish her own studio, sculpt using marble to pay homage to her African American and Native American roots and acquire more acclaim until her death in 1911. "Decades later, Lewis's legacy continues to thrive through her art and the path she helped forge for women and artists of color. Today, we celebrate her and what she stands for – self-expression through art, even in the face of adversary," the internet giant noted. Lewis' life journey and displays of her work is also featured now in Google's Arts & Culture section.

Andrew Krok/Roadshow Car Culture by Andrew Krok January 31, 2017 8:35 AM PST @andrewkrok Up Next Say hello and goodbye to the final Rolls-Royce Phantom VII Toyota is locked in a battle for global sales dominance with Volkswagen, but when it comes to Google searches, Toyota reigns supreme. A new study compiled by Quickco, a car parts company, shows that Toyota is the most Googled brand in the world. It was the top automaker search term in 74 different countries, including the US, China and Australia. BMW came in second with 51 countries, and Hyundai held onto third with 17 countries. Enlarge Image Hope you've boned up on your geography! Quickco As evidenced by the recently coined verb being tossed around, this study looked only into Google searches, so that should be taken into account. Not every country counts Google as its most popular search engine, including large ones such as Russia and China, so this is hardly the most scientific study out there. Nevertheless, it provides some interesting insights. Most notably, it shows that popularity isn't always based on country of origin. The US doesn't have Chevrolet on top, nor does South Korea have Hyundai. Only four countries tout hometown favorites -- Germany and BMW, France and Renault, Sweden and Volvo, and Italy and Fiat. Chevrolet actually proved most popular in Mexico and parts of South America. BMW's dominance stretches into Asia and North Africa. Honda's reign covers Canada, Brazil and a good chunk of South East Asia. And just a single country -- Niger -- has a supercar manufacturer on top (Bugatti).

The satellite images appear to show a 'flying saucer' spacecraft parked at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) near Los Angeles. YouTube user 'Name Shame' made the bizarre finding yesterday and published the images on his YouTube channel. Scroll down for video  Keen-eyed UFO hunters have spotted a strange circular object on Google Earth images of a Nasa runway. The satellite images appear to show a 'flying saucer' spacecraft parked at Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) near Los Angeles 'Is NASA playing games?.. UFO captured? What is it?' he said in the post. Google's satellite images reveal that that the object has moved since 2014. While it could be seen sat on a patch of grass near the JPL runway three years ago, it has since shifted onto the runway. The JPL, near Los Angeles, is the birthplace of the US's first satellite to orbit the Earth. The 'Explorer 1' satellite launched in 1958. The JPL now acts as the headquarters for exploratory missions to study distant planets and asteroids. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next World's first tuberculosis-resistant cows are created in...

Share this article Share 447 shares But conspiracy theorists suggest that the labs house secret alien technology captured from fallen UFOs. 'I doubt this is a captured extraterrestrial flying saucer, more likely it is a structure or vehicle that has a flying saucer shape,' Nigel Watson, author of the UFO Investigations Manual, told MailOnline. The JPL is the birthplace of America's first satellite to orbit the Earth back in 1958. It now acts as the headquarters for several upcoming exploratory missions to study distant planets and asteroids 'Secondly, why would they leave it out in the open to be spotted by the likes of Google Earth? 'Seeing strange anomalies on Google seems to be the latest craze that is rivalling the watching of live images from the International Space Station to get a glimpse of UFOs. 'In most of these instances we see what we look for.' And this is not the first time that UFO Hunters have used Google's satellite tech to spot aliens. Earlier this month a self-proclaimed ufologist claimed footage of himself fighting and being abducted by aliens had been caught on camera by Google maps. A man who called himself John Mooner, from Newton Abbot in Devon, claimed a 'real alien abduction' has been captured taking place on Google's satellite cameras.  The green glow is supposedly light from an alien ship hoping to beam him up. The small red circles allegedly show him being punched in the face by an alien. A zoomed in version is shown top right THE 'ABDUCTION' Mr Mooner claimed he does not remember the abduction at all, but is convinced it is himself in the footage. 'I do remember sporadic episodes of missing time throughout the year of 2016 and going back through the previous years,' he said. He is convinced from looking at a series of pictures that he was abducted. 'The shocking thing about this was that it's me being abducted by a grey alien and the satellite image clearly shows me trying to fight off the grey alien by punching it in the face,' he said.  'I was having trouble with the Google Earth app that was installed on my computer so I looked for an online option and found Google satellite maps,' Mr Mooner told the Torquay Herald Express. 'I thought to myself I will view the area where I was UFO spotted from last year and look for anything out of the ordinary.  'I was left speechless by what I saw. 'The satellite has captured a real alien abduction taking place.' The pictures were released by Mr Mooner, who claims he took them from Google maps. Where exactly the abduction took place is unknown. 'The shocking thing about this was that it's me being abducted by a grey alien and the satellite image clearly shows me trying to fight off the grey alien by punching it in the face,' he said. Mr Mooner claims he does not remember the abduction at all, but is convinced it is himself in the footage. 'I do however remember sporadic episodes of missing time throughout the year of 2016 and going back through the previous years,' he said 'Looking at the image it appears that the alien has blocked my punch and has grabbed my fist and must of been able to subdue me [sic].' Mr Mooner claims he does not remember the abduction at all, but is convinced it is himself in the footage. 'I do however remember sporadic episodes of missing time throughout the year of 2016 and going back through the previous years,' he said.  'I do remember wearing a black baseball cap and shirt. This is definitely me on the satellite image.'  'The shocking thing about this was that it's me being abducted by a grey alien and the satellite image clearly shows me trying to fight off the grey alien by punching it in the face,' he said Read more: 'Amazing evidence of my alien abduction' claims UFO spotter John Mooner | Torquay Herald Express jet propulsion laboratory UFO spotted sighting 2017 - YouTube Share or comment on this article e-mail 447 shares Most watched News videos Moment carer is caught on camera manhandling a dementia patient Ministry of Defence release build up to Marine A shooting Taliban fighter Woman filmed performing sex act in Florida court house Sky News presenter accidentally says 'pr**k' in Trump segment Ivanka posts video of Arabella singing a song for Chinese New Year MoD video shows build-up to moment marine shoots Taliban fighter Moments after Audi R8 GT crashes after driving almost 200 mph John Berocw says there's 'no issue' with baby being in commons Man hanging from windowsill of high flat falls to his death 'I'd like you to apologise': Moment outraged caller phones LBC Junkie holds young girl at knifepoint as he demands drugs from police Loose Women: Farage rows with Saira Khan over US travel ban EXCLUSIVE: Trump's Supreme Court pick Neil Gorsuch...

Here are five tablets that fans are hoping will get a refresh in 2017. Sarah K. White (CIO (US)) 01 February, 2017 20:19 - - - - print email Comments Tablet might be struggling to find a place amongst hybrids, but there are still plenty of devices to get excited about in the coming year. These five tablets are slated to be some of the most exciting devices of 2017, and each offers a traditional tablet experience. iPad Air 3 Apple Apple typically announced iPads in the fall, but last spring it surprised everyone by announcing the 9.7-inch iPad Pro. But come fall, Apple was mum on a third generation iPad Air. That has some speculating that Apple will ditch the Air lineup, instead offering a third, entry-level iPad Pro. However, NeuroGadget reports it's likely Apple will release a 16GB iPad Air 3, with a thinner, water-resistant design, for $600. Either way, sources are confident that Apple plans to announce three tablets - a 9.7, 10.5 and 12.9-inch model - in Spring of this year. NeuroGadget also reports that, to compete with the Microsoft Surface, the iPad Air 3 is expected to ship with the Apple Pencil. Galaxy Tab S3 Samsung The Samsung Galaxy Tab S2 took a strong swing at the Apple iPad Air 2, offering a similar design and level of performance. It became a strong contender for anyone interested in a high-end tablet outside of the iOS ecosystem. There aren't many rumors about the Tab S3, but earlier this month, Trusted Reviews reported that an Android tablet featuring the model number "SM-T825," had been certified by the WiFi Alliance. While it can't be confirmed as the Tab S3, the GFXBench benchmark readout actually does list the device as the Samsung Galaxy Tab S3. Specs include a 9.6-inch display, a quad-core Qualcomm Snapdragon 820 processor, 4GB RAM and a 12-megapixel camera. Whether it's the Tab S3, or not, it's clear Samsung has something in the works for the 9-inch tablet market. [ Related story: Enterprise tablet wars: Galaxy TabPro S vs. Surface Pro 4 ] Google Chrome OS Google Google recently announced that all Chromebooks released in 2017 will be compatible with Android apps -- a move that suggests Chrome OS tablets are in the works. In an interview with The Verge, Google's Rajen Sheth, director of product for Android and Chrome said that the company is working on making Chrome OS more touch-friendly. Sheth also told The Verge that Google is working on making Android apps run smoother on larger displays in order to combine the desktop feel of Chrome OS with an Android tablet experience. While there aren't any confirmed devices in the works, it seems Google is gearing up to either release a proprietary Chrome OS tablet, or open up the ecosystem for other OEMs to develop tablets and hybrids. As The Verge points out, it wouldn't be out of reason to imagine Google might try to salvage the Pixel C tablet with a new version that can run this improved version of Chrome OS. ASUS ZenPad 3s 10 LTE ASUS The Asus ZenPad 3S 10 LTE is an update to last year's Asus ZenPad 3S 10, featuring a Qualcomm Snapdragon 650 processor, LTE capabilities, 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage. The improved specs make this one of the more exciting tablets for 2017 -- Asus not only boosted the performance, they also claim the new model gets 16 hours of battery life. The ZenPad 3S 10 LTE doesn't just feature premium performance, it also boasts a thin, all-aluminum and lightweight design and a 2K IPS display. While it's been announced, the device isn't available outside Malaysia yet, but it's expected to sell for around $400 once it hits the U.S. Right now, you can get a similar device, the https://www.asus.com/us/Tablets/ASUS-ZenPad-Z10-ZT500KL-Verizon-exclusive/, from Verizon, featuring nearly identical specs and LTE capabilities.

The Amazon Fire family not only includes affordable tablets, but a range of devices that offer different levels of performance. The last update came last September, when Amazon introduced a new Amazon Fire HD 8 with better storage, faster performance and more battery life. It's been two years since the Fire 7 and Fire HD 10 were treated to an update, so it would make sense for Amazon to refresh the two tablets. The Fire HD 10 was updated in 2016, but the changes were mostly aesthetic -- the tablet was updated to feature an all-metal design and additional storage options. But with only 1GB of RAM and a 1.5GHz quad-core processor, it's well overdue for an upgrade. Related Video 6 Styles of Customer Analytics More from Gartner Join the CIO Australia group on LinkedIn.

Lego has also replaced Disney as the most powerful brand in the world, according to the ranking.

Administrators using these solutions now have greater control over the data stored on Google’s platform. Reports said the updates include the ability for admins to require their own users to use security keys to access data on the apps, while those managers can also control who gets those tokens, via the Security Key service. This, Google said, helps employees be protected from phishing attacks, one of the most common cybersecurity threats of a business. A two-year study on the use of security keys by Google employees, released last month, found that the technology is better than two-factor verification solutions, like smartphones, at preventing hacks. Google is also expanding its data loss prevention (DLP) service, which had previously only been extended to Gmail. Administrators can enact the DLP solution for Google Drive, which prevents employees from sharing sensitive corporate data beyond the company. Additionally, Google has introduced new features for email security, allowing businesses to implement their own encryption certificates, while enabling companies to also store emails outside of Gmail and Google Vault by integrating with third-party services. Reports noted that the updates appear to be an effort on Google’s part to prevent businesses from using other cloud-based app services. The G Suite solutions are the result of Google’s rebranding of its enterprise-facing units last October. At the time, Google announced a partnership with enterprise services company Accenture to help corporate clients understand G Suite’s offerings, develop industry-specific apps and support cloud adoption.

According to a study by valuation and strategy consultancy Brand Finance, published on Wednesday, the monetary value of Google’s brand rose by 24 per cent last year to $109.5bn, propelling it to the top spot for the first time since 2011. Apple’s value fell from $145.9bn in the previous year to $107.1bn. “[Google] remains largely unchallenged in its core search business, which is the mainstay of its advertising income,” Brand Finance wrote in its report. David Haigh, chief executive officer of Brand Finance, commented that Apple has recently struggled to maintain its technological advantage over rivals. “New iterations of the iPhone have delivered diminishing returns and there are signs that the company has reached a saturation point for its brand,” he said. “The Chinese market, where Apple has enjoyed a dominant market share, is becoming far more competitive with local players entering the market in a meaningful way.” But late Tuesday, before Brand Finance’s sturdy was published, Apple posted forecast-beating results for the most recent quarter, reclaiming the throne as the world’s top smartphone seller for the first time in five years – even beating arch rival Samsung. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, reported in January better-than-expected revenue for the most recent quarter thanks to a fast-growing cloud-computing business and booming YouTube video advertising, but profits were hit by a one-off tax payment. The study of 500 brands deemed Amazon the third most valuable, at $106.4m, followed by AT&T at $87m and Microsoft at $76.3m. Facebook claimed the ninth spot in the rankings with a value of a slither under $62m. In Wednesday’s report Brand Finance also crowned Lego the world’s most powerful brand, which is defined as one whose enterprise value is most positively impacted by the strength of its brand. The study found that much of the Danish family-owned company’s success is owed to its partnerships with the Star Wars, Harry Potter and Batman franchises. Other brands that made it into the top five “powerful” ranking included Google, Nike, Ferrari and Visa. Walt Disney, which nabbed the title of most powerful brand last year, fell to sixth place. “This may be because its 2016 Star Wars release was a spin-off and less successful than 2015’s reboot of the main franchise, one of the highest grossing films of all time,” Brand Finance wrote in the report. The company noted, however that it “remains a hugely powerful brand and will be closely watched during 2017 when the eighth instalment of Star Wars is released and could propel the brand up the rankings again”.

Cue opening of dystopian novel. A man walks down the hallway of the abandoned hospital he has been squatting in since the downfall of Western civilisation. There are rat droppings in the corner, and the walls are sticky with bodily fluids, but instead of this abject squalor, the man’s VR headset shows him a field of prancing deer. Video of Oasis As you can see from the above video, things aren’t all that grim. The Oasis project uses Google’s augmented-reality Tango platform to scan a local environment, and then transform this 3D map into a procedurally generated VR world. See related  Virtual reality will change the way you think about violence Virtual and wet: An interview with artist Adham Faramawy Confront death with this out-of-body VR experience The idea is that you scan a room or a portion of corridor using a Tango-powered phone. The layout of the space’s floor and walls are then used as the basis for a virtual environment, which can be viewed by putting the same phone into a VR headset. So far the researchers have made four environments: the aforementioned bucolic paradise; an island surrounded by shipwrecks; a hellish lava flow; and a metallic platform floating in space. As well as walls, furniture can apparently be visualised as rocks or ponds, so you don’t trip up over your own sofa. According to UploadVR, chairs can also be scanned in real-time, so they can be factored into the virtual space. You’d need to have strong faith in the system not to make a minor mistake when positioning the VR chair, but if you’re looking for a chance to sit down in the middle of a deserted island, the app has you covered. As well as providing a virtual means of escape, the makers of the app hint at Oasis’ potential to be used to create new forms of storytelling: “Oasis can be used, for example, to create story spaces where friends and family can remotely participate in a session of storytelling around the campfire,” the project’s description reads. “The freedom to move around and interact with the virtual world allows for a new form of storytelling when combined with traditional narration techniques like vocalisation, movement and gestures. We call this human-in-the-loop-storytelling, distinguishing it from current VR storytelling experiences where the software system is the storyteller.” It’s not clear how multiple users would remotely participate in shared sessions – or that they would even want to, given how much emphasis the project places on location-specific spaces – but Oasis does hint at a future for VR where physical and digital objects are combined. Creative studio Marshmallow Laser Feast, for example, recently used this overlap between VR and real-world set design in its Treehugger: Wawona installation.

World Trademark Review Login Reset password Toggle navigation Home Home Magazine Blog Market intelligence Top TM professionals Research Legal updates Events International directory Media Apple no longer top of the tree; Google named world’s most valuable brand 01 Feb 17 < Back to Blogs Trevor Little The latest version of the Brand Finance Global 500, which identifies and ranks the world’s most valuable brands, has seen Google take the number one spot, with Apple dropping to second place after a five year stint at the top. Despite a substantial jump in its brand value, Amazon.com remains in third place. Apple has been top of the list since 2012, as its dominance in the smartphone and tablet sector helped it consistently grow in brand value. But this year Brand Finance reports a 27% fall in brand value. Amongst the factors it considered when making its assessment was a perceived over-exploitation of the goodwill of customers, with other tech brands playing catch-up in the competitive technology sector. Crucially, a number of Chinese brands have strengthened their position in the smartphone market, further denting Apple’s supremacy. In the forthcoming edition of World Trademark Review we will bring exclusive in-depth analysis of the list and the key drivers of value over the past year. A key trend across the 500 brands that made the list is the strengthening of a number of technology brands. Considering Google’s victory in regaining the top spot after a six year absence, Brand Finance’s analysts note that the company has carefully built up its brand equity despite its overall brand architecture being more complicated than Apple’s. Amazon rounds off a competitive top three, having seen its brand growth leap 53% year on year (YoY). Meanwhile Facebook posted an even more impressive annual growth, its 82% rise in brand value propelling it into the top ten. Even this, though, can’t match Tencent’s 95% YoY improvement, which saw it jump 70 places on the overall list. Other Chinese tech brands that saw significant jumps in value were WeChat (103%), Alibaba (94%), JD.com (46%) and Huawei (28%). The 20 most valuable brands (with last year’s rank in brackets) were: Rank Brand Brand value 2017 ($m) Brand value % change (YoY) 1 (2) Google 109,470 24% 2 (1) Apple 107,141 -27% 3 (3) Amazon.com 106,396 53% 4 (6) AT&T 87,016 45% 5 (4) Microsoft 76,265 13% 6 (7) Samsung Group 66,219 13% 7 (5) Verizon 65,875 4% 8 (8) Walmart 62,211 16% 9 (17) Facebook 61,998 82% 10 (13) ICBC 47,832 32% 11 (9) China Mobile 46,734 -6% 12 (11) Toyota 46,255 7% 13 (10) Wells Fargo 41,618 -6% 14 (14) China Construction Bank 41,377 17% 15 (22) NTT Group 40,542 28% 16 (12) McDonald’s 38,966 -9% 17 (15) BMW 37,124 6% 18 (23) Shell 36,783 16% 19 (18) T (Deutsche Telekom) 36,433 10% 20 (21) IBM 36,112 14% Away from the most valuable list, an alternative perspective on brands is to look at their ‘power’, and to this end Brand Finance’s Brand Strength Index (BSI) scores attributes such familiarity, loyalty, promotion, marketing investment, staff satisfaction and corporate reputation, which are then benchmarked against industry competitors. Last year Disney – boosted by its acquisition of Lucasfilm – replaced Lego as the most powerful brand. This year, Lego is back on top, with canny collaborations and licensing deals (such as the team-up with Warner and DC to bring the Lego Batman Movie to cinema screens) contributing significantly to both Lego’s licensing income and brand affinity amongst diverse groups of consumers. Rounding out the top five are Google, Nike, Ferrari and Visa. Not all trademark counsel are in a position to undertake formal valuation assessments, but for those protecting and enabling commercialisation around the brands featured on the top 500 list, today’s publication provides a useful tool in their efforts to increase their understanding of the legal function’s work and value – after all, they protect the very assets which underpin economic performance and can represent significant percentages of overall enterprise value. Speaking at the 2016 Managing the Asset Lifecycle event in New York, Patrick Flaherty, intellectual property and internet law attorney at Verizon Communications, specifically highlighted the role such lists can be wielded: “The brand has tremendous value to us and, while it doesn’t impact our transactional work, we certainly keep track of third-party valuations and awards for internal reporting purposes.”   As we noted then, for the companies that appear on such tables, this type of recognition allows an important message to be conveyed to internal stakeholders – that trademark maintenance and protection is not just a company cost, but is directly contributing to brand value. David Haigh, CEO of Brand Finance, will be a speaker at the upcoming Managing the Trademark Asset Lifecycle Europe event, held in Munich on March 23. Haigh will feature in a session exploring the practical payback of brand valuation and how companies can both conduct and wield the results of valuation exercises.

Sami Khan   February 1, 2017 16:33 IST Google HomeTwitter/@madebygoogle There's a lot of suspense around Google's participation in the Super Bowl Ll on Sunday as the web giant is using the big game to show off its most popular home-connected speaker. The web search titan is tight-lipped about what the Google Home commercial will be about. Android Authority reported that advertisers are spending $5 million for each 30-second Super Bowl commercial. It ought to be a good one, right! Read: Super Bowl 2017 ads: Budweiser's pro-immigration, Justin Timberlake's Bai drink & more [VIDEOS] Google Home has been available in the market for months now, and it is one of the most popular smart home gadgets in the market. Google has demonstrated its home speaker's capabilities in previous ads on YouTube, showing how it can improve consumer lives by controlling everything from lights to music with just voice commands. If that's any indication, we can expect Google to improvise on that. According to AdAge, which reported about the Google's Super Bowl ad during the NFL football championship between the Atlanta Falcons and the New England Patriots, Google's parent company Alphabet spent $3.19 billion in 2015 for advertisements. This is only a fraction of what the company made through advertising. Last week, Alphabet reported about $22.4 billion ad revenue for the quarter ending December 31, which was up 17 percent year-over-year. Google won't be the only tech company participating in the Super Bowl 2017 commercials. Intel, Sprint, T-Mobile, GoDaddy, SquareSpace, Wix.com, TurboTax and Evony: The King's Return game will feature their ads during the big game.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Google Drive templates for docs on mobile got easier By Ida Torres - February 1, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Every day, the G Suite updates just keep on coming, have you noticed? Whether it’s a minor or major update, it looks like Google is trying to fulfill its promise of making the mobile experience of using Google Drive, Docs, Sheets, and Slides almost the same as that of using them on the desktop. The latest update makes it easier for users to use the templates by having direct access from the Drive. It should now be easier to create new files from these templates so you can focus on the content of the files. Templates are pretty useful for those times when you don’t want to focus on the format and style of a document you’re creating, but having a pre-set one is pretty important. Google and some developers and experts as well have been creating templates for things like invoices, case studies, content calendars, budget breakdowns, etc. They have been lifesavers sometimes, especially if you’re in a hurry and on your mobile device. Google is making it easier now as it now grants you access to templates directly from the Google Drive. Just go to Drive > New > Google Docs/Sheets/Slides/Forms > From a template and you will be redirected to the respective template gallery where you can choose one that you need at that moment. You don’t have to go to the home pages of Docs/Sheets/Slides/Forms to be able to access the templates. The update has already started rolling out to all G Suite users, so you might want to check out your Google Drive Google Play page.

Liz Stinson and Margaret Rhodes Design Date of Publication: 02.01.17. 02.01.17 Time of Publication: 5:30 am. 5:30 am America Has Its Problems, But Design Can Help Solve Them twelveofour Designers do more than make shiny, pretty things. They shape how the world works by solving problems. And right now, the country has some problems. Regardless of whether you were protesting in the streets last weekend, you’d probably agree that people of all political stripes have receded into echo chambers. Discourse has devolved into arguments over facts and alternative facts. No one is sure how to move forward. Designers can help. There is a cadre of designers who devote themselves to politics and civic engagement. We spoke to some of them: researchers who study and clarify voting laws, designers who help communities navigate local regulations, and optimistic technologists. They offered five basic principles to help chart a more meaningful path forward: Remove Roadblocks Participating in a democracy can feel daunting. Things like arcane voter registration laws, convoluted ballot measures, and the labyrinthine nature of government create confusion and little incentive to get involved. Google Designers call snags like this friction, and the best of them excel at removing them. When Google realized how many people were searching for voting information, its experience designers built tools to intuit their questions. Typing “where do I vo-” brought up tidily packaged answers presented in plain language. “Voter ID laws are so confusing and give you too much information,” says Lisa Tilson, a UX writer at Google. “A lot of my job is just pulling out information people do not need.” You don’t need Google’s pockets or human resources to make an impact. After the election, Pioneer Works, a multidisciplinary studio and incubator in Brooklyn, created a kiosk where people can literally make their voices heard. A visitor can enter his address in a computer, record a message, and the kiosk sends the voicemail to his state representative. By removing roadblocks, designers can make getting involved a little easier. Expect To Do Non-Design Work The designer-client relationship revolves around an assignment, a Big Idea, and an unveiling. Political change doesn’t work that way. It happens slowly, and incrementally. “We get calls from people all the time saying, ‘We want to do something, we want to make an app,’” says Whitney Quesenbery, the co-founder of the Center for Civic Design. There’s nothing wrong with being ambitious, but an app isn’t always the answer. Designers may not regularly do clerical work, but elections offices and local non-profits need it. “They need proofreaders and volunteers and people to answer phone calls,” says Dana Chisnell of the Center for Civic Design. “Designers are often good at those things.” Center for Civic Design The work provides invaluable insights. Think of it as user research, says Christine Gaspar of the Center for Urban Pedagogy (CUP), a non-profit that uses design to increase civic engagement in underserved communities. Getting involved on a grassroots level can reveal problems that might not otherwise be obvious. “Show up and listen for while before you figure out how you can help them as a designer,” Gaspar says. “Over time you’ll realize they might have a design you can help with.” Engage With Your Community Every designer brings personal experiences and biases to a project, but effective designers put them aside and strive to understand the people they’re working for. “How do you as a designer show up in a way that’s being an ally and an accomplice first?” says Gaspar of CUP. A few years ago, Gaspar and her team were helping develop a pamphlet that would help public housing residents understand their rights. Her designer chose a particular shade of blue for the typography, which elicited a strong reaction from the community members. “They said, ‘You can’t use that color,'” Gaspar recalls. “That’s the color of the Housing Authority.” It was a simple mistake and easily rectified, because Gaspar’s team involved its constituents in the design process from the very beginning of the project. The experience led Gaspar to an important insight: Oftentimes the quickest path to a solution is to stop talking and start listening. “It’s about being respectful and showing up and creating spaces for people to give input that is meaningful,” she says. “It needs to be clear that we value their input. We’re not saying, ‘Here’s what we did, do you love it?’ We’re saying, ‘Here’s what we did, what’s wrong with it?'” Create A Shared Language Bureaucracies tend to move slowly and communicate poorly, something Sarah Brooks discovered when she became chief design officer at the US Department Veteran Affairs in 2014. President Obama wanted her team to make an agency with more than 365,000 employees into the government’s best customer service organization. She and her team worked with the US Digital Service to launch Vets.gov.1 They were also tasked with creating a consistent patient experience across 135 medical centers, community clinics, and hospice centers. Achieving this required bringing together a wide range of disparate goals, objectives, and vocabularies. “You need to be really good at finding a shared language,” Brooks says. Brooks began introducing VA staffers to new terminology like  “journey map,” which describes a graphic that helps employees understand what veterans might be experiencing and how the agency can help. It took a little while for VA staff to catch on—“this is a service design 101 tool but it’s very new to VA,” she says—but eventually it became common parlance. VA Veterans Experience Team Be Patient It takes time for effective design to work its way into people’s lives. And when it does, the outcome isn’t always obvious. “Working in the social space is not glamorous and it takes time,”says Mariana Amatullo, co-founder of Designmatters, a program that focuses on design and social innovation at ArtCenter College of Design. “Some of the work I’ve been part of, I haven’t seen results, in terms of community impact, for two, three, five years after a campaign might have been designed or a product proposed.” Years ago, Amatullo worked with the University of Southern California to reduce cervical cancer rates among Latinas. The problem wasn’t money or access to healthcare, but communication—women didn’t know when to get tested. Designmatters created Es Tiempo, an campaign encouraging women to get annual checkups when the Jacaranda trees common to Los Angeles bloom each spring. “It took really five years to see that campaign implemented in some of the most vulnerable communities in LA,” she says. Brooks, who came to the VA from the tech sector, says designers have to adjust to the slower pace when they do civic projects. “You have to think in very long time horizons,” she says. “You’re not trying to radically disrupt. Sometimes incremental change is the best thing you can do in government.” The work requires small steps, she says. But they often lead to big ripples.

While everyone believed this as being a hoax, Google quickly confirmed this as being true. Its official, Google started rolling out its latest operating system update. The news of another software update has got the whole Android community riled up. Sadly, we need to announce that not all of Google’s devices are eligible to receive this update. When Google confirmed that Android 7.1.2 Nougat beta is being rolled out, it also announced that Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 aren’t allowed to download it. The reason behind this is that both devices have reached their two year milestone and Google isn’t forced to support them anymore. Additionally, Nexus 6P isn’t also eligible to download Android 7.1.2 Nougat beta. Gladly, Google confirmed that a special build for Nexus 6P is in the works. Eligible Devices For Android 7.1.2 Nougat Beta Nexus Player; Nexus 5X; Pixel; Pixel XL; Pixel C; Worth mentioning is that while Google’s updates are always centered on providing users with innovative features, this update is focused more on fixing bugs. Google even referred to the Android 7.1.2 Nougat beta as being an incremental maintenance release. This means that Android 7.1.2 Nougat beta has been developed especially to optimize the operating system and improve the overall user experience. Obviously, this software update is still in its beta phase and things might change along the way. In case you own one of the previously mentioned devices and want to download Google’s latest update you need to know that there’s two ways to do that. The first one involves registering in Google’s Android Beta Program and receiving the update OTA (over the air). The second one appeals to the more experienced Android power users. The update can be downloaded from Google’s Android website and side loaded manually. Android users should know that even though this is a maintenance update, it’s quite large. The update weighs in at 827.9MB and this is why we advice Android users to download it through a stable Wi-Fi connection and not through data.

Android 7.0 Nougat was revealed last year first on Google’s range of smartphones, and since then, it has appeared on many different smartphones from various manufacturers like LG, HTC, Sony, Samsung, and the ilk. However, Android Nougat is different from the updates of yore -- this time around, Google took a different step. They released Nougat to developers with a public preview beta programme, which would open the door to early access for new Android versions. With Google’s very own Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones rolling out with Android 7.1 Nougat right out of the box late last year, things are starting to be interesting as new features are tacked on in Android 7.1 Nougat. The Android 7.1 beta program kicked off on October 19th, 2017, where the final roll out of Android 7.1.1 Nougat happened in early December last year. Google also did offer confirmation that Android 7.1.1 Nougat would be made available to supported handsets and tablets from December 5th onward, hitting the Pixel XL four days after that. What about the most recent version of Android Nougat? We are peering down the hole with Android 7.1.2 Nougat, with a public beta just being announced today. It would also do all of you Android device owners a world of good to know that Google has confirmed how it will be working alongside other device manufacturers in order to deliver the Android 7.1.2 Nougat update to your respective device -- as long as it qualifies for Android 7.0 Nougat, it should be good to go for Android 7.1.2 Nougat. The Android 7.0 Nougat update was released to LG G5 owners last year, while those rocking to Verizon Wireless and Sprint too, picked up the Android 7.0 Nougat update in December 2016. As for those who are using previous generation LG G Series smartphones like the LG G4 (or even the LG G3) will most probably have to be patient and ride it out for a few more months, although it is most likely that the LG G4 will pick up Android 7.0 Nougat (or even Android 7.1 Nougat) in the first half of this year. What about the LG G6? The LG G6 is supposed to be the next generation flagship smartphone from the South Korean manufacturer. It is tipped to be revealed in Barcelona this February 26th at Mobile World Congress. Chances are the LG G6 will sport a 5.7-inch QHD+ display with a USB Type-C port located at the bottom and a top mounted headphone jack. We would not be surprised to see that the LG G6 will be released with at least Android 7.1 Nougat in tow, although it would be even better news if it came with Android 7.1.2 Nougat right out of the box. The LG G6 will continue to maintain a fingerprint sensor at the back as well as its dual lens setup. Keep our fingers crossed that the camera sensors in there will be an improvement on the already impressive LG G5’s sensors, as those the LG G5 is getting old having used the LG G4’s sensor.

Devices which will enjoy the updated software are Google’s Pixel lineup, Nexus 5x, Nexus Player and Pixel C devices. In order to receive this update, users should be enrolled in the Android Beta Program. Nexus 6P owners will have to take their time as Google has announced they will update the software on it pretty soon. This update doesn’t come with a wide array of new features. Android 7.1.2 will be more of a maintenance release which will be heavily focused on refining and tweaking the software in terms of a couple of bug fixes and system optimizations. A small number of enhancements are solely made for carriers and users. Google only hinted these slight modifications and we will have to wait and see if the update will pack any extra features for the newest version of Android. In order to have access to this update as soon as possible, one has to enroll in the Android Beta Program and have a device which is eligible for the respective software. If you already own a device which supports the update and are already enrolled in the Android Beta Program, expect the update to Android 7.1.2 Nougat to arrive in batches in the next few days. If you haven’t just enroll in the Beta Program by heading to their website and select your eligible device for having the update downloaded. Within the next few hours, one will receive the update over-the-air on the Android tablet or smartphone. If that does not work, one could also check for updates the old fashioned way by going to the settings menu and tapping on Check for Updates. By doing so users will be requested to download and flash the update manually. There is no official release date for the consumer-ready Android 7.1.2 Nougat version but users should note that it will be released in a couple of months if the Beta Testing proves to be successful.

Sadly, Google tends to leave a few devices behind along the way. Google’s policy states that once a device reaches the two year milestone, the Android parent isn’t required to support it anymore. The reason we are talking about this topic today is because Google recently started rolling out its latest Android 7.1.2 Nougat beta software update. While there are a bunch of devices that are eligible to receive this update, two of Google’s own are not. Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 are the devices to be left behind. This is happening because both of them have been launched back in 2014 and they passed Google’s “availability” limit. Worth mentioning is that these two Nexus devices actually reached their two year milestone last year but Google decided to still provide them with Android 7.0 Nougat. We can consider that operating system update as being Google’s parting gift. Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 owners should know that even though their devices aren’t eligible to receive Android 7.1.2 Nougat beta, Google has confirmed that its still going to continue to provide them with security updates. Being able to receive all of Google’s monthly security bulletins is rather important. Especially when taking in consideration the fact that there are many exploits and threats which manage to slip through the cracks. Additionally, Google confirmed that it’s going to keep rolling out security updates for Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 until December 2017. Regarding Google’s latest operating system update we need to announce that only users who are registered in the Android Beta Program will receive it. The software update can also be downloaded from Google’s official Android website and side loaded manually. Right now there isn’t that much information surrounding the update outside than the fact that it’s centered on optimizing the operating system. Nonetheless, because the update is still in its beta phase we can expect that things are going to change along the way. Maybe some new features will be introduced alongside all the bug fixes and software enhancements.

News Hardware Gaming Mobile Finance Reviews Deals Mobile  ⋮  Software How to Update Google Pixel and Pixel XL to Android 7.1.2 NPG05E Nougat By Rafia Shaikh Jan 31, 2017 13Shares Share Tweet Submit Google started releasing Android 7.1.2 Nougat NPG05E to Pixel and Pixel XL along with Pixel C and Nexus Player. If you are registered to Google’s beta program, you will receive the notification to regular over-the-air (OTA) updates of all milestone builds. Want to go the manual way? Here is how to update Pixel to Android 7.1.2 NPG05E. The steps will help you flash factory images on both Google Pixel and Pixel XL. Prerequisites to update Pixel and Pixel XL to Android 7.1.2 Beta Create a backup of all important data on your Pixel device. Download and install USB drivers for Pixel on your computer. Unlock Pixel bootloader. The Android SDK should be installed on your PC with ADB and Fastboot command working. Enable USB debugging option by pressing Menu > Settings > Applications. Navigate and tap on Developer Options to enable USB Debugging. Ensure that your Pixel phone carries more than 70% of charge. Steps to flash Android 7.1.2 NPG05E on Pixel, Pixel XL Required files: Download factory images for your Pixel or Pixel XL from the links shared below: Pixel Android 7.1.2 – Download Factory Image Pixel XL Android 7.1.2 – Download Factory Images Let’s now flash the latest beta beauty on your Google Pixel or Pixel XL. Connect your device using a USB cable and turn it off. Make sure that Fastboot is installed on your PC. Now, start the device in Fastboot mode: Turn on the phone while pressing and holding the Volume Up + Volume Down + Power keys until you see the Fastboot menu and the START text on top. Extract the downloaded Android 7.1.2 file on your PC. Go to _NPG05E_ folder and copy/paste all the files to your Fastboot directory (which often is the platform-tools folder inside the Android SDK directory). This step involves flashing the factory image to your Pixel device. Open the Fastboot folder where we just copied our Nougat factory files. In the address bar, type cmd and type the command written below and press enter. On Windows: Run flash-all.bat On Mac: Run flash-all.sh using Terminal Linux: Run flash-all.sh Once the script finishes running, your Pixel will reboot. First boot may take up to 5 minutes, so don’t worry if it takes your device longer than usual to boot up. Nexus 5X Gets Pixel's 'Swipe For Notifications' Fingerprint Gesture With Android 7.1.2 Let us know if you like this incremental Android 7.1.2 Beta update. Not a fan? You can always get a factory spec system image and then manually flash it to your device. Check this post for Android 7.1.1 Nougat.

If you happen to be using any device that has been enrolled in the Android Beta Program, you too, will be on the receiving end of this particular version. Android 7.1.1 Nougat will not only ensure that the cool features that can be found on the Google Pixel and Pixel XL are available to the masses, it will also be a push by Google to promote the idea of gender equality. This particular push will be achieved through the addition of new emoji which will showcase the kind of important roles that women play globally, every single day. These new emojis will have more professions to choose from, including gender counterparts for emoji that were only available for the male gender in the past. With female welders thrown into the mix this time around, not to mention female astronauts, it is going to be a fun time composing instant messages to friends and family. Not only that, Android 7.1.1 Nougat will allow one to send GIFs straight from the keyboard. This is achieved through supported apps in the vein of Google Allo, Google Messenger and Hangouts, of course. In addition, the Android 7.1.1 Nougat update will also allow one to enjoy app shortcuts straight from the home screen without any worries. You will be able to go ahead and launch actions on your favorite apps (Twitter and Google Maps will be part of the deal) through the simple act of pressing the app icon for a long time. From there, you can also engage in an existing conversation on Google Messenger right away, or to kick off a totally new conversation directly from the app icon itself. How about that for convenience? Google did announce that Android 7.1.2 Nougat will be a small sized update, although one thing that should be noted is the fact that both the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 will be left out of this particular update. This means the Android buck stops at Android 7.1.1. Nougat for the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9. If it is of any consolation, both the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 will still continue to receive security patches -- at least until November 2017 rolls around. That would be the time where you ought to make changes to your smartphone usage habit as it would signal the moment you upgrade your device to something newer if you want to remain protected against any threats or malware. After all, the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 are already a couple of years old and will be pushing three by the time the end of the year arrives. Google has a guarantee for system updates to be pushed out for two years, which means Android 7.1.1 Nougat would be the end of the road for these two devices. Perhaps it is time to take a closer look at the Pixel and Pixel XL, right?

The program pays out rewards to researchers who find bugs and vulnerabilities in Google software, including Chrome and Android. In fact, of the $3 million given out last year, $1 million each was handed out for bugs found in Android and Chrome. “The amounts we award vary, but our message to researchers does not; each one represents a sincere ‘thank you’,” said Google in a blog post. Image: Google Last year, Chrome opened up the Chrome Fuzzers Program to the public, allowing anyone to ‘fuzz test’ Chrome at scale “across thousands of cores of Google hardware”. Fuzz testing is a technique for testing software for coding errors and bugs by feeding it a huge amount of random data. The goal is to make the system crash and then figure out what caused the crash. Google also claims to have increased its presence at hacking events around the world like pwn2own and Pwnfest, which helped Google fix a number of bugs. In its blog post, Google also mentions the story of Jasminder Pal Singh, who uses the money from rewards program to fund his startup. Another story mentions Jon Sawyer, who donated all his reward money to his local Special Olympics Team.

Apple’s fall in the Brand Finance Global 500 ranking after five years at the top comes as the study claims its brand value dropped 27% to 107.1 billion US dollars over 2016, while Google’s rose by 24% to 109.5 billion US dollars. Lego has replaced Disney as the most powerful brand in the world, according to the ranking. Lego Star Wars The report said Google remained “largely unchallenged” in its core search business, with its advertising revenues up 20% in 2016. Brand Finance chief executive David Haigh said: “Apple has struggled to maintain its technological advantage. “New iterations of the iPhone have delivered diminishing returns and there are signs that the company has reached a saturation point for its brand.” Lego’s success followed licensing deals with Star Wars, Harry Potter and the Batman franchise, which would also reinforce the company’s brand strength among both children and adults “for years to come”, the report said. Meanwhile, Visa and MasterCard’s brand value grew by 81% and 58% respectively in 2016 as their core markets continued to move towards a cashless society, Brand Finance said. A Visa and a MasterCard credit card next to each other Coca-Cola and Pepsi both fell in the ranking, by 13 and 12 places respectively, as scrutiny around the marketing of sugary drinks to children gained pace. Fast food outlets McDonald’s, KFC and Domino’s Pizza continued to drop down the ranking, with their brand value falling by 9%, 27% and 16% respectively.The Global 500 five most valuable brands are: 1. Google; 2. Apple; 3. Amazon.com; 4. AT&T; 5. MicrosoftThe top five most powerful brands are: 1. Lego; 2. Google; 3. Nike; 4. Ferrari; 5.

Rohit KVN   February 1, 2017 15:53 IST Android Nougat release news: Samsung lists all Galaxy S, A series devices eligible for Google mobile OS v7.0Samsung Newsroom Last month, Samsung announced a list of Galaxy A and S series devices eligible for Android Nougat update and among them the company had listed only the Galaxy A3 and the A8 series, which left many Galaxy A5 and A7 series owners baffled. Now, an Australia-based network carrier, Opus, on its software support page, has confirmed that the company has commenced testing Android Nougat software on Galaxy A5 series. If everything goes according to plan, Opus will roll out the update soon. Also read: Android Nougat release news: See if your Samsung Galaxy S, A series devices are eligible for Google mobile OS v7.0 The announcement by Opus has puzzled many as Samsung has no plans to release Android Nougat even to 2015 series Galaxy A. So, how come 2014 series get such a preferential treatment? Opus' software support page doesn't mention which series of Galaxy A5 will get the update. If history is any indication, it will be the 2016 series. As per the treaty between Google's Android and phone-makers, like in this case Samsung, the company is obliged to provide 18 months of software support for the devices. But, Samsung is notorious for not complying with the agreement, especially when it comes to the mid-range phones.

Home Business Software Chips Mobile Internet Security Review Desktop Software Graphics cards Laptops Mobile apps Mobiles Peripherals Storage Tablets Workstations TechEye Home Business Software Chips Mobile Internet Security Review Desktop Software Graphics cards Laptops Mobile apps Mobiles Peripherals Storage Tablets Workstations Menu Android bug bounties getting huge Posted on February 1, 2017 by Nick Farrell - News, Security Google wrote more than $3 million in cheques last year in bug bounties as security experts cashed in on Android flaws. Pay outs in 2016 take Google’s total payments under its bug bounty schemes have increased dramatically 2015 it paid researchers $2 million. Last year was the first full year Android was covered by Google’s bug bounty, which earned researchers nearly a cool million for finding and reporting issues to the Android security team. That figure is significantly more than the $200,000 it paid in 2015 after launching the Android rewards programme in June. Google’s acknowledgements to individuals who’ve helped improved Android security has grown in recent years as it has expanded efforts to secure the operating system. The Android bug bounty appeared when Google started its monthly Android security bulletins, which aims to encourage handset makers to deliver patches regularly to devices and allows end-users to see what date their phones are patched to. Another million was given to researchers who reported bugs in the longer-running Chrome vulnerability rewards program. The company says its three rewards programmes attracted over 350 researchers from 59 countries, while it issued over 1,000 individual rewards with the biggest single reward being $100,000.

He makes the case for businesses to take a stand. [Photo:Flickr user 5chw4r7z] More from Creative Conversations Meet The Music Nerds Behind The Tunes You Hear At Starbucks The Secret To A Perfectly Tailored Suit? For The Black Tux, It's Machine Learning "Valley Of The Gods" Recounts The Wild Ride Of Peter Thiel's Fellows Cale Guthrie Weissman 02.01.17 5:00 AM President Trump's executive order barring citizens from seven predominantly Muslim countries from entering into the U.S. has caused a lot of pushback. Hundreds of thousands of people took to both the streets and airports to protest the order this week. Lawyers worked tirelessly to help travelers enter the country. Leaders around the world denounced the policy. The response from the business community has been mixed. While some CEOs have come out strong against the ban, others have given pat, noncommittal statements, while still others have remained noticeably silent. Laszlo Bock, Google's former HR head who left the company last July, felt an imperative to take a strong line against the ban. He took to Twitter Sunday night to call for other leaders to follow suit: I spoke with him to hear more about his thoughts on the executive order, his background as a political refugee, and what leaders should do in these strange times. What follows is a transcript of our conversation. It's been edited for space and clarity. Can you give a little bit of background about the tweets you sent, and why you sent them? It's important to speak against the kind of trend in our culture to disregard the rights of people who are just as human as any of us. As somebody who worked hard and has been fortunate to end up in a position of some authority, status, and power, it's particularly important that I and people like me use our voices. I feel I have a responsibility to say something if something is wrong. You can't stand by and watch that happen. "It's particularly important that people like me use our voices." Can you talk a little bit about your background as a Romanian refugee? My father's first memories are from 1945 in Romania, hearing on the radio that "the Americans are coming . . . the Americans are coming." Eventually the communists took over Romania. For his entire life he wanted freedom—freedom of assembly, freedom of speech, freedom to think and do what he wants, freedom of religion. All these things weren't allowed under the communist regime. In the early '70s, when I was quite young, (my brother and I) had tourist visas to go from Romania to Czechoslovakia for vacation. And instead my father and my mother took us to the border of Austria, and we snuck across the border and applied for political asylum in a refugee camp in Austria. And that refugee camp is still there, housing Syrian refugees, today. From there we applied for refugee status from the United Nations, and then came to the United States. And then both my parents started their own businesses. My brother started his own business. They employed lots of people. I went into technology, because in business school I observed that technology is an industry where there's not a premium placed on lots of experience. You don't have to have 20 or 30 years' experience to have an impact and get up to speed because the field changes so quickly. And I wanted to be part of something dynamic. Eventually I got recruited by Google to lead People Operations. Do you think that tech companies specifically have an imperative to respond to what’s happening right now? I don't think tech companies are alone in having an imperative to speak out when things are happening that are wrong and unjust.From a self-interest perspective, in the long term, it's in their interests to actually make sure there is freedom—both in terms of markets, but also in terms of how people can behave and act. Innovation and creativity come from the freedom to have lots of ideas; it comes from having people literally from all over the world bringing their best ideas to this country. In a way, one of the most insidious things that's happening is the current administration is sending a tremendous signal to the rest of the world that the best, smartest people should not come to America. John Doerr [of the Kleiner Perkins venture firm] famously said that everybody from a foreign country who gets a PhD in the U.S. should get that PhD with a green card stapled to the back of it. Today, the best, smartest, most creative people—and by the way, this is true of any job, not just for white collar jobs; the people who come here and end up as landscapers—are also people who are incredibly hard working. They take enormous risks. They come here to work hard, to have a positive impact. "The current administration is sending a tremendous signal to the rest of the world that the best, smartest people should not come to America." I think it's easy to look at the tech industry and say, ‘Well, they have a special link because they employ a lot of people who come from other countries.’ But there's a couple problems with describing it that simply. That's absolutely true for the tech industry—but the agriculture industry employs a tremendous number of immigrants; the automotive industry, financial services, employ a lot of immigrants. They all have an interest in this particular issue, as well as a lot of other political issues. Do you think there’s a double standard with tech companies being asked to respond, compared to other industries? First, credit where it's due: Howard Schultz put out a pretty bold statement to his employees, this beautiful letter that talks about how they're going to hire 10,000 refugees in the next five years. I think that that is tremendous leadership. That said, yeah there's a difference. The tech industry seems to be more vocal on this and a lot of other issues. And it's important that the tech industry be vocal about it. I can draw a parallel to roughly four or five years ago at Google, when the decision was made to start disclosing diversity numbers, and the rest of the industry followed suit. [editor's note: Google first released its diversity report in 2014; the only company of a similar size to release data earlier is Intel.] And ever since, there's progress made, but not as much as people would like—not as much as I would have liked when I was in that job. [Now] the industry gets beat up for not doing enough on diversity. "Innovation and creativity come from the freedom to have lots of ideas; it comes from having people literally from all over the world bringing their best ideas to this country." I'm impressed that the tech industry is weighing in on this issue, just like I'm impressed that Howard Shultz and Starbucks are weighing in on this issue. It's a shared issue across lots of organizations, large and small, and just like the diversity issue, when you look beneath the covers, every company has the same issues. As a company, there are clear incentives not to speak up because you don't want to get pilloried in the press. You don't want to offend whatever regulators there might be. And you draw attention to by speaking up. But the fact is, on the diversity issue, the tech industry has made slow and modest but real progress in a way that has not happened in other industries. And on the issue of immigration, the industry needs to keep pushing in that direction. "If you're a company that wants to keep the best people, the best people generally want to work for companies that do care about these kinds of issues." On the issue of immigration I expect to see the same. And it would be amazing if other industries that had exactly the same interest and perhaps even the same set of values spoke up in a similar way. And, by the way, it's what their employees want. This is driven by people in the companies saying, ‘I want to work for this kind of company.’ Another layer of self-interest is, if you're a company that wants to keep the best people—even if you don't care about immigration—the best people generally want to work for companies that do care about these kinds of issues. And they're going to end up there. So what’s next? We have this executive order, people initially responding. What do business leaders do now? I think there's a set of business leaders who have the ear of the administration or have connections and influence. And they should use that to have a positive, constructive conversation and try to end up in a more sensible, realistic place. It's important to make public statements because it sends a signal to the rest of society about what's important. And silence sends a signal about what is not important. It's important for companies to take care of their own people. And it's important for them to support efforts to advance not just what's right, but also what is in their own business interest in the long term, and in the interest of their employees. "It's important to make public statements because it sends a signal to the rest of society about what's important." They do that by [making] donations to nonprofit organizations. I know a lot of people who are attorneys who are volunteering time, doing a tremendous amount of pro bono work. There's a lot that can be done. The human beings being held at airports who legally are entitled to representation, they should be afforded representation. And for a large company, it's a rounding error if people take a day off to help with this kind of thing. It's a lot of small, incredibly meaningful ways to provide support. Anything else you think is important to mention? The one other thing is [that] obviously there's always a wide range of issues that companies care about when it comes to their relations with the government. There's trade issues, there's security issues, privacy issues. There's a lot of issues. And organizations tend to be pretty thoughtful about weighing on which issues are the most important. And they also have to walk a very careful line around serving all of their customers. And for every organization, they have customers from every political belief, every orientation, every religion. So you need to be thoughtful about focusing on your business and making sure you are in touch with all of your customers. But this question of immigration is a relatively straightforward entry point for organizations. It's a discussion that is pretty tightly tied to their businesses. There's others like trade and free speech, freedom of the press, freedom of assembly, that don't have as an immediate day-to-day impact on a business's operation, but have much more profound implications on long-term operations. Organizations should be thoughtful about when they want to weigh in on all of these issues. But sooner is generally better, because even though it's difficult for companies, it's relatively easy compared to others to weigh in on the question of immigration or work visas or refugees.

Google wins ‘right to be forgotten’ battle in Japan Posted yesterday by Jon Russell (@jonrussell) 0 SHARES Next Story MIT built a gel-based claw robot that can catch and release live fish Google has won a long-standing battle in Japan that drew parallels with Europe’s “right to be forgotten” ruling. The Japanese Supreme Court today dismissed four cases against the U.S. company seeking the removal of allegedly defamatory comments in its Google Maps service, including one high-profile case involving a medical clinic. Back in April 2015, the Chiba District Court ruled that Google must delete the comments, but the search giant appealed that decision and has now prevailed. The ruling dismisses the cases, which were troubling because the comments in question appeared to be legitimate. In the instance of the medical clinic, two comments made about the business via Google Maps seemed to document negative customer experiences. However, the clinic had sought to scrub them from the web via a defamation suit against Google. While there are similarities with Europe’s “right to be forgotten” ruling, the legal cases are not the same. The Europe’s case, the issues center around the freedom of individuals, but, in Japan, the suits against Google came a small number of plaintiffs that included both businesses and individuals. “We’re pleased that with these latest rulings, the Supreme Court has unanimously recognized, based on existing privacy and defamation laws, that any decision to delete information from search results should prioritize the public’s right to information,” Google told TechCrunch in a statement. The U.S. firm previously argued against the removals, stating that they did not violate its terms and served an important purpose for the public. “While we provide tools that allow business owners to respond to reviews, and we take down posts that violate our policies, we believe online reviews, positive and negative, are a critical tool for people to give and read direct feedback about businesses,” it said in 2015. 0 SHARES Advertisement Advertisement Crunchbase Google Founded 1998 Overview Google is a multinational corporation that is specialized in internet-related services and products.

News Business Business News The world's most valuable brands revealed The monetary value of Google’s brand rose by 24 per cent last year to $109.5bn Josie Cox Business Editor Thursday 2 February 2017 12:18 BST Click to follow The Independent Online The report deemed Amazon the third most valuable brand, at $106.4m, followed by AT&T at $87m, and Microsoft at $76.3m Brand Finance Google has snatched Apple’s title as the world’s most valuable brand, ending the iPhone maker’s five-year reign. According to a study by valuation and strategy consultancy Brand Finance, published on Wednesday, the monetary value of Google’s brand rose by 24 per cent last year to $109.5bn, propelling it to the top spot for the first time since 2011. Apple’s value fell from $145.9bn in the previous year to $107.1bn. Read more Google parent Alphabet shares fall as profit misses targets “[Google] remains largely unchallenged in its core search business, which is the mainstay of its advertising income,” Brand Finance wrote in its report. David Haigh, chief executive officer of Brand Finance, commented that Apple has recently struggled to maintain its technological advantage over rivals. “New iterations of the iPhone have delivered diminishing returns and there are signs that the company has reached a saturation point for its brand,” he said. “The Chinese market, where Apple has enjoyed a dominant market share, is becoming far more competitive with local players entering the market in a meaningful way.” Read more The top 100 brands in the world have been revealed Google overtakes Apple as most valuable global brand These are the 10 most influential brands in Britain But late Tuesday, before Brand Finance’s sturdy was published, Apple posted forecast-beating results for the most recent quarter, reclaiming the throne as the world’s top smartphone seller for the first time in five years – even beating arch rival Samsung. Alphabet, Google’s parent company, reported in January better-than-expected revenue for the most recent quarter thanks to a fast-growing cloud-computing business and booming YouTube video advertising, but profits were hit by a one-off tax payment. The study of 500 brands deemed Amazon the third most valuable, at $106.4bn, followed by AT&T at $87bn and Microsoft at $76.3bn. Facebook claimed the ninth spot in the rankings with a value of a slither under $62bn. In Wednesday’s report Brand Finance also crowned Lego the world’s most powerful brand, which is defined as one whose enterprise value is most positively impacted by the strength of its brand. The study found that much of the Danish family-owned company’s success is owed to its partnerships with the Star Wars, Harry Potter and Batman franchises. Other brands that made it into the top five “powerful” ranking included Google, Nike, Ferrari and Visa. Walt Disney, which nabbed the title of most powerful brand last year, fell to sixth place. The world’s most valuable brands 10 show all The world’s most valuable brands 1/10 1st - Google Google replaced Apple as the world’s most valuable brand, with a brand value of $109.5bn, according to Brand Finance 2/10 2nd - Apple Apple’s brand value declined from $145.9bn to $107.1bn in 2016 3/10 3rd - Amazon Amazon's brand value rose from $69.6bn to $106.4bn in 2016 4/10 4th - At&t Of the 40 telecoms brands in the ranking, AT&T in 2016 overtook Verizon as the most valuable brand rising to $87bn from $59.9bn the year before 5/10 5th - Microsoft Microsoft's brand value rose marginally from $67.3bn to $76.3bn in 2016 6/10 6th - Samsung Amazon's brand value rose from $58.6bn to $66.2bn 7/10 7th - Verizon Verizon's brand value inched up from $63.1bn to $65.9bn 8/10 8th - Walmart Walmart's brand value rose from $53.6bn to $62.5bn 9/10 9th - Facebook Facebook's brand value increased sharply from $34bn to just shy of $62bn 10/10 10th - ICBC ICBC saw its brand value rise to $47.8bn from $36.3bn. It was the most valuabe financial brand in the world in 2016 replacing Wells Fargo “This may be because its 2016 Star Wars release was a spin-off and less successful than 2015’s reboot of the main franchise, one of the highest grossing films of all time,” Brand Finance wrote in the report. The company noted, however that it “remains a hugely powerful brand and will be closely watched during 2017 when the eighth instalment of Star Wars is released and could propel the brand up the rankings again”.

Because on that day in history, Google launched Word Lens in Japanese, and schoolchildren throughout Japan slammed shut their textbooks, tossed aside their calligraphy pens, and reached for their smartphones to conquer the notoriously difficult writing system once and for all. Perhaps that’s a bit extreme, but Google’s new Google Translate add-on is no less revolutionary. Here’s how Word Lens works. Simply open the Google Translate app, hover your phone’s camera over Japanese text, and the app instantly translates the text into English on your screen. What’s more, you don’t need an internet connection for it to work. The potential applications for Word Lens are endless. Language-learners, for example, can now check their kanji recognition skills real-time, and travelers will be able to navigate the streets of Tokyo with increased ease, which is an especially timely development with the 2020 Olympics on the horizon. Combined with revamped road signs and, yes, standardized bidet controls, this will certainly make Japan one of the most tourist-friendly non-English speaking countries in the world. The only downside is that, unlike the soon-to-be-released portable translator ili, Word Lens isn’t capable of translating spoken word (or sleazy pick-up lines). For now, anyway. The speed at which translation technologies are evolving begs an important question: Will learning foreign languages one day become obsolete? Time will tell, but for now Google Word Lens is a handy tool in …continue reading      BLOG CATEGORIES BUSINESS CARS CULTURE EDUCATION FOOD SCI-TECH SOCIETY TRAVEL J-INFO Japan Weather City Guide All Japan Tours Inside Japan Tours Japan Deluxe Tours, Inc.

Using the hashtag #GooglersUnite, employees tweeted photos and videos of walkout actions around the world, including at headquarters in Mountain View, California, the Verge reported. The protest came after employees donated more than $2 million to a crisis fund that will be distributed among nonprofit groups working to support refugees. Google match employees’ donation with $2 million. "This was in direct response to the immigration action," Enzam Hossain, an employee on the Mountain View campus, told The Verge, adding that "We wanted to be a part of it, and support our colleagues who are facing it." Both Google co-founder Sergey Brin and CEO Sundar Pichai spoke to employees at Mountain View. "The fight will continue," Pichai said, according to a New York Times reporter who was on the scene. Brin told employees "it's a debate about fundamental values," according to the reporter, Daisuke Wakabayashi. The protest was organized by employees but supported by Google, sources said. Employees began organizing during the last few days using internal listservs, employees told The Verge. A source close to the protest said the keynote speaker in Mountain View was Soufi Esmaeilzadeh, an Iranian-born Canadian citizen who has lived in the United States for 15 years. Esmaeilzadeh, who works as a product manager on Google Assistant, traveled from San Francisco to Zurich as President Donald Trump's executive order banning immigration from seven Muslim-majority countries went into effect. Esmaeilzadeh contacted Google's immigration support team to ask whether she should end her trip early, the source said. She was told to wait in Zurich while the team sorted out the legal situation, out of fear that she would be deported if she attempted to return to the United States. Then a federal judge granted a stay preventing Trump's immigration order from being implemented. Google then coordinated Esmaeilzadeh's return flight, routing her through Dublin and Boston. She returned home yesterday.           LATEST STORIES (11) Syrian Army Recaptures Key Village in Damascus Province Quebec Mosque Shooting: Vigils Held Across Canada Iraqi Forces Hunt ISIL Terrorists along Mosul-Tikrit Road Syrian Army Drives ISIL Out of More Positions to Lift Siege on Deir Ezzur Airbase Homs: Syrian Army Reinvigorates Security at T4 Airbase Protestors Pour to Britain's Streets over Donlad Trump's Visa Ban, State Visit Home!

By Sarmistha Acharya February 1, 2017 09:10 GMT Google pushes Apple down to become world's most valuable brand Kimihiro Hoshino Google is now the world's most valuable brand with a value of $109bn (£87bn), replacing Apple which held sway for the last five years. According to the annual report on the world's most valuable brands – Global 500 for the year 2017 – by Brand Finance, an independent branded business valuation and strategy consultancy, Apple's brand value has fallen to 27% since early 2016 to $107bn. Google, on the other hand, remains unchallenged in its core search business, which is the primary source of its advertising income. Its ad revenues were up 20% last year. The desktop ad is comparatively more lucrative than mobile ads. Amazon is in third place, coming behind Google and Apple, with a brand value of 53%. The company is growing strongly as it continues to both reshape the retail market and capture a larger share of it. Amazon Fresh, the company's grocery service, is still limited in scale but this year it expanded operations overseas for the first time, to central and east London. Amazon said it would create 100,000 jobs in the US over the next 18 months. AT&T, Microsoft and Samsung are in fourth, fifth and sixth positions with a brand value of $87,016m, $7,265m and $66,219m respectively. Verizon, Walmart, Facebook and ICBC are a few of the bands that made it to the list of top 10 most valuable brands. Social media giant Facebook continues to climb the ranks following an 82% brand value growth, but it has been outdone by China's biggest tech brands such as Alibaba, WeChat and Tencent which have grown by 94%, 103% and 124% respectively. "There are probably 50 or 60 analysts that follow Apple," said David Haigh, the CEO of Brand Finance told the Telegraph. "Some are very bullish, some are very pessimistic. What drives our valuation is consensus. We are reflecting what the market says and the market consensus is that the prospects of future turnover are worse than they were last year or the year before," said Haigh. Along with the most valuable brands, the study also reveals the world's top 10 most powerful brands, which are awarded the top AAA+ brand rating based on Brand Finance's Brand Strength Index (BSI). According to Brand Finance, Lego is the most powerful brand in the world. Its success is primarily driven by the Lego Batman movie. In addition, its geographic expansion has also fuelled growth. Lego opened its first factory in China in 2014 and a new Asian head office in Shanghai. The second position for most powerful brands has again been grabbed by Google, with Nike coming in at third.

According to Google, Chrome for iOS was previously kept separate from the rest of the Chromium project because of the "additional complexity" required for the platform, such as the need for the browser to be built using the WebKit rendering engine. Google says the company's engineers have spent "a lot of time" over the last few years tweaking the Chrome for iOS code needed to upstream into Chromium, a process that was recently completed. Today, that upstreaming is complete, and developers can compile the iOS version of Chromium like they can for other versions of Chromium. Development speed is also faster now that all of the tests for Chrome for iOS are available to the entire Chromium community and automatically run any time that code is checked in. Designed as an alternative to Safari, Chrome for iOS is available for free to all users from the iOS App Store. [Direct Link] Chrome users won't notice any obvious changes to the browser, but the shift to open source will make it easier for Google to release new versions of Chrome for iOS.         LATEST STORIES (11) Syrian Army Recaptures Key Village in Damascus Province Quebec Mosque Shooting: Vigils Held Across Canada Iraqi Forces Hunt ISIL Terrorists along Mosul-Tikrit Road Syrian Army Drives ISIL Out of More Positions to Lift Siege on Deir Ezzur Airbase Homs: Syrian Army Reinvigorates Security at T4 Airbase Protestors Pour to Britain's Streets over Donlad Trump's Visa Ban, State Visit Home!

CLOSE Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Friday, February 3, 2017 Insider K Street Lifestyle Opinion Politics Religion Sports Voting Laws Culture Health Immigration Technology Economy Education Energy Home Technology Are Minorities Being Left Behind in the Google+ Migration? Policy Technology Are Minorities Being Left Behind in the Google+ Migration? By Jeneba Ghatt - 2:30pm July 18, 2011 11140 72 SHARE Facebook Twitter For all the talk about US Blacks and Hispanics being the most active users of Twitter and having a substantial membership on Facebook, it seems they may not be quickly migrating to and taking advantage of Google’s latest attempt at breaking into the social media sphere, the Google + project. It is still quite early in the Google+ roll out, but according to a recent analysis, membership on that site has grown 350% since it launched to members of the tech community on an invite-only basis on June 28.   Today, there are reports that over 10 million people have already joined Google +.   But scan the profile images of some of the 940,000 users  listed on the website Find People on Plus and you may notice the dearth of brown and black faces among users.  And even among those who managed to get an early invite, they are like many of the later adopters who do not necessarily “get” the new platform yet and have simply set up a basic profile and have not used it since.  Much of the buzz of the site had to do with the fact that so few people were allowed on in its earliest Beta testing stages. The curious all wanted a golden ticket. The site is used most actively now by the crowd of adventurous tech aficionados who are anxious to see Google finally get the social media thing right.  Google’s previous experiments with Buzz, Orkut, and Wave all failed to take off.   Google+ is slowly creating a new category of user addicts because it is cleaner, so far Ad-Free, and is touted as not being riddled with the same privacy concerns as Facebook, neither is it saddled with applications that litter users streams with gaming updates, for example.    Many Google+ users spend their time sharing ideas and tips on how to navigate the site.  They also lament how much better it is than Facebook in that it allows them more control over with whom they share information and interact, and how much easier it is to filter out those who they want to limit access to certain updates or photos. Who is on Google+ now? It still may be too soon to be taking a critical look at users of a 3-week old site, but since it launched, several articles have examined every aspect of the site including the fact that at one point, only 10% of its users were female.  Because more and more studies reveal that Hispanics and Blacks have higher than average mobile phone ownership and are accessing broadband through their mobile devices, it is not too presumptuous to think those groups would have been early adopters of Google+.  The “digital elite” , the interconnected web of popular bloggers, technical experts and early adopters to the newest technologies,  made up the earliest invitees.  This elite group is quite monolithic and for the most part includes middle to upper middle class professional whites and Asians.   In America anyway, most socialize in racially segregated circles so when Google allowed those on the site to invite their friends, it should come as no surprise then why the second wave of users mirrored the racial make up of the first wave.  Members of the black Technoratti who work with and associate with the general population of tech experts have a  healthy representation on Google+ now as well.  Perhaps, as they began to invite their circle of friends, they helped diversify the site. But beyond these audacious early users,  many are still skeptical about adopting yet another social media platform, and especially one that is not necessarily intuitive.   Google + requires people to categorize their network of family, friends, and colleagues into neat circles and enables users to participate in simultaneous video chat and explore articles categorized by interest. Google+ is not that intuitive as the tech savvy application development community may think.  It certainly is  not as turnkey as Facebook.  With Facebook, anyone can  pretty easily figure out the lay of the land within moments of signing up.  Not so much with Google +.   In response to some user confusion, there have been over two dozen articles published by leading tech publications and sites explaining how to navigate the site.  A killer competitor to Facebook  shouldn’t be so difficult to circumnavigate. And even then, many have already invested lots of  time cultivating a home on Facebook, building photo albums and “friending” long lost classmates and relatives.  It will take a lot to get many reluctant and less active  folks to adopt Google +.  So the question remains whether it will survive the initial rounds of early users, folks who are eager for its success and will more quickly appreciate its benefits. But then again, not all people “got” Twitter initially either.  Minorities slowly gravitated to it as well and have since taken over,  some reports say.   An Edison Research annual report on Twitter  showed that Blacks represented 25% of Twitter users, roughly twice their share of the population in general.  A Pew Research Center’s Internet & American Life Project report showed slightly lower usage statistics, but still impressive, indicating usage among blacks and Hispanics proportionate to their population at 13% and 18%, respectively. Google+  shares user demographics based on region of the country, profession, and gender but not race.   When Google opens the site to all users, we may likely see more minorities migrate over but not as quickly as one would think or some would want. Social media expert Lindsay Holmes, owner of LCH Business, a branding & marketing company, says while Google+ may be a competitor to Facebook, she doesn’t think Google+ will be Twitter killer. “People who get Twitter and use it for marketing won’t abandon it that fast because they know its utility and Google+ can’t compete,” Holmes said. ” If there is anything that will slow minorities down from adopting any new technology that would be  intimidation and once they get over that initial hurdle, they will get on.” Holmes said when people are able to realize the usability of Google+, they will join more when it becomes available to more.  “We are people that need usability and understand usability,” she added. It is quite possible then that Hispanics and Blacks, as a group, may be among the last to join the site if it indeed lasts through the long haul and becomes a viable competitor to Facebook.  They may be less likely than other groups to join the bandwagon and try a new platform.  They may remain loyal users of Twitter and Facebook as Asian and Whites, and tech savvy higher income minorities join Google+. Google+, the place to go to escape the  “ghettoization” of other social media platforms In essence, if  Google+ indeed is able to court away some of Facebook’s 750 Million users and black and brown users adopt later, we may be looking at a repeat of what happened with MySpace.  According Researcher Danah Boyd, scores of more affluent and white users abandoned MySpace for Facebook partly because there was an impression that it had become too “ghetto” and used by blacks and Hispanics.     She discussed this issue back in 2007 in a controversial chapter of a forthcoming book addressing “digital” white flight, the Digital Race Anthology. In White Flight in Networked Publics?  How Race and Class Shaped American Teen Engagement with MySpace and  Facebook, the Microsoft Research and Harvard Berkman Center for Internet and Society scholar conducted ethnographic research and used anecdotal conversations with over 100 youth to conclude there was a “white flight” from MySpace because it had become too brown. Currently, Blacks and Hispanics still have a predominant presence on MySpace and are represented on that site at a disproportionate rate at 26% and 45%, respectively, when they are 12% and 16% in the population as a whole.  Some have speculated, though not gone on record saying, that Rupert Murdoch sold off MySpace, which was once valued at $12 billion for a mere $35 million because he saw no value in a tool being used primarily by minorities and poor whites.  Some critics of Murdoch say MySpace went down hill after Murdoch’s Newscorp acquired the once popular site, first used by nascent bands and performing groups to promote their albums and songs.  He failed to sufficiently invest in it to make it competitive to new sites – Facebook launched one year after MySpace- and then quickly abandoned it when its cream users stopped using it.  A more plausible explanation may be that NewsCorp simply wanted to free up some cash to acquire a majority stake in UK’s Sky Broadcasting, that MySpace was too prone to viruses, hackers and spam than Facebook or because Facebook was simply more attractive options for users.  But those who stayed, did so by choice.  As one blogger on the Project Economic Refugee pointed out, what Latinos loved about MySpace was the freedom to be creative, everything Facebook isn’t and why they did not join it when everyone else was. Facebook  is used widely by all races these days as is Twitter. But as mentioned,  recent reports indicate higher than average Twitter use among Blacks and Hispanics and data indicate this may because they are more likely using their mobile devices to access social media than whites. According to a new report by the Pew Research Center’s Internet & American LIfe Project, 44% of African Americans and Hispanics say they own a smartphone, compared to just 30% of non-Hispanic whites. Using this type of data as a guide, several bloggers and tech watchers have pondered whether Black and Hispanics use of mobile devices will enable them to leapfrog over other groups and help them bridge the digital divide. While idealistic and hopeful, that outcome would hardly be realized so long as Blacks and Hispanics are slow to navigate to new services. Are minorities positioned to be left behind? Since Google+ was rolled out, a benefit of being an early adopter is being able to access and be visible to some of the top players in the digital, programming and application world.  Those who are followed by millions on Twitter, are only being “followed” by hundreds or thousands on Google+.  When followers pose a query as a follow up to a post by a more popular user, they are more likely to get a direct answer.  There is interaction. Right now is the peak and prime time to get on, start exploring, learn from and exchange with leaders in your field you may not ordinarily have easy access to on other platforms.  Once the site is opened to millions that accessibility will dissipate most likely. Many of the current inhabitants are dreading the inevitable.  When news broke this week that Google plans to soon open up the social media tool to everyone, some Google+ users let out a collective sigh. “There goes the neighborhood,” one person commented on the stream of noted Tech writer Mike Elgan. Another added, “As soon as Google+ is open, the quality will drop.” These retorts show that Google+ perhaps , for a few, is a place to escape the not so pleasant aspects of Twitter, including users who in the past have been said to be degrading the medium by using it to create and discuss crass, misogynistic, racist and even violent trending topics.  While some users may want to be exclusionary, Google can’t afford to shun anyone if it truly plans to put a dent into Facebook’s 750 Million user database. It will have to be inclusive of broad demographics, encourage them to navigate over and make it useful and easy for them to stay and set up shop in a similar fashion as the earliest adopters. When the site is eventually opened who is to say even whether minority groups and younger users will wander over and join immediately?  It may not matter. Google+ may bolt out the starting gate, gain momentum and slowly die out just like other social media sites that have tried to rival and best Facebook.   Only time will tell.

Many promising design trends are bound to erupt in 2017. Last year I covered the top 2016 design trends and we’ve seen a lot of changes since then. So, for this post I’ve picked the top 20 trends that I’ve noticed gaining traction in 2017. These design trends can apply to any website, so keep your eyes out for these techniques as we move through 2017 and beyond. 20 Hottest Trends That Will Shape Web Design Come 2016 20 Hottest Trends That Will Shape Web Design Come 2016 As time inches forward with each passing year, many new design trends loom on the horizon. The field…Read more 1. “Featured in” badges Startups, blogs, SaaS projects and even small businesses are now using the “as featured in” badges on their websites. These badges often link to articles on mainstream blogs such as HuffPo, Forbes, CNN, Fox, and other news outlets. The goal is to validate a website and build trust with new visitors. It’s easier for someone to trust a website when they can see that it’s been mentioned in authoritative publications. In fact many top blogs appreciate the exposure, so it really helps everyone involved. These big sites often release their logos online but you can also find transparent PNGs or SVGs just by googling around. Also it’s recommended that you link back to the original article mentioning your site. This proves that you were really mentioned on the site, and you’re not just making up claims. 2. Bold all-caps nav links I’ve seen dozens of sleek navigation menus all relying on this same design. These nav links vary in font and size but they usually have similar features, such as: All caps Bolded Evenly spaced Aligned to the right corner The homepage of Zazzle is a great example. But you can find this on many startup websites because it’s a clean way to share links that are easy to read and easy to browse. I mostly associate this trend with businesses and tech startups but it can be prevalent on blogs too. Make note of the next time you see this trend because it’s everywhere. And I expect it to keep growing well into 2017. 3. Magazine-style blogs Blogging was such a niche concept back in the early 2000s. If you ran a blog in 2003 it was considered a cute little hobby. In just over a decade that trend has radically changed. Now blogs can provide a full-time income, and they’re starting to look a lot more like digital magazines. Look back at the original design of TechCrunch when it first launched in 2006. Looks like a generic WordPress blog right? Now look at the current homepage of Techcrunch in 2017: It not only looks like a magazine, it also functions like one. TechCrunch publishes dozens (if not hundreds) of new posts every single day. They’re the #1 go-to source for startup news. The magazine-style design trends make a big difference. The homepage uses a big featured story section, each post has its own thumbnail, and the article pages center around the headline. When you think about it, TechCrunch hasn’t changed much. It’s still “just a blog”. But it’s designed and managed like a magazine, and this makes all the difference. Recommended Reading:Creating and Running a Profitable Online Magazine 4. Video backgrounds Autoplaying sound is perhaps the most annoying trend on the web. But surprisingly, autoplaying video (without sound) is a rapidly growing trend. You can spot this on dozens of business sites where a video background takes over the entire screen. I really like this technique when it’s applied properly. As long as the video relates to the site and doesn’t obstruct content, I think it’s a cool effect to use in your header. 5. Ghost buttons As minimalism feeds further into web design, many new trends are emerging. One such trend is the rise of ghost buttons which don’t have an inner fill but do have an outer border. Most of the time these buttons contrast with others to draw attention. You can see this on the homepage of Instantmojo with the green signup button located right beside the ghost button linking to a live demo. Other sites have adopted a purely-ghost design style to their buttons sitewide. A great example here is the new Bootstrap layout. I think ghost buttons work on sites that lean towards minimalism. They may not be a great fit for every website, but I do see their use increasing with each passing year. 6. Modal window opt-ins Modal windows are super annoying, and I can’t imagine any user would like them. However they are proven to increase signups, and marketers cannot ignore techniques that work. This is why I think modal opt-in windows will continue to climb in 2017. They’re not my favorite thing, and I never add them to my websites. But if the goal is to increase signups then modal windows are a surefire way to get things rolling. New plugins can even target exit intent which triggers a modal whenever the user attempts to leave the site. Other modals appear after x seconds or are set to open when the user scrolls down far enough. Regardless of how modals are triggered, how they’re designed, or how you feel about them, I think they’ll be around for the long haul. 7. Illustration & vector art With new vector design programs such as Sketch and Affinity Designer, there’s a new wave of illustrators breaking onto the web. Graphic design and interface design are constantly merging with more multidisciplinary designers now than ever before. This means we’ll be seeing a lot more custom icons and full-page illustrations in the near future. Many illustrators are practiced artists so I think we’ll see more full page backgrounds made with digital painting software, rendered in detail like concept art. 8. Fixed scrolling sidebars The first wave of fixed design focused on navigation bars. These are all too common especially in responsive designs where the fixed navbar replicates the feeling of a native mobile application. But in 2017, I expect to see one more sticky element—the sticky sidebar. Almost every major blog uses this kind of sticky sidebar. It keeps content in view at all times and increases the likelihood that users will interact with sidebar content. Plus with dozens of free jQuery plugins that can replicate the sticky sidebar effect. It’s easier than ever to set this up on any website. 9. In-page table of contents A recent case study found that longform content outperforms shortform in both rankings and quality of user retention. Granted this isn’t always true because some queries can be answered quickly. But with far more longform content on the web, it’s natural to see more tables of contents added into articles. You’ll see this on lengthy review sites or in articles that break down into listed items. Adding a table of contents can improve the user experience and help to break up the reading into smaller chunks. Table of contents can also help your site rank better! If Google finds your page valuable you might get jump links in the search results. It may be true that ToCs are fairly scarce right now. But I expect this trend to blow up over 2017 and many years after. 10. Bright colorful designs I’m not sure if this trend emerged out of minimalism or as a reaction to Google’s material design. But I’ve stumbled onto dozens of websites that use bright pastel colors mixed with other vibrant hues to create a very fanciful appearance. The Rentberry homepage is a great example which also uses tons of gradients. And it even has the aforementioned “Featured in” badges located underneath! Two trends on one site. You’ll notice that the colors don’t permeate the entire page, and they are muted with other shades of white & gray. I’ve seen enough of these vibrant color schemes to believe they’re on the rise.

However that’s not what I meant with the title “scroll animations”. I’ve seen many sites that now animate content into view when you scroll past a certain section of the page. This trend is mostly confined to startup homepages & SaaS companies that want some pizzazz in their design. I can’t say if it’s a particularly useful trend. It certainly does grab the eye but I don’t think it offers much beyond aesthetics. Still, it’s a trend that seems to be spreading fast, and when used sparingly it can be really neat. 12. Single-page apps (SPAs) Single-page applications are websites built purely with Ajax calls. JavaScript pulls content from a server and loads it dynamically, so the page never refreshes. Common examples are sites like Gmail and Facebook. But with more JS technology, I’m noticing more & more SPAs developed all the time. Heck, even CodePen could be considered an SPA. With powerful frontend libraries such as React & Aurelia, it’s gonna be even easier to create an SPA from scratch in 2017. Recommended Reading:Understanding Synchronous and Asynchronous JavaScript 13. Toggleable search bars It used to be that search fields were always in view somewhere on a webpage, either in the sidebar or the navigation. But lately I’ve noticed a lot more search fields that get hidden by default, and must be toggled into view. Certainly a handy trend to save space on the page while still keeping the search feature accessible. If you’re unsure of where to place a search form in a new design you might consider using a toggle field linked to a magnifying glass icon in the navigation. 14. Adblock messages There’s no denying the fact that ad blocking is on the rise. The only question is how publishers will handle this trend. Some sites politely add messages into the ad spaces like Time.com. On Hongkiat, you’ll notice internal ads to fill the void that link further into the site. One serious trend that I see increasing is adblock content blocks. This is a technique to “block the ad blockers”. This feature is already in place on many large sites such as Business Insider and Forbes. Unfortunately, this hurts both the user and the publisher, and it all stems from poor-quality advertising techniques. Ultimately, it doesn’t matter who you blame or where you stand in the ad blocking debate. More people are installing adblock plugins, and I’m expecting more publishers to push back. Recommended Reading:Detecting Ads Blocker with jQuery 15. Pure SVG icons SVG graphics have already seeped into the web but they’re growing larger by the day. And I have a feeling that 2017 will be a huge year for SVGs on the web. You can find thousands of free SVG icon sets on sites like Flaticon if you know how to search. But you can also code SVGs into HTML, for example by making use of this example on CodePen. So, designers have a way to use SVGs, and developers have a way to use SVGs as well. Modern browser support looks good across the board, so there no problem with compatibility. All that’s needed is enough designers to recognize the power of SVGs and start using them! Recommended Reading:Styling Scalable Vector Graphic (SVG) with CSS 16. Adobe XD Adobe put out a full beta of Adobe XD in 2016, and it has since grown rapidly. It currently supports both Mac & Windows, and it’s in the testing phase before being fully rolled out. You may scoff at the idea of any program overtaking Sketch but Adobe is the main software company of creative work for a reason. Plus Sketch is still Mac-only while Adobe is looking to support everyone. I firmly believe we’ll be reading a lot more about Adobe XD in the coming year. It may become the go-to software for designing UI mockups—so we can finally use Photoshop as a photo manipulation tool (as intended). With the rise of new software, comes dozens of tutorials and freebie GUI kits as well. You can find lots of Adobe XD freebies in Dribbble along with two new XD-focused freebie sites Designmine and XD Guru. 17. More hamburger menus Love it or hate it, the hamburger is here to stay. There are plenty of usability studies that argue against menus hidden from view. But with a small screen and only so many alternatives, there isn’t any better alternative for now. Hamburger icons are slowly becoming recognizable symbols for nav menus. Just like a magnifying glass icon implies “search”, the three-bar hamburger icon will soon be synonymous with “menu”. This is already true for most tech-savvy individuals. But with each passing year, more people get smartphones and start browsing the mobile web. And they’re learning to associate that hamburger with a nav menu with no end in sight. Recommended Reading:20 Yummy Hamburger Menu Animations 18. Product feature icons I wrote about this trend on Treehouse but haven’t mentioned it recently. And going into 2017 this trend is gonna be huge. It’s probably the most common way to share product features on a homepage. You start by making a list of features for your product. The product can be anything from a SaaS program to a WordPress theme or even a physical item. Then you can either design custom icons or find an icon set to represent these features. It’s best to avoid generic features such as “reliable” or “fast” because most people expect this stuff. Instead, list features that actually matter. If it’s a premium WP theme maybe list that it’s responsive, how many widgets it comes with, or how the menu works. These feature icons work like visuals to help sell each feature. Text alone is difficult to consume but visuals are much easier to understand at a glance. 19. Above-the-fold CTAs Call-to-actions have traditionally been placed all over a website. But with visitors spending less time on websites, it’s crucial to have a strong CTA right above the fold. These call-to-actions might be buttons, opt-in forms, or other inputs to drive people to take some action such as signing up or reading a blog post. I can’t tell you how to design a CTA or how to optimize it for conversions. But I can say the trend seems to be placing these CTAs above the fold and in clear view for all visitors to see. 20. Smaller content areas Monitors have grown so large that most websites have to set a max width. It’s much harder to read sentences when they’re 2000px wide compared to only 700px wide. Smaller content is easier to consume, and ultimately creates a better experience on content-heavy websites. I think more designers are realizing this, and will slowly reduce the size of their content areas. I prefer a maximum width of 750px but you could go as small as 600px or less. Shorter paragraphs with fewer sentences and smaller content areas will always increase readability. Major publications such as the NY Times may deviate with their own structural guidelines. But for a simple blog or business site, the trend is moving towards lengthier content with smaller paragraphs & content areas. Wrapping up There are many other trends I wasn’t able to cover in this post, but I think these 20 are the most interesting. As we move forward into 2017, it should be apparent which trends are exploding and which ones aren’t.

Apple’s fall in the Brand Finance Global 500 ranking after five years at the top comes as the study claims its brand value dropped 27% to $107.1bn over 2016, while Google’s rose by 24% to $109.5bn. Lego has replaced Disney as the most powerful brand in the world, according to the ranking. The report said Google remained “largely unchallenged” in its core search business, with its advertising revenues up 20% in 2016. Brand Finance chief executive David Haigh said: “Apple has struggled to maintain its technological advantage. “New iterations of the iPhone have delivered diminishing returns and there are signs that the company has reached a saturation point for its brand.” Lego’s success followed licensing deals with Star Wars, Harry Potter and the Batman franchise, which would also reinforce the company’s brand strength among both children and adults “for years to come”, the report said. Meanwhile, Visa and MasterCard’s brand value grew by 81% and 58% respectively in 2016 as their core markets continued to move towards a cashless society, Brand Finance said. Coca-Cola and Pepsi both fell in the ranking, by 13 and 12 places respectively, as scrutiny around the marketing of sugary drinks to children gained pace. Fast food outlets McDonald’s, KFC and Domino’s Pizza continued to drop down the ranking, with their brand value falling by 9%, 27% and 16% respectively. The Global 500 five most valuable brands are: :: 1. Google :: 2. Apple :: 3. Amazon.com :: 4. AT&T :: 5. Microsoft The top five most powerful brands are: :: 1. Lego :: 2. Google :: 3. Nike :: 4.

As the version number indicates, there won't be any new front-facing features; instead, it will focus on "refinements", including "a number of bugfixes [sic] and optimizations". There are a few things to be aware of before installing this build. Here are some general advisories: This public beta release may have various stability, battery, or performance issues on supported devices. Some apps may not function as expected on this public beta release. This includes Google’s apps as well as other apps. This public beta release is Compatibility Test Suite (CTS) approved on supported devices. Apps that depend on CTS approved builds should work normally on these devices (Android Pay, for example). This public beta release is available on these supported devices: Pixel and Pixel XL, Nexus Player, and Pixel C. Google told us that the 6P will be supported at a later date. As for the 5X, it was listed as supported in the blog post, but not in the release notes. The company told us that it should be supported now, but we'll update this article if anything changes. Here are the known issues: General On Pixel C devices, Quick Settings may not be visible in some cases. Pixel launcher may crash when trying to search apps while a physical keyboard is connected. Occasional UI hangs Wi-Fi stability issues Setup wizard Black screen during transition from boot animation to Setup wizard. Wi-Fi is turned off after completing Setup, even if user has chosen to set up the device using mobile data. SMS messages may not be restored during device-to-device transfer. Unfortunately, there's also some bad news. In a statement to Neowin, Google has confirmed that the Nexus 6 and Nexus 9 will not receive this update; however, both devices will continue to receive security updates for the time being. This shouldn't be surprising news to anyone, as Google only guaranteed updates through October, 2016 for both devices. If you want to enroll your device in the Android Beta Program, you can do so right here. Google says that it's planning to have a final release of Android 7.1.2 Nougat in "just a couple months", and it will be available for the Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel C, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, and Nexus Player.

(STC), the kingdom’s biggest operator, is the Arab world’s most valuable brand, while Emirates, the world’s largest airline, continues to be most valuable brand in the United Arab Emirates (UAE), according to Brand Finance’s Global 500. Print this article The Global 500, an annual ranking from the leading valuation and strategy consultancy, ranks brands by monetary value and also calculates the most “powerful” brands, as defined by the companies whose enterprise value is most positively impacted by the strength of their brand. In order to determine a brand’s value, Brand Finance first evaluates factors such as marketing investment, familiarity, loyalty, staff satisfaction and corporate reputation to determine the ‘strength’ or ‘power’ of a brand. Brand power determines the proportion of overall business revenue that is contributed by a brand. The Middle East STC of Saudi Arabia moved up to 252nd place in the rankings, making it the Middle East’s most valuable brand. The company’s brand value rose 11 per cent during 2016 to $6.2 billion. The increase was primarily driven by STC ‘humanising’ its marketing campaigns, and reengaging with its stakeholders with a fresh, more personable outlook. Despite an oil slump, the strengthened US dollar and global economic softening that has impacted consumer appetite for air travel globally, Emirates secured 264th place in the rankings with a brand value of $6.1 billion. The company’s Brand Strength Index score even increased from 85 out of 100 in 2016 to 87 out of 100 in 2017, securing it a AAA rating once again. Brand Strength Index is the part of Brand Finance’s assessment, designed to calculate the underlying strength of a brand. It includes an analysis of marketing investment, brand equity (the goodwill accumulated with customers, staff and other stakeholders) and finally the impact of those on business performance. Etisalat, the biggest of two telecom providers in the UAE, rose to 293rd place, up from 404th place in 2016. The company’s brand value increased 45 per cent on last year to $5.5 billion. The rise in value was on the back of growing user numbers, innovation (i.e. Etisalat was the first Middle Eastern brand to trial 5G) and strong profit results in 2016. Qatar National Bank, Qatar’s largest bank by assets, entered the survey for the first time securing 441th place with a brand value of $3.8 billion. The company’s brand value rose 56 per cent year-on-year driven by its continued robust financial performance and its successful international expansion. Qatar National Bank now operates in more than 30 countries across three continents. Andrew Campbell, Managing Director of Brand Finance Middle East, said: “Middle Eastern brands continue to make their mark in the Global 500. The brand value of the four companies from the region represented in our 2017 ranking grew on average by 23 per cent year-on-year, which reflects the scale of their achievements when it comes to driving brand awareness, recognition and advocacy. We expect more brands from the Middle East to enter our Global 500 in time as oil prices readjust and companies from the region continue to expand into new geographic markets.”   Most valuable global brands Google replaced Apple as the world’s most valuable brand, with a brand value of $109.5 billion. Google’s brand value rose during 2016 by 24 per cent (from $88.2 billion) whilst Apple’s declined from $145.9 billion to $107.1 billion. Google last occupied the position of the world’s most valuable brand in 2011. The company remains largely unchallenged in its core search business, which is the mainstay of its advertising income. Advertising revenues were up 20 per cent in 2016 as budgets are increasingly directed online and Google finds more lucrative revenue streams from digital consumers. Andrew Campbell, continued: “Apple has struggled to maintain its technological advantage. New iterations of the iPhone have delivered diminishing returns and there are signs that the company has reached a saturation point for its brand. The Chinese market, where Apple has enjoyed a dominant market share, is becoming far more competitive with local players entering the market in a meaningful way. Samsung has also been successful in taking market share and financial analysts are projecting declining revenues and margins.” Brand power Lego (196) has regained its status as the world’s most powerful brand, with a brand strength score of 92.7. Much of it success owes to its media licencing deals and partnerships which have driven growth and introduced the likes of Lego Star Wars, Lego Harry Potter and Lego Batman. The Lego Batman Movie will premiere in February with further movies planned for the franchise. This will contribute significantly to Lego’s already significant licencing income but, as importantly, the exposure – to both children and adults - will reinforce Lego’s brand strength for years to come. Google (1), Nike (28), Ferrari (258) and Visa (57) complete the rest of the top 5 most powerful brands in the world, with the latter seeing an eight percentage point gain in brand strength – the most of any company in the top 10. Andrew Campbell, added: “A powerful brand can protect a company’s value during turbulent market conditions or challenging times for a business. The share price resilience of Samsung and Wells Fargo, after a difficult year, is testimony to how a brand can help a company ride out a storm. This is why a brand is such an important intangible asset and should be valued as such. Particularly during M&A scenarios, the fact that brand values are not factored into company accounts can mitigate against fair value being paid. Sellers ought to recognise the full worth of their brand, whilst buyers ought to factor in how far the asset of a brand can be stretched and monetised.” Sector insights Financial services Financial services companies comprise 20 per cent of the Global 500 and, this year, China has been the big winner. Growth in brand value in China can broadly be attributed to the growth of the Chinese middle class and its maturing consumer economy. The brand value of Wells Fargo (13) fell six per cent after a turbulent year for the brand and was replaced as the most valuable financial brand in the world by ICBC (10). However, it only fell three places on the overall ranking of most valuable brands, remaining the US’s most valuable banking brand, due to its deep roots across the country and its market share. Payment service providers Visa (57) and Mastercard’s (110) brand value grew by 81 per cent and 58 per cent respectively in 2016, as their core markets continued to move towards a cashless society and become increasingly reliant on the two companies’ services. Media Walt Disney (24) fell from the position of the world’s most powerful brand to number 6 in the power rankings. This may be because its 2016 Star Wars release was a spin-off and less successful than 2015’s reboot of the main franchise, one of the highest grossing films of all time. Furthermore, Disney’s biggest films of 2016 are all associated with sub-brands rather than Disney itself – Star Wars: Rogue One (Lucasfilm), Finding Dory (Pixar), Captain America Civil War (Marvel). Disney remains a hugely powerful brand and will be closely watched during 2017 when the eighth instalment of Star Wars is released and could propel the brand up the rankings again. Telecoms Of the 40 telecoms brands in the Global 500, AT&T (4) overtook Verizon (7) as the most valuable brand. Its geographical and acquisitive growth in South America and Mexico has been rewarded with continued growth in brand value and an increase in market share in the respective regions. Spectrum (83) is the highest new entrant of the Global 500. The brand created by Charter Communications which describes itself as the fastest growing TV, internet and voice provider, counts the acquisition with Time Warner Cable and Bright House Networks under its name. Non-alcoholic drinks The behemoths of the non-alcoholic drinks industry, Coca-Cola (27) and Pepsi (67) have fallen by 13 and 12 places respectively as they continue to struggle against the trend towards healthier alternatives and greater scrutiny around marketing sugary drinks to children. Sprite (388) was the only of company in this category to grow its brand value over the past year (from $3.8 billion to $4.4 billion). Brands offering energy drinks, appear to be protected as Red Bull (227) and Gatorade (372) continue to increase their brand strength rating (by one and three index points respectively) with their marketing efforts continuing to focus on extreme sports and performance athletes. Restaurants The global fast food outlets McDonald’s (16), KFC (257) and Domino’s Pizza (427) continue to drop down the rankings in the world’s most valuable brands, with heavy competition in an increasingly fragmented market with healthier challenger brands offering greater choice for consumers. McDonald’s has fallen by 4 places in the rankings with its brand value decreasing by 9 per cent, while KFC and Domino’s Pizza declined by 27 per cent and 16 per cent respectively. The largest improvement within the sector, with a 45 per cent increase in its brand value, came from Tim Horton’s (192), the fast food restaurant based in Canada, known for its coffee and doughnuts. Parent company, Restaurant Brands international, which also owns Burger King (329), has announced plans for expansion abroad with the Philippines and the UK tipped to be targets. Aerospace & Defence Boeing (78) and Lockheed Martin (193) were big gainers in brand value in 2016, rising by 17 per cent and 32 per cent respectively, while Northrop Grumman was a new entrant to the Global 500 at 418. In an increasingly uncertain world and with a newly elected President committed to military spending, American defence and aerospace companies have benefitted. Conversely, Airbus (153) has been a big loser within the category. Its fall in brand value of 10 per cent can be linked to the poor reception of its latest model, the Airbus A380, the company’s failure to meet some orders and reductions in staff.

It was first rumored to run Chrome OS, to succeed the Chromebook Pixel. In the end, it launched with Android Marshmallow 6.0.1 back in December of 2015. The Pixel C is just over a year old at this point, and it appears Google has stopped stocking an entry-level model with 32GB of storage. At this time, only the 64GB version of the Android tablet remains for sale from Google for $599, that raises the entry-level price by $100 from $499. As the Pixel C reaches this far in its life-cycle, theres no knowing if Google plans to launch a successor in the future. But given that the Google Pixel phones have been selling generally well, perhaps Google should consider a Pixel-branded tablet lineup that rivals the iPad, then again, the tablet market has been on a slow but steady decline in sales with cheaper windows 2-in-1 PCs rivaling tablet sales.

Google has finally opened the code for Chrome on iOS. Up till now, Google had to keep the Chrome for iOS and the Chromium project separate which would often result in the delay in development. If you are not aware, Apple requires all browsers to build on WebKit instead of their own respective engines. As of now, the rendering engine for Chrome on other platforms is Blink which made it a complex process for developers to work on Chrome for iOS.   As Google has opened up the source code, developers can now dive in to built on the iOS version of the app and it also opens up the ability to look for possible loopholes as well. In other words, now users can dig in and look for all the vulnerabilities and bugs in the iOS version of the app. Further, the development going on with the iOS Chrome app will be much faster and we are expected to see more relevant updates in less time.   Also See Budget 2017: live updates   “Due to constraints of the iOS platform, all browsers must be built on top of the WebKit rendering engine. For Chromium, this means supporting both WebKit as well as Blink, Chrome's rendering engine for other platforms. That created some extra complexities which we wanted to avoid placing in the Chromium code base.” - read the Chromium blog post.   Just last week, Google rolled out Chrome 56 for the web which brings in a bunch of interesting enhancements to the browser platform. Chrome v56 makes HTML5 default for all the users, hence, blocking the Flash (Adobe Flash) content automatically. Moreover, the new version now also bumps up the security level with the browser displaying clear warnings when a website seeks a password or credit card information over a non-HTTPS unsecured connection.     Chrome Chrome OS iOS Apple Chromium project Google Chrome Google Apple iOS First Published : Wednesday, February 01, 2017 - 12:52 Similar News Android 7.1.2 beta brings Swipe for Notifications feature on Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P Google rolls out Android 7.1.2 beta for select Google devices Google rolls out Chrome 56 with HTML5 and blocks Adobe Flash Google Pixel 2 to come with improved camera, faster processor; cheaper model in works as well Android Wear 2.0 along with two LG smartwatches to be unveiled on February 9 Google Pixel 2 image renders leaked?

It happens, regularly. You may not know why exactly. It looks like an algorithm may have done it — and now you need to reach a human being at the company to get back on. NPR has interviewed more than two dozen users in that situation — all people who rely on Facebook to do their work, make their living. Their stories, which we'll share in a separate article, made us wonder: If you needed to reach Facebook, what would you do? Many people would go online and search for "Facebook customer service." We tried that, and got this number: 844-735-4595. It was prominently displayed as the top search result on Google. Google even made it a "featured snippet" — that is, a result highlighted in a box at the top, enhanced to draw user attention and lend credibility. Enlarge this image Until recently, a phone number at the top of Google search for "Facebook customer service" led callers to a scam, NPR has found. Google/Screenshot by NPR hide caption toggle caption Google/Screenshot by NPR Until recently, a phone number at the top of Google search for "Facebook customer service" led callers to a scam, NPR has found. Google/Screenshot by NPR Please do not call it. You will get someone real — just not from Facebook. The first time NPR called, someone picked up and then put the phone down — maybe on a table. You could hear mumbling in the room. It felt suspicious. So NPR gave the number to Pindrop, a company that specializes in phone fraud. A Pindrop researcher, who has to remain anonymous for his work, called up and recorded as he pretended to be a Facebook user in distress. A Pindrop Researcher Calls A Fake Facebook Customer Service Number 7:15 Toggle more options Embed Embed <iframe src="https://www.npr.org/player/embed/511824829/512000179" width="100%" height="290" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" title="NPR embedded audio player"> A call center operator named "Steven" — who, according to Pindrop analysis, is based in India — says: "Thanks for calling Facebook." He is pretending to be a Facebook employee. Article continues after sponsorship The Pindrop researcher plays along and explains he is locked out of his Facebook account. He needs help getting reactivated. "Steven" gives him very unusual advice: Go to a Wal-Mart or a Target. "Just walk up over there and tell them to provide you an iTunes card. OK? And on the backside of that iTunes card there would be a 16-digit security code." All Tech Considered From Hate Speech To Fake News: The Content Crisis Facing Mark Zuckerberg Maybe you see where this is going. Steven continues: "You need to call us back on this same number and provide me that 16-digit security code so that I can activate that access and we'll be giving you the password for your new — for your old account." This is a scam. The top Google search result for "Facebook customer service" led to a person asking for codes on iTunes gift cards. This is a well-known method of stealing from innocent people online. (Both Apple and the Federal Trade Commission have issued alerts about it.) That toll-free "Facebook" line was not just on Google. That number and others have been circulating on Facebook itself, on pages where users are asking for help, for at least a year. In one instance, a user asked whether the number was valid and a member of the company's Help Team responded: "There isn't a number to contact Facebook. ... It sounds like the email or notification you saw is likely a scam." It's unclear whether the Help Team member reported it to her superiors to investigate. All Tech Considered A Real-Life Tax Scam: This Is What IRS Phone Fraud Sounds Like "Wow. Wow. Wow. That's crazy," says Marty Weintraub, founder of Aimclear Marketing. He wrote a leading industry book on Facebook advertising, long before the rest of the world realized the company would dominate the Internet economy. "This is an astonishing result." He also wrote a book on how to manipulate search results, to get your brand or product up on top. He knows that companies monitor their search results, to see what their customers want, and that criminals and competitors try to exploit powerful brands. These are standard practices. What Weintraub finds astonishing is that a term as basic as "Facebook customer service" slipped through the cracks. "It's not like somebody's searching for 'Hey, what color are Mark Zuckerberg's socks?' It's not like it's something that's off the beaten path," Weintraub says. "So one would think that a company as large as Facebook would be monitoring [the] search engine results page for a major query surrounding their services." All Tech Considered Fixing Your Online Reputation: There's An Industry For That According to Google data, "Facebook customer service" gets searched, on average, about 27,000 times a month in the U.S. Weintraub says that is sizable, that Facebook should have known about it "almost the first minute" it came up, and that the company should have guarded its users. "I'd be so scared," he says. "These are people who are looking for help with the product and they're getting scammed. OMG." NPR informed Facebook and Google about the scam line. Facebook said that it has been investigating the group associated with this toll-free number for some time; that this group is targeting many platforms; and that it's up to Google to explain why it displays certain search results. A Google spokesperson said in a statement that the company has taken steps to remove the fraudulent number. Neither company explained how the prominent search result went unnoticed. And to be clear, Facebook does not have a phone number for regular users to call. It does have an online help center, located here. (Facebook pays NPR and other leading news organizations to produce live video streams.) NPR's Aarti Shahani has started a page on Facebook for people to share concerns about the platform. It's called Tell Zuck. If you use Facebook for work, and find you're unable to reach the company, tell her your story at www.facebook.com/tellzuck. scams Facebook Facebook Twitter Google+ Email All Tech Considered Tech, Culture and Connection All Tech Considered Tech, Culture and Connection About All Tech Considered explores how technology is changing culture and connection.
