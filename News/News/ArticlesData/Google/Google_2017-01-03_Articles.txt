(CHS) Fiat Chrysler Partners With Google On Infotainment System January 2nd, 2017 - By Teri Schroder - 0 comments Filed Under: Headlines - Technology Fiat Chrysler (NYSE:FCAU) has partnered with Alphabet’s Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) to build a new in-car infotainment system. The companies announced the partnership just ahead of the beginning of CES, the annual consumer electronics show in Las Vegas. The new system is a combination of FCA’s UConnect infotainment system and Android 7.0 Nougat, released in 2016. It will be on display in a Chrysler 300 sedan at CES this week. The new infotainment system operates a range of features, including HVAC, navigation, AM/FM, media streaming, Bluetooth calling and media streaming, multi-channel audio, and digital instrument clusters. The system also supports a number of apps like Google Assistant and Maps, as well as other Android apps like Pandora and Spotify. Google wants Android integrated into every user-facing system in the car, from climate control and audio controls to the speedometer. In a press release announcing the news, Patrick Brady, Director of Android Engineering, said, “Google is committed to building Android as a turn-key automotive platform that integrates deeply with the vehicle in a safe and seamless way.” The new system is open-source, allowing automakers to customize it to their tastes. Customizability is very important, as carmakers create their infotainment user interface to be an extension of the car brand itself. With a pre-existing Android app ecosystem, carmakers may be able to save time and money developing infotainment systems on top of Android. Chris Barman, FCA’s head of electrical engineering, said in a statement, “With Android, we are able to maintain our unique and intuitive Uconnect user interface, all while integrating our easy-to-use systems with Android’s features and ecosystem of applications.” Neither FCA nor Google has announced when the platform will be available in dealer showrooms. Google’ work with FCA is different than the Android Auto model. Android Auto is an in-car software platform that brings the functionality and feel of a smartphone to the vehicle’s central screen. It’s not an operating system; it’s a layer that sits on top of the operating system. At its 2016 I/O developer conference, Google released a version of Android Auto that would run directly on a phone. Apple is also seeking to integrate its mobile products in car systems via CarPlay. However, Apple maintains way more control over the look and feel of the interface.

LG Puts Up January Security Bulletin Before Google Google in its latest Android security bulletin has two security patch level strings. The company says that this will provide Android partners with the flexibility to more quickly fix a subset of vulnerabilities that are similar across all Android devices. The partial security patch level string (2017-01-01) indicates that all issues associated with previous security patch level strings are addressed while the complete security patch level string (2017-01-05) indicates that all issues associated with 2017-01-01 and 2017-01-05 (and all previous security patch level strings) are addressed. Google says that all supported devices will receive a single OTA update with the Wednesday security patch level. In the January security patch, Google fixes total of 95 vulnerabilities in which 23 bugs are fixed with 2017-01-01 patch while 72 are fixed under 2017-01-05 patch. The security bulletin assures that OEM partners were notified about the issues on December 5, and source code patches for these issues will be released to the Android Open Source Project (AOSP) repository in the next 48 hours. Between the two patches Google has fixed over two-dozen high severity issues and 10 critical problems. Google adds, "We have had no reports of active customer exploitation or abuse of these newly reported issues."

 Samsung and Google teamed up to make two new Chromebooks that run Android apps Jeff Dunn Jan. 4, 2017, 5:00 PM 7,203 facebook linkedin twitter email print The Samsung Chromebook Plus. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn Google is ready to push Android’s presence on Chromebooks — and Samsung is making some new hardware to help. Samsung on Wednesday announced a new pair of Chrome OS machines, the Chromebook Plus and the Chromebook Pro, which Google says were designed to better accommodate Android apps from the Google Play store. What that means is they’re both convertibles, or “2-in-1s,” so their displays can flip around 360 degrees and become a sort of makeshift Android hybrid tablet. They’re also the first Chromebooks to come with the Play store pre-installed — Google has slowly rolled out Play store support to a small selection of existing Chromebooks over the past few months — and the first to come with native support for a built-in stylus.  On the spec sheet, both machines seem fairly high-end. They each have 12.3-inch displays with taller, 3:2 aspect ratios — so they can fit a little bit more of a webpage on screen — and sharp 2400 x 1600 resolutions. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn Both are nicely slim and light, measuring about a half-inch thick and just under 2.4 pounds, so it's not the most unwieldy thing in tablet mode. There’s two USB-C (but not Thunderbolt 3) ports and a microSD card slot on both, as well as an accelerometer and gyrometer, which should help the devices stay compatible with certain Android apps. Samsung rates each battery at about eight hours.  The main difference comes down to processing power. Both laptops feature 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, which is plenty for a Chromebook, but the Plus runs on an unspecified ARM chip that’s generally meant for mobile devices (likely from Rockchip) while the Pro is powered by a last-gen Intel Core m3 chip, which is mediocre for a Windows laptop, but should be more than enough to handle Chrome OS. Only the Chromebook Plus model has a set price and release frame: Samsung says it’ll cost $449 and arrive sometime in February. The Chromebook Pro is pegged to release “later this Spring,” but past leaks suggest it’ll cost $499. The included stylus, which slides into a slot on the Chromebook's side. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn For Chromebooks, these two are pretty expensive. And based on some brief hands-on time with the Chromebook Plus model, I have reasons to doubt they'll be worth the money. Google told me the software on my demo unit wasn’t finalized, so I can’t knock it for being sluggish, but the hardware itself didn’t feel as substantial as other pricey options like the Dell Chromebook 13 or HP Chromebook 13. The metal material isn't as chilly or sturdy. It certainly looks sharp, but the keyboard is on the shallow side, and the trackpad wasn’t anything special. The built-in stylus, while small, did seem to work in harmony with apps like Google Keep, but the screen wobbled noticeably whenever I wrote with it in laptop mode. On the plus side, the display looked great, and flipping the notebook into a tablet or tent mode was painless. Either way, we’ll have to test further before making a recommendation. The interesting bit here is in the software, as Google tries to overcome the quirks of having Android apps invade another OS. Unfortunately, the Chromebook Plus will only come with the beta version of the Play Store at launch. We’ve tried that before, and while it has some benefits (offline Netflix!), there's still some fundamental awkwardness, like not being able to granularly adjust window size, or certain apps not being formatted for larger screens. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn Google laid the groundwork for addressing some of those issues in the latest Android 7.0 Nougat update, but right now the Play Store you'll find on the Chromebook Plus is running on Android 6.0 Marshmallow, with an update to come in a “few months.” Samsung’s new Chromebooks are not the first convertible laptops to work with Android apps, and time will tell if they’re worth buying, but more significant is how they may mark the start of Google finally getting the Android-Chrome OS combo going after months of delays. Kan Liu, Google’s senior director of product management, says that more “larger screen, productivity-focused, Android-type devices” will be announced by various companies before the Mobile World Congress show in Barcelona next month. That would suggest that having Android apps play nicer outside of a mobile display could become more of a focal point. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn Looming over all this is Andromeda, Google's long-rumored OS that will reportedly blend Android and Chrome OS together completely. Liu couldn’t comment on that directly, but did say that Google’s general goal is eventually to get a point where people "don’t care" about what the underlying OS is on their devices. “Over time, if [Chrome OS and Android] happen to get closer and closer together — such that, from a development perspective, it’s less work to duplicate work — we’re happy to have that as well,” he said. For now, though, Samsung thinks what merger is there can be a selling point. We’ll let you know if they’re right once the Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro are available.

By Michael Havis / Published 4th January 2017 GOOGLE/GETTY SWEPT AWAY: The rogue wave struck Goolawah beach in Crescent Head, New South Wales, Australia The group, which included up to 12 children, suffered a range of injuries in the bizarre incident. Luckily, there were no fatalities among the group, who were swimming near Crescent Head in New South Wales, Australia. However 10 of them needed hospital treatment, one for a fractured arm and another for a gash to the head. GOOGLE SUN KISSED: The group were bathing in rock pools on the beach when the wave hit “That hit and we all went off in different directions” Sophie Shepherd Nine were taken to Kempsey district hospital for treatment, and one to Port Macquarie Hospital. One of the group, Sophie Shepherd, said there were three waves; the second was the worst. She said: "The first one happened and we were all good… we were like 'ok, it’s fine' "The second one was the one that hit and we all went off in different directions." Britain's killer coastlines Thursday, 25th August 2016 Great Britain is known for dangerous coastlines where waves can reach as high as 16ft, and that have taken a number of people's lives. We take a look at moments where Britain's coastlines become monstrous 1 / 12 Getty Images Winter storms hit the rocky coastline with monumental force at Land's End in Cornwall Ms Shepherd told NBN she was dragged herself from the water and called for help. Everyone else was rescued from the base of a nearby cliff by volunteers and medics. The Westpac Rescue helicopter also came to help, but no patients required air transport. The beach is located in the Goolawah National Park and was hard to reach, an ambulance spokesman said.

If so, there’s a good chance that was the right decision, as 2017 has promised to be the year of handsets like the iPhone 8, Google Pixel 2, and even a Galaxy Note 8. In fact, if you believe the rumors, it could be very hard to choose one this year. Here are the rumored smartphones we see being the top five handsets of 2017. Image source: Apple designer – YouTube iPhone 8 Even before the iPhone 7 launched in September, there were rumors about this year’s handset. Some suggested that if Apple was going just to rehash an old iPhone design with no additional features, it shouldn’t bother. Instead, critics hoped the iPhone 8 and the tenth anniversary of the original iPhone launch would spark Apple into action. If you believe the rumors, 2017 will indeed be a big year for Apple, as its next handset is expected to deliver both hardware and design changes which should make it the most advanced iPhone to date. Imagine a handset which looks like it’s made from a single sheet of glass! That’s what Jonny Ive apparently wants, and to get that, it would need an edge-to-edge OLED display. Recent leaks have supported this theory, with Apple’s suppliers already looking to produce the all-glass body. However, in creating an edge-to-edge OLED display, both the Home button and Touch ID would have to be hidden beneath it. Other rumors point towards the handset featuring wireless charging, facial recognition, an A11 Fusion CPU, and an improved camera. Additionally, some rumors suggest 2017 will be a three-iPhone year. Google Pixel 2 According to SlashGear, Google originally wanted to work with Huawei on its Pixel handsets. However, due to Google insisting that only its branding appear on the handsets, Huawei reportedly backed out, and Google turned to HTC for help finishing the design and manufacturing the devices. The process took only nine months from start to finish and was an incredible feat considering how good those handsets are. There is very little information about the Pixel 2 and Pixel XL 2 to share right now. However, with much more time on their side, it’s thought that this time around, the handsets will take on the iPhone 8, Galaxy S8, and Note 8 this year. The only information we have seen comes via micgadget, which predicts dual-camera setups and 4K features. Image Source: galaxynote7info Galaxy Note 8 Even with the Note 7’s demise, it’s possible the phablet series is not dead. Until a couple of days ago, we had only vague rumors that Samsung was going to launch a Galaxy Note 8. But now thanks to one of Samsung’s own suppliers, more meat has been put on to the bones. The supplier reportedly spoke to BusinessKorea, and it seems as though the Korean tech giant will release a no-holds-barred attack on the smartphone market in 2017 in a bid to regain consumer confidence and the business it lost with the Note 7 recall. The features expected/rumored to be making their way to the handset include: a high-definition 4K display, a much-improved AI assistant called Bixby, a 30MP rear camera, Snapdragon 830 CPU, and 6GB of RAM. There is also talk of the handset coming with dual-foldable displays. However, Samsung has been talking about this kind of display technology for years, which means we doubt that will happen. Image Source: DBS Design – YouTube.com Galaxy S8 Unlike the previously mentioned Note 8, Samsung has all but confirmed the existence of the S8. In fact, it is with this handset that many believe Samsung will mount an early challenge to the iPhone 8. As with all of the handsets featured here, the S8 is expected to get a significant facelift compared to its predecessors, with a curved Super AMOLED display expected to take up 90% of its face. If that information is correct, it will point to the handset (like the ones above) ditching the Home button and other manual buttons in favor of embedding them into its screen. Additional rumors of late have suggested that the S8 will offer many enterprise features, such as the Samsung Desktop Experience, which is similar to Microsoft’s Continuum and enables a user to connect a Windows 10 handset to a keyboard, monitor, and mouse. Bluetooth 5.0 is expected to make an appearance and offer increased range and faster transfer rates. Additionally, 8GB of RAM and Qualcomm’s SnapDragon 835 super CPU are being touted as real possibilities for the handset. Image Source: Samir Makwana/Mysmartprice.com LG G6 With the rumor mill focused on the iPhone 8 and Samsung’s handsets, there’s not much room for the LG G6. However, it could be just as capable as any of the above. LG has not confirmed the handset yet, so the information we have is based on rumors. Unlike its predecessor, the well-received LG G5, the G6 isn’t expected to be modular. It appears that the possibility of adding functionality to a handset for an additional fee did not go down well with consumers. However, from experience with this handset, we can also tell you that not many modular add-ons were ever available, so that too could have been a reason for this technology’s demise. Additionally, it appears that LG will use tempered glass for the first time, giving it a more premium feel than the all-aluminum G5. Also there could be an OLED panel, which, unlike the other manufacturers on this list, LG produces itself. It’s still unclear what size it will be, but some rumors suggest 5.3 inches and others 5.5 inches. As for the camera, LG has long been a user of dual-lens setups, and it’s thought that this will appear again on the G6.

There was a time when smartphone cameras struggled to click good photos even in bright sunlight. But in the year 2016, we saw that some smartphones were such adapt shooters for their class and size and that they were so good that they almost matched big and bulky DSLR cameras. Phoned like the Google Pixel and the iPhone 7 Plus matched serious cameras, irrespective of the lighting conditions. In fact, good cameras made it possible for most people to shoot better images compared to what they will get with complex DSLR camera. In low light, for example Pixel or the Galaxy S7, took care of the ISO settings or exposure automatically and gave images that most people may not be able to click with a regular DSLR camera and lens. Also Read: Smartphones with best camera: Google Pixel XL There are still areas where DSLR cameras lead -- I will talk about them in a while -- but overall it is easy to see that in good light, purely from usability perspective, we saw phones in 2016 that clicked images that were as good as what you could manage from a DSLR camera. There were a number of phones that proved capable shooters. But of all, the five came closest to proper cameras and these five were: Google Pixel, iPhone 7 Plus, Galaxy S7, Google Nexus 6P and OnePlus 3. Google Pixel Shot with Google PixelStarting with the Nexus 4, Google started putting special emphasis on the camera performance of the phones it was selling under its banner. But the Nexus 4 had too many inherent weaknesses so it failed on the camera front. The Nexus 5, however, was so much better. But it was inconsistent. Then in 2015 came the Nexus 5X and the Nexus 6P, two phones with huge image sensor (IMPX 377) inside them. This made them spectacular shooters when used with some care. But the software was still not up there. With the Pixel and the Pixel XL, Google largely fixes the software part too. Just like the Nexus phones of 2015, The Pixels have a large image sensor (IMX378) inside them. This gives them ability to capture more data while clicking images. This in turn makes them a superstar in low light and when it comes to capturing vibrant colours. The software features, meanwhile, mean that these phones handle the dynamic light in a fantastic way. They also get white balance right, the HDR mode is faster than it was in the Nexus phones, and the software-based image stabilisation works wonders. The Pixel phones are one of the best shooters right now in the market. Sure, they also have the same problems that afflict other smartphone cameras. But yet with good hardware -- the large sensor, a big F2.0 lens -- and good software, they are excellent cameras for street and everyday shooting. iPhone 7 Plus The iPhone 7 Plus doesn't have that big of an image sensor. But what it lacks in size, it makes up by employing certain tricks in software and hardware. This is the only phone, other than those oversized camera phones launched by Samsung and Asus, that offer optical zoom. This the iPhone 7 Plus does by giving consumers option to use a 56mm lens, which sits beside its main image sensor. Although the low light performance of this 56mm lens -- it's so close to nifty fifty that DSLR shooters love -- is not that great, in good light this lens clicks fantastic images. Then there are tricks like the portrait mode, which uses machine learning to click images with creamy bokeh aka blurred background. Shot with iPhone 7 PlusFinally, there is Apple's flawless camera software. It always gets white balance and exposure right to give images contrast colours that are absolutely top notch. Also, the good software and fast image processor inside the iPhone 7 Plus ensures that the phone clicks images quickly, with minimal shutter lag and without heating. Galaxy S7 The Galaxy S7 has an image sensor that is not as big as what you get in the Pixel, but it is also not small like the one in the iPhone 7 Plus. This sensor is combined with Samsung's good camera software and an excellent F1.7 lens. The result is that the Galaxy S7 is not only a great shooter in good light but also one of the best in low light, all thanks to its extremely bright lens. Then there is the manual mode in the phone, which helps users control some of the key areas like ISO and shutter speed for better images. Google Nexus 6P Shot with Nexus 6PAlthough Pixel is supposed to have a superior camera compared to Google's earlier phone Nexus 6P , it is not necessarily true. The two phones are quite close to each other when it comes to clicking photos. In fact, the Nexus 6P even shows stronger performance when the light is very dynamic, for example during sunset. The reason why the Nexus 6P is so good with clicking images has to do with its excellent IMX 377 sensor. The IMX 378 in the Pixel is just an iteration of this sensor. The IMX 377 has these big pixels, which help the Nexus 6P click wonderfully detailed images, even in low light. OnePlus 3 Shot with OnePlus 3The OnePlus 3 is similar to Galaxy S7. It's an all-rounder and an excellent shooter in all conditions, despite its lower price compared to the other phones here. The phone has a decent-sized sensor and a good F2.0 lens. But the magic with the OnePlus 3 happens in the software. It is a phone with one of the most accurate cameras that I have used. It gets the white balance right almost always. It gets the exposure right. It tries to preserve the detail and yet provide enough amount of pop into the images to make them look good. And in low light, it errs on the side of preserving details and getting the contrast right instead of blowing up the highlights and brightening the image unnatural, the way phones tend to do. Top class stuff this. Advantage DSLR camerasIf any DSLR camera lovers are reading this article I have a feeling that by now they must be thinking that writer here is a dolt. May be. Although, I also love to click pictures, have a DSLR camera and when I want absolute best results, I do take out that big shooter out of the bag. But of late, I have also seen that most of the time if I am using one of the phones mentioned here, they do a fine job even if the fine job is not the best job. To ensure that this article does send a wrong message, I do want to talk about the best job. If you want absolute top class photos, a nice DSLR camera along with a top quality lens is still the combination you want. There are some advantages that DSLR cameras continue to enjoy over the phones. These are: Also Read: Last hurrah for Google Nexus 5: You won't believe these photos were clicked with Nexus 5 -- If you want the best quality details in your photos, pick a DSLR camera and a nice lens. Then shoot RAW. Then edit them in an app like Lightroom or Photoshop. -- If you want the best quality dynamic light, and micro-contrast, as the photographers call it, there is no beating a DSLR camera and a good lens. This means, for photos that looks very artistic with cool light effects and breathtaking colours, you will have to shoot with a DSLR camera in RAW and then use an image editing tool. -- If you are shooting wildlife or birds, there is no beating a DSLR camera and a good quality telephoto lens. Only such combo has the reach and speed to capture a running Cheetah in frame. -- If you are clicking hyperactive kids, a speedy DSLR is your only option. The same goes for pets, unless your dog or cat is sleeping or is still. -- If you want absolutely best images in low light, there is no beating a modern DSLR camera like the Canon 5D Mark IV, which can shoot absolutely clean images even at 24000 ISO. -- If you are shooting sports, there is no beating a DSLR camera and good, sharp lens. But with all this said, it is also clear that all of these scenarios where DSLR cameras still hold advantage are niche cases. For everyday shooting, for street photography, even for clicking pictures during a travel, the iPhone 7 Plus or the Google Pixel do a mighty job, giving you photos that are pretty close to what you will get with a DSLR camera.

Google is ready to push Android’s presence on Chromebooks — and Samsung is making some new hardware to help. Samsung on Wednesday announced a new pair of Chrome OS machines, the Chromebook Plus and the Chromebook Pro, which Google says were designed to better accommodate Android apps from the Google Play store. What that means is they’re both convertibles, or “2-in-1s,” so their displays can flip around 360 degrees and become a sort of makeshift Android hybrid tablet. They’re also the first Chromebooks to come with the Play store pre-installed — Google has slowly rolled out Play store support to a small selection of existing Chromebooks over the past few months — and the first to come with native support for a built-in stylus. On the spec sheet, both machines seem fairly high-end. They each have 12.3-inch displays with taller, 3:2 aspect ratios — so they can fit a little bit more of a webpage on screen — and sharp 2400 x 1600 resolutions. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn Both are nicely slim and light, measuring a little over a half-inch thick and just under 2.4 pounds. There’s two USB-C (but not Thunderbolt 3) ports and a microSD card slot on both, as well as an accelerometer and gyrometer, which helps the device stay compatible with certain Android apps. The main difference comes down to processing power. Both laptops feature 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage, which is plenty for a Chromebook, but the Plus runs on an unspecified ARM chip that’s generally meant for mobile devices (likely from Rockchip) while the Pro is powered by a last-gen Intel Core m3 chip, which is mediocre for a Windows laptop but should be more than enough to handle Chrome OS. Only the Chromebook Plus model has a set price and release frame: Samsung says it will cost $449 and arrive sometime in February. The Chromebook Pro is pegged to release “later this Spring,” but past leaks suggest it will cost $499. Business Insider/Jeff DunnThe included stylus, which slides into a slot on the Chromebook’s side. For Chromebooks, these two laptops are pretty expensive! And based on some brief hands-on time with the Chromebook Plus model, I have reasons to doubt it will be worth the money. Google told me the software on my demo unit wasn’t finalised, so I can’t knock it for being sluggish, but the hardware itself didn’t feel as substantial as other pricey options like the Dell Chromebook 13 or HP Chromebook 13. There’s no aluminium here. It certainly looks sharp, but the keyboard is on the shallow side, and the trackpad wasn’t anything special. The built-in stylus, while small, did seem to work in harmony with apps like Google Keep, but the screen wobbled noticeably whenever I wrote with it in laptop mode. On the plus side, flipping the notebook into a tablet or tent mode was painless. Either way, we’ll have to test further before making a recommendation. The interesting bit here is in the software, as Google tries to overcome the awkwardness of having Android apps invade another OS. Unfortunately, the Chromebook Plus will only come with the beta version of the Play Store at launch. We’ve tried that before, and while it has some benefits (offline Netflix!), there’s still some fundamental awkwardness, like not being able to granularly adjust window size, or certain apps not being formatted for larger screens. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn Google laid the groundwork for addressing some of those issues in the latest Android 7.0 Nougat update, but right now the Play Store on the Chromebook Plus is running on Android 6.0 Marshmallow, with an update to come in a “few months.” Samsung’s new Chromebooks are not the first convertible laptops to work with Android apps, and time will tell if they’re worth buying, but more significant is how they may mark the start of Google finally getting the Android-Chrome OS combo going after months of delays. Kan Liu, Google’s senior director of product management, says that more “larger screen, productivity-focused, Android-type devices” will be announced by various companies before the Mobile World Congress show in Barcelona next month. That would suggest that having Android apps play nicer outside of a mobile display could become more of a focal point. Business Insider/Jeff Dunn Looming over all this is Andromeda, Google’s long-rumoured OS that will reportedly blend Android and Chrome OS together completely. Liu couldn’t comment on that directly, but did say that Google’s general goal is eventually to get a point where people won’t care about what the underlying OS is on their devices. “Over time, if [Chrome OS and Android] happen to get closer and closer together — such that, from a development perspective, it’s less work to duplicate work — we’re happy to have that as well,” he said. For now, though, Samsung thinks what merger is there can be a selling point. We’ll let you know if they’re right once the Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro are available.

Rather, BlackBerry has partnered with TCL to release Android phones under the BlackBerry brand name. The latest device, revealed behind closed doors at CES 2017, doesn’t have a name yet, so we’ll rely on its internet codename — which BlackBerry suggested — as “Mercury.” If you’re unaware, TCL manufactures phones under the Alcatel brand name. BlackBerry’s first devices under the new partnership with TCL were the DTEK50 and DTEK60, which are re-branded Alcatel phones announced and released towards the end of 2016. They all carry the same software experience that includes the BlackBerry Hub, the DTEK security app, and the famed BlackBerry Messenger (BBM). The same applies for the Mercury — though instead of targeting the budget and mid-range line, the new device will pit itself against flagship devices like Apple’s iPhone 7, the Samsung Galaxy S7, and Google’s Pixel. But BlackBerry has not released hardware specifications for the device, its price, or its release date — all we know is that official details will be announced around the time of Mobile World Congress in February. More: LG’s K Series budget phones run Android 7.0 Nougat Regardless, we managed to get some hands-on time with the Mercury, and we can talk about how it feels. The software was far from being finalized, so we can’t comment on it yet other than the fact that it runs Android 7.0 Nougat. Design For all you hardcore BlackBerry fans — the Mercury has a QWERTY keyboard with capacitive gesture capabilities, akin to the physical keyboard on the Priv. That means you can swipe up and down, left and right on the keyboard to move through your home screen, or even scroll through apps. Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends What’s unique is the fingerprint sensor, which is embedded into the space bar on the front of the device. We couldn’t test it out yet, but it’s a unique way of adding the sensor onto the front panel — rather than extending the bezel to accommodate it. Above the keyboard are capacitive navigation buttons that offer strong haptic feedback. More: Star Trek VR experience showcased at CES 2017 The device carries a rectangular shape that’s quite elongated due to the physical keyboard — it’s smaller than a 5.5-inch phone such as the Google Pixel, and the screen is even smaller. BlackBerry hasn’t offered specific details yet, but the Mercury felt fairly chunky. It has a soft-touch back that seems a little cheap for a flagship phone. The Mercury runs Android 7.0 Nougat. There is a headphone jack, and what looks to be down-firing speakers. Sitting in between the speakers is a USB Type-C charging port. The Mercury carries the same “Convenience Key” that’s available on the DTEK60 and the DTEK50 — it’s basically a customizable hotkey to specific apps or tools, such as the camera. The power button was on the left, and the volume rocker sat above the Convenience Key on the right. To be clear, the Mercury is a joint venture from BlackBerry and TCL and the hardware and software aren’t final. Software The Mercury runs Android 7.0 Nougat, and TCL says BlackBerry’s mobile team will continue to issue digitally-signed security updates for the device — including Google’s monthly security updates for Android. Julian Chokkattu/Digital Trends The user-interface is almost exactly stock Android, but BlackBerry has a few of its own tweaks to the OS. For example, the overview button shows previous apps in a grid-like layout. You’ll also find pre-installed BlackBerry apps, such as BBM, BlackBerry Hub, and DTEK by BlackBerry. Rumored specs As we mentioned, BlackBerry and TCL aren’t releasing specifications for the Mercury yet. Previous rumors suggest the device may pack a Snapdragon 821, features a 4.5-inch display, and a resolution of 1,680 x 1,080-pixels. This may change by the final announcement. Can the Mercury be BlackBerry’s comeback? The Priv was supposed to be BlackBerry’s splashy comeback into the mobile arena, but its high price deterred many from jumping back. The DTEK50 and DTEK60 have been around for a few months, but it’s hard to tell if they’ve turned the heads of enthusiasts — or anyone. The Mercury is promising — we don’t know its specifications or price, but if both are competitive it can certainly be the go-to Android device for people in search of a physical keyboard. The fact that it ships with the relatively-recent Android 7.0 Nougat is great — and we’ll have to hope that BlackBerry issues security and version updates in a timely manner. Will it attract people away from Apple, Samsung, or Google? It really comes down to if you prefer a physical keyboard, and if you like BlackBerry’s security-focused apps. Chances are the device won’t see mainstream appeal like in BlackBerry’s prime, but there’s potential in the enterprise market. We’ll have the final details on specifications and price when BlackBerry officially announces the phone close to Mobile World Congress in February. Highs: Runs near-stock Android 7.0 Nougat BlackBerry is promising fast security updates Physical keyboard has gesture capabilities Convenience Key is a handy, customizable shortcut button Lows Physical keyboard feels a little cramped On the bulkier-end of phones Soft touch back didn’t feel high-end Also watch: Share

By Peter Funt | January 4, 2017 | 2:45 p.m. Share on email Share on print I’m drinking morning coffee and exchanging pleasantries with the omnipotent Google Home device that arrived as a gift and was given a place near our kitchen table. Google has designed this coffee-can shaped digital assistant so that it can only be addressed with the words “OK, Google” or “Hey, Google.” Me: “Hey, Google. How do you spell omnipotent?” It (she?): “Omnipotent is spelled o-m-n-i-p-o-t-e-n-t.” Me: “Hey, Google. When is the Warriors’ next game?” It: “The Golden State Warriors will be playing the Toronto Rappers Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.” “Hey, Google. Hay is for horses.” Ha. Just kidding. That’s how my mom used to remind us that it’s not polite to say “hey.” I might add that mom knew how to spell omnipotent and, on balance, seemed to get along fine without guidance from inanimate objects — although she was prone to criticizing them, as in: “That darn toaster is taking too long!” Google Home competes with Amazon’s Echo, which for nearly two years has been the hottest thing on the planet. It answers to “Alexa.” “Hey, Google. Do you know someone named Alexa?” “Sorry, I don’t know how to help with that, but I’m still learning.” “Hey, Google. Do you know Siri?” “She has a nice name.” Since I’m writing this on my iPad, I thought I’d ask Siri, “What do you know about Google Home?” Siri: “I found this on the Internet: Home, a 2015 film. An alien on the run makes friends with a girl.” Seems these devices are still easily confused. Yet, for some people the lonely days of waiting to hear, “You’ve got mail,” have been replaced by the semblance of conversation with an entity that knows how many miles it is to the nearest pizza place, can convert dollars to yen, and has a Silicon Valley sense of humor. “Hey, Google. Tell me a joke.” “Who designed King Arthur’s Round Table? Sir Cumference.” Back in the 1980s our family had a Chrysler station wagon with limited vocabulary and laughably halting pronunciation. We’d jump in and the car would declare: “A ... door ... is ... a ... jar.” That made us laugh, and it prompted my sister to quip, “I always thought a door was a fork.” Nowadays I can barely make it out of the driveway without audio cues from GPS. My alarm clock volunteers the temperature, and the moving sidewalk warns when it’s coming to an end. What’s next? Bob, the talking toothbrush (“Don’t forget to scrub your tongue”). Hank, the grouchy lawnmower (“Gotta do something about that crabgrass”). Marge, the nagging refrigerator (“Save some of that apple pie for tomorrow, big guy”). I think Google might have erred by not giving its gadget a name. Product reinforcement is one thing, but it becomes a real pain after you’ve said “Hey, Google” or “OK, Google” several dozen times. We humans assign anthropomorphisms to many things in our lives-from pets to potted plants. Heck, the first thing Tom Hanks did when he was stuck on an island was name his soccer ball Wilson. As for conversing with inanimate objects, we’ve come a long way. In 1949, when my dad, Allen Funt, hid a speaker in a mailbox in Manhattan so it could “talk" to passersby, folks were aghast. Even after settling in to conversation, not a single person asked the mailbox for the high temperature in Philadelphia, or to play a tune by Perry Como. Nowadays young people think nothing of chatting with the machines in their lives. I suspect, however, that many of them wouldn’t know what to make of a mailbox. — Peter Funt is a writer, speaker and author of the book, Cautiously Optimistic.

Gap reveals app that lets you virtually try on clothes without leaving home DressingRoom by Gap lets users try on clothes in augmented reality Using the app, shoppers select a Gap style and one of five body types The item appears on an avatar that moves around to show different angels The app will launch later this month but only on a Google Tango-enabled device By Stacy Liberatore For Dailymail.com Published: 18:54 EST, 4 January 2017 | Updated: 19:35 EST, 4 January 2017 e-mail 318 shares 14 View comments Gap will soon let customers try on clothes without setting foot in a physical store. The firm unveiled a new pilot app, called the DressingRoom, at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where customers can 'try on' clothes in an augmented reality experience. Shoppers simply select a Gap style, choose their body type and a digital mannequin wearing the garment appears – and you can also purchase the item from the app. Scroll down for video  Gap unveiled a new pilot app called the DressingRoom, which lets customers 'try on' clothes in an augmented reality experience.Shoppers simply select a Gap style, choose their body type and digital mannequin appears wearing the garment  HOW DOES IT WORK?  Shoppers choose a Gap style they may want to purchase in DressingRoom by Gap. Next, they select one of five body types - extra small, small, medium, large and extra large. Users can try on the piece of clothing from anywhere on a Google Tango-enabled device. An avatar appears wearing the garment and shoppers can move it around the room to see the item from different angles. And clothing can be purchase through the app. The DressingRoom is a collaboration with Avametric, a firm that creates 3D renders for fashion brands, and Google. 'Google was an obvious collaborator for us on this project, as a longtime innovator in the Augmented Reality and mobile visualization space,' Liz Nuna, a Gap spokesperson, said in a blog post. 'And, Avametric is an early pioneer in the Augmented Reality space.' 'The technology they've created uses avatars to help people understand how products will fit without stepping foot in a dressing room, and that's really exciting.' The clothing brand is calling their experience 'augmented reality', as it overlays virtual images, such as clothing, on top of a real-life image. And customers will have the ability to move the avatar around to see how the clothing looks from different angles. RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 Next Think two cameras on your phone is enough?

Share this article Share 318 shares As of right now, the firm is only offering five different body types to choose from - extra small, small, medium, large and extra large. 'Technology gives customers incredible autonomy around the shopping experience and it's our responsibility to constantly explore new ways to make the shopping experience effortless and pursue solutions that will add value to the customer experience,' shares Nuna. Customers will have the ability to move the avatar around to see how the clothing looks from different angles. As of right now, the firm is only offering five different body types to choose from - extra small, small, medium, large and extra large THE END OF DRESSING ROOMS? A new high-tech 'mirror' means shoppers need no longer try clothes on - because it shows the latest garments on a digital scan of your body. The virtual wardrobe will save time by using a motion-capture camera to produce a realistic 3D image of each customer as they stand in front of the 6ft 6in screen. The computer even selects a range of clothing and accessories it believes will suit the shopper's shape and size, and presents them on the display. Shoppers can then use a simple wave of their hand to choose which ones they wish to 'try on', and instantly see what it looks like. The system - available in High Street shops this summer - is so advanced it can show how clothes hang from the shoulders and cling to the body. The device, hailed as 'every woman's dream invention', uses Microsoft's motion sensing technology, Kinect 3D.  'The DressingRoom by Gap pilot app is just one element of our longer-term strategic plan in this space.' The app is set to be released later this month, but will work only with phones supporting Google's Tango augmented-reality technology - namely Lenovo's Phab2 Pro and Asus' just-announced ZenFone AR. The move by Gap comes as shoppers spend less on clothing and more on experiences like beauty treatments. The app is set to be released later this month, but will work only with phones sporting Google's Tango augmented-reality technology - namely Lenovo's Phab2 Pro and Asus' just-announced ZenFone AR And over the past few years, online shopping has become more popular than visiting physical locations. Besides getting people into the store, Gap has also been struggling with sales - many loyal customers have turned away due to a lack of compelling clothing to choose from. 'We know that consumer shopping behaviors continue to change at a rapid pace, while technology continues to change the way customers engage with brands, browse products and shop,' Nuna writes. 'We want our customers to always be confident that the product they see will fit the way they expect.  Read more: adressed.gapinc....

It’s important to note that the lawsuit doesn’t accuse Google of actually engaging in discrimination, but rather that it is not being as forward as the Department of Labor would like through the audit process. According to the complaint, uncovered by The Verge, officers began the audit in September 2015 and requested a series of compensation snapshots for employees that would allow wages to be compared over time. A few months later, Google declined to provide such data, citing privacy reasons. Google’s refusal to supply this specific data comes after it had cooperated with other parts of the audit, supplying, “hundreds of thousands of records” throughout the process. Google explained in a statement that it has worked willingly with the Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs, but feels the organization is now making requests that are overbroad in their reach: “We’ve worked hard to comply with the OFCCP’s current audit,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement. “However, the handful of OFCCP requests that are the subject of the complaint are overbroad in scope, or reveal confidential data, and we’ve made this clear to the OFCCP, to no avail. These requests include thousands of employees’ private contact information which we safeguard rigorously. We hope to continue working with OFCCP to resolve this matter.” The audit comes from Google’s contracting business, which focuses on providing advertising and cloud computing services to federal agencies. Because it’s a federal contractor that does more than $10,000 in business, there are specific rules and regulations to which Google must adhere and cooperate. In many cases, these audits uncover evidence that leads to anti-discrimination suits, such as discrimination against a certain race in job hiring, pay, or workplace treatment. As of now, however, Google has not been accused of any sort of discrimination, it’s just not cooperating with the audit. Whether or not that means it’s hiding something remains to be seen… Guides Google View THe Guide blog comments powered by Disqus Submit a Tip cancel Submitting a tip constitutes permission to publish and syndicate.

In its top 10 predictions for the year, the organization forecasts that chatbots – virtual agents which operate via social networks and messaging platforms – will grow in presence and popularity, streamlining e-commerce activities such as booking flights and hotels, or to order items directly by speaking with a bot through an app. More Chat The research firm also expects there will be more opportunities for businesses to personalize these services, using social media analytics to provide consumers with specially tailored incentives. While acknowledging that many messaging bots have not seen a significant uptake in Western markets yet, due to their basic features and the technology not being fully-developed, Juniper noted that in Asian markets including China platforms such as WeChat have already established chatbots that aid in daily tasks. Meanwhile, North American applications such as Facebook Messenger are finally beginning to drive chatbot integration using ads. Bots won’t be the only helpful technology to get more widespread use this year: With Google Assistant coming to multiple devices and Alexa, Cortana and Siri already available on several platforms, Juniper said 2017 will be the year when digital assistants become sufficiently mainstream for the device ecosystem to become a key battleground. While many homes will initially be served by multiple voice assistants, Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Apple are all focusing on bringing consumers into their own services’ ecosystem. This means that single-branded homes and offices will start to become the norm, with companies endeavouring to win customers over by introducing exclusive features or brand discounts, such as inclusive subscriptions to content channels for a given period. Money Moves Established financial companies will continue to see disruption driven by the emergence of so-called tech-challenger banks and technology-first players, according to Juniper, and the failure of many traditional banks to innovate and keep pace with pure-play providers and technology banks will lead to some high-profile acquisitions and consolidation within the sector, alongside continued direct investments. Meanwhile technology giants such as Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon are competing to invest in emerging fintech markets such as payments, including contactless and mobile. Juniper expects that alongside banks, these tech giants could, and will, buy out startups to expand across other payment verticals, such as money transfer and remittances, to become more fintech-relevant. Like the banking sector, traditional insurance businesses are also going to be disrupted, said Juniper, as technology is enabling insurance to become much more personalised. “Insurtech” has seen new entrants deliver a more nuanced approach to insurance than traditional providers, often having products that enable customers to tailor the cover to their specific requirements. The research firm anticipates the emergence of Person-to-Person insurance, an approach which may appeal to millennials in particular. Juniper also believes that if Google, Facebook and Amazon enter the insurance market, they would likely be seen as a far better value proposition than incumbent competitors thanks to their huge customer bases. While many of the world’s largest insurers, including Aviva, Allianz, AIG and MetLife have created venture capital funds to invest in promising technologies and propositions, Juniper expects more companies instead to partner with the giants’ insurtech firms. Of course, you can’t really talk about what lies ahead for fintech without mentioning the blockchain. In fact, as Juniper noted, most blockchain deployments thus far have been limited to the financial sector, with exchanges and banks trialling the technology as a means of increasing the speed, transparency and security in areas such as transaction settlement. However, in 2017 the research firm predicts that a raft of proof of concepts will be developed, integrating the technology into a much wider array of applications and bringing logistics and identity management to the fore. Game On Juniper Research’s top 10 predictions for the year is also forecasting the rise of so-called eSports – the competitive playing of video games at the professional level – predicting that more than 190 million unique viewers will be watching through mobile and online channels in 2017, and that game consoles such as Microsoft’s upcoming “Project Scorpio” will help developers and their sponsors alike keep up. But where does this gaming chatter leave the much-talked-about virtual reality? Juniper said that while the latest PC and console-powered VR headsets were released and mobile VR was expanded in 2016, 2017 will be the year when most content creators come to the VR platform. In fact, Juniper predicts that console and PC-based VR companies will spend the next year focusing on creating experiences across all platforms, while media and tourism companies will aim to build interactive experiences for smartphone VR to add extra dimensions to a tourists’ visits.

It also brings trouble of its own and today we want to take a close look at the state of these new Pixel and Nexus Android 7.1.1 problems as we head into 2017. Advertisement Google’s Android 7.1.1 Nougat update, like the Android 7.0 Nougat update, went through a beta process to help Google wipe out problems ahead of its public release. While Google was able to eliminate bugs and problems, Android 7.1.1 Nougat problems have slipped through the cracks and Nexus/Pixel users are reporting issues with the new version of Google’s operating system. As we push away from the Android 7.1.1 release we’re starting to hear about the issues plaguing those who have downloaded or received the Android 7.1.1 Nougat update from Google. With that in mind, we want to run down the most important things to know about Pixel, Pixel XL, Pixel C, Nexus 6P, Nexus 6, Nexus 5X, Nexus Player, and Nexus 9 Android 7.1.1 problems. Advertisement This roundup takes a look at current state of Android 7.1.1 Nougat problems, offers potential fixes for Android 7.1.1 problems, runs down a list of solid resources, and looks ahead at future bug fix updates from Google. Prepare for Android Nougat Updates Each new Android 7.1.1 Nougat build will be a tempting install for Nexus and Pixel users, particularly those dealing with lingering Nougat problems. These updates have the potential to improve performance on your smartphone or tablet but there’s also a chance they will cause trouble. And that’s precisely why we recommend doing some prep work before you install new software on your device. It’s impossible to predict what you might encounter during the installation process and in the aftermath. Many of you will come out of it unscathed. Others will experience unpredictable problems. This is why it’s important to prepare. Advertisement We’ve put together a step-by-step guide that will take you through the things we do before we install an update from Google. You don’t need to follow every step but you’ll absolutely want to make a backup of your device’s important files before you make the move to the current version of Android 7.1.1. A little preparation will go a long way toward preventing problems and headaches so set aside some time before you make your move. Nexus Android 7.1.1 Nougat Problems Android 7.1.1 fixes lingering Nougat problems but it also brings its own collection of problems to Nexus and Pixel users. Google’s Nexus forums are already filling up with complaints about the new update. Nexus users are reporting download issues, problems with Bluetooth, freezes, lag, call forwarding issues, reception issues, problems with various apps, and a whole lot more. We’re also starting to see complaints about the Nexus 6 Android 7.1.1 update Google recently rolled out. Owners of the aging former flagship are noticing a variety of problems including issues with vibration, notifications, black screens on incoming calls, and issues with sound. Some Nexus 6P users are saying the Android 7.1.1 update bricked their device. These issues are similar to the ones that plagued the Nexus 5X after the Android 7.0 release. A number of Nexus 6 users are experiencing echo when using speakerphone. The issue is beginning to pickup steam on Google’s Nexus forums. Fortunately, Google is aware of the issue and a fix could emerge on the next version of Nougat. We expect complaints about Android 7.1.1 issues to pickup as Google’s OTA process picks up speed in the days ahead. I have seen the battery bug with 7.1.1 first hand. Died about 35% with my Nexus 6 @AndroidDev @android pic.twitter.com/O1sDTX0R58 — Silver Ice Thing (@coolsilver) January 9, 2017 Bluetooth issues I was having with my car are a known bug with Android 7.1.1 and are being tracked on bug #225774. — Marcus Wolfe (@hackerseraph) December 25, 2016 @Android I guess I shouldn't have done that update to 7.1.1 on my 6p. Now the Bluetooth is jacked up — Sean McDonald (@BigMac0608) December 20, 2016 Ugh… if having wifi proxy issues with Android Nougat 7.1.1, please star this! https://t.co/7isqUfhgr4 I searched but found no duplicates. — filipe fernandes (@filotek) December 21, 2016 @GooglePlay isn't letting me download app in @Android 7.1. Tried each solution.Phone is in roaming, but it works in WiFi OR non roaming SIM. — Sourav Das (@sd_016) December 21, 2016 @googlenexus after upgrading to Android 7.1.1 my battery is dying soon. Doze mode almost not working — sujendra nath (@sujendra_m) December 23, 2016 The company’s Pixel forums are also a source of complaints about various Android 7.1.1 problems plaguing both the regular model and the XL. Complaints from Pixel users are similar to the complaints from Nexus users. We’re hearing about Wi-Fi and Bluetooth problems, freezes, occasional lag, issues with reception, download problems, and issues with sound/speakers. We’re also seeing complaints about the camera, Photos app, issues with hotspot, touch screen problems, and more. There’s no guarantee you’ll encounter one of these issues on your device but the potential for problems should be the motivation you need to prepare your smartphone or tablet for the Android 7.1.1 Nougat update. Where to Find Android 7.1.1 Feedback As we push away from the Android 7.1.1 release you’ll want to keep an eye on feedback from fellow Pixel and Nexus Android 7.1.1 users. This feedback will alert you to potential bugs and it’ll help you gauge performance. We’re already starting to see Android 7.1.1 feedback emerge on social media sites like Twitter and Facebook. That’s a great place to look for potential issues and opinions about the Android 7.1.1 update’s performance on your device. @Android the battery life in my Nexus 6p is interesting, 89% – 0% 10mins, 0%-23% with no charging. Stayed at 19% for about an hour. 7.1.1 pic.twitter.com/A8m4va7TaD — John Penny (@Foldupdrjj) December 24, 2016 Google’s Pixel Help Forums, Google’s Nexus Help forums, XDA-Developers, YouTube, and Android-centric forums are also great places to look for feedback. If you’re already dealing with Android 7.1.1 Nougat problems or you’re worried about potential Android 7.1.1 problems, dig into short-term and long-term feedback. We’ll be digging into the Nexus and Pixel Android 7.1.1 updates and its performance so keep an eye out for our impressions. How to Fix Nexus Android 7.1.1 Problems If you’ve already encountered an Android 7.1.1 Nougat problem on your Nexus or Pixel device on your device you’re probably in the hunt for a fix. There are several key resources out there but our list of fixes for common Nexus Android Nougat issues is a great starting point. Our list includes potential fixes for Wi-Fi problems, Bluetooth issues, and other common bugs that typically popup after Google releases a new update. We’ve also put together another guide that will show you how to fix Nexus Android Nougat battery life problems. If you can’t find a fix there, take at Google’s Nexus Help Forums or Google’s Pixel Help forums. There are some very knowledgeable (and polite) people on there. If you’d rather go somewhere else, head over to XDA-Developers, or your favorite Android-centric forum for other potential remedies. What’s Next If you’re unable to find a manual fix you’re probably wondering when Google will roll out its next Nougat update. The company hasn’t confirmed anything but reliable sources indicate the company is planning at least one more bug fix update. That update? Android 7.1.2. The next three quarterly maintenance releases of Android Nougat will be Android 7.1 / 7.1.1 / 7.1.2 — Evan Blass (@evleaks) August 28, 2016 It’s unclear when Android 7.1.2 will roll out but we wouldn’t expect anything to emerge for a few more weeks. Google will also continue to roll out its monthly security updates to Nexus and Pixel devices but there’s no guarantee those will help your performance. The company’s January security update doesn’t have any known bug fixes on board. The company will eventually roll out new bug fixes for Nougat problems but you’ll likely be on your own for the next month or so. 9 Things to Do Before Installing Android 7.1.1 Nougat Get Familiar with Android 7.1.1 Nougat   1 / 9 One of the first things you'll want to do before installing Android 7.1.1 Nougat is to get familiar with the update. Blindly installing Android 7.1.1 Nougat on your device is a bad idea, particularly for novice Android users. If you haven't been following the Developer Preview, now would be a great time to get acquainted with Android 7.1.1 and its various changes. There are many. Some are big and obvious. Others are much smaller and harder to locate.  We've put together a guide that will walk you through Android 7.1.1 Nougat versus Android 7.0 Nougat and Android Marshmallow. If you're coming to 7.1.1 from Android 7.0 Nougat or Marshmallow, and we assume most of you are, this will come in handy.  Google's also outlined many of the update's key ingredients and you can take a look at those right here and right here.  It's in your benefit to dig into the update prior to installing it. This way, you won't be caught off guard by any of the changes.    1 / 9 2 Responses 12/17/2016 ammythomas04 Reply I found a great site that focuses on stay at home mom’s complete guide to gaining a serious amount of money in very little time.

The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP) said it had sought the data about the company's equal opportunity program in September 2015. The company failed to submit despite many opportunities, the OFCCP said. As a federal contractor, Google must agree to permit the federal government to inspect and copy records and information relevant to its compliance with the equal employment laws administered by OFCCP. The company has provided hundreds of thousands of records over the last year to comply with the OFCCP's current audit, a Google spokesperson told Reuters. "However, the handful of OFCCP requests that are the subject of the complaint are overbroad in scope, or reveal confidential data, and we've made this clear to the OFCCP, to no avail," the spokesperson said. The OFCCP said it would ask the court to cancel all of Google's current government contracts and to debar the company from entering into future contracts if it failed to comply.

Not really, anyway. Sure, there were a few decent ChromeOS apps, but it made no sense that they couldn't run the zillions of apps that Google's own Android mobile OS enjoyed. That problem is finally sorted. Samsung's new Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro — one powered by ARM, one powered by an Intel Core m3 — can run any Android app that lives on the Google Play store. That means all of Google's own in-house apps like Docs, as well as any game or app that a smartphone or tablet can run. The result of an ongoing collaboration between Samsung and Google, both use 12.3-inch 2400x1600pixel displays and have 4GB of RAM, as well as the traditionally light-for-a-laptop 32GB of storage — Chromebooks mostly suit the user that stores everything in Google Drive or Gmail. Taking an obvious cue from Samsung's Note smartphone line, the Chromebooks have a stylus integrated into the body that can be used to mark up the touchscreen display, which itself hinges 360 degrees to be used as a tablet-esque device. Battery life is claimed to be eight hours — certainly possible given the relatively low level of processing power from those ARM or Core m3 CPUs. No word on whether the Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro will make it to Australia, though — we're tracking that information down for you ASAP. US pricing is in the region of $US449 for the Plus. [Samsung] Comments M0F0 @m0f0 Jan 5, 2017, 11:35am So much want! Reply 0 sebg @sebg Jan 5, 2017, 12:36pm No price listed for the Pro (Intel-powered) version. However, at 1.1kg weight these look like Uber tablets and quite usable laptops. I'm interested. Reply 0 kyle9600 @kyle9600 Jan 5, 2017, 9:52pm Already Chromebooks out there that support Android apps , only a matter of time before all support them Reply 0 WhitePointer @whitepointer Jan 11, 2017, 9:59pm Including the new ASUS Chromebook Flip C302 models, that were also on display at CES. You get more power under the hood, a longer battery life (10 hours) and a backlit keyboard but lower screen res and no pen compared to the Samsungs.

Twitter Facebook Department of Labor sues Google over wage data Google has refused to comply with a request related to its federal contracts, the agency says Grant Gross (IDG News Service) 05 January, 2017 09:25 - - - - print email Comments The U.S. Department of Labor has filed a lawsuit against Google, with the company's ability to win government contracts at risk. The agency is seeking what it calls "routine" information about wages and the company's equal opportunity program. The agency filed a lawsuit with its Office of Administrative Law Judges to gain access to the information, it announced Wednesday. Google, as a federal contractor, is required to provide the data as part of a compliance check by the agency's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs (OFCCP), according to the Department of Labor. The inquiry is focused on Google's compliance with equal employment laws, the agency said. "Like other federal contractors, Google has a legal obligation to provide relevant information requested in the course of a routine compliance evaluation," OFCCP Acting Director Thomas Dowd said in a press release. "Despite many opportunities to produce this information voluntarily, Google has refused to do so." Google must allow the federal government to inspect and copy records relevant to compliance, the Department of Labor said. The agency requested the information in September 2015, but Google provided only partial responses, an agency spokesman said by email. Google refused to provide some wage information requested by the agency, according to the lawsuit. The agency is asking the court to cancel all of Google's current government contracts and to bar the company from entering into future contracts if it does not comply with the information request. A Google spokeswoman didn't immediately respond to a request for a comment on the lawsuit.

Artist Bradley Theodore using the HTC Vive and Google's Tilt Brush. Image: Google By Adario Strange2017-01-04 23:10:52 UTC The landscape of cutting-edge art, usually limited to traditional multimedia, audio and visual hacks, is undergoing a major shift with the advent of virtual reality art tools like Oculus Medium and Quill.  Now, one of the earliest players in the space, Google's VR paint-meets-sculpting app Tilt Brush, has launched what it calls an "artist in residency" program to push VR art even further into the mainstream of creative expression.  SEE ALSO: 5 VR safety tips to stop you from destroying your home We saw the first hints of such a program last year in France, where Google trained a small group of artists in the ways of VR art. The new program is much bigger and boasts over 60 artists, including New Yorker cartoonist Bob Mankoff, The Little Mermaid animator Glen Keane, Justin Roiland, the co-creator of Adult Swim's Rick and Morty, and Susan Kare, well known as the graphic designer behind the interface icons and fonts for Apple's Mac computers back in the '80s.  Unlike a traditional artist residency, the program won't actually be housing the artists as they create. Instead, they're being given inside access to Tilt Brush developers, becoming, in Google's words "part of the Tilt Brush team." When asked if the residency program included compensation of any kind to the artists, a Google spokesperson declined to reveal those details.  Given the relative lack of transparency, on its face, the "residency" seems more like a way for Google to use the talents of artists to engage in research to figure out how to make Tilt Brush better (and get some high profile artists fronting its app in the process).  But despite the somewhat murky aspect of the relationship (the program is only open to handpicked artists), the initiative represents a commitment by Google to further the reach of VR beyond the realm of gaming and into areas of creation, something that is often overlooked by those only superficially familiar with current VR systems.  Like Oculus' Medium, with Tilt Brush, artists can output what they create to the .obj format, allowing VR-created objects to be 3D printed. Additionally, back in December, Tilt Brush added another export feature that allows users to easily export Tilt Brush sessions to YouTube (another Google company). That's an important update in that, like gaming, watching VR art being created on platforms like Twitch is slowly gaining popularity. Connecting Tilt Brush natively to YouTube could spur even more VR art session sharing.  One of the most surprising things I've noticed when introducing VR art tools to traditional artists is how quickly they take to the new medium. Unlike other digital tools, the Oculus Touch controllers and, to a lesser degree, the HTC Vive controllers, offer a more intuitive and organic approach to creating art in a digital medium. It's likely that, for those reasons, I have yet to meet a pen, pencil, paint or sculpture artist who tries VR art and dismisses it as too artificial or not organic enough.  It appears, at least early on, that VR tools like Tilt Brush are the digital art medium many traditional artists have been waiting for.  BONUS: HoloLens IRL: What it's like in Microsoft's version of augmented reality Topics: apps, art, Google, HTC Vive, Tech, tilt brush, virtual reality, VR, vr art About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

Name: Subject: Message: Samsung Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro will run Android apps Newsby John Callaham2 weeks ago 6 931 5 Samsung has now confirmed earlier rumors about its plans to release new Chromebook models as part of its CES 2017 announcements. The Samsung Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro will be among the first Chrome OS devices that are able to run Android apps from the Google Play Store out of the box. The only hardware difference between the Samsung Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro is that the Plus has a ARM-based hexa-core OP1 processor, while the Pro has an Intel Core m3 chip. Both models boast a 2400×1600 resolution display that can rotate a full 360 degrees, and both feature 4GB of RAM and 32GB of onboard storage. The two models will also arrive with two USB Type-C ports and both will ship with a built-in pen that’s tucked away on the side of the device when not in use. The Chromebooks will come pre-installed with the Google Keep app for note taking and Samsung ArtCanvas for drawing. See also: Four more Chromebooks can use Android apps on Chrome OS Developer channel November 17, 2016 However, the fact that both of Samsung’s new Chromebooks will come with the Google Play Store pre-installed may be the biggest feature. Google has so far only updated a small selection of its Chromebooks to run Android apps, via Chrome OS updates, since mid-2016. Hopefully this means we can expect to see more Chromebooks supporting Android apps, both new and existing, in the near future. However, we should note that Samsung points out that the Google Play Store support for the Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro will be in beta form. The Samsung Chromebook Plus will go on sale in February for a price of $449. The Chromebook Pro has a more general “Spring” release time frame, but the price tag has yet to be revealed.

The potential banishment is being sought in a Labor Department lawsuit filed Wednesday with the Office of Administrative Law Judges. The complaint alleges that Google has repeatedly refused to provide the Labor Department with employee compensation records and other information as part of an audit designed to ensure the company isn't discriminating against workers based on gender or race. The review of how Google pays the thousands of workers at its Mountain View, California, headquarters is allowed under decades-old laws regulating U.S. government contractors. Google has struck a series of deals with various federal government agencies during the past decade, including a digital advertising agreement cited by the Labor Department that has generated more than $600,000 for the company since June 2014, according to the complaint. That amount is a pittance for Google, whose revenue has surpassed $130 billion during the same span. If Google doesn't comply with all its demands, the Labor Department wants a legal order that would void all of the company's current federal government contracts and block future deals. In a statement, Google said it has provided hundreds of thousands of records in an attempt to comply with the Labor Department's requests, but has rebuffed some of the agency's demands as "overbroad" and an invasion of employee privacy. Like most other big technology companies, Google for the past few years has been posting breakdowns of its workforce that show most of its computer programmers and other high-paid employees in technical jobs are white and Asian men. The disclosures have become a source of embarrassment for Google and its technology industry peers, who have repeatedly acknowledged they need to do more to hire women, blacks and Hispanics. "We're very committed to our affirmative action obligations, and to improving the diversity of our workforce, and have been very vocal about the importance of these issues," Google reiterated in its response to the Labor Department's lawsuit. But Google, which is part of Alphabet Inc., and other tech companies so far have only been disclosing the types of jobs held by the two genders and different races without providing specifics about the salaries in different employment categories. It is well known, though, that programmers and engineers who write the coding for technology products and services are among the highest paid workers besides the companies' executives. The Labor Department maintains that Google agreed to submit to a higher level of scrutiny when it decided to do business with federal agencies funded by taxpayers. "Like other federal contractors, Google has a legal obligation to provide relevant information requested in the course of a routine compliance evaluation," said Thomas Dowd, acting director of the Labor Department's Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs.

Samsung and Google introduce the next generation Chromebook Posted on 5-Jan-2017 11:56. | Filed under: News : Mobile : Android. Samsung Electronics America, Inc. has announced the Samsung Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro, the latest generation of its Chromebooks that pairs the power and productivity of a laptop with the flexibility and versatility of a tablet. Samsung and Google partnered to design this next generation Chromebook, which is born at the intersection of hardware and software innovation. The Samsung Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro are designed for Google Play so you can use all the apps you love in addition to movies, books and music. The new Samsung Chromebooks also offer a 360-degree rotating touchscreen, quad HD screen, built-in digitized pen and new lightweight metal design.   “Since launching our first Chromebook over five years ago, we have continued to improve the product, developing a computer that not only fits into consumers’ lifestyles, but makes their lives easier, more mobile and more productive,” said Alanna Cotton, vice president of product marketing at Samsung Electronics America. “With the Chromebook Plus and Pro, we’re partnering with Google to pair a sleek design with supreme flexibility, encouraging users to experience more with Google Play and Android apps, while continuing to provide simplicity, top-rated security and shareability inherent in Chromebooks.”   The Chromebook Plus and Pro are designed to be flexible – allowing the user to transform the Chromebook on demand. It is built with a 360-degree rotating touchscreen performing both as a notebook, and an ultra-mobile premium tablet.   For the first time in the Chromebook lineup the Chromebook Plus and Pro come with a built-in pen, which is embedded on the side of the device for secure storage and easy access. The pen takes convenience to another level with tablet-like benefits, such as the ability to effortlessly take notes and capture on-screen content. The pen is ready to use out of the box with pre-installed Google Keep for notetaking and Samsung ArtCanvas for drawing. The newly developed pen has a 0.7mm pen tip and pressure sensitivity for precise screen capturing.   With a sleek, lightweight design, the Chromebook Plus and Pro is a computer people will be proud to own. The high-quality hardware is slim, designed to fit right into consumers’ bags, so it’s easy to carry wherever the day takes them. Additionally, an integrated full-size keyboard and trackpad allows users to write and play from anywhere.   The new Chromebook isn’t just a laptop, or tablet – it’s a connection to a world of experience including apps, games and media, all through the Google Play Store. Delivering a Quad HD 2400x1600 resolution display made of durable Gorilla Glass 3, with a 3:2 aspect ratio – users can game, work or binge-watch on Samsung’s best Chromebook screen.   The Chromebook Plus and Pro have upgraded its ports, and now includes two USB-C ports for enhanced connectivity and 4k video streaming, producing high quality video and gaming from the Chromebook on connected 4k displays.   The Chromebook Plus and Pro are for the user that wants to do more, create more and get more done all while staying connected. The new Chromebooks deliver a powerful multitasking multi-window experience allowing users to browse on Chrome, work in Google Drive and chat easily with friends on Google Hangouts.   The Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro also allows users the ability to access apps, work on documents or listen to a playlist while offline. Additionally, traditional Chromebook features like built-in anti-virus and automatic updates remain.   The new Chromebooks have 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage and feature batteries that last up to 8 hours, as well as an enhanced battery life extender to lengthen productivity time. Samsung Chromebook Plus will feature an ARM processor starting at $449 and will be available at major retailers, including Best Buy, in February. The Chromebook Pro will be powered by an Intel Core m3 processor, designed for fast, responsive performance and will be available later this Spring. Both devices will come with the Google Play Store (Beta) pre-installed.   More information: http://www.samsung.com/us/computing/chromeboo...

ADVERTISEMENT Hands on: Google's Project Tango can see the world in 3D Hands on: Google's Project Tango can see the world in 3D Technology 07 Sep 2015 BMW has teamed up with Accenture to build an augmented “car visualiser” that uses Google’s Tango technology and shows full-scale, photorealistic, virtual versions of the i3 and i8, with adjustable options for the exteriors and interiors. Read more This car headrest monitors your brain waves to stop you falling asleep at the wheel This car headrest monitors your brain waves to stop you falling asleep at the wheel By Matt Burgess Tango adds spatial perception to Android phones and tablets by adding advanced computer vision, image processing, and vision sensors. A Tango-enabled device can map in 360 degrees, meaning that as it is moved, it navigates and views the room in the same way a person would. BMW’s app and Tango-enabled devices will be piloted across select BMW dealerships this year, and, if successful, will be rolled out further. The app will also be available "soon" on Android for everyday consumers to download, meaning they can configure the cars from their living room. BMW's iVisualiser lets you 'sit' in virtual, life-size cars BMW/Accenture From within the app, you can view, walk around, look inside and select options on a life-size virtual BMWi. You can also select which i-series car you want to look at, and choose from a range of exterior options including paint colour and wheels. As the car is viewed through the device, the virtual car moves in relation to how you move. Inside, you can open doors, step inside and make changes to upholstery colours and the dashboard. You can even turn on the radio and hear music, as well as turn on the engine and the lights. BMW/Accenture ADVERTISEMENT The app uses Tango’s integrated sensor technology and motion tracking, area learning, and depth perception to create the virtual view. As a result, it doesn’t need GPS or to be connected to the web after the app has been installed. After using the app to build a virtual version of your car, you can save the preferences and send them to a local dealership to buy the car. The app also lets you take screenshots and share your options by email, or online. Although the trial only applies to the i3 and i8 models, the app has been built so that future models of BMWs can be added using 3D CAD files. The release date of the app is yet to be announced, and more details about the trial dealerships are expected soon.

Both Chromebooks are designed specifically with Google Play in mind, as being the first Chromebooks ever with support for a stylus. Samsung’s Chromebook Pro and Chromebook Plus both feature a 12.5-inch QuadHD 2400×1600 display with Gorilla Glass 3, as well as two USB-C ports on either side of the machine for both charging and data transfer. The display rotates 360-degrees for use as a tablet as well. The Chromebook Pro and Plus also feature a built-in stylus which can be used in Samsung’s ArtCanvas drawing app, or Google’s built-in Keep app for notetaking following a recent update. The stylus also slides into the Chromebook to keep it secure. Both Chromebooks feature 4GB of RAM, 32GB of storage, and offer up to 8 hours of battery life. Samsung also offers an “enhanced battery life extender” to add power on the go. Both also feature the same design, but differ when it comes to processing power. The base model Chromebook Plus offers an ARM chipset while the Chromebook Pro packs the much more powerful Intel Core m3 processor. Pricing on the Chromebook Plus starts at $449 and will go on sale from major outlets like Best Buy, Amazon, Newegg, and more starting in February. The Chromebook Pro, on the other hand, will go on sale starting this Spring. Both machines will ship with the Google Play Store installed out of the box. Pre-orders are open now on Samsung’s store. Samsung Electronics America, Inc. today announced the Samsung Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro, the latest generation of its Chromebooks that pairs the power and productivity of a laptop with the flexibility and versatility of a tablet. Samsung and Google partnered to design this next generation Chromebook, which is born at the intersection of hardware and software innovation. The Samsung Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro are designed for Google Play so you can use all the apps you love in addition to movies, books and music. The new Samsung Chromebooks also offer a 360-degree rotating touchscreen, quad HD screen, built-in digitized pen and new lightweight metal design. “Since launching our first Chromebook over five years ago, we have continued to improve the product, developing a computer that not only fits into consumers’ lifestyles, but makes their lives easier, more mobile and more productive,” said Alanna Cotton, vice president of product marketing at Samsung Electronics America. “With the Chromebook Plus and Pro, we’re partnering with Google to pair a sleek design with supreme flexibility, encouraging users to experience more with Google Play and Android apps, while continuing to provide simplicity, top-rated security and shareability inherent in Chromebooks.” Flexibility The Chromebook Plus and Pro are designed to be flexible – allowing the user to transform the Chromebook on demand. It is built with a 360-degree rotating touchscreen performing both as a notebook, and an ultra-mobile premium tablet. For the first time in the Chromebook lineup the Chromebook Plus and Pro come with a built-in pen, which is embedded on the side of the device for secure storage and easy access. The pen takes convenience to another level with tablet-like benefits, such as the ability to effortlessly take notes and capture on-screen content. The pen is ready to use out of the box with pre-installed Google Keep for notetaking and Samsung ArtCanvas for drawing. The newly developed pen has a 0.7mm pen tip and pressure sensitivity for precise screen capturing. With a sleek, lightweight design, the Chromebook Plus and Pro is a computer people will be proud to own. The high-quality hardware is slim, designed to fit right into consumers’ bags, so it’s easy to carry wherever the day takes them. Additionally, an integrated full-size keyboard and trackpad allows users to write and play from anywhere. Experience More The new Chromebook isn’t just a laptop, or tablet – it’s a connection to a world of experience including apps, games and media, all through the Google Play Store. Delivering a stunning, immersive Quad HD 2400×1600 resolution display made of durable Gorilla Glass 3, with a 3:2 aspect ratio– users can game, work or binge-watch on Samsung’s best Chromebook screen. The Chromebook Plus and Pro have upgraded its ports, and now includes two USB-C ports for enhanced connectivity and 4k video streaming, producing high quality video and gaming from the Chromebook on connected 4k displays. Cutting-edge Software, Enhanced Productivity The Chromebook Plus and Pro are for the user that wants to do more, create more and get more done all while staying connected. The new Chromebooks deliver a powerful multitasking multi-window experience allowing users to browse on Chrome, work in Google Drive and chat easily with friends on Google Hangouts. The Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro also allows users the ability to access apps, work on documents or listen to a playlist while offline. Additionally, traditional Chromebook features like built-in anti-virus and automatic updates remain. The new Chromebooks have 4GB of RAM and 32GB of storage* and feature batteries that last up to 8 hours**, as well as an enhanced battery life extender to lengthen productivity time. Samsung Chromebook Plus will feature an ARM processor starting at $449 and will be available at major retailers, including Best Buy, in February. The Chromebook Pro will be powered by an Intel® Core™ m3 processor, designed for fast, responsive performance and will be available later this Spring. Both devices will come with the Google Play Store (Beta) pre-installed. Samsung will debut Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro at CES 2017’s regular exhibition hours, from January 5-8 at the Booth #15006, in LVCC, Level 1, Central Hall.

It knows what I want to type before I type it. It even knows where I want to drive to before I drive. So it was only a matter of time before Google figured out what I wanted to write with my pen before I finished my pen stroke. And now Google's showing off this newest feat of machine learning in Samsung's next major Chrome OS laptops: the Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro. Samsung's newest Chromebooks were designed in tandem with Google so they're not like Chromebooks you've seen before. They look a little stubby next to something like Samsung's updated Notebook 9. That's due to the display. Instead of a traditional widescreen display like those found in nearly every other notebook on the market, the Chromebook Plus and Pro have iPad-like 3:2 2400 x 1600 displays. That make them significantly more square. And the decision to go with a stubbier 3:2 display ratio is directly tied to the sweet predictive writing Google's including in the newest version of Chrome OS. It's also why Samsung's new Chromebooks also have 360-degree hinges, a Samsung Note-like stylus built in, and ship with Android's Play Store. Samsung and Google want you to use this device as a tablet as often as you use it as a laptop. But the new Samsung Chromebooks won't be the best bet for artists or other professionals yet. The stylus they ship with is the tiny kind meant for quick notes rather than intensive image creation and editing. And the other features tied into Chrome OS's new ability to recognize pen input, like the ability to turn scribbles into text and automatically tighten up hastily drawn shapes into perfect circles and squares, are already found in iOS and Windows. So what really sets the Chromebook Plus and Pro apart from competition is the price. The Plus, with an ARM processor, 4GB of RAM, and 32GB hard drive, starts at just $450 when it ships in February. The Pro, with an Intel Skylake coreM processor, 4GB of RAM and 32GB hard drive, will likely cost more, and won't ship until later this spring.

Asus unveils Zenfone AR with THREE sensors that can take 92 megapixel 'superpictures' and even 3D scan a room  Zenfone AR is second handset to incorporate Tango which allows for indoor mapping, augmented reality and more Also one of the first phones to be compatible with Google's Daydream VR app  By Afp Published: 17:09 EST, 4 January 2017 | Updated: 18:27 EST, 4 January 2017 e-mail 35 shares 5 View comments While Apple and others have made the leap to two cameras, ASUS have got one step further - with a triple sensor. The firm's new Zenfone AR has a traditional 23-megapixel sensor, alongside motion-tracking and depth-sensing cameras. It can combine four native 23-megapixel photos to create a single image —something the company is calling a 92-megapixel 'super resolution' photo.  Scroll down for video  The Zenfone AR has a 23-megapixel camera sensor, alongside motion-tracking and depth-sensing cameras, allowing it to scan a room and superimpose images on it.

The Zenfone AR is just the second handset to incorporate the Tango computing platform which allows for indoor mapping, augmented reality and more. The new device, unveiled by Asus at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, is also one of a small number of smartphones that is compatible with Google Daydream, the US tech giant's virtual reality system. 'We are excited to be the first to enable Tango and Daydream,' Asus chairman Jonney Shih as he unveiled the new 5.7-inch (15-centimeter) handset, which will be available in the second quarter of the year.

It also boasts Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 821 processor, and is the first smartphone with 8GB of RAM.  The phone uses ASUS's own TriCam system that clusters three camera sensors (a 23-megapixel sensor, alongside motion-tracking and depth-sensing cameras) to reduce the space it takes up, keeping the phone lighter and thinner.  It also boasts Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 821 processor, and is the first smartphone with 8GB of RAM. The ZenPhone AR also crams in a 5.7-inch Super AMOLED display and a new five-magnet speaker for improved sound. Shih said the new phone 'enables interaction with virtual objects' and offers the ability to watch a movie or play a game in virtual or augmented reality. 'This is really the next wave that is going to get consumers excited about smartphones,' said Asus marketing chief Erik Hermanson. Project Tango uses depth sensing and motion tracking to create onscreen 3D experiences, allowing users to get a better picture of a physical environment for functions such as home decoration. The phone uses ASUS's own TriCam system that clusters three camera sensors (a 23-megapixel sensor, alongside motion-tracking and depth-sensing cameras) to reduce the space it takes up, keeping the phone lighter and thinner. Google Project Tango leader Johnny Lee, who joined the Asus media event, said he expected 'dozens of Tango-enabled apps' to be available soon on the Google Play store. The only other handset using Project Tango is Lenovo's Phab2 phone, which was released last year. Asus announced it would be releasing another new smartphone, the Zenfone 3 Zoom, with upgraded camera technology which aims at delivering professional-quality images. HOW TANGO WORKS  Project Tango combines 3D motion tracking with depth sensing to give your mobile device the ability to know where it is and how it moves through space.  'The goal of Project Tango is to give mobile devices a human-scale understanding of space and motion,' said Johnny Lee from the ATAP-Project Tango Team. 'Our team has been working with universities, research labs, and industrial partners spanning nine countries around the world to build on the last decade of research in robotics and computer vision, concentrating that technology into a unique mobile device With Project Tango, developers can create applications that explore physical space around the user, including precise navigation without GPS, windows into virtual 3D worlds, measurements of spaces, and games that know where they are in the room and what's around them.  Share or comment on this article e-mail 35 shares Most watched News videos Gloria Williams waves extradition for kidnapping Kamiyah Mobley Kitesurfer unaware of great white shark swimming below Disgusting moment cyst puss eruption covers cell phone Enraged kick-boxer strikes husband's mistress NINE times 2017's luckiest man: Pedro Grendene Bartelle win's $3.5m Man takes his cat Weston Sledding in the snow Sheep attack shepherd after being frightened by a car in Germany She's falling for him?

It’s been a while since the Korean manufacturer has updated its line of Chrome OS powered laptops, and the new Samsung Chromebook Plus and Pro are the best of the bunch. It’s fitted with a vibrant 2,400 x 1,600 display, a 360-degree hinge, and it has a trick hidden up its sleeve — the Google Play Store. Key Specs 6th-gen Intel Core m3-6y30 4GB RAM, 32GB e.MMC 12.3-inch 2,400 x 1,600 display Built-in stylus 360-degree hinge Designed with Google Play Store in mind That’s right. Working with engineers at Google, Samsung has constructed the first Chromebook designed with Android app capabilities in mind. That includes a built-in stylus with digitizer, full accelerometer support, and new context menus to help both laptop and mobile users bridge the gap between form factors. It’s worth noting there are actually two new Chromebooks: the Plus and Pro. The only difference between the two is the processor, which is an ARM hexa-core chip of Samsung’s own making called the OP1 in the Plus, and an Intel Core m3-6y30 in the Pro. Otherwise, the systems are completely identical. The hardware The Chromebook Pro is a bit of a mixed bag when it comes to internal components. At its heart is an Intel Core m3-6Y30, a dual-core Skylake chip with Hyper-Threading and a 900MHz base clock, paired up with 4GB of RAM and 32GB of e.MMC storage. That’s not the most competitive performance promise we’ve seen, but it makes up for it with the display. The 12.3-inch screen boasts a very competitive 2,400 x 1,600 panel. It’s a fully equipped touchscreen, like the kind we’re growing used to seeing on laptops of any size, with a digitizer for the built-in stylus, which pops out of the side a la Samsung’s Note line of smartphones. While it’s hard to judge screens in a hardware preview hall, it’s clear Samsung has a winner on its hands here. Colors were pleasantly vibrant, and black levels deep enough for us to take notice. Its 3:2 aspect ratio is an odd choice for a Chromebook, but as frequent Surface Book users, we’ve grown fond of the taller screen, and it allows Android apps to run vertically in laptop mode without leaving a lot of awkward space on either side. For a small system, in a market that doesn’t place a lot of stock in build quality, the Samsung Chromebook Pro is impressively sturdy, with an aluminum chassis that exudes luxury, while still weighing in at just under 2.5 pounds. The keyboard provides deep travel and a sturdy click at the bottom of each press — once again, a rare feature to come across on Chromebooks at any price point. Connectivity is fairly standard, offering up two USB Type-C ports with Thunderbolt 3, MicroSD for expansion, and dedicated power. The software While a handful of Chromebooks will recieve an update allowing them to use Android apps from the Google Play Store, Samsung’s new Chromebook Pro is the only system built with that very use case in mind. The built-in accelerometer allows you to play your favorite Android games without any issue, and the screen and special beta version of Chrome OS are designed to be more receptive to a keyboard and trackpad. That’s a massive boon to Chrome OS users. We’re big fans of the lightweight operating system, particularly for users who often find themselves within range of a Wi-Fi network, but newer hardware is growing cheaper, more powerful, and more power efficient. Google Play is a solution that’s ready to roll out with existing infrastructure and rich app support, opening up the world of Chrome OS to new experiences. Google is able to create an algorithm for prediction tied specifically to your handwriting patterns. As you might imagine, spending time with the Chromebook Pro only convinced us further that this is the way to go for Chrome OS. The mobile-first Android apps open fast and load even faster, maxing out potential screen resolution and performance settings in games, and sprawling out seductively in productivity and media apps. Samsung mentioned other little perks too, like using the Netflix Android app to save videos offline — something you can’t do on a Windows or Mac laptop — and the ability to use mobile-only messaging apps with a keyboard and touchpad. The stylus is also a new feature for Chrome OS, and one that actually brings a lot of functionality with it. Using machine-learning techniques, Google is able to create an algorithm for prediction tied specifically to your handwriting patterns. That means, instead of waiting for you to finish a word and inserting a slight delay to interpret it, the word is actually predicted as you write, so taking down notes has never been snappier. Better yet, this algorithm allows you to turn around and search your own handwritten notes. The digitizer display performs with the best of them, but you’d likely only use it when the system is in tablet mode, where your fingers will do just fine for Android apps. Is it worth it? Samsung’s new Chromebook Pro has everything you could possibly want from a Chrome OS machine — great keyboard, solid construction, and Core level performance — while also bringing some of the best Android features — accelerometers, advanced touch support, and of course the Google Play store. That’s really the big draw with Samsung’s Chromebook Pro. Chrome OS on its own is a minimal and utilitarian operating system, but mixing in Google Play Store apps adds a massive amount of functionality and developer support the platform has never experienced. Working with Google has clearly focused Samsung’s efforts on producing clean, serious hardware that’s purpose-built for covering a wide array of mobile and computing use cases with minimal effort on the user’s part. The ARM-powered Samsung Chromebook Plus will start at $449, with an ARM OP1, but identical specifications otherwise, and we expect the Chromebook Pro to cost slightly above that, pricing it at the top end of the Chromebook market, apart from the niche Pixel Chromebook. Google Play, in conjunction with refined, powerful hardware, means the Samsung Chromebook Pro and Plus may be the breaking wave that changes the tide for Chromebooks. Highs Full Google Play Store support Sturdy, attractive hardware Vibrant screen Versatile form factor Lows Priced at the top end of the market Stylus’ usefulness remains to be seen Share

While the company recently launched SoundCloud Go, an ad-free streaming experience priced at $10 per month that also provides offline playback, the company has had significant trouble generating profit from the service. Furthermore, as the streaming market has matured, SoundCloud has found itself competing against tech giants like Apple and Google. Google is reportedly pitching $500 million to acquire the niche streaming company. This falls below the $1-billion price tag SoundCloud asked for when Spotify approached it back in December. For Google, $500 million is a relatively low price to eliminate a Play Music competitor. Although it was much easier to comprehend a Spotify’s interest in the company, 9to5Mac suggests that SoundCloud may complement Google’s other musical properties. SoundCloud does, after all, possess over 175 million users, and it’s not uncommon for Google to pursue several properties that serve the same purpose.

Photo: Michael Short, Bloomberg Labor department sues Google over pay data 1 / 6 Back to Gallery The U.S. Department of Labor said Wednesday it filed a lawsuit against Google because the company failed to provide compensation data, which it had agreed to do as a federal contractor. The data requested include job and salary history of employees as of Sept. 1, 2014 and 2015, as well as the names of employees and their contact information, the department said in the suit, which was filed with its Office of Administrative Law Judges. The department said it is requesting this data as part of its efforts to make sure there is no employment discrimination by its contractors and subcontractors. If Google doesn’t provide the data, the department is asking the court to order the Mountain View company’s federal contracts canceled and to bar Google from participating in future federal contracts until it provides the information requested. ALSO For young entrepreneurs, college debts can snuff out startup hopes Aerospace firms start recruiting in prekindergarten Air India’s women-only row; Lyft’s big loss; driverless in Vegas According to the Department of Labor, its Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs had asked Google to provide the data by June 1, and was told on June 17 that Google would not hand over the information. The department said it has made efforts to get Google to voluntarily provide the information, but the company still hasn’t released it. A Department of Labor spokesman said its request is fairly routine, but “enforcement actions like this one are less common.” Google said that it has “worked hard to comply” with the office’s audit and has “provided hundreds of thousands of records over the last year, including those related to compensation.” The company said it hasn’t released some data because it has concerns about providing the private contact information of its employees. The company said the requests for the information that it did not provide are “overbroad in scope, or reveal confidential data, and we’ve made this clear to the (Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs), to no avail.” David Rosenfeld, a lecturer at UC Berkeley School of Law, said that in general, it’s unusual for companies to not comply with the department’s request, and that the employee contact information is not something that members of the public can see under a Freedom of Information Act request. The Department of Labor may need the contact information of employees to talk to them to make sure that the salary information is accurate, he said.

Join us on Facebook Get latest news on advertising, media and marketing Pichai looks at his birthplace to launch SMB product for the globe By Karan Choudhury , Business Standard, New Delhi | In Digital | January 05, 2017 Prasad asks Internet giant to help improve India's digital security. Sundar Pichai, the India-born chief executive officer of Google, used his homeland to launch a global platform that allows small firms to build websites on their smartphones before the largest Internet firm takes it to other countries. India has around 51 million small and medium businesses, but less than a fifth of them, or around 9 million, are online. Google is looking to bring more small firms online, launching do-it-yourself courses for users to build websites on smartphones. This will help it engage and lock these users on its platform. At the same time, Google expects local solutions built for India can be replicated in other emerging markets in Africa, Latin America and Southeast Asia. "When we solve for a place like India, we solve for everyone around the world. That has led us to grow our team here and spend more time and ensure the products are useful for everyone," said Pichai, launching the MyBusiness tool with Law and Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad. Google also launched Digital Unlocked, an education programme, in association with industry body FICCI and the Indian School of Business to teach mobile and online courses to help small businesses. Since it stepped up focus on India over a decade, Google has been building India-specific products, engaging with the government to connect 100 railway stations with Internet via its Railwire project, and improving access in the hinterland. The company is also working on a host of products around regional languages. In the second edition of the Google for India event last September, the company said it was doing extensive work on making searches more comprehensive in Indian languages. The company is also launching a voice-based vernacular search platform. The platform now works in Hindi, but the company plans to make it available in other Indian languages. Last December, the first edition of the Google in India event saw Pichai launching a host of India-specific products. Google also said India was the third largest startup ecosystem and the company had invested Rs 130 crore in it. The company has started Google Launchpad and Google Accelerator, investing in mid to late startups through Google Capital. Prasad, who was also at the event, said Google was as much an Indian company as American and it needed to play a larger role in the domestic market by tailoring its products and working more on cyber security. "Google India needs to tailor its operation more to India's psyche, local languages, local aspirations, local products... India's digital economy is going to be $1 trillion plus in the coming 3-4 years," he said. Stressing that Google should be more involved, the minister highlighted areas, including cyber security, where the technology giant could play a bigger role. Growth of digital payments would lead to stronger challenges in cyber security, he said.

Available for Android and Apple phones, Primer will also work offline and is currently available in English and Hindi with Tamil, Telugu and Marathi versions coming shortly.  4) The US-based firm also previewed My Business Websites to help businesses to have a rich, mobile-optimised digital presence that will be launched later this year.  5) Google's My Business will help small businesses set up website from their mobile devices and all they need is a smart phone. 6) Google also launched Digital Unlocked, an education programme, in association with industry body FICCI and Indian School of Business.

As part of the demonstration, Panasonic Automotive and Qualcomm Technologies have integrated state-of-the-art Android 7.0 features to give drivers a unified experience across an automaker's entire vehicle lineup, adjusting for different applications, screen sizes and resolutions. This adaptive user interface design concept is a cost-saving feature that will allow OEMs to optimize their system engineering investments and customize the infotainment system across vehicle lineups. Using a Qualcomm [®] Snapdragon [™ ] 820Am processor, this concept system is based on the latest version of the Android operating system (7.0 Nougat), which is designed to provide automakers with a superior, high-performing platform to quickly develop cloud-connected infotainment systems, helping accelerate the rate of innovation in both the in-vehicle infotainment experience as well as the connected car. The concept system will demonstrate how new connected services and applications will deliver a safety-focused and intuitive driving experience to consumers. The next-generation infotainment demonstration takes advantage of the high-performing connectivity, multimedia and graphics capabilities integrated into the Snapdragon 820Am automotive processor, including integrated X12 LTE modem supporting up to 600 Mbps downlink and 150 Mbps uplink speeds, integrated location services, power-efficient, custom-built quad-core Qualcomm Kryo™ CPU, Qualcomm [® ] Hexagon™ 680 DSP, Qualcomm [®] Adreno [™] 530 GPU for video processing capabilities and support for multiple high-definition displays. "From the beginning, our goal was to create an in-vehicle infotainment system that shortened production time, minimized development cost for major OEMs globally, and allowed for more efficient evolutions as time and technology changes in mobility," said Tom Gebhardt, President, Panasonic Automotive Systems Company of America. "By working with Qualcomm Technologies and Google, we were able to accomplish that goal, resulting in an infotainment system concept that is innovative and future proof. This concept should be considered 'skip generation' technology, meaning that we expect it include features beyond that of the next two IVI generations ahead."  During CES 2017, Panasonic Automotive and Qualcomm Technologies are planning to showcase this latest IVI system built upon Android's automotive features that control in-vehicle functions such as HVAC, and demonstrate the integration of Google's services and popular Android applications with the system. "This has been an exciting collaboration of industry leaders where our combined technologies, innovations and engineering efforts have enabled us to demonstrate superior, highly intuitive, in-car infotainment systems," said Patrick Little, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Automotive, Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. "We look forward to continuing to work with Panasonic Automotive and Google to continually advance our Snapdragon automotive solutions to bring to life the advanced features and services of the Android experience." "Android has evolved into a turn-key automotive platform that enables automakers and suppliers to build powerful next-generation IVI systems," said Patrick Brady, Director of Android Engineering, Google. "We are excited to see industry leaders like Panasonic Automotive and Qualcomm Technologies integrate Android deeply with the car to provide drivers with a seamless connected experience." This next-generation IVI system concept features the Panasonic Automotive passenger application, which is designed to address the challenges that passengers have when entering navigation destinations or controlling music. Car manufacturers, automotive suppliers and developers can create Android-powered infotainment solutions initially with Qualcomm Technologies' Automotive Development Platforms (ADP), which utilizes Qualcomm [®] Snapdragon™ automotive system-on-chips, followed by production systems developed and manufactured by Panasonic Automotive. The concept IVI system will be on display at the Panasonic Booth (LVCC, Central Hall, 12908) throughout the duration of CES 2017, and also at the Qualcomm automotive booth (North Hall, #5609).

First up is the ASUS ZenFone AR. As expected, the ZenFone AR is the second Google Tango smartphone, offering a TriCam system with a 23-megapixel rear camera as well as motion tracking and depth sensing cameras. With this setup, you’ll be able to utilize the ZenFone AR for augmented reality features. The ZenFone AR also offers a 5.7-inch 2560x1440 AMOLED display, which is a bit smaller than the 6.4-inch screen found on the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro, the first Tango smartphone. This high-res display will be useful for Google’s Daydream VR platform, which is also supported by the ZenFone AR. Also included with the ZenFone AR’s spec list is a Snapdragon 821 processor and 8GB of RAM, both of which should help to keep performance smooth when you’re utilizing AR to visualize what a piece of furniture would look like in your home or exploring a VR world. Powering the ZenFone AR is Android 7.0 Nougat. The ZenFone AR will launch in Q2, but there’s no word yet on how much the ASUS ZenFone AR will cost. Also announced today is the ASUS ZenFone 3 Zoom. Like the ZenFone Zoom before it, the ZenFone 3 Zoom places a focus on its cameras. The phone has two 12-megapixel cameras on its backside, one with a 25mm wide angle lens and one with a 59mm lens as well as a 2.3x optical zoom. Other camera features include dual-pixel phase detection autofocus, subject tracking autofocus, and a new laser focus system. Another highlight feature of the ZenFone 3 Zoom is the phone’s battery. There’s a 5,000mAh battery crammed into the ZenFone 3 Zoom’s body, and this big battery can even be used as a power bank to charge other devices. Also included with the ZenFone 3 Zoom is a Snapdragon 625 processor. The ZenFone 3 Zoom will launch in February for an undisclosed price. Both of ASUS’s new Android phones are interesting. The ZenFone AR has support for both Google Tango and Google Daydream, but its 5.7-inch QHD display and 8GB of RAM will make it enticing to spec hounds, too. And then there’s the ZenFone 3 Zoom, which isn’t quite as high-end but packs special camera tricks and a huge battery. Now we just have to wait and see how the ZenFone 3 Zoom’s special camera setup actually performs.

At a CES 2017 press conference Casio revealed the WSD-F20, running the new Android Wear 2.0 OS. The successor to the WSD-F10 (which will also gain the update when Google eventually rolls it out), offers much the same design aside from new button guards and a protective bezel. Designed for outdoor types, the WSD-F20 adds low-power GPS and the ability to save offline maps, both of which are pretty vital when you’re out there in the wilderness and both lessen the reliance on the companion smartphone. The watch also brings a new feature called Location Memory, which will both mark down a location, and give you a read-out of your current position with a single press of a button. Casio has also added a feature called Moment Setter, which will allows wearers to pre-set notifications. This could include a heads-up when the sun sets or to indicate how much higher folks have to climb.

It’s also been granted a MIL-STD-801G rating against the elements. Casio says the 1.32-inch LCD display will also benefit from a low-power mode that will limit functionality but will provide battery life for a month. Normal usage is pegged at over a day.

Follow TechnoBuffalo Samsung unveiled two new Chromebooks during CES 2017. They were developed closely with Google, which says they’ll be the first notebooks on the market to have the Google Play Store for Android apps preloaded. They’re fine machines. In my few minutes with each I loved the compact size, comfortable keyboards for typing, full 360-degree hinges that allow you to turn them into tablets, the sharp Quad HD displays and more. I also dig that Samsung added support for quick charging, so you only have to spend about 10-15 minutes at the outlet for a few hours of charge. The metal design felt rock solid in my hands. The sides of the Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro are home to new ports, too, including two USB-C ports. That’s a welcome addition. Perhaps the most exciting change, however, is the inclusion of a stylus that slips right into a port in the side of the Chromebook. Samsung refused to call it an S Pen, which it says is reserved for its mobile products with access to its S Pen suite of software. You can use the stylus to jot down notes, take screenshots and more. Differences between Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro The primary difference between the Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro is the processor under the hood. You won’t notice anything aesthetically, so the pictures in the gallery above are of both devices. The Chromebook Plus uses an ARM chip while the Chromebook Pro employs Intel’s Core m3 processor. Here’s a look at how the rest of the specs measure up: Samsung said the Chromebook Plus will start at $449 when it launches in February in Best Buy and other major retailers. The Chromebook Pro will debut later, in the spring, and pricing was not announced.

We're talking about the Zenfone AR and Zenfone 3 Zoom. Asus Zenfone AR The Asus Zenfone AR is only the second ever handset to come with support for Tango, Google's augmented reality (AR) system. The Zenfone AR follows the Lenovo Phab2 Pro from last year in this nascent market. But the Asus model takes things one step further, since it also supports Daydream, Google's VR functionality built into Android Nougat. So if you get a Zenfone AR you can immerse yourself either in augmented reality or virtual reality, depending on your mood. Unfortunately though, you can't combine the two - for now you can only use Daydream apps when the phone is inside a Daydream VR headset, and Tango apps when it's in Tango mode. The Zenfone AR has a 5.7-inch QHD AMOLED touchscreen, and it's powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 821 chipset aided by a whopping 8GB of RAM - a world first. The main snapper is a 23 MP unit using Sony's IMX318 sensor, with OIS, EIS, and 4K video recording. Thanks to Google's Tango requirements, on the back there's also a motion tracking camera and a fisheye depth-sensing camera. The smartphone will be out in the second quarter of this year, so at some point in April, May, or June. Until then we should also learn its pricing and the rest of its specs, hopefully. Asus Zenfone 3 Zoom The Zenfone 3 Zoom still has a main camera with optical zoom like its predecessors called Zenfone Zoom from last year. However, this time around Asus went with the dual-camera solution, thus the magnification is just 2.3x compared to 3x in the original Zenfone Zoom. Like in the Apple iPhone 7 Plus, the new device's lenses work together to create the bokeh effect that blurs the background of your pictures while keeping the subject in focus. The zoom itself is fixed on one 12 MP lens, while the other lens is a 12 MP wide-angle 1/2.5" unit with f/1.7 aperture and Sony's IMX362 sensor. They both have 1.4nm pixels. OIS and EIS are on board too, along with 4K video capture. Autofocus time is claimed to be 0.03 seconds, even with a moving subject, thanks to three different focusing modes: Dual Pixel phase detection, laser, and continuous. The phone is 7.83mm thin and weighs 170g. It has a 5.5-inch 1080p touchscreen with Gorilla Glass 5 on top, the Snapdragon 625 SoC at the helm, and a huge 5,000 mAh battery. It will become available in February disappointingly running Android 6.0 Marshmallow, and we assume Asus will share details on its other specs until then.

PTI Photo by Kamal Kishore (PTI12_16_2015_000056B) New Delhi : To further tap into the 51-million strong small and medium businesses (SMBs) market in the country, Google’s India-born chief Sundar Pichai announced a number of initiatives to help these enterprises go digital. Pichai, who is scheduled to visit his alma mater IIT Kharagpur, said the company is working on products for India that can be expanded globally. “When we solve for a place like India, we solve for everyone around the world. That has led us to grow our team here and spend more time and ensure the products are useful for everyone,” he said at a Google event here. He added that SMBs are a growth driver for the Indian economy. “It is important that they have the right tools and skills to digitise. We believe it is important for us to invest in training and equipping these individuals and small businesses to accelerate their journey of growth,” he said. Over 8 million Indian SMBs are already using Google’s platforms. A joint research study by Google-KPMG estimates that 68 per cent of the 51 million Indian SMBs are offline. It also states rising Internet penetration and greater uptake for digital by SMBs could help increase their contribution to India’s GDP by 10 percentage points, taking it up to 46-48 per cent by 2020, reports PTI. Profits of digitally engaged SMBs grow twice as fast (compared to their offline peers) and they are also able to grow their customer base significantly, it added. The report cited the lack of understanding of the benefits of digital technologies and technical skills as the essential reasons for being offline. To overcome these challenges, Google has launched Digital Unlocked — a training programme to enable SMBs get online and start using Internet to grow their business. The training is being conducted with FICCI. Over the next three years, 5,000 workshops will be held across 40 Indian cities. The online training comprises a set of 90 self-paced video tutorials, curated specifically for India and will be available free of charge. The trainings are certified by Google, Indian School of Business and FICCI. Besides, it also launched Primer — a free mobile app uniquely designed to teach digital marketing skills in an interactive way. Available for Android and Apple phones, Primer will also work offline and is currently available in English and Hindi with Tamil, Telugu and Marathi versions coming shortly. The US-based firm also previewed My Business Websites to help businesses to have a rich, mobile-optimised digital presence that will be launched later this year.

Nathan Ingraham, @nateingraham 01.04.17 in Personal Computing Comments 818 Shares Share Tweet Share Save Late last year, I lamented that Google didn't make Chromebooks a priority over the holiday season. With Android apps and the Google Play Store coming to the platform, it seemed like a perfect time to push Chrome OS. As this morning's leak showed, I just needed to wait another month: Samsung and Google have just announced the Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro, a pair of laptops that strive to present the best Chrome OS experience a user can have. Gallery: Hands-on: Samsung's Chromebook Pro | 14 Photos 14 +10 Let's get the difference between the two models out of the way early: The cheaper Chromebook Plus uses an ARM processor while the Chromebook Pro features an Intel Core M3 processor. Neither is the most powerful out there, but in my quick tests, the Chromebook Pro seemed plenty snappy. I will note that an ARM processor is probably never going to provide the best Chromebook experience one can have, but I'll grudgingly reserve judgement until really testing it out. But everything else about the two computers is the same. Both have 12.3-inch displays with 2,400 x 1,600 screen resolution (and the same 3:2 aspect ratio of the Chromebook Pixel). But instead of making everything super tiny, the display scales things down to 1,200 x 800 by default. Don't worry, though, everything is super crisp and clear. Fortunately if you need more real estate, there are plenty of options here. Four gigs of RAM and 32GB of internal storage round out the basic spec sheet, and battery life is rated at eight hours. As you might expect, the screen is a touchscreen, all the better to use Android apps. In fact, this is the first Chromebook that'll come with Google Play pre-installed. The Chromebook Plus is scheduled to launch first, in February, and the Play Store will still be in beta. But when the Pro launches later this spring, it will come out of beta running with full Android Nougat support. These laptops truly represent the coming-out party of Android apps on Chrome OS. The screen has another unique trick to the Chromebook space, as well -- it's the first screen to support a stylus. Samsung has a lot of experience with the stylus, and it comes to bear here. There's a slot on the side of the computer to tuck the stylus in, and when you want to start writing you can pop it out, Galaxy Note style. Indeed, the stylus is basically identical to what Samsung has offered on the Note series in recent years. To make for a better note-taking experience, the Chromebook Plus and Pro both can flip their screens all the way around and work as a tablet. I've always been a bit dubious of the reversible screen tablet form factor, but these Chromebooks are light enough to make it workable, if not the most comfortable experience. At 2.38 pounds, you're not going to want to hold this up for long, but putting it down on the desk to take notes is works just fine. Once you start taking notes, Google's newest contribution to Chrome OS becomes clear. The Google Keep app has been redesigned with handwriting in mind. Using the company's vast amount of machine learning data, it can analyze your notes and make them searchable, so your handwritten notes are just as easy to find as things you type out. Those notes sync back to the cloud and are available and searchable in the Keep mobile app for iOS and Android, as well. Google is also using its machine learning chops to improve handwriting recognition and latency when writing notes. By analyzing a huge sample of handwritten notes, the Keep app can predict what you're most likely to be writing based on the first few letters you start drawing. It sounds similar to the autocomplete word suggestions that the iOS and Android keyboards give users, but just tuned to work with handwriting. Google says that thanks to this machine-learning assist, the Samsung Chromebooks have less latency than the Surface Pro when writing words. We were able to try writing both with and without Google's assisted writing feature, and there was no question: It's much faster and more accurate to take notes with it on. It made my chicken-scratch writing look a bit clearer, and things just flowed out of the stylus much better -- but it didn't feel unnatural, like the software was getting ahead of what I was writing. From a physical, build-quality perspective, the Chromebook Plus and Pro are the nicest pair of Chromebooks that I've seen this side of the Pixel. The all-aluminum construction makes them feel solid and strong, and the keyboard and trackpad both felt good in the all-too-short time I spent with them. I'm used to using a 13-inch laptop, so everything felt a little small here, but it wasn't too jarring and I expect most people will adjust pretty quickly. Fortunately, the keyboard is basically full-size, so typing won't be compromised. As for ports, the Plus and Pro are going all-in on USB-C, for both charging and connectivity. There are only two on board, but that's pretty standard for most Chromebooks these days. There's also a microSD card slot and a headphone jack, and that's all you'll get. The last thing to know about the Chromebook Plus and Pro is that they won't come cheap. I wouldn't have expected them to either; the construction here is on par with $1,000 laptops, at least at first glance. The Plus starts at $449, and it's reasonable to expect the Intel M3-toting Pro to cost $100 more (though Samsung had nothing to announce on that front yet). That puts this computer into a place that few Chromebooks have ever seen. The closest comparison is probably HP's Chromebook 13, which starts at $500 and goes up significantly from there. But Samsung's new Chromebooks appear to have more solid construction, are lighter and -- most importantly -- are ready for Google Play, which will significantly expand the functionality of Chrome OS. Google says it remains committed to the Chromebook Pixel line, but until it releases another model in that lineup, it's fair to say that Samsung's Chromebook Pro has assumed the mantle of everything a Chromebook can be in 2017. Of course, we'll need to give it a thorough review to make sure it delivers on that promise.Click here to catch up on the latest news from CES 2017.

This new Chromebook is Samsung and Google's answer to the iPad Pro.Posted by The Verge on Wednesday, January 4, 2017 Live coverage from the year's biggest technology conference, the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas. The year in tech starts here. Following months of leaks, Samsung is today making its latest Chromebook official. The new computer is actually two models — the Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro — and is the first one built from the ground up with support for Android apps. It’s also the first Chromebook to come with a stylus and support on-screen inking. The Chromebook Plus will be available starting this February for $449; the virtually-identical-save-for-a-different-processor Chromebook Pro will arrive later this year for a to-be-determined-but-definitely-higher price. Google and Samsung collaborated on the new device, which features a 12.3-inch, 2400 x 1600 pixel LED display; 4GB of RAM; two USB Type-C ports, which support charging and 4K video output; a MicroSD card slot; and 32GB of internal storage. It has an all-metal chassis and weighs just under two and a half pounds and is just over half an inch thick when closed. The 360-degree hinge lets the device switch between laptop and tablet modes, much like many convertible Windows laptops available on the market. The only difference between the Chromebook Plus and Chromebook Pro, save for price, is the processor inside; the Plus has an ARM-based chip, while the Pro uses an Intel Core M3 processor. Samsung says that both models are rated for eight hours of battery life between charges. Dan Seifert / The Verge What makes the Samsung unique, of course, is its included stylus, which can be used to write on the screen, grab screenshots, or as a “laser pointer” to highlight things. (Eagle-eyed readers might notice that it’s virtually the same stylus included with the Galaxy Note 5 smartphone, just without a button on its side.) The stylus slides into a slot on the side of the computer and a menu of options pops up on the screen when you remove it. Google uses cloud technology to improve writing with the stylus The stylus can be used to take notes in Google Keep, which are then instantly synced and available for search through Google’s optical character recognition technology. Google is also using its cloud services to improve the inking experience when writing — according to the company, it can predict where you’ll move the pen next, which improves response and makes writing or drawing feel more natural on the display. Kan Liu, senior director of product management for Chrome OS, says that the technology makes the Chromebook’s stylus more responsive than the Surface Pen used with Microsoft’s Surface Pro and Surface Book. Stylus support and the flexibility to switch between modes are a big part of Google’s pitch for the device, which is said to work for both productivity and entertainment. It’s the same pitch Apple gives for the iPad Pro and Microsoft gives for the Surface Pro, though Google says only the Chromebook combines a desktop-class browser with the wealth of mobile apps provided by the Google Play store. Liu says that this kind of flexibility could make the Chromebook Plus and Pro more appealing to consumers, as opposed to the education and enterprise markets that have made up most of the Chromebook user base so far. Grid View In a brief demo of the devices, I found the build quality and performance to be satisfactory. The display is very vibrant and colorful, and the Chromebook was able to run Android games such as Asphalt 8 without any issues. It’s definitely not something I’d want to use as a tablet for long periods of time, but it could be a good Netflix machine in the propped up tent mode. While the build quality doesn’t come anywhere close to the Chromebook Pixel and the keyboard’s typing experience is a far cry from the best you can get, both are suitable and appropriate for the Chromebook Plus’ price point. I found using the stylus to be satisfactory, as well, whether I was writing or drawing with it. In my experience, it is on par with the Apple Pencil and Surface Pen, though not noticeably or significantly better. Google says that Keep is the only app that currently supports the cloud-based predictive technology, but there will be an API for other app developers to tap into. Whether or not these new Chromebooks ignite a fire among consumers remains to be seen, but they do appear to be competent devices with fewer restrictions than earlier ChromeOS machines. We’ll have more to say on the Chromebook Plus and Pro experience once we’re able to test final versions later this year.

In a complaint filed today, the Department says Google refused to provide compensation data as part of an anti-discrimination audit, and seeks a court order forcing the company to comply. The case stems from Google’s federal contracting business, which provides advertising and cloud computing services to a number of federal agencies. As a federal contractor with more than $10,000 in business, it is subject to specific rules against racial or religious discrimination, and must cooperate with government audits to ensure that it complies with those rules. The lawsuit doesn’t allege that Google actually engaged in discrimination, only that it dragged its heels as the Department of Labor conducted the necessary audit. According to the complaint, officers launched the audit in September 2015, requesting a series of compensation snapshots drawn from current Google employees that could be compared over time. A few months later, Google replied with a letter declining to produce the some of the data. Google says it withheld that data for privacy reasons, but has produced hundreds of thousands of records over the course of the audit. “We’ve worked hard to comply with the OFCCP’s current audit,” a Google spokesperson said in a statement. “However, the handful of OFCCP requests that are the subject of the complaint are overbroad in scope, or reveal confidential data, and we've made this clear to the OFCCP, to no avail. These requests include thousands of employees’ private contact information which we safeguard rigorously. We hope to continue working with OFCCP to resolve this matter.” Such audits can often unearth evidence that leads to larger anti-discrimination suits. In September, Palantir was sued by the Department of Labor for discriminating against Asian job applicants. Palantir has denied the allegations. 5:20PM ET: Updated with comment from Google.

But one thing that has been holding Google Tango back as of yet has been the lack of compelling applications that take advantage of the Tango hardware. Now, Google says that dozens of Tango-enabled apps should be hitting the Play Store over the next few months. Johnny Lee, the Director of Engineering for Google Tango, said the following at ASUS Zennovation event at CES 2017: In addition to growing the number of Tango enabled hardware devices, we expect dozens of Tango enabled apps to be coming out in the next few months. Already in the Google Play Store are a few classic games with AR twists on them. This includes games like Hot Wheels and Dominos. And there’s also utility apps that help you visualize products in your place, like Wayfarer and Lowes. Johnny Lee demoed one new app for Tango at the event: an app from GAP that lets you visualize how clothing sizes and fit. For an idea of the Tango experiences available right now, check out Google’s Play Store collection of apps — currently totaling 32. Toward the end of Johnny’s segment, he further reassured us that Google is actively working to engage developers and help them make better apps and games: So, in through 2017 we will be heavily focused on developers, finding new partners who are really want to create new and great experiences and continue to refine the technology, making things better and increasing the capabilities or APIs leading ultimately to richer apps and games. It goes without saying that this is good (and necessary) news for Tango, but the Tango app ecosystem is still in its infancy. It’s still to be seen if the coming apps can make the platform compelling for consumers and for Android OEMs who are considering making their own Tango-enabled devices. That said, the ZenFone AR is definitely the most compelling Tango device yet.

Both feature 360-degree rotating touchscreens, a built-in stylus, quad high-definition screens, 4 GB of RAM, 32 GB of storage, and more. The Samsung Chromebook Plus will be priced at $449 and will go on sale February 12 with the beta version of the Google Play Store installed. The Chromebook Pro has not been priced, but will be slightly more expensive than the Plus, and is expected to go on sale later this spring. At that time, the final version of the Google Play Store will also be available. “Since launching our first Chromebook over five years ago, we have continued to improve the product, developing a computer that not only fits into consumers’ lifestyles, but makes their lives easier, more mobile and more productive,” remarked Samsung’s vice president of product marketing Alanna Cotton in a statement. There are several differences between the two new computers, with the Pro being geared more towards power users. Additionally, the Plus is equipped with an OP1 processor and internal graphics card, while the Pro has an Intel Core M3 processor and an Intel HD Graphics 515 card. Aside from that, the specifications on both devices are exactly the same — USB Type-C power adapter, microSD port, 12.3-inch 2400×1600 LED display, 2.38 pounds, AirDroid Premium support for 1 year, and more. Above: The Samsung Chromebook Pro and Plus features a 360-degree touchscreen display. Image Credit: Ken Yeung/VentureBeat In a first for Chromebooks, Samsung has embedded a stylus that lets you write and draw on the screen — but don’t call it an S-Pen. The company made it clear that the name specifically references options and software that had been made for its mobile devices, such as the now-defunct Note7. For the Chromebooks, Samsung opted to develop a separate set of tools for the pen. While Chromebooks may start to blend in with one another, the Pro and Plus are unique in that they’re the only two to have hardware specifically built around the new Chrome OS, which was announced at last year’s Google I/O conference and began rolling out in September. What this means is now you can bring your favorite Android apps directly onto your Chromebook, and since touch is a prominent part of that experience, both the Samsung Chromebook Pro and Plus are the two devices that support that. Above: The stylus pen that accompanies the Samsung Chromebook Pro and Plus. Image Credit: Ken Yeung/VentureBeat But there are other Chromebooks that offer a variation of the new Chrome OS, including the Flip, R11, and Pixel, just not with the latest hardware refinements. Google said that it will continue to support older model Chromebooks to a point, but had no additional announcements. It also revealed that while Samsung is the first to offer these new computers, Google is planning on working with other manufacturers to expand its lineup. “With the Chromebook Plus and Pro, we’re partnering with Google to pair a sleek design with supreme flexibility, encouraging users to experience more with Google Play and Android apps, while continuing to provide simplicity, top-rated security and shareability inherent in Chromebooks,” Cotton said. You can purchase the Chromebook Plus and Pro at Samsung.com, Amazon, and BestBuy. ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat. All rights reserved.

It also might hint at where more phones are likely to be headed over the next few years. Previously leaked by Qualcomm, the Asus ZenFone AR is indeed real and coming later this year (by the end of the second quarter, in fact -- no pricing details yet). The phone is compatible with Google's Daydream View VR headset and apps, but it also has a revamped tri-camera system that can achieve depth sensing 3D scanning and augmented reality through Google Tango. 12 ZenFone AR is Daydreamy The only other Tango phone in existence is the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro, a huge 6-plus-inch monster phone we reviewed last year and had mixed feelings about. Tango's AR is promising, but it's a work in progress. The ZenFone AR, however, has a little more going on under the hood. It has a faster Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor, and boasts a "vapor cooling" system to keep the whole phone from overheating when running VR and AR. Or, maybe, both at once. According to Asus, the processor is optimized for computer vision and "six degrees of freedom" tracking, which refers to the motion-tracking and smart camera features that make Tango AR work. 50 All the cool new gadgets at CES 2017 It's also smaller than Lenovo's first Tango phone, with a 5.7-inch screen. Part of that is due to a trimmed-down Tango camera design: a "Tri-Cam" system combines motion, depth-sensing and a 23-megapixel camera into a smaller housing on the back. It makes a difference. The Phab 2 Pro was heavy and thick; the ZenFone AR feels so light and slim, we almost questioned whether it had the battery inside (it did). But our hands-on time with the ZenFone AR left us cold and unmoved. Asus hadn't loaded the demo devices with any of the AR apps shown on stage during the phone's unveiling. In fact, there were no AR apps at all. So while the ZenFone AR is remarkably slim and light, it's impossible to say if using Tango and Daydream together on a phone broadens our experience using a phone -- we'll be forced to wait for a review unit to find out. Bridging the gap Still, we can speculate. The ZenFone AR could bridge the gap between augmented and virtual. Tango and Daydream were brought under one umbrella last year, and it seems like Google's intent is to explore how both will involve each other. Down the road, VR-ready phones equipped with position-tracking advanced cameras could enable further blending of virtual and real. For comparison, look at the Occipital Bridge, a mixed-reality iPhone headset that can do things like 3D-scan rooms and display them as VR experiences with virtual objects added. Google hasn't announced any deeper plans for Tango and Daydream intersections yet. There aren't many killer Tango apps either, but there are a growing set of good Daydream VR apps including YouTube, Netflix, Street View and EA's Need for Speed. Apps, along with Google's support of both platforms, will determine how useful a blend of Tango and Daydream on a phone will really be. 12 ZenFone AR is Daydreamy Specifications and features 5.7-inch Super AMOLED display (2,560x1,440 pixels) Android 7.0 Nougat 6GB RAM Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor 23-megapixel camera (Sony IMX318 image sensor) with four-axis OIS and three-axis video stabilization, 4K video recording, improved low light mode Update 2:12 p.m. PT: Added hands-on impressions from CES.

The player had arrived seemingly out of the blue in late December, identifying as “Master(P)” or “Magister(P),” and knocking down the best in the world in short-lived games on two platforms. It turns out this was a situation like Superman showing up as Clark Kent to a strong-man contest. Google had sent a ringer. And that ringer was AlphaGo, the artificial intelligence software famous for mopping the floor last year with Lee Sedol, an 18-time world champion in Go, considered the hardest board game on the planet. Master(P) or Magister(P) is a new AlphaGo prototype, Google’s Demis Hassabis revealed Jan. 4 in a Twitter post. “We’re excited by the results and also by what we and the Go community can learn from some of the innovative and successful moves played by the new version of AlphaGo,” said Hassabis, CEO of Google’s DeepMind AI unit. The new AlphaGo played more than 50 games, winning all but one that was deemed a tie when the other player’s network connection timed out, according to a report in the journal Nature. A Chinese professional Go player had offered a $14,000 reward for anyone who could beat the mystery contestant, according to Nature. The new AlphaGo had an advantage in the online games, because they’re played faster, which favors the computer over the human player, a freelance Go program developer told Nature. Hassabis said the software would play official, full-length games later this year.  “How strong it will be in more high-profile tournaments remains unclear, because the rules of such matches differ from those played in online forums,” Nature reported.   Photo: South Korean professional Go player Lee Sedol reviews the match after finishing the second match of the Google DeepMind Challenge Match against Google’s artificial intelligence program, AlphaGo in Seoul, South Korea, Thursday, March 10, 2016.

The Office of Federal Contract Compliance Programs had in September asked Google to submit particular information, according to a news release Jan. 4 from the labor department. “As a federal contractor, Google must agree to permit the federal government to inspect and copy records and information relevant to its compliance with the equal employment laws,” the labor department said. “Despite many opportunities to produce this information voluntarily, Google has refused to do so. We filed this lawsuit so we can obtain the information we need to complete our evaluation.” The suit was filed Jan. 4. A Google spokesperson said the firm was “very committed” to its affirmative action obligations and had “worked hard” to comply with the audit, providing hundreds of thousands of records over the past year, including some related to compensation. But a “handful” of requests at issue in the lawsuit “are overbroad in scope, or reveal confidential data,” the spokesperson said. “These requests include thousands of employees’ private contact information which we safeguard rigorously.” Google said it hoped to continue working with the department to “resolve this matter.” The lawsuit asked the court to ensure that if Google failed to produce the data, all its federal government contracts would be cancelled and the firm couldn’t obtain any more. Google was asked for information about jobs and pay, and for employees’ contact information, according to the lawsuit. Google’s acceptance of federal government contracts carries the legal obligation to hand over the data, the suit said. The audit is a routine compliance check, according to the department.   Photo: Technology workers outside Google.

Native YouTube Support It’s now possible to watch YouTube videos in the Google app without having to open a new web page or open the separate YouTube app. If your search returns a carousel of YouTube videos on the front page, as shown in the example below, then tapping on one will have it load instantly in the app’s native YouTube player. Interestingly enough, if you select a video from the ‘Videos’ tab it will not open within the app. Those videos still need to be opened in the YouTube app. It seems the new feature only applies to video cards on the front page of search results. Hotel Searches Another new feature in Google’s iOS app involves hotel searches. Now, when you search for the name of a hotel and expand the Knowledge Graph box, you’ll see a new section for rates and booking info. An example is shown below. Restaurant Searches Restaurant searches have also been revamped in Google’s iOS app. Knowledge Graph cards for restaurants now have a new ‘Menu’ section. Tapping on the menu option will load it within the app without having to visit an external page. Unannounced Feature: Built-in Gboard Google’s iOS app changelog only mentions the three new features listed above, but it has been discovered there is a 4th and unannounced new feature. With the latest version of Google’s iOS app installed, users can change their keyboard to Google’s Gboard without having the third-party keyboard installed on their phone. This can be done by going to Settings > General > Keyboard > Keyboards > Add New Keyboard > select Google. Having both the Google app and Gboard installed on one’s phone is now redundant since you can now get Gboard by updating your Google app. Related Posts Search from Your iPhone’s Keyboard with New Google Gboard Google Takes on Twitch With a New YouTube App Built for Gamers Videos on Facebook: Native vs YouTube.

Of course, we had a feeling that such a phone would get a reveal thanks to an early leak from Qualcomm, but at this point, that’s neither here nor there. The ZenFone AR has been made official, and it packs support for Google Tango and Daydream into the same device. That’s a pretty big deal, because so far, the only support we’ve seen for Google’s Tango augmented reality platform was in the Lenovo Phab 2 Pro. Just as well, only a small number of handsets support Google’s virtual reality platform Daydream at this early stage. So far, there hasn’t been a single phone that supports both, but that’s about to change with the ZenFone AR. During its press conference, ASUS spent a lot of time talking about the ZenFone AR’s TriCam system. That amount of promotion is justifiable, as Google Tango needs quite the set up to implement its vision for augmented reality. As the name suggests, the ZenFone AR’s TriCam System uses three different cameras – one for motion tracking, one for depth sensing, and a final 23MP camera to capture high resolution images. All three of those are necessary for Tango, which uses its area learning, depth perception, and motion tracking capabilities to offer a more fully-featured AR experience than many will be used to. Fulfilling the needs of Tango is just one part of the equation, however. The ZenFone 3 needs to be similarly well-equipped to handle the demands of Daydream as well, and it certainly seems to be capable in that regard. The phone’s 5.7-inch Super AMOLED display outputs at a sharp 2560×1440 resolution, so you should be able to get a good Daydream experience out of this device. In fact, the ZenFone AR appears to be almost perfectly tuned for both AR and VR, with neither taking a backseat to the other. It’s encouraging to see that ASUS isn’t making guesses about which platform will be more popular. Instead, it feels like the ZenFone AR treats both Tango and Daydream with equal importance, giving both the components they need to work at optimal levels. Obviously, AR and VR will both be CPU intensive tasks, which is why the ZenFone AR will be the first commercially available Tango phone to use the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821. The 14nm 821 offers a lot of power – enough to meet the needs of Tango and Daydream – while at the same time ramping up efficiency over previous Snapdragon SoCs. The ZenFone AR will need all the extra battery power it can get, so it’s good to have the Sanpdragon 821 along for the ride. ASUS has also revealed that the ZenFone AR will feature a whopping 8GB of RAM and an “advanced vapor cooling” system, but strangely didn’t mention anything about the capacity of its battery. As we’ve already touched on, battery life is going to be important in a phone that looks to tackle AR and VR, so that’s a pretty crucial statistic to leave out. Unlike the ZenFone 3 Zoom, the ZenFone AR is still a ways off, so there’s plenty of time for ASUS to reveal more details. The ZenFone AR won’t be launching until sometime in Q2 2017, and for the moment, we don’t know how much it’ll cost either. While we imagine it’s going to sport a premium price tag, we’re now left to wait on ASUS for an official number. Stay tuned for more!

But in an update posted on Twitter earlier this morning, Google has admitted that the mystery account "Master", as well as a second account "Magister", was their world-beating AlphaGo bot all along. The revelation came courtesy of a statement posted by Demis Hassabis, co-founder and chief executive of the Deepmind artificial intelligence company. Deepmind was bought out by Google in 2014, and the same company is responsible for building the machine learning algorithms that powered the AlphaGo AI - the latter of which became the first Go-playing bot to defeat a professional Go player last year. Excited to share an update on #AlphaGo! pic.twitter.com/IT5HGBmYDr — Demis Hassabis (@demishassabis) January 4, 2017 The revelation is only partial vindication to the Go community: while the general consensus was that "Master" was an AI - who racked up 51 wins straight before being forced into a tie on its 52nd game thanks to an old-fashioned disconnect - people didn't believe Google was responsible. After all, they were the same company who made such pomp and circumstance out of the five-match series against Lee Sedol. And as of yesterday, AlphaGo was the second highest ranked Go player in the world. Surely, if Google was going to unleash something that powerful on online Go, they wouldn't do so without saying anything. But as it turns out, that's exactly what Google did. It really is a bit like that episode from Hikaru No Go, where Hikaru spends time in an internet cafe so his ghost mentor and legendary Go champion Sai can play matches to his heart's delight. Perhaps the most lovely part of all of this has been the reception from the Go community. Rather than acting with shock and dismay towards Google, the general response has been one of excitement - possibly partly because people can witness more matches featuring AlphaGo, giving everyone a new world of moves and strategies to study and learn. Comment from discussion Official announcement from DeepMind about AlphaGo. It's the real deal. AlphaGo is probably absolutely unbeatable in its current state. #baduk #go #weiqi #igo https://t.co/QyhPiEYcA5 — Sherico Dela Cruz (@Mithfalath_) January 4, 2017 Ke Jie, the current #1 ranked player in Go who fell victim - twice - to AlphaGo's online rampage, posted on Weibu that he was aware of AlphaGo's identity. "Thanks for the shock and awe the latest version of AlphaGo provided us," he wrote, according to a fan translation. "As someone who knew its identity from the beginning, I'd have loved to see us human winning a blitz game. If not for being in the hospital, I'd have tried one last response that I prepared for a week...slight regret, and hope Gu Li can play to the best of our human ability in this final game of AlphaGo beta test." AlphaGo is due to play more official matches this year, although the next step is to see how well AlphaGo plays under long time constraints. (The matches played on the online Korean and Chinese servers were under blitz time formats, with AlphaGo making all of its moves in less than 10 seconds.) Nonetheless, you'd have to favour AlphaGo in any format right now - and it's fascinating to watch, regardless of the format. Comments Casual Prolix @germinalconsequence Jan 5, 2017, 9:11pm Not really a surprise. I imagine that Google was keeping it quiet because they either didn't want a flood of people challenging the machine or they wanted to see if people could work out that it was an AI. Kind of like a Turing test for board game AI. Reply 0 Join the discussion! Log In Sign Up Guest Access Join the discussion! Cancel Reply Log In / Sign Up Name Email You are starting a new discussion.

The Linux Foundation Kubernetes is a hugely popular open source project, one that is in the top percentile on GitHub and that has spawned more than 3,000 other projects. And although the distributed application cluster technology is incredibly powerful in its own right, that’s not the sole reason for its success. “We think it’s not just the technology, we think that what makes it special is the community that builds the technology,” said Chen Goldberg, Director of Engineering, Container Engine and Kubernetes at Google, during her keynote at CloudNativeCon in Seattle last November. Goldberg explained how that community works by pointing to three key areas for keeping Kubernetes moving forward: empowering internal special interest groups (SIGs), a commitment to transparency, and a culture of shared learning. Kubernetes’ SIGs are intertwined; they don’t map to different GitHub repositories. They meet frequently and communicate among each other as often as possible. Goldberg said that the SIGs exist to ensure the community is thinking about how to make the technology as broad and accessible as possible, that every facet of the project is making Kubernetes useful to more people. “Everything in the Kubernetes community is operating around SIGs,” she said. “They decide what features they want to work on. They discuss roadmap strategy. They triage issues towards the release. They make decisions. That's the most important thing. When a community is so big, we have to grow leadership and distribute it.” Hand in hand with that distributed approach is the commitment to transparency. Through the use of the features repository on GitHub, SIGs ensure their alignment, get new members caught up to speed, and generally just conduct business out in the open. There is a project management working group that reviews all features, highlights new breakthroughs, and keeps the SIGs working together. “We want to make sure that you are informed of decisions if things are happening in the community,” Goldberg said. There are frequent “burndown” sessions, post-mortems, and other community meetings to keep everyone on the same page and to make sure new features live up to the community’s high standards. “We take it really seriously, the responsibility for your productions,” Goldberg said. “It means that when we release something, we want to make sure that we put the quality bar really high. We make a community decision when we are ready to release something. We will triage issues together ... We want to make sure it works for you.” The final vital element -- a culture of shared learning -- is really a nod to the fact that everyone is in uncharted territory with this new technology. There are many great ideas inside the Kubernetes community about what could work, but that’s a far stretch from knowing what does work. “We don't know everything,” Goldberg said. “I would lie if I would say it's easy to manage such a big community. We make mistakes. The important thing is the community, we're engaged to learn together and to improve.” To learn more, watch the complete presentation below: Do you need training to prepare for the upcoming Kubernetes certification?

The 6-inch leviathan boasted cutting-edge depth-sensing and motion-tracking tech, but it wasn’t perfect. Lenovo’s handset suffered from a subpar camera, middling display, and occasional tracking problems — issues Asus aims to rectify with its first Project Tango attempt, the ZenFone AR. The ZenFone AR’s depth-tracking sensors react to forward, backward, and strafing motions — if you take a step forward in a Tango game, digital objects on the screen stay in perspective as you circle around or duck under them. Project Tango can identify objects in the real world, like a desk in a living room and the walls of a home office. And even more usefully, it can calculate the dimensions of those objects. Want to get a bed’s length? The ZenFone will provide the measurements in your metric of choice. More: Ultraslim Asus notebook could be getting flagship GeForce GPU The ZenFone AR — the latest addition to Asus’ ZenFone line of smartphones — is the “thinnest” and “lightest” device to support Tango, a feat made possible by Asus’s proprietary TriCam system: A 23-megapixel PixelMaster 3.0 primary camera, a motion-tracking camera, and an infrared camera in a configuration that “reduces their footprint within the phone.” Some of those same sensors enable support for Daydream, Google’s virtual reality environment. It’s the spiritual successor to Google’s debut VR effort, Google Cardboard, but far more holistic in scope: it consists of three components; a headset, a motion controller, and a suite of virtual reality apps including HBO, YouTube, Hulu, Gunjack, Hunters Gate, and more. More: Google Tango-Enabled Asus ZenFone AR accidentally leaked by Qualcomm It’s worth noting that not all of those components come in the box. Prospective buyers will need to shell out for a Daydream-compatible virtual reality headset like Google’s Daydream View. Rumor has it that the company’s working on an self-contained augmented reality headset with Tango-like tracking technology, but it’s unclear whether it’ll interface with the ZenFone AR. The rest of the ZenFone AR’s hardware isn’t anything to scoff at. It packs Qualcomm’s Tango-optimized Snapdragon 821 and Adreno 530 graphics card — not the silicon behemoth’s latest processor, granted (that’s the Snapdragon 835), but one that Qualcomm guarantees delivers “VR with high-resolution display, ultra-smooth graphics and high-fidelity sensors for precise head tracking.” And it sports a massive 8GB of RAM (a world’s first), a 5.7-inch WQHD (2,560 x 1,440 pixels) Super AMOLED screen, and a powerful five-magnet speaker system. Cooling all that hardware is a vapor-cooling system which Asus says enables the CPU and GPU to work “more efficiently,” and delivers “enhanced performance to prevent overheating.” New Tango apps The ZenFone AR is launching alongside new augmented reality experiences from Asus. The smartphone maker partnered with Gap to develop Dressing Room, an augmented reality experience that lets users “try on” the clothing retailer’s latest fashions. And it teamed up with BMW to develop the i Visualizer, a Tango-enabled app that allows users to configure, customize, and walk around BMW’s i3 and i8 cars in a digital environment. The BMW app is launching in select BMW dealerships in the U.S., U.K., Germany, Norway, Spain, Italy, Poland, Belgium, Netherlands, China, and Japan in the coming weeks. Later this year, it will become more broadly available from the Google Play store. More: Everything you need to know about Google Daydream “In our initial tests, as people entered the car virtually in the app, we saw them ducking down, as if there were really a roof there for them to bang their heads on. It’s a level of detail which means this technology offers the customers real added value,” BMW’s group vice president of sales strategy and future retail said in a press release. “You can list out a car’s features on a sheet of paper or a webpage, but this doesn’t help customers with the emotional connection […] Videos can help, but Tango gives people a much more immersive experience.” Pricing and availability Mum’s the word on the Asus ZenFone’s battery life, unfortunately. And Asus has yet to share pricing and availability details — previously, Asus CEO Jerry Chen said the ZenFone AR would launch “at a competitive price.” But we’re expecting to learn more after the company’s press conference on Wednesday.

With around 400 million internet users, a number which is estimated to go up to 750 million by 2020, India has already become the second largest user base in the world. Ravi Shankar Prasad speaking at Google’s Digital Unlocked. However, amidst this digital growth, the threat of cyber security has also increased. This was a concern Ravi Shankar Prasad, Minister of Communications and Information Technology and Law and Justice, voiced at Google’s Digital Unlocked event in New Delhi today. Addressing Sundar Pichai, the minister appealed to Google to be more involved in this transformation. He called on the Google CEO to do more with regard to digital security and to help India fight the threat of cyber crimes. He also spoke about the country’s movement towards the Digital India ideal. In his speech, he cited the example of Sadamma, a 70-year-old beedi worker from Telangana, who can be seen as the face of this transformation — the septuagenarian, who doesn’t know how to read and write, is digitally literate. She not only operates her phone deftly but also chats with her son on Skype. The minister said it was a need that led her towards adopting technology. When he interacted with Sadamma, she explained that her son works as a plumber in a different country and visits her every year or two and she naturally wanted to see him more often. When she found out it was possible to chat with him face-to-face, she picked up the basics of Skype. She can now see her son whenever she wishes. “There are many such stories out there which ratify how India is transforming into Digital India,” Prasad said. According to the minister, although it was unfortunate that India missed not only the Industrial Revolution of the 19th century but also the entrepreneurial revolution of the ’80s and ’90s, the digital revolution is one the country can’t afford to miss. In fact, India will lead the world in this regard, he said. Counting the schemes introduced by the present government, Prasad added that Digital India, Skill India, Startup India, and Make in India are the tools with which India will be transformed. The minister emphasised the way the country is already adopting the digital payment system. In 2014, the total number of online transactions was 10 million. In 2015, the number rose to 15 million. By the end of December 2016, the country witnessed 30.5 million digital transactions per day. He said, “I see India turning into a trillion-dollar economy in the next three years. And this economy is also going to be a digital hub which will offer plenty of opportunities in the field of cyber security.” (Photo by Manoj Upadhyaya) Calling all startups in mobility and transport sector! Apply now for the Indo-German bootcamp and get a chance to be mentored by industry experts and showcase your products.

The phone features a 2560 x 1440 pixel resolution Super AMOLED screen, and a 79 percent screen-to-body ratio. Asus’ TriCam system is along for the ride to offer motion tracking, area learning, and depth perception for virtual reality and augmented reality experiences. The company partnered with the Gap for an impressive demonstration of its Google Tango support during its CES press conference. A virtual mannequin was shown on the camera’s screen with clothing of the user’s choice, allowing them to walk around to see how the garment looked from different angles. In the demonstration an Asus representative selected clothing sizes to get an idea how they would look on different body types. Want to compare multiple sizes at the same time? No problem, put multiple mannequins side by side to see how the medium and the large compare. This experience was driven by an app the Gap will be publishing to the Play Store later this year. Need to keep the kids occupied while you try on clothes? There’s a Hot Wheels app that lets you interact with virtual toy car tracks, either ones you create yourself or pre-made challenges. With a traditional AR app you might have to use on-screen controls to manipulate objects, but with the ZenFone AR, the phone itself is used as a controller. For example, you can raise and lower the phone in order to move pieces of track. The Hot Wheels app is already available in the Play Store. Qualcomm and Asus indicates that this is the first phone with a Snapdragon 821 optimized for Tango and the world’s first phone with 8GB of RAM. Asus also touted the phone’s vapour cooling system.

  [caption id="attachment_241189" align="aligncenter" width="700"] Google CEO Sundar Pichai[/caption] Aiming to give a technological edge to the small and medium businesses (SMBs) in India, Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Wednesday announced two initiatives 'Digital Unlocked' and 'My Business Website'. "Small businesses are the backbone of India's economy. Internet is for everyone," Pichai said, addressing the media. "The Internet is a powerful equaliser and we are motivated to bring the benefits of information and technology to as many people as possible," he said. "Building for everyone and making it available in the hands of as many people is at the heart and core of what we do. And we do this by investing in open ecosystem," Pichai added. Pichai said that Google, along with the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci), has developed a training programme called 'Digital Unlocked', to empower thousands of Indian SMBs with essential digital skills that would enable them to get online and start using the power of the internet to grow their businesses. The programme would be certified by Google, Ficci and Indian School of Business - Hyderabad. It would offer online and mobile courses to SMBs across the country. "We plan to impart 5,000 training workshops in 40 cities in three years," he added. The global search giant also started another initiative 'My Business Website'. It is a free tool, which would help make a website in 10 minutes. "Any small business can sign up. Internet is as much for the local players as it is for a high-flying one. It will first start in India (later this year), and then will be launched in other countries," Pichai said. 'My Business Website' would be available in English, Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Marathi, Tamil, Urdu, Gujarati, Kannada, and Malayalam languages. There are around 51 million small and medium scale businesses in India. Google unveiled a joint research study with KPMG titled "Impact of internet and digitization on SMBs in India", which said that 68 per cent of the 51 million Indian SMBs were offline. "Profits grow twice as fast for those SMBs who have digital business," Google's Vice President, South-East Asia and India, Rajan Anandan said. The micro small and medium entreprises contribute 37 per cent to the Indian gross domestic products (GDP), he added. Further, for India's mobile-first audience, Google also launched Primer, a free mobile app uniquely designed to teach digital marketing skills in a quick, easy and interactive way. Primer also works offline and is currently available in English and Hindi. Tamil, Telugu and Marathi versions are coming up shortly. Appreciating all the initiatives by Google, IT and Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said: "Google is as much an Indian company as American."

ADVERTISEMENT Over the past seven days, the firm has announced new wireless headphones, a levitating speaker and today it unveiled its latest smart home products including a household robot that is a cute rival to Amazon Echo and Google Home. Called Hub Robot, the household robot is a cross between Bicentennial Man (in function, rather than looks), and looks like it comes straight out of a Pixar film. It connects to other smart appliances in the home and uses Amazon Alexa’s voice recognition technology to carry out tasks. LG's examples include turning on the air conditioner or changing a dryer cycle. In the UK, this is more likely to be switching on lights or adjusting the heating.

And like Amazon and Google's products, it also plays music, sets alarms, and gives weather and news updates. LG unveiled industrial and home robots at CES LG Unlike Amazon and Google's devices, however, LG’s Hub Robot moves and swivels in place and shows "a wide range of emotions" using a face on its display. It is also said to be able to respond to body language and has facial recognition so it identifies family members and knows when they're in the room, or have gone to bed. As a result, it can be programmed with a different greeting for each family member.

Other LG robots unveiled ahead of the Consumer Electronic Show include a robot that mows your lawn. Unsurprisingly named the Lawn Mowing Robot, this device uses the principles of a vacuum cleaner to trim grass. It has sensors and bumpers and can map any lawn to avoid obstacles. Outside of the home, LG also showcased the Airport Guide Robot, which will soon be trialled in Seoul’s Incheon International Airport. It answers questions in four languages including English, Chinese, Japanese and Korean and can give passengers details about their flight by scanning their tickets. There is also an Airport Cleaning Robot which is a glorified smart vacuum. “LG has been involved in smart technology and robotics for many years with the HOM-BOT robot vacuum cleaner being our most visible consumer effort,” said Song Dae-hyun, president of LG’s home appliance and air solutions company. “Here at CES, we’re demonstrating how we’re taking the knowledge gleaned from years of research and applying that to various situations inside and outside the home.” ADVERTISEMENT LG's fridge shows what's inside it LG The firm also used the press conference to showcase its next-generation smart fridge. Also powered by Amazon's Alexa technology, the Smart InstaView has a 29-inch touchscreen that turns transparent when you knock it twice. This lets you look inside without opening the door. Using Amazon’s Alexa voice service, homeowners can use it to search recipes, play music, and buy food through Amazon Prime in addition to all the other 6,000 Alexa skills available. It follows Samsung's announcement of a similar fridge. Prices and release dates for the robots and the fridge are yet to be announced.

Can Dropbox find a way to last by cashing in on corporate users? by Peter Burrows January 3, 2017 Of the big IPOs expected to occur in 2017, Dropbox’s could be one of the most intriguing. When Dropbox last raised money, in 2014, it was valued at a hefty $10 billion. But large investors such as Fidelity and T. Rowe Price slashed the value of the Dropbox shares on their books by as much as 50 percent in 2015. The key concern: could a company whose free file storage service is used by hundreds of millions of people find enough paying customers to make a great business? Investors may be in for a pleasant surprise. According to people familiar with the company’s finances, sales are running at more than $750 million a year, up from around $400 million in 2014. That’s thanks in part to growing sales of Dropbox Business, a souped-up version of the free app that costs $150 per employee per year. The company has been cash-flow positive since early 2016, even as it has made heavy investments in engineering, sales, and IT infrastructure. Now CEO and cofounder Drew Houston is leading a new strategic charge. In addition to selling utilities to keep digital files safe and accessible, Dropbox intends to offer software that businesspeople use for hours each day to create content and get work done. The company will say more about its product roadmap on January 30, according to an invitation sent to reporters. “This is a mature, very, very powerful software company,” says Bryan Schreier, a partner with venture capital firm Sequoia Capital, which was an early investor in the company. That doesn’t mean Dropbox will live up to that heady $10 billion valuation, which even at the time was widely seen as a sign of a bubble about to burst. Even if annualized revenue hits $1 billion by the time Dropbox goes public, investors would still need to think the company is worth 10 times its current sales. These days, the average cloud software company trades at just 4.7 times revenue, according to Bessemer Venture Partners. Still, Schreier and other investors insist they are no longer worried about Dropbox’s fundamental business model. About 10 million new people start using the free consumer product every month. An increasing percentage of those users sign up for the $100-a-year Pro version, which offers more storage and sharing features. Many of those Pro customers use Dropbox at work, and once their employers realize how popular it is they are more likely to step up to Dropbox Business, which is designed for use by teams rather than individuals. So far more than 200,000 companies have signed up for Dropbox Business, up from 50,000 in 2014. While most are small and medium-sized companies, a few big companies such as Expedia and News Corp. have more than 10,000 seats. A successful push into productivity and collaboration software could give corporate customers much more to buy from Dropbox. The first example is Paper, which provides a kind of virtual white space where employees and contractors can share Excel spreadsheets, Google Docs, and other digital assets regardless of what device they are using. The idea is to tie together scores of different productivity tools and fold in management tools to help teams keep projects on track. Paper has been in beta since late 2015, but appears to be nearing a general release. “Paper is going to be really important for us,” says chief operating officer Dennis Woodside, who declined to comment on IPO plans or on the company's revenue. “In five years, you could start a business on Dropbox: that is something we aspire to.” Dropbox is far from the only company looking to change the way work is done. Google offers G Suite, which contains business versions of apps such as Google Docs and Gmail. Facebook has a collaboration service called Workplace. Microsoft is improving its cloud offerings as it seeks to defend the massive market share earned with its Windows and Office monopolies. Box has strong traction with companies in highly regulated industries like health care and financial services, while younger companies such as Asana, Atlassian, and Slack already handle elements of what Dropbox aims to do. According to Gartner analyst Karen Hobert, there are 130 companies just in the electronic file storage and sync market. Yet even rivals see Dropbox as a likely survivor of the inevitable consolidation. The overall market opportunity for productivity and collaboration tools is $30 billion, if you replace all those PC disk drives and traditional Windows or Mac programs with cloud-based alternatives. “That’s an order of magnitude more than the combined revenue of all the players today,” says Box chief executive officer Aaron Levie. “As everything moves to the cloud, there’s going to be plenty of opportunity.” Fending off challenges Dropbox has been bulking up for this opportunity since 2014, when Houston hired Woodside. A former McKinsey consultant, Woodside joined Google in 2003 as an operations expert, before running U.S. sales and then the Motorola Mobility cell phone division. At Dropbox, he’s hired more than 200 salespeople, up from zero when the company relied solely on Internet clicks. The engineering team has more than doubled to more than 1,000 members, large by any measure. And he has overseen a massive, risky IT overhaul. While most companies are moving more of their business onto public cloud platforms like the one run by Amazon Web Services, Dropbox has shifted billions of its U.S. customers’ files away from Amazon’s platform to three of its own data centers. That way, Dropbox can tweak its network to cut the time it takes to store and sync traffic. The result is more of a traditional enterprise software company than the hyper-efficient app maker Houston founded in 2007. The idea for the company came when Houston realized during a long bus ride that he’d forgotten the USB drive with his work files at home. The resulting cloud-storage app was a sensation with people who felt his pain. By 2012, Dropbox had 100 million registered users. Then things got difficult. Giants such as Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, and Google began giving away cloud storage capacity as a way to sweeten other offerings. As prices collapsed, cloud storage specialists faced an existential threat. Even though Box has been farther ahead than Dropbox in focusing on corporate customers’ needs, it still struggled to gain investors’ confidence after going public in early 2015. Until recent weeks, Box shares traded well below the original offer price of $14 per share. Do you think you could use better cloud collaboration tools like the ones Dropbox might offer? Tell us in the comments. A successful move by Dropbox into the huge productivity and collaboration software market could brighten the outlook, but it will require the company to pull off two tough transformations at once. Dropbox is still evolving from a maker of a free consumer app to a corporate IT infrastructure company. Now it must also move from selling technology that’s designed to be as invisible as possible—after all, people love Dropbox because they don’t have to think about it—to making products people use much of their day. Again, Box provides the cautionary tale. It introduced a Paper-like product three years ago called Box Notes. But Levie admits that its reception has been less than overwhelming. Box plans a “major relaunch” this year.  Woodside responds that few companies have the scale, the technical expertise, and the brand to pull off its ambitious plans. “There’s close to two billion knowledge workers in the world, and I know this much: the tools they’ll be using in five years are not the ones they’re using today,” he says. Companies with huge numbers of loyal customers have a huge leg up in figuring it out, he argues. “Is the number 500 million? A billion? I don’t know. But we have a shot.” Tagged Drew Houston, Dropbox, ipo, Dennis Woodside, cloud storage, Asana Credit Illustration by Sam D’Orazio Peter Burrows Guest Contributor READ COMMENTS Please read our commenting guidelines.

During a media briefing at the CES gadget show Wednesday, the company showcased a number of tracker-enabled accessories, including what it says is the first VR camera, multiple rifles built for VR shooters and haptic gloves. The tracker weighs less than three ounces; the company hasn't set a price. To foster more development, the company will give away up to 1,000 trackers to developers. The company is also launching its first ever app subscription service, which will allow unlimited access to VR apps for a flat monthly fee. That service will launch in early 2017. HTC didn't say how much it will cost. ___ 4 p.m. Samsung America chief operating officer Tim Baxter opened a flashy press conference Wednesday at CES by acknowledging the "challenging year" Samsung had in 2016 due to its problems with the Galaxy Note 7. The company's flagship smartphone had to be recalled because of its tendency to burst into flame. Baxter said the company and third parties have been investigating the problem and the company will be sharing its root cause "very soon." The rest of the conference showcased Samsung's new offerings, including a new form of its quantum dot TV technology called "QLED," which purports to be sharper and more colorful than other TVs. It is adding Samsung proprietary voice control to some smart refrigerators, echoing a voice-control theme seen throughout CES so far. Samsung is also introducing a washer-dryer combo that can wash two separate loads at once while drying a regular load and delicate items separately. ___ 3 p.m. A French startup called Wair is bringing a new scarf to CES, one that it says can double as both fashion accessory ... and anti-pollution gas mask. Wair calls its product, also dubbed Wair, the first "anti-pollution scarf." Worn one way, it's a seemingly normal wrap that's a bit baggy in the middle. But if air pollution starts to get to you - or if you get an alert from Wair's companion app, called "Supairman" - you can pull it up over your face and seal a respirator mask over your nose and mouth. (At which point the scarf ceases to look particularly chic.) The scarf is supposed to contain an embedded filter that can remove dust, gases and bacteria. It's unclear just how effective it will be, although the startup notes that the filter will need changing every two to four weeks, at roughly $5 to $10 each time. The product is expected to ship in a few months, starting at about $55 for men and $90 for women. ___ 2 p.m. Ah l'amour. One of the most whimsical gadgets at CES is the Lovebox, a device that doesn't have much further use than wrapping up a text message like a present. The wooden box plugs into an outlet and connects to Wi-Fi. A heart on the outside spins if you get a message. It will keep spinning until you open the lid. A digital screen then displays the message, ideally a message of love. You decide who can send you love notes through the Lovebox mobile app. Messages are limited to 160 characters. You can reply with a digital heart by rotating the heart on the box. The box comes from the French startup. It launched in France over Christmas and is due to hit the United States in June. True love, of course, comes at a price: $120 for one box or $220 for two. ___ 12:35 p.m. Nest and other home security systems let you spy on your home if something seems awry. Now you can spy on your groceries. British company Smarter is launching the Fridge Cam, a small round camera for your fridge. It takes a picture every time you close your fridge door, so you can see if you need bread or sundries if you're at the store. It also uses visual recognition tools to alert you if you need to replace something. You can sign up for automatic reorders via the app, and it can alert you when products are due to expire. Similar technology is already built into smart refrigerators, but those are pricey - Samsung's Family Hub starts at $5,600. Smarter's Barnaby Sellars says you can instead "spend $149 and turn your refrigerator smart." The product is among those being demonstrated at the CES gadget show in Las Vegas this week. ___ 11:45 a.m. Gap is testing a smartphone app that will let customers try on clothes without stepping foot in a dressing room. Gap's DressingRoom app uses avatars to help people understand how products will fit. People can then buy what fits online. Gap calls this augmented reality, a technology that involves overlaying virtual images - such as clothing - on top of a real-life image. But in this case, the choices are limited to five pre-determined body types, rather than the actual photo of the potential buyer. The AR part is just the ability to physically walk around the avatar to see how clothing looks from various directions. The app will come out this month, but will work only with phones sporting Google's Tango augmented-reality technology - namely Lenovo's Phab2 Pro and Asus' just-announced ZenFone AR. The clothing chain, which also operates Banana Republic and Old Navy stores, unveiled the app Wednesday at the CES gadget show in Las Vegas. Wayfair, Home Depot and other retailers have been embracing virtual reality and augmented reality to help shoppers figure out ways to decorate homes. But clothing retailers have been slow to embrace the technology. The question is whether it will be something more than just a gimmick. The move by Gap comes as shoppers spend less on clothing and more on experiences like beauty treatments. When customers do buy clothes, they're increasingly going online. Gap has also been struggling with a lack of compelling clothing, resulting in a long-standing sales slump. ___ 11 a.m. A startup carmaker, Faraday Future, is promising again to have electric cars roll off a new $1 billion assembly line in southern Nevada in 2018. Faraday showed off a prototype at the CES gadget show in Las Vegas. Tuesday's demonstration had the company's four-door, 1,050-horsepower FF 91 model clocking 0-to-60 mph in just under 2.4 seconds. Faraday Future officials say the car's battery allows a travel range of up to 378 miles, and a modular design will allow for a faster rollout of future models. Company executive Nick Sampson didn't say when construction would resume at the factory site, where work was suspended in November. Nevada pledged up to $335 million worth of incentives to attract Gardena, California-based Faraday Future to North Las Vegas. ___ 10:20 a.m. Carnival, the operator of such cruise lines as Princess, Holland America and Carnival, is unveiling new concierge technology designed to help crew members anticipate and respond to passengers' needs. A waiter, for instance, could bring a guest's favorite cocktail before she asks, or someone could remind a lounging guest that a yoga class is about to start. Carnival hopes to boost loyalty and ultimately sales. The development comes as the leisure-cruise industry plays catch-up with travel peers like hotels and airlines, which now let you unlock rooms with a smartwatch or fly with a boarding pass on your phone. Carnival is announcing the system on Wednesday at the CES gadget show in Las Vegas. It's scheduled to debut on the Regal Princess cruise ship in November. ___ 9:45 a.m. Research firm Gartner says it expects worldwide shipments of PCs, tablets, phones and other gadgets to remain unchanged in 2017. Gartner says it expects 2.3 billion such devices to ship this year, the same as in 2016. This finding comes as gadget makers unveil all sorts of new products at the CES tech show in Las Vegas this week. Looking ahead, Gartner says the embattled PC market should return to growth in 2018, thanks to a natural cycle of upgrades. That's mostly driven by an increase in premium "ultramobiles" - including ultra-slim Windows 10 devices and Apple's MacBook Air. Smartphones are expected to grow just slightly; much of the growth is in emerging Asia and Pacific markets. In a report Wednesday, Gartner research director Ranjit Atwal says consumers have fewer reasons to upgrade or to buy traditional devices. Rather, he says, "they are seeking fresher experiences and applications in emerging categories such as head mounted displays, virtual personal assistant speakers and wearables." ___ 8:50 a.m. New television sets from LG will include an ultra-slim model that's less than 4 millimeters (0.15 inch) thick. The company is achieving this by moving many of the bulky components - such as graphic cards - into a separate box connected to the screen with just a cord. The speakers are also separated; the TV has two round, retractable speakers on top. The new TV will also have better audio, using Dolby Atmos technology, along with high-end OLED screen technology. OLED - which stands for organic light-emitting diode - can produce better pictures because each pixel produces light individually. Traditional TVs are backlit and use filters to block out light - but not well enough to produce pure black. OLED is rare in TVs and is currently found mostly in smartphones. LG will have non-OLED models, too, and promises new technology to make colors more vibrant. LG also says an LG Technicolor mode will be added to TVs in 2017 to add to color accuracy. Samsung, LG, Sony and others are unveiling new offerings at CES that highlight higher-resolution pictures, thinner displays and brighter colors. The moves come as high-definition and 4K TVs are becoming cheaper and more mainstream, so top TV makers are competing for the higher end of the market. LG says it will release prices in February and start selling them in March. ___ 8:15 a.m. What's new in television sets this year? Incrementally better pictures, larger screens and cheaper prices - and that's about it. True, set manufacturers are bombarding consumers with a whole series of buzzwords - such as OLED, HDR and wide color gamut. Flashy new sets with these supposedly "must have" features are getting the spotlight Wednesday at the annual CES gadget show in Las Vegas. But when it comes down to it, none of these amount to revolutionary improvements for your living room. Set manufacturers may not have run out of technological tricks yet, but for this year, at least, they're reduced to improving what's already out there. Gadgets like virtual-reality headsets and smartphones have snagged much of the buzz that flashy new TVs once had. And stand-alone streaming-TV devices now offer better features than smart TVs. So TV makers like Samsung and LG have doubled down on what they know best: screen technology. "4K" sets with twice the resolution as high definition is making a push into the mainstream this year, as prices come down and video providers offer more 4K streaming and channels. Manufacturers are also touting improvements in color - brighter whites, darker blacks and a wider range. ___ 7 a.m. Comcast is hoping to make Wi-Fi in the home faster through an updated router - the machine that serves as data traffic cops for Wi-Fi networks. Although home internet speeds have gotten faster, laptops and phones on Wi-Fi might still feel sluggish because older routers can't transmit data as fast. Comcast's updated router costs $10 a month and comes with a modem. It's the same price as before. Customers can still buy their own equipment and save money over time. Comcast is also offering extenders to help Wi-Fi work all over a house, though the company wouldn't say what it might charge. Eero, Starry, Google and Luma are among the companies that have fancy new router systems, but they start at more than $100 and run as much as $500. Fewer than 5 million Comcast customers, mostly those on the most expensive internet packages, will get the new high-powered router this year. The company says it could take years to reach the bulk of its more than 24 million customers. Another 10 million customers with the company's existing routers will get a software update by March to make it easier to set up parental controls and install "smart" thermostats and other internet-connected appliances. These features also come with the new routers. Copyright 2017 The Associated Press. All rights reserved. This material may not be published, broadcast, rewritten or redistributed.

Mat Smith, @thatmatsmith 01.04.17 in Mobile Comments 727 Shares Share Tweet Share Save While ASUS's ZenFone AR might have been leaked days early, it's nonetheless a phone that's trying to drag us into the future -- whether that's virtual reality or augmented reality. ASUS says its ZenFone AR will be compatible with both Google's Daydream VR platform as well as Google's Tango augmented-reality tech. While this is the first smartphone capable of both VR and AR, it's also only the second Tango-compatible Android handset. Even when it comes to Daydream, the phone joins a small group of devices that are compatible with Google's VR platform. The phone itself is pretty unassuming, with a large camera module that looks like something from Nokia's now-gone Lumia smartphone series. There's an important reason for that: Augmented reality requires plenty of camera and sensor smarts. ASUS's own TriCam system that clusters three camera sensors (a 23-megapixel sensor, alongside motion-tracking and depth-sensing cameras) to reduce the space it takes up, keeping the phone lighter and thinner than it should be. There's also a lot of power inside: Not only does it have Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 821 processor, but it's also the first smartphone to cram in 8GB of RAM to keep your augmented (or virtual reality) running smoothly. The ZenPhone AR also crams in a 5.7-inch Super AMOLED display -- a good size for a VR headset -- and a new five-magnet speaker for improved sound, to boot. How does it fare in practice? We'll be handling one for ourselves at the end of ASUS's big press conference, so stay tuned for more.Click here to catch up on the latest news from CES 2017.

Image Credit: Jordan Novet/VentureBeat Google today said it’s enhancing Google Docs for Android with support for importing files in OpenDocument Text (.odt) format and then exporting documents as .odt files. A similar thing is happening with Google Sheets for Android: It now supports importing and exporting of OpenDocument Spreadsheets (.ods) files. And with Google Slides for Android — you guessed it! — you can now import and export OpenDocument Presentations (.odp) files. This comes after Google made it possible to import .odt, .ods, and .odp files in Google Drive in late 2014. The new support does not work offline, Google said in a blog post. And there’s no word about .odt, .ods, and .odp support coming to Google Docs, Sheets, and Slides on iOS. Microsoft’s Word, Excel, and PowerPoint for iOS all support OpenDocument files. But they’re not accessible in the Android versions of those apps. The OpenDocument format originated in the 2000s at time when Microsoft Office, with its .doc, .xls, and .ppt formats, was dominant and the Google portfolio of competing cloud-based apps was still coming up. Ultimately Microsoft added support for it on its desktop productivity apps with the release of Office 2007 Service Pack 2. Also today Google said it has added support for exporting docs in .epub format from Google Docs for Android. (Last year Google added .epub exporting support to Docs on the web.) And that app is also getting page setup options such as orientation (portrait or landscape), paper size, and page color.

Under the deal, the New York-based broadcaster's sports programming, including its NFL games and the NCAA Division 1 Basketball Championship, as well as CBS Sports Network and POP, an entertainment channel, will be on Hulu.  Hulu subscribers will also be able to subscribe to CBS Corp's Showtime for an additional price. Hulu announced new affiliate agreements with 21st Century Fox and The Walt Disney Company. The deals encompass 35 networks that will be added to the line-up in early 2017 when Hulu launches its live TV service to compete with cable companies THE INTERNET TV WARS  Earlier this year, Hulu said today it will offer a live-streaming service in 2017 that will offer a mix of cable and broadcast programming as well as news, sports and events.  That pits the streaming service against similar offerings from Dish's Sling TV and Sony's PlayStation Vue as more and more Americans shift to watching TV online.  It is also claimed Google has signed a deal with CBS Corp to carry the network on its web TV service and is in talks with 21st Century Fox and Viacom Inc to distribute its channels Apple is also believed to be developing a similar service. AT&T also recently launched a streaming only service, branded DirectTV Now, which will cost $35 a month - although it has not been revealed which channels are included. CBS, whose shows include news magazine '60 Minutes' and the comedy 'The Big Bang Theory,' will bring in more than $3 per monthly subscriber for its channels, with increases that could eventually get to more than $4, according to a source familiar with the situation.  The source requested anonymity because the deal is not yet public. The Wall Street Journal first reported news of the agreement. Late last year Hulu announced new affiliate agreements with 21st Century Fox and The Walt Disney Company. The deals encompass more than 35 networks that will be added to the platform early 2017 when Hulu launches its live TV service to compete with cable companies. Users will have access to Fox's premier entertainment, news, sports and non-fiction services, as well as Disney's portfolio of networks - and access could cost as little as $40 a month. 'We're building a service that offers subscribers the most sought-after programming on television -- and channels from 21st Century Fox and The Walt Disney Company are essential to that mix,' said Mike Hopkins, CEO of Hulu. 'With these two new deals in place, and additional partners to come, Hulu will soon give TV fans of all ages live and on-demand access to their favorite programs in a whole new, more flexible, highly personalized way.' The agreements will pack up the line-up with more than 35 top networks. This includes broadcast networks FOX and ABC, Fox Sports networks such as the Fox Sports 1, Fox Sports 2 and BTN and ESPN, ESPN2, ESPNU, ESPN-SEC and ESPN 3. Users will also be able to see live showings of Fox Regional Sports Networks across dozens of key national markets; Disney Channel, Disney XD and Disney Junior; Fox News and Fox Business; Freeform; FX, FXX and FXM, and National Geographic and Nat Geo Wild. In August, Hulu dropped its free TV episodes as it worked on an online television service in a bid to overthrow the cable kings, as the average consumer can pay anywhere between $99 to more than $200 a month for traditional cable.

Share this article Share 55 shares While Hulu began as a free site, supported by advertising, free video has become increasingly more difficult to find as the firm tries to lure viewers into a subscription — $8 a month for a plan with ads, and $12 without, reports the Associated Press. In recent months, visitors to Hulu.com have been presented with prominent links to subscribe, with links to free video buried in a menu after signing in.  Hulu members will have access to Fox's premier entertainment, news, sports and non-fiction services, as well as Disney's portfolio of networks from Disney/ABC Television Group and ESPN Inc - and can watch shows during live times, instead of the next day Around the same time, the streaming service announced an affiliate agreement with Time Warner Inc. that adds both live and on-demand streaming of Turner's suite of entertainment, sports, news and kid's networks including TNT, TBS, CNN, Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, truTV, Boomerang and Turner Classic Movies. Hulu has more than 12 million subscribers who pay for original shows, the entire current seasons of some network shows and access to Hulu's library on mobile and streaming-TV devices. With its shift to live online TV services next year, the firm will show broadcast and cable channels in real time, without making viewers wait until the next day to watch episodes. This service is set to cost just $40 for a package that includes access Hulu's group of live channels. Google is also taking advantage of consumer's need for more cable options, as the tech giant signed a deal with CBS Corp to carry the network on its web TV service and is in talks with 21st Century Fox and Viacom Inc to distribute its channels, three sources told Reuters last week.  The service, which will be part of Google's YouTube Platform, is expected to launch early next year and will include all of CBS' content, including live NFL games, one of the sources said.

This service is set to cost just $40 a month that includes access Hulu's group of live channels Google's 'skinny' bundle will cost $25 to $40 a month, the source said. According to the Wall Street Journal, the service will be called Unplugged.   And said 'Beside CBS, other channels from CBS that will be part of the YouTube offering include Pop and CBS Sports Network. '21st Century Fox channels under discussion include Fox Broadcasting, Fox News, FX, Fox Sports and National Geographic Channel, the people familiar with the matter say, while Disney-owned channels that could be part of the service include ABC, ESPN, Disney Channel and Freeform.' GOOGLE WILL TAKE A STAB AT CABLE COMPANIES NEXT YEAR  Google also recently signed a deal with CBS Corp to carry the network on its web TV service and is in talks with 21st Century Fox and Viacom Inc to distribute its channels, three sources told Reuters last week. The service, which will be part of Google's YouTube Platform, is expected to launch early next year and will include all of CBS' content, including live NFL games, one of the sources said. Google's 'skinny' bundle will cost $25 to $40 a month, the source said.  According to the Wall Street Journal, the service will be called Unplugged.  It is unclear which Fox and Viacom networks would be part of the Google service, two of the sources said.  The sources requested anonymity because the discussions are confidential. However, the Wall Street journal said 'Beside CBS, other channels from CBS that will be part of the YouTube offering include Pop and CBS Sports Network.  '21st Century Fox channels under discussion include Fox Broadcasting, Fox News, FX, Fox Sports and National Geographic Channel, the people familiar with the matter say, while Disney-owned channels that could be part of the service include ABC, ESPN, Disney Channel and Freeform.' AT&T is also joining a race with a new streaming service equip with more than 100 popular TV channels that is set to release next month - it will also cost $35 a month. That's far less than the typical big bundle of channels on cable, which a recent survey from Leichtman Research Group says costs about $100, on average. But it's comparable to the price of Dish Network's Sling TV streaming service, which, granted, has fewer channels at that price.  Share or comment on this article e-mail 55 shares Most watched News videos Gloria Williams waves extradition for kidnapping Kamiyah Mobley Kitesurfer unaware of great white shark swimming below Disgusting moment cyst puss eruption covers cell phone Enraged kick-boxer strikes husband's mistress NINE times 2017's luckiest man: Pedro Grendene Bartelle win's $3.5m Man takes his cat Weston Sledding in the snow Sheep attack shepherd after being frightened by a car in Germany She's falling for him?

(Image courtesy Starship Ltd.) Press release: vTime Now the Most Widely Available VR Social Network with Launch on Google Daydream Liverpool, UK –  vTime, the VR Sociable Network, today becomes the most widely-available VR social network in the world as it launches for Google Daydream. Used by people in 195 countries, vTime is the only VR social network available across all mobile formats, and is now available to download for free from the Google Daydream and Google Play stores. Offering its users the easiest way to chat, share, broadcast and record in virtual reality, vTime is now live on five VR platforms: Samsung Gear VR, Oculus Rift, Google Cardboard, iPhone and Google Daydream. “We’re very proud to reach this significant milestone within 12 short months of launching on our first VR platform,” said Managing Director Clemens Wangerin. “With the trajectory of mobile computing over the next few years as compelling as it is, and the phone already established as the most important device you own, we believe the ease-of-access to mobile VR will continue to mark it out as the most accessible form of VR for quite some time, with vTime perfectly positioned to capitalize on that.” The launch on Daydream follows a flood of significant updates for vTime. November saw vTime become the first VR social network to launch on iOS – available now for the iPhone 5S upwards. The expansion saw vTime pass half a million downloads the day before its first birthday celebration on December 22. The immersive and easy-to-use network also added pioneering new feature vCast. This open beta feature allows every vTime user to broadcast their VR podcasts, panels, talk shows and more to the entire community. Unlike traditional live-streaming platforms, vCast viewers can watch the action from a prime position in any of vTime’s 18 environments. With full spatial audio and rotational tracking for viewers, vCasters can be joined by up to three other guests, and can bring in their own flat and 360 images to use within the broadcast. For viewers, vCast offers the ability to view content without directly taking part. vTime’s latest early access feature push also gives each user the ability to record their session or vCast in full 360, and then publish the content to their public library, meaning viewers are free to enjoy the event an unlimited number of times at a time that suits them, and as if it were live. As well as furthering discoverability for content and content creators, further updates coming this year will also see the introduction of producer tools, which allow a second vTime user to take up the production mantle. Leaving the host free to do what they do best, the producer can bring in guests, content, messaging, and even external social media feeds for real-time interaction. Working over 3G, 4G or Wi-Fi, the free app is currently out on Samsung Gear VR, Google Cardboard, Google Daydream, iPhone, and Oculus Rift (DK2 and CV1). Completely cross platform, vTime will be available on all major VR platforms soon, with support for HTC Vive coming soon.   About vTime vTime is the VR sociable network that allows anyone, anywhere to socialize with family and friends in virtual reality. Bringing people together virtually since December 2015, vTime is enjoyed by users in over 195 countries. Experience a growing library of incredible destinations, and personalize your avatar, as you chat with others in the virtual world. Broadcast your sessions with vCast, and record them for others to enjoy on demand. Platform agnostic, vTime supports PlayStation VR, Google Cardboard, Google Daydream, iPhone, Samsung Gear VR and Oculus Rift, and will add support soon for HTC Vive soon.  www.vTime.net Related Posts OpenSim year in review Genesis Metaverse switches to DigiWorldz hosting How I use CoSpaces to help students create their dreams OpenSim Embassy celebrates grand opening Wednesday Canadian Sun to hold St. Patrick’s Day parade Tags: DaydreamvTime Press Release This is a press release, contributed by an outside company or organization and does not necessarily reflect the views or opinions of anybody at this publication.

By: ENS Economic Bureau | New Delhi | Published:January 5, 2017 1:20 am Union Minister for Electronics & IT, Ravi Shankar Prasad with Google CEO Sundar Pichai during an event to announce ‘Digital Unlocked’ skill programme, in New Delhi on Wednesday. Source: Praveen Khanna In the light of the fast growing digital ecosystem in which a number of security vulnerabilities have come to the front, Minister of Electronics and Information Technology Ravi Shankar Prasad on Wednesday appealed to US-based technology company Google to work on strengthening cyber security systems. “More the digital payments will grow; more the challenges will be to cyber-security. I will appeal to Google to work more to ensure digital security,” Prasad said. “Google is as much Indian as much it is American. It has a similar obligation towards India, as much as it has towards the US and the world,” he added. “Google India needs to tailor its operation more to India’s psyche, local languages, local aspirations, local products..,” Prasad said. Watch What Else Is making News Experts have suggested that in the backdrop of rising electronic payments in the country; wherein a number of new apps and digital services have been developed post the Centre’s November 8 announcement of withdrawing high denomination currency notes from circulation, cyber-security could have been put on the backburner leaving loopholes in several systems. Last month chipset maker Qualcomm had said that wallets and mobile banking applications used in India do not use hardware level security which can make online transactions more secure. “You will be surprised because most of the banking or wallet apps around the world don’t use hardware security. They actually run completely in Android mode and users’ password can be stolen. Users use fingerprint which might be captured … in India that is the case for most of all digital wallets and mobile banking apps,” Qualcomm Senior Director Product Management Sy Choudhury had said. Prasad was speaking at a Google event in the capital in presence of the company’s global CEO Sundar Pichai, where it was launching a programme to help small and medium enterprises in India understand how online systems work to operate on digital platforms. The online training compromises 90 training videos as well as an eight-hour classroom training programme along with industry body Ficci. Google has also planned 5,000 workshops in 40 cities across India. There will be an app called Primer, available on iOS and Android in Hindi and English, with other languages being developed. “Small businesses online have significantly larger market share outside their cities. SMBs (small and medium businesses) that go digital end up employing more people than those that ignore online,” said Rajan Anandan, VP and MD of Google South East Asia.

By John Lincoln John Lincoln is co-founder and CEO of Ignite Visibility, a digital-marketing teacher at the University of California San Diego and an online-marketing consultant. @johnelincoln Co-founder and CEO, Ignite Visibility@johnelincoln WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement It's important to find out which emerging trends are likely to give you success in 2017. Then, you can use those strategies to rank, bank, and beat your competitors. Here's what's in store for SEO in the new year. Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) will become more important AMP loads web pages on mobile platforms in a jiffy. That's why Google loves it. If you haven't already AMPed up your site, now is the time to do so. Backlinks won't be as popular as they were last year Once upon a time, the best way to rank your site was with backlinks from high PR blogs. PR is gone now (for our purposes, anyway) and backlinks are losing strength as a ranking factor. Artificial intelligence (AI) will become more important AI is already driving big changes at Google. In the new year, you can expect to see more companies following Google's lead and adopting self-learning technology. Home devices will be used for search In 2017, you can learn about the odds of successfully navigating an asteroid field from the convenience of your own home. That's because home devices will gain in popularity and people will use them to search for information online. Original content will continue to rule If you want to rank your site during the next year, be sure to get some fresh content on your blog. Social ranking signals will have more weight According to one study, the social shares of a referring page is one of the top 100 ranking signals. In the new year, expect that social signals will have even more influence over where a site ends up in the search engine results pages (SERPs). Schema will become even more important You should add schema.org markup to your site if you haven't already done so. It's going to be more important than ever in 2017. HTTPS will become more important Expect to see more webmasters adopting HTTPS in the new year. That's because HTTPS not only brings certain security benefits, but SEO benefits as well. People will use Amazon to search for products When it comes to searching for information about products, Amazon will beat Google in 2017. More people will use Facebook search Facebook wants to keep people in their ecosystem. You can expect that more people will be using the Facebook search engine. Voice search will grow in popularity Amazon Echo and Google Home will make it easy for people to search without even lifting a finger. They'll just ask a question to their home device and hear an audible answer. Google will go auto with penalties This one is just a gut feeling... Manual actions may be a thing of the past as Google starts dispensing penalties based on an algorithm. Of course, that shouldn't affect you if you're playing by the rules. Google will show fewer category/product pages Sometimes, the SERPs are populated with pages from ecommerce sites that might be tangentially relevant to a search query. Expect that to change in 2017 as Google serves up more informational content. Google will get better at rendering AJAX or JavaScript Sites that rely on AJAX often get left out of the SERPs because the Googlebot can't "see" information that's programmatically rendered. Expect that to change in the new year. Mobile will become even more important There's little doubt about the importance of mobile today. In 2017, you can expect to see more SEOs and businesses adopting a "mobile-first" SEO strategy. International SEO will stay profitable SEOs who specialize in optimizing sites for a global economy will continue to see their client lists and bank accounts grow. Longform content will still rank better The already documented SEO benefits of longform content will stay in place. If you're not using longform content on your company blog, make 2017 the year you start to do so. Optimizing images will be important Think you can get away with just optimizing text and not images? Think again. In 2017, SEOs will focus on images as well as content. Titles with higher click-through rate (CTR) will rank better Clickbait will offer SEO benefits as Google will give a boost in rank to authors who can draw a crowd to their content. More people will search for video and multimedia Sometimes, people just don't want to read. They'd rather watch a video or listen to audio. In 2017, you can expect to see a rise in people who are searching for information that isn't text. Better design will rule Google will continue to show favoritism to sites that give users an awesome experience. If your site is user-hostile, hire a designer to improve it. Good luck with your SEO in 2017! Keep these things in mind and you will ahead of the curve. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com.

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars Follow us on social: MOBILE Asus unveils ZenFone AR with Google’s Daydream and Tango support, coming in Q2 2017 Emil Protalinski@EPro January 4, 2017 11:30 AM Tags: asus, Asus ZenFone, CES 2017, Google, Google Daydream, Google Tango, top-stories, Zenfone, ZenFone AR Probably the most-leaked device at CES 2017 so far has been the Asus ZenFone AR, through no fault of the Taiwanese company. Partner Qualcomm revealed much of the details in a blog post touting the use of its Snapdragon 821 chipset, and infamous leaker Evan Blass (evleaks) added front and back press renders of the phone. The key part that was missing was a release timeframe, which we now have: Q2 2017. The ZenFone AR stands out as the first smartphone that will support both of Google’s Daydream and Tango platforms, and is only the second to support the latter (Lenovo’s Phab 2 Pro was the first). Daydream is a virtual reality (VR) platform built into Android 7.0 Nougat and above. Tango is an augmented reality (AR) platform that detects users’ positions relative to places and objects around them without using GPS or other external signals. Asus states the phone “was developed in close cooperation with Google to deliver the best user experience” using both AR and VR technologies. For both platforms, content is still lacking — Asus and Google will be working to bring more apps to the market. ASUS ZenFone AR (2nd Google Tango phone) pic.twitter.com/ctKQ9IKfeC — Evan Blass (@evleaks) January 2, 2017 For VR, Asus points to the phone’s 5.7-inch WQHD (1440 x 2560 resolution) screen and high-contrast super AMOLED technology that enhances the 3D effect. The device can be used as a VR display mounted in the Daydream View headset. For AR, the phone has a set of sensors and computer vision software for interpreting images, videos, space, and motion. Tango allows the ZenFone AR to offer motion tracking, depth perception, and area learning so that it can detect how far it is away from a floor, wall, or an object and understand where it is moving in three-dimensional space. The Zenfone AR is powered by a Snapdragon 821 processor, like the Google Pixel, as well as an Adreno 530 GPU and 6GB of RAM. The ZenFone AR also has a vapor cooling system to prevent overheating, a common issue when powering AR and VR experiences. The phone features a PixelMaster 3.0 camera system, a Sony IMX318 sensor, and TriTech Autofocus system. The camera has a few special modes: 4-axis OIS photo, 3-axis EIS video stabilization, Super Resolution (92MP photos by capturing and combining four native 23MP photos), low light, and 4K video recording. You can also expect support for Hi-Res Audio, DTS virtual surround sound, and a 5-magnet speaker. If you’re fascinated with mobile AR and VR, or a developer interested in both, this phone looks like a solid bet. The only missing piece of the puzzle is pricing, which will be unveiled later this year. ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat. All rights reserved.

The ZenFone AR is the first phone to support both Tango — Google’s mobile augmented reality platform — and Google’s Android-based Daydream VR platform. It’s also only the second phone to integrate Tango, after the Lenovo Phab Pro. The ZenFone AR uses a Snapdragon 821 processor that’s supposedly optimized for Tango, as well as 6GB of RAM. It runs Android 7.0 Nougat on a 5.7-inch 1440 x 2560 Super AMOLED screen, and it supports Tango’s AR capabilities with a 23-megapixel main camera, a motion tracking camera, and a depth sensing camera, all arranged on the back of the phone. It will be released in the second quarter of 2017, with pricing details to come. We’ve previously speculated that Tango could bring new tracking capabilities to Google Daydream, but at this point, Google emphasizes that there’s no interplay between Tango and Daydream on the ZenFone AR. Its screen is slightly larger than Google’s 5.5-inch Pixel XL, but like all Daydream-ready devices, Asus’ phone fits into the Google-made Daydream View headset. On the Tango side, Asus boasts that it’s working with Google and other companies to expand the number of available apps. Currently, there are around 30, including a home improvement app from Lowe’s and a virtual dinosaur exhibit from the American Museum of Natural History. Tango and Daydream are both promising platforms, but it’s unclear whether they’re big enough selling points to drive adoption, especially since we can’t say much more about the ZenFone AR’s quality otherwise. The ultimate goal for AR and VR options is to make them feel like a standard part of Android, not like defining features — but Asus’ new phone reminds us how unusual they really are.

According to a Bloomberg report Wednesday, Ford and Toyota have teamed up with a handful of smaller automakers to create auto industry standards for in-vehicle apps and services before Apple or Google gain too much traction. SmartDeviceLink The partnership between Ford and Toyota isn’t new; the two companies have been working together on in-car information and entertainment initiatives, a platform called “SmartDeviceLink,” since 2011. That effort has translated thus far into a functional, if not elegant, platform supporting popular apps such as Pandora, Spotify, iHeartRadio, and AccuWeather on more than 5 million vehicles worldwide. With the growing adoption of Apple’s CarPlay and Google’s Android Auto, however, Ford and Toyota have recently sought to expand their consortium in order to speed up development of what they aim to be an open source platform. In response, Mazda, PSA Group (Peugeot), Fuji Heavy Industries (Subaru), and Suzuki Motor Corp., as well as a group of auto manufacturing suppliers, have all joined while others, such as Honda, are rumored to be considering it. Control and Access The automakers publicly cite safety as their primary reason for being wary of handing over the in-car experience to Apple or Google. Without a direct hand in the features and capabilities of systems like CarPlay, they argue, they can’t be sure that the experiences won’t be dangerously distracting to drivers and vehicle occupants. The automakers are also concerned about allowing these systems to access vehicle data. More realistically, the automakers are also concerned about losing control over their own vehicles, especially with self-driving technologies fast approaching, making in-car information and entertainment more important than ever. The availability of CarPlay and Android Auto is still relatively limited, allowing the automakers a brief window to present a more appealing (from the manufacturers’ perspective) open source alternative. This doesn’t necessarily mean that systems like CarPlay will be abandoned by automakers, but the hope is to create a compelling manufacturer-driven system that can either win over drivers on the merits or force companies like Apple to adopt the underlying platform for compliance.

That’s it, I just won’t ever buy a car from Ford or Toyota. (looks out the window at the two Prius’s sitting in the driveway) Well, crap.

Awful system. January 4, 2017 at 3:43 EST PM d'monder January 4, 2017 One vehicle has a 3.5mm jack input At least that jack worked with whatever you plugged into it. 🙂 IMO the worst possible scenario is a Babel of every manufacturer using their own proprietary infotainment system, all half-baked and poorly supported, with no clear market leader. Every vehicle you hop in is likely to have something different. And sadly that appears to be exactly what’s happening. January 4, 2017 at 5:56 EST PM CudaBoy January 4, 2017 FCA Fiat-Chrysler is jumping ship from QNX to Android for their vaunted UConnect car system. Both Ford and Toyota are behind the curve of electric and definitely autonomous car tech – they have nothing for the Tesla on the drawing boards and none of the 12 Ford announced are close to TODAY’S Tesla’s in well, everything including autonomous. Poor Toyota and Honda bet on Hydrogen and that just ain’t happening..apparently. Just as Disney’s chairman realized at the Parade lo those years ago that 8 out of 10 characters were Pixar and thus they had BETTER buy Pixar or else, so should Apple realize as the VR, AI and IOT “parade” flourishes how long can they remain on the sidelines and not get in the game? Car Play? Apple really can’t finger out anything related to cars apparently.

If we are both in the car, but I want to cennect to mine you run through several hoops; Click on the Phone icon, choose connect phone, click on Lee’s, click on Connect. It should be choose connect phone, click on Lee’s. They finally got Siri by clicking and hold on the steering wheel phone button.

Photograph: LG Adam Gabbatt in Las Vegas @adamgabbatt Wednesday 4 January 2017 14.23 EST Last modified on Wednesday 4 January 2017 15.37 EST Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close LG unveiled its own competitor to Amazon Echo and Google Home on Wednesday – a home assistant that can play music and tell you the weather but also order your vacuum cleaner to start cleaning the house and turn on your oven. The Hub Robot, which LG said will go on sale in 2017, was shown for the first time in Las Vegas ahead of the Consumer Electronics Show, which opens to the public on Thursday. The device – a little white machine that has two glowing blue “eyes” on the front – appears to be a direct competitor to Amazon Echo and Google Home. Introducing the Hub Robot, David VanderWaal, vice-president of marketing, home appliances & consumer at LG, described it as “your intelligent home assistant”. It can also play music, tell you the about the weather and traffic – all things that Amazon Echo and Google Home can do. The difference, the company argues, is the extra things Hub Robot will be able to do. “It can pre-heat your oven,” VanderWaal said, and “initiate your robot vacuum cleaner when you leave the house”. It will also be able to turn on your washing machine and interact with your refrigerator. One problem LG might have with the Hub Robot is that for it to do those things you would also need to own an oven, robot vacuum cleaner, washing machine and refrigerator that are all connected to Wi-Fi. LG sells all of these things, but it seems that to get the most out of the Hub Robot you will also need to spend thousands of dollars upgrading your home appliances. If you are unable or unwilling to do that, it doesn’t seem the Hub Robot will do much more than its rivals – apart from have a little face. Adam Gabbatt (@adamgabbatt) LG just unveiled its "Hub Robot" home assistant which has a little face and will compete with Amazon Echo and Google Home #CES2017 pic.twitter.com/yZbGZ6HQPE January 4, 2017 Still, Taryn Brucia, LG’s director of public relations, told the Guardian that the Hub Robot “will compete” with Echo and Google Home. “But we are working with our partners to see how we might synchronize to work with each other.” Brucia would not give a release date but said the Hub Robot will be released in some countries this year. “Fun. Life’s good,” she said, neatly referencing LG’s slogan. “We like to be playful.” Artificial intelligence is one of the main themes of CES this year. On Tuesday Faraday Future, a fledgling electric car company, unveiled a car that will learn its driver’s preferences, while Honda will be presenting cars that can “artificially generate their own emotions”. Faraday Future takes on Tesla at CES with FF 91, the electric car that can learn Read more One thing that has not been discussed at the conference so far – at least not publicly – is the vulnerability of these artificially intelligent devices to hacking. At the Infosecurity Europe conference in May, industry experts and academics warned that the security of the internet of things – physical devices that connect to and operate through the internet – was being ignored because of the relative unimportance of those devices to date. “We have a whole industry that is being ignored by the virtue of unimportance, but all of a sudden may find itself extremely [open] to attacks,” the Inquirer reported James Lyne, global head of security research at Sophos, as saying. The message was that as the internet of things expands to include vehicles and important personal data – bank account details, or behavioural habits, for example– there is a need for these artificially intelligent devices to become more secure. Another problem is the issue of privacy. In December, police in Arizona seized an Amazon Echo device, believing it may have recorded information that could help solve an murder. Law enforcement also issued a warrant to Amazon to hand over data that may have been captured by the device. The Seattle-based tech company, however, is refusing to provide the police with the information they requested.

 Here's one reason why Apple, Google, and Amazon are getting into the music streaming market Eugene Kim Jan. 4, 2017, 1:25 PM 2,574 facebook linkedin twitter email print More Charts   Competition in the music streaming space has intensified in recent years, with Apple, Amazon, and Google all launching their own services to compete against upstarts like Spotify. One simple reason for this is the on-demand music streaming market's mind-boggling pace of growth. According to this chart by Statista, based on data from BuzzAngle, the number of on-demand audio consumption jumped a whopping 82.6% year-over-year in 2016 to reach 250 billion total streams. That's a much bigger increase than the total number of on-demand video streams, which went up just 7.5% year-over-year. What's perhaps more interesting is that the streaming growth came at the expense of album and song sales, which each dropped 15% and 24% from the previous year, respectively. Don't expect a slow down any time soon: Streaming will grow to 50% of the global music market by mid-2019 and to 80% in 2025, according to Macquarie.

If Melissa did show up at the pub we could engage in some good-natured banter, as she somehow roots for Chelsea and I for Spurs.

Thus, it is no longer selfish, but ignorant. Thoughts please.” Well, Gerrard, China are certainly looking to develop their football, looking at their signings and their recruitment.

Shutterstock Email Twitter Facebook LinkedIn A computer’s operating system, the layer of software between you and the hardware, has changed remarkably over the past few decades. At the beginning a user had to interact with levers and switches, then came screens and DOS, the Apple’s Macintosh and Microsoft’s Windows, and, finally, the internet. These slowly wormed their way into our lives and changed the way we do almost everything. But the OS of the future is going to be something different entirely. The next step is artificial intelligence, and there’s a land rush going on. Just think of how profitable Microsoft’s control of the previous epoch was. How operating systems evolved In the 70s, many of us cut our teeth with command line systems like MS-DOS, CP/M and Unix. Just imagine the black screens with green type. You could type almost meaningful commands like “cp” to copy a file. This was pretty geeky, but a little less than physical switches. In the 80s, computing moved over to graphical interfaces like Mac OS and Windows where you could simply point and click. Want to delete a file? Simply drag it into the bin. What could be simpler? Computing was no longer just for geeks. Almost anyone could do it. In the 90s, computing became more connected. The internet took off and the browser became king. Indeed, Google have made a whole Operating System out of this, Chrome OS. And more recently, computing became mobile and moved onto apps on our smartphones. Some of these apps and services started branching out, creating their own little worlds to bring together developers and users. There is probably no better example than the Chinese app WeChat, which has thousands of applications, from social networking through buying airline tickets. You might not realize it but the next revolution in Operating Systems is now under way. And the technology giants like Microsoft, Apple and Google are racing to be the winner. The new race Late last year Google announced a series of hardware products. There was Google Home speaker, Pixel smartphone, and the virtual reality headset Daydream View. But Google isn’t going to make billions out of hardware like this. Software is a much better business to be in. It scales so much more easily. No, Google is producing this hardware just as a means of getting its AI-based Google Assistant into our homes and our pockets. Assistant is baked into all of these products, and through it, Google wants to be at the centre of our lives, however we connect. Conversational assistants like Assistant and Apple’s Siri and Amazon’s Alexa are the Operating System of the future. No more typing. No more pointing. The power of Artificial Intelligence will be harnessed to serve our needs. “Get me on the next flight to Canberra, Google”. “Who’s the President of Switzerland, Siri?” “Play me that jazz saxonophist that I like, Alexa.” In many cases, there won’t be a keyboard in sight. We’ll walk into some new room and say “Turn on the lights” and expect someone will be listening. Sorry, something will be listening. We’ll sit it our car and simply announce “start the ignition”. We’ll get into a lift and command “top floor, please”. We’ll walk into the bathroom and say “run me a bath”. Screens will disappear. In its place, will be conversations. Conversations that will follow us from room to room, to car, to office and to bed. The knock on effects of all this will be huge. The loss of screens will mean digital advertising must be rethought. The rise of conversation will impact search and online networking. Whoever wins the race to define this new operating system will take the lead in all of this. Winners and losers This is an exciting future. There are plenty of opportunities for the bold. To build a watch that doubles as your personal assistant. Sunglasses that tell you when you’ve had too much sun. A weighing scale that offers advice about your diet. The likely winners are companies like Google, Microsoft, Facebook, or Amazon because they are the first movers, and the theory of network effects mean their products will likely rapidly improve. The likely losers are privacy, diversity and democracy. The NSA can’t wait for every room to be listening. Marketers can’t wait to see all this data on our everyday lives.

NEW DELHI: Sundar Pichai, the India-born chief executive of the world’s largest Internet company Google, has described the Modi government’s demonetisation exercise as a bold and courageous move that could propel the country to the forefront of digital payments. “I have spent my life developing platforms. Every time you drive a platform shift, it has a big multiplicative effect, leveraged effect. Digitising a country of the scale of India, and making it work well, truly will have a beneficial effect,” said Pichai, who is currently in India on awork-cum-personal trip. The Google CEO said his company will work overtime to evolve products for a more ‘digitised’ Indian economy. “We are closely looking at UPI (Unified Payments Interface), and ways in which our products and services including Android can support it (digitisation) better.” Forty four-year-old Pichai brushed away fears about protectionism in the wake of Donald Trump’s victory in the US and the Brexit vote. “I have always felt the US to be an open and inclusive country. I don’t expect any of that to change,” said Pichai. “Companies in the US deeply care about being competitive. The reason why they are the best in the world is because they invest in the best resources and they have that mindset. There is nothing I see that indicates that will change,” added Pichai, who took over as CEO in October 2015. Also Read: Over time you will see more global products that are developed in India first. That’s our aspiration: Sundar Pichai, CEO Google Pichai did not appear too sympathetic towards Indian startups who have sought policies that favour domestic companies over foreign rivals. “I am positive that over the next 5-10 years you will have more companies from India which will be competitive on the global stage,” he said. “To do that, you have to be in a global system where you can test yourself in a global marketplace and that’s what will help you scale not just in India, but beyond India,” he said. Last month, India’s preeminent Internet entrepreneurs — Flipkart’s Sachin Bansal and Bhavish Aggarwal of Ola — raised the banner of nationalism in their fight against foreign-origin rivals such as Uber and Amazon, as they urged the government to design policies to favour homegrown companies. Pichai said India would continue to be an important test bed for Google’s products. For instance, offline versions of YouTube and Maps were tested in India before they were launched globally. Google is now working on YouTube Go, which will be launched in India before being rolled out in other markets. The version will enable offline viewing and sharing of videos without using a data connection. “For a place like India, my number one goal is to develop a high quality product, in all local Indian languages, and how we can make that work on more affordable smartphones, and even slower connectivity,” said Pichai, adding that he would love to see more affordable entry-level smartphones, priced around the $30 mark.Pichai, adding that he would love to see more affordable entry-level smartphones, priced around the $30 mark. While Google has bet big on driverless cars in the US, Pichai echoed Uber cofounder Travis Kalanick’s view that India wasn’t ready for autonomous cars. “I don’t think a country like India is going to see, as Travis said, completely automated cars. But just like technology is assisting humans, we can make cars so that they are safer, and the driving experience is comfortable and shared,” added Pichai. Solving connectivity issues is another big focus area for Google in India, be it through providing WiFi at railway stations or turning public spaces into WiFi hotspots. Asked if he is comfortable with the speed at which India is getting connected, Pichai said, “I am never comfortable with the pace of anything that’s happening”.

Subscribe for unlimited access Read FAQ Plans for a citywide fiber-optic network may be on hiatus, but Google is looking into other ways to grow internet access in Mountain View. The search-engine giant is cutting the city an $800,000 check to expand free public WiFi through the downtown area. The tech giant has a checkered history with attempting to expand internet access to its hometown. Back in 2006, the company launched its own Google WiFi system, a network of about 560 light pole-mounted nodes providing free hookups to households throughout the city. Users initially found the service dazzling, but later disappointing. About five years in, complaints began mounting that the WiFi was unbearably slow and unpredictable, and prone to complete service blackouts. In 2014, Google decided to scuttle the system. The company gave Mountain View a $500,000 technology grant to fund a third-party company to take over the wireless hubs downtown. At the time, the setup was portrayed as temporary since the company was beginning talks to bring its much-faster Google Fiber service to Mountain View. Fast forward to 2016 and not much has changed. In May, Google officials signed an agreement with Mountain View and other South Bay cities to install the fiber-optic service, but there's been no action since then. In October, the company announced it was hitting the brakes on its plans to bring Google Fiber to most cities. Mountain View officials say the new $800,000 check from Google will be used to expand the existing downtown WiFi system. Roger Jensen, Mountain View's information-technology director, said the city will work with a contractor to add about 40 new wireless hubs downtown to provide exclusive bandwidth for the city. The new expanded service area will go along Castro Street, from El Camino Real to Evelyn Avenue. Google officials did not return calls for this story, but a spokesman noted in an email that Mountain View is the only city receiving this grant money. This story contains 317 words.

Speaking as an IT Security expert. credentialled, I would never use a public wifi for anything. I have questions regarding the $800.000. I do not think that WIFI devices costs that much, the most they cost is $2,300. THe power cost is 13W per device, if you calculate 13 * 40 devices *24 hours * 365.25 days = 4,558,320 watts. The Cost for electricity is .12 per KwH. so 4,558,320/1000 = 4,558.32 * .12= $547.00 for a year for 40 repeaters. I can estimate that it may take 2 hours to install the devices and I will estimate $100. hr per installation which comes to 40*2*100= $8,000. I cannot see that the laying of any new cabling will cost more that $150,000. $150,000 + (40*$2300.00) + $600 + $8,000= $250,600. so that accounts for 31% of the $800,000, where is the additional $450,000 going, into the City of Mountain View revenue? This is just a PR ploy to distract the fact that Google is under routine review for labor practices that could be questionable. As one trained in Human Resources, this appears to be an attempt to prevent statistical analysis that could indicate disparate impact in employment at Google. But the real problem is that disparate impact only means that there was NO intent to discriminate. It can occur nonetheless but it may NOT be by design. But Google attempting to withhold the information is a violation of the OFCCP compliance rules and shows that the issue could actually consist of disparate treatment. This kind of discrimination IS by design and INTENDED to discriminate. Or at the very least, Google INTENDS to withhold potential evidence of Disparate Impact, which changes the classification from impact to treatment. Given that this information is readily available to Google, the OFCCP regulations are clear, Google IS a FEDERAL CONTRACTOR UNDER THE LAW, this decision seems to be a very poor one. I wonder if this decision will impact on the plans of Google with regards to consideration with the City of Mountain View.

This comes after Spotify considered picking up the service earlier this year, a deal that ultimately died last month. SoundCloud still needs a buyer, though, as it struggles to compete with the mainstream music streaming players like Apple and Google itself… The company has been struggling to find ways to monetize itself, especially since its relatively new SoundCloud Go subscription service — which provides an ad-free offline experience for $10 a month — hasn’t received much traction. SoundCloud reportedly wanted $1 billion for itself according to a report from Bloomberg earlier this year, but it now seems as its valuation falls that the company will have to settle for far less. It’s not clear how the service, which has somewhere in the realm of 175 million users, would benefit Google if an acquisitions actually goes through. SoundCloud primarily serves as a large community for indie music artists (and it provides a great place to hosting podcasts as well), which could theoretically complement Google’s other music streaming avenues like Google Play Music and YouTube Red. It’s not uncommon for Google to have many products that do the same things. There’s also of course the possibility that Google is simply interested in SoundCloud’s talent. The company has clearly succeeded in building a large, niche community in the music streaming space.

The New York Post reports that the woman, a 30-year-old college student, has an uncommon West African name, and that after she broke up with her boyfriend in late 2015, he posted sneakily recorded videos of them having sex to porn sites. As a result, now when one searches the woman's name, more than four pages of porn-related search results come up, according to the suit. The woman's lawyer told the Post the situation has kept her from getting so much as an internship. In response, she is demanding that Google, Yahoo, and Bing permanently remove her name from their sites, a much more sweeping measure than asking the individual sites hosting the porn to take it down. The request does not have a legal precedent in the U.S., but it echoes the 2014 European Court of Justice ruling creating the European Union's "right to be forgotten." The principle, allowing people to request the removal of inaccurate, old, and "no longer relevant or excessive" results, has already led to the censoring of several hundred thousand search results. For now, the right to be forgotten only applies within the EU, meaning that Google makes results hidden to people accessing the internet from IP addresses in those countries. However, in 2015, the highest court in France ruled that Google must expand its censorship and hide the results from every computer in the world. Google is appealing the ruling, which in the U.S. would likely violate the First Amendment and chill publishing in all its forms. As Slate reports, there are other ways that the idea behind the right to be forgotten is creeping into U.S. courts. In 2012, a Connecticut woman named Lorraine Martin sued several news organizations in an effort to force them to remove articles mentioning a marijuana arrest that she had had expunged after the charges were dropped. Martin lost the case, but the court avoided addressing the First Amendment issues raised by her suit. Also, from Slate: Alabama is currently contemplating a bill that would force websites to remove mug shots of arrestees who were later acquitted, and California has already passed a law that allows minors to compel websites to delete any content they posted when they were under 18. The related issue of revenge porn, in which someone posts explicit images of another person out of spite, is also evolving in the law. In New York state, publishing revenge porn is not a crime, though hacking is, and copyright claims can be made by victims. A bill currently before the City Council would make uploading or disseminating pornographic images with the intent of harming the person in them a crime punishable by a $1,000 fine and up to a year in jail.

As we ease our way into the annual avalanche of overhyped device launches and overly confident tech rumors, I thought I'd take a moment to talk about the one Android phone that truly stands out at the start of this new year -- yup, you guessed it: Google's own Pixel. You know the spiel by now, right? The Pixel excels not for any single element or feature but rather for the whole package it provides -- the overall user experience, which includes everything from the hardware to the user interface and the tight integration of complementary Google services. Crucially, it also includes an unmatched commitment to timely ongoing updates and support -- something that meaningfully sets the phone apart from almost every other Android option. As I've put it before, it's all the good parts of Google and Android, amplified -- and without all the usual downsides. It only seems fitting, then, to kick off 2017 in this column by talking about some simple ways to make the Pixel even more powerful. Whether you picked up the phone as a gift over the holidays or have had it in your pretty little hand since its launch last fall, these next-level (and not entirely obvious) tips can help you get the most out of your pocket-sized Googley gadget. Tip #1: Teach your Pixel the art of tapping One of my now-favorite Pixel features showed up with the recent Android 7.1 software update (which should hopefully be on your device by now as well). It's the ability to have your phone's screen turn on and give you a quick glance at any pertinent info whenever you double-tap its display. The screen lights up only partially at first -- with a dimmed image showing you the current time and any pending notifications. If you touch the screen again, it'll illuminate all the way and let you interact with that info or just proceed normally to your home screen. It's similar to the Ambient Display feature on Google's Nexus phones of yore (and the Active Display feature introduced on Motorola phones before that) -- except while those features flash the display on anytime you bump your device or pick it up, this one requires a more deliberate action. I find I actually prefer that, as I don't necessarily want my screen to light up every time I move the phone and would rather have a more intentional way of triggering the at-a-glance view. jr To give it a whirl, head into the Moves section of your system settings and look for the item labeled "Double-tap to check phone." (You'll also find an option there called "Lift to check phone," which will give you the motion-activated Ambient-Display-like alternative.) Tip #2: Make your Pixel light-sensitive Our second item is another useful Android 7.1 Pixel addition: the presence of a new Night Light mode that tints your phone's screen to make it easier on your eyes in dim conditions. It really does work well -- and if you're anything like me, once you get used to it, you'll want it on whenever the evening hours arrive. And that gets at the best part of the feature: You can actually set the Pixel's night mode to activate and deactivate itself automatically based on the amount of daylight wherever you are. jr Just dance over to the Display section of your system settings and tap the line labeled "Night Light." Select "Turn on automatically" and choose "Sunset to sunrise" to have the screen light soften itself whenever dusk hits and go back to normal when morning arrives. Tip #3: Let Google give you the gift of free data Mobile data can be a precious (and costly!) commodity these days, so take note: A little-known Pixel feature can help you tap into readily available high-quality Wi-Fi connections and limit the amount of carrier-based mobile data you use. It's a core feature of Google's unusual Project Fi wireless service -- and it's now available to all Pixel (and Nexus) owners as well. The way it works, in short, is that whenever Google senses a fast and reliable public Wi-Fi network in your vicinity, it'll connect you to that network while encrypting all of your incoming and outgoing data for security. That way, you'll stay online without burning through any of your mobile data allotment. jr All you've gotta do is go to the Google section of your Pixel's system settings, then select "Networking" and activate "Wi-Fi Assistant" to opt in. (If you're using Project Fi as your carrier, the option should already be activated by default as part of the service.) Tip #4: Expand what your Pixel's fingerprint scanner can do The Pixel's fingerprint scanner is great for security, sure, but why not expand its usefulness and make it do even more? A third-party app called Fingerprint Gestures lets you assign all sorts of custom actions to the Pixel's fingerprint scanner so it can have a purpose even after you unlock your phone. I use it to create a more convenient Home button, for instance -- one I can easily tap without shifting my hand at all, especially when I'm using my Pixel single-handedly. It's far more practical and powerful than the single (and somewhat silly) fingerprint gesture offered in the Pixel's own settings. Tip #5: Turn Google into your communications gatekeeper For Goog's sake, it's 20-freakin'-17. Shouldn't we be past the point of dealing with spam calls and texts on our supposedly "smart" phones already? If you have a Pixel, thank your lucky stars -- for the answer is a resounding "yes." The phone's software actually has some pretty advanced spam-blocking tools, and all you have to do is get in the habit of using 'em. The next time you get a call from someone questionable, head into your Phone app and tap the clock icon (the second icon from the left) at the top of the screen to pull up your call history. Find the offending number, then press and hold it for a second and select "Block/report spam" from the box that appears. Once you confirm that's what you want to do, Google will prevent that number from ever reaching you again and will also report it as spam to Google's own evolving database. Any numbers you block will be prevented from texting you in Google's Messenger app, too, and best of all: Your list of blocked numbers will automatically sync up with any Android phone you use in the future (as long as it also runs Android 7.0 or higher). Oh, and one more thing: You can see a list of all the numbers you've blocked -- and manually add a number to the list, if you're ever so inclined -- by tapping the settings icon in the upper-right corner of the Phone app and selecting "Settings" followed by "Call blocking." And while you're in the Phone app's settings, take a minute to look under the "Caller ID & spam" option and make sure that option is activated. It'll allow Google to show you the name of an incoming caller even if their number isn't saved in your own contacts and will alert you when an incoming call is from a number associated with spam. Tip #6: Unlock your Pixel camera's potential The Pixel has a spectacular camera, but there's one asterisk to be aware of: By default, it won't capture certain types of content at the highest possible quality. To fix that, open your phone's Camera app, tap the menu icon in the upper-left corner, and select "Settings." Find the option labeled "Back camera video resolution," tap it, and then select "UHD 4K." (Remember, your Pixel comes with free unlimited photo and video storage on Google Photos, so you don't have to worry about how much extra space the higher quality format will take up.) While you're there, look for the option labeled "Panorama resolution" and change it to "High." If you ever take a panoramic photo with your phone (which you should, at least once!), you'll be grateful for the better quality. Tip #7: Take photos without lifting a finger The new Google Assistant brings some confusing inconsistencies to the realm of Android voice commands -- but along with that, it brings some handy new features to owners of Pixel phones. One of them is the ability to start a countdown and take a photo simply by speaking out loud. It couldn't be easier, either: Just say "OK Google, take a picture" to start a three-second countdown with your rear-facing camera -- or "OK Google, take a selfie" to do the same with the front-facing one. If you want to set a specific amount of time for the countdown, just add that into either command -- "OK Google, take a picture in 15 seconds," for instance. And don't forget to smile, you good-lookin' son-of-a-gun. Tip #8: Bring your Pixel's wallpaper to life Live wallpapers have been around on Android for ages, but they haven't gotten much love from Google in a long time -- and as a result, they've kind of stagnated in terms of excitement and evolution. The Pixel changes that. Touch and hold on any open area of your home screen and select "Wallpapers" to explore the numerous new possibilities created specifically for this phone. I like "Aurora Time Lapse" (under the "Live Data" category), which shows you subtly shifting gradients based on the time of day and the current weather conditions wherever you happen to be. jr I also enjoy the "Daily wallpaper" option in the "Earth," "Landscapes," "Cityscapes," "Life," and "Textures" categories. It rotates through an array of lovely images for your background, with a new one appearing automatically on your home screen about once a day. Tip #9: Get lucky This last one's more silly than practical, but it's pretty fun -- and it can be an entertaining way to kill some time by yourself or with others (hello, family road trips!). With your Pixel nearby, say "OK Google, I'm feeling lucky." I'll let you find out what happens next.

Uconnect can be found in most of FCA’s brands and features an 8.4-inch touchscreen display as its main input source. The version of Uconnect powered by Android, to be demonstrated in a Chrysler 300 sedan at the 2017 Consumer Electronics Show, will run the latest version of Google’s popular operating system, version 7.0, nicknamed Nougat. ALSO SEE: Intel strengthens self-driving car presence with 15 percent stake in HERE digital maps firm The infotainment system has been designed so that the Android OS works away in the back end, controlling some key car features like the radio and comfort settings. There are also a few of Google’s own apps integrated with the system, such as Google Assistant and Google Maps. At the front end, the user will be faced with FCA’s own designs for the various screens, tailored to each of its brands. Google a step closer to taking control of infotainment Though a release date hasn't been mentioned, the move brings Google a step closer to taking control of car infotainment systems, just as it has in the smartphone world. Recall, the tech giant has already developed its own Android-based infotainment system. “Google is committed to building Android as a turn-key automotive platform that integrates deeply with the vehicle in a safe and seamless way,” senior Android developer Patrick Brady said in a statement. “This collaboration with FCA brings together the industry standard for connected car systems with Android to create powerful infotainment systems designed for the digital age.” Other automakers have been wary of ceding control of key components such as the infotainment system to an outside firm, especially when it comes to privacy of data collected. For example, we’ve already seen Toyota reject Android Auto and the similar Apple CarPlay smartphone integration system. It will be interesting to watch this battle play out.

Sort Of NPRPolitics There's More To It Elections Data & Tech Demographics Pop Culture Fact Check Stations Issues Twitter Facebook Twitter Facebook Politics Amid Ethics Office Debacle, Googling Congress Members Spiked. Sort Of Facebook Twitter Google+ Email January 4, 201712:21 PM ET Danielle Kurtzleben Twitter Amid this week's firestorm over Republicans' attempt to weaken the Office of Congressional Ethics (and subsequently, backpedal on that attempt), you may have seen this chart floating around the Internet. It depicts data from Google Trends about Americans' search interest in learning who their congressional representatives are, with a pronounced spike around 9 a.m. Tuesday. The Hill reported this on Tuesday, with the The New York Times later referencing the trend. The conclusion some are drawing is that people looked up their representatives, then called them to complain about the ethics issue, and that the groundswell of support got Congress members' attention. And, indeed, some Congress members reported that these phone calls did influence them. But there's a buyer-beware issue with this data, and with all Google Trends data — the problem of scale. While there's a "spike" here, there's no way to tell how big it is without comparing it to other popular — or unpopular — search terms. Depending on what you're comparing it to, that spike is little more than a speed bump. Here, for example, is the "who is my representative" search compared to searches for "Obamacare" in the U.S. over the past week. The spike nearly disappears here — as of 9 a.m. Tuesday, "who is my representative" registered at 7 on this chart, compared to 60 for Obamacare. Article continues after sponsorship But then, maybe that's not fair. Obamacare is a really big topic in the news right now. Let's try a Google search term that's still politics-related but with less mass appeal, like infrastructure. The Congress-member-search spike is a bit more apparent here, but it's still dwarfed even by searches for the relatively nonsexy topic of infrastructure. The really striking comparisons come when you compare this "spike" to searches for nonpolitics-related topics. How about a newly released, poorly reviewed movie? What about a certain pop superstar who recently gave a catastrophic performance on national TV? OK, so the spike for Mariah Carey happened a couple of days earlier, but you get the picture. It's true that Google Trends data can say something about what people care about, and that can be super-useful in a democracy where politicians are theoretically supposed to represent those cares. For example, researchers reported in October that Trump searches outstripped Hillary Clinton searches. They subsequently concluded that "this could be evidence that Mr. Trump is doing better than the polls project." But when that data is presented without a reference point, it can overstate the importance of a particular search trend. In fact, to get a term that has comparable volume to the Congress member search, you have to get creative and do a lot of random Googling. As it turns out, searches for "who is my representative" are roughly equal to searches for a 1990s trend that people have mostly forgotten. So searches for "who is my representative" spiked, surpassing Beanie Baby searches for the first time in ... well, a long time. None of this is to say that this spike didn't matter; lots more people than usual did Google their Congress members' offices, and anecdotal evidence suggests that there was an increase in people calling their Congress members. But it is to say that Google data on only one search term can misrepresent the size of a phenomenon. Yes, plenty of people were Googling their Congress members this week. But plenty more were watching that Mariah video. office of congressional ethics search term member search congress member representative congress members government ethics president elect donald trump House Republicans Congress ethics Google Facebook Twitter Google+ Email NPRPolitics There's More To It NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor Homepage News U.S. World Politics Business Technology Science Health Race & Culture Education Arts & Life Books Movies Pop Culture Food Art & Design Performing Arts Photography Music First Listen Songs We Love Music Articles Tiny Desk Videos Programs About NPR Overview NPR Finances People at NPR Support NPR Visit NPR Press Room NPR Extra Blog Careers at NPR Corrections NPR Ombudsman Permissions Help Contact Terms of Use Privacy Sponsorship Choices Text-Only

At CES 2016 Ford announced it was adopting CarPlay for their SYNC connectivity system. At CES 2017 Ford is taking another route.   While Apple and Google have revved up efforts to integrate their smartphone technologies with auto communications systems, Ford and Toyota on Wednesday announced the SDL Consortium which aims to develop an open-source software platform that app developers can use as an alternative to Apple's CarPlay and Google's Android Auto.   In Ford's press release issued today they noted that "Mazda Motor Corporation, PSA Group, Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. (FHI) and Suzuki Motor Corporation are the first automaker members of the consortium. Elektrobit, Luxoft, and Xevo join as the first supplier members. Harman, Panasonic, Pioneer and QNX have signed Letters of Intent to join." Harman, of course, translates to Samsung who acquired them in November.   Conveniently Apple competitors are happy, as Pandora, Spotify and iHeartRadio, are already available to Ford AppLink users. For more on this read the full press release here.   The non-profit group's goal is to promote more choice in how smartphones get connected to in-vehicle technologies like dashboard displays and voice recognition, and in other programming.   Toyota has resisted offering Apple's CarPlay and Google's Android Auto in its vehicles, citing concern that doing so would diminish safety and security. Ford offers them on all its 2017 model vehicles. But the No. 2 U.S. automaker still wants an open-source software platform that all app developers can use as an alternative to those of Google and Apple.   Bloomberg noted in their report that "Toyota first agreed to collaborate with Ford on car telematics systems in 2011. The automakers worry that if CarPlay and Android Auto establish themselves as must-have options, the influence of Apple and Google over the industry will grow."   It'll be interesting to see how this plays out over time because I think it's a huge gamble on their part. There has to be a really easy one button method to allow CarPlay to be the infotainment system of choice for Apple fans in their brand new vehicles or consortium automakers are going to lose customers. Maybe I'm right, maybe I'm wrong. Where do you stand on this?   About Making Comments on our Site: Patently Apple reserves the right to post, dismiss or edit any comments.

SME focus Mr. Prasad was speaking at a Google event in the national capital, where Sundar Pichai, CEO of the global major, announced a slew of initiatives targeted at small and medium businesses in the country. Mr. Pichai said the company was working on products for India that could be taken to global markets. The Minister appealed to the U.S.-headquartered firm to work more towards ensuring digital security, particularly in the backdrop of the push towards digitisation post-demonetisation. “There has to be greater technological strengthening of the IT walls,” he added. IT Secretary Aruna Sundararajan, also present at the event said, the Bharat Interface for Money (BHIM)app launched last week had seen 5 million downloads and about a million transactions. A joint study by Google-KPMG said that rising Internet penetration and greater uptake for digital by SMBs could help increase their contribution to India’s GDP by 10 percentage points, taking it up to 46-48 per cent by 2020. Mr. Pichai, who is scheduled to visit his alma mater, IIT Kharagpur, tomorrow, said, “When we solve for a place like India, we solve for everyone around the world. That has led us to grow our team here and spend more time and ensure the products are useful for everyone,” he said. Google rolled out Digital Unlocked, a training programme to enable SMBs in India to start using the Internet. Under this initiative, 5,000 workshops will be held across 40 Indian cities in the next three years, while the online training will comprise 90 video tutorials. These will be available free of charge and the training will be certified by Google, Indian School of Business and FICCI. It also launched a free mobile app, Primer, to teach digital marketing skills in an interactive way. Available for Android and Apple phones, Primer will also work offline and is currently available in English and Hindi with Tamil, Telugu and Marathi versions coming shortly. The US-based firm also previewed My Business Websites to help businesses to have a rich, mobile-optimised digital presence that will be launched later this year. About 68 per cent of the 51 million SMBs in India do not have an online presence, it is learnt. These initiatives will help Google reach out to them. More than 8 million Indian SMBs are already using Google's platforms. “It is important that SMBs have the right tools and skills to digitise. We believe it is important for us to invest in training and equip these individuals and small businesses to accelerate their journey of growth,” Mr. Pichai said. “SMBs have always been key users of our platform right from the beginning,” Google Vice-President India and South-East Asia Rajan Anandan said.

In the same week that Apple has announced a ‘big reveal’ on October 4th, Samsung have promised a Google revelation on October 11th at Samsung Mobile Unpacked in San Diego. It’s an event which showcases new phones but this one carries the subtitle ‘Google Episode’. Samsung are thought to be behind the Nexus Prime rather than early Android partner Motorola.Due to the timing of the event, we’re betting it’s an outing of the long awaited Google Nexus Prime and the next instalment of Android – Ice Cream Sandwich. You can see a leaked version of the Android update in action here. The picture to the right is a mock-up of the Google Nexus Prime by designer Federico Ciccarese but shows how a Nexus Prime phone could look. We’ll be lucky if it’s that silm, but it’s not a bad guess. Current thinking suggests a 1.5 Mhz dual core processor, 4.6 inch screen and a 10 megapixel camera. The current launch date for the Google Nexus Prime is expected to be November.   What Mobile Awards 2011: Vote and win!   Home » News » Google Nexus Prime release date, Ice Cream Sandwich leak TagsAndroidGoogle Nexus PrimeIce Cream Sandwich Previous Story Emporia RL1 review Next Story BlackBerry Bold 9900 review About the author What Mobile Website Related Posts Zivix Jamstik+ Smart Guitar Review By Thomas Wellburn The Jamstik+ is an interesting accessory...

The company is now preparing to launch a new high-end smartwatch, powered by Google's wearable OS. The 'pre-announcement' came at Qualcomm's CES keynote, at which the chipmaker formally revealed its new flagship-class Snapdragon 835 system-on-a-chip. The exact details of the new Swarovski device are not yet known, although it will, of course, include a Snapdragon chip. Indeed, very little was revealed about the Swarovski wearable, but we do know that it will be based on Android Wear. The second major version of Google's OS was originally slated for launch last year, but in September, the company announced its delay until 2017. Google has confirmed that it will launch two new Android Wear watches this year. Two models of Swarovski's smartwatch will be made available, supposedly with separate designs for men and women. Full details of the new device will be announced at the BaselWorld watch and jewelry expo in March.

Sort Of NPRPolitics There's More To It Elections Data & Tech Demographics Pop Culture Fact Check Stations Issues Twitter Facebook Twitter Facebook Politics Amid Ethics Office Debacle, Googling Congress Members Spiked. Sort Of Facebook Twitter Google+ Email January 4, 201712:21 PM ET Danielle Kurtzleben Twitter Amid this week's firestorm over Republicans' attempt to weaken the Office of Congressional Ethics (and subsequently, backpedal on that attempt), you may have seen this chart floating around the Internet. It depicts data from Google Trends about Americans' search interest in learning who their congressional representatives are, with a pronounced spike around 9 a.m. Tuesday. The Hill reported this on Tuesday, with the The New York Times later referencing the trend. The conclusion some are drawing is that people looked up their representatives, then called them to complain about the ethics issue, and that the groundswell of support got Congress members' attention. And, indeed, some Congress members reported that these phone calls did influence them. But there's a buyer-beware issue with this data, and with all Google Trends data — the problem of scale. While there's a "spike" here, there's no way to tell how big it is without comparing it to other popular — or unpopular — search terms. Depending on what you're comparing it to, that spike is little more than a speed bump. Here, for example, is the "who is my representative" search compared to searches for "Obamacare" in the U.S. over the past week. The spike nearly disappears here — as of 9 a.m. Tuesday, "who is my representative" registered at 7 on this chart, compared to 60 for Obamacare. Article continues after sponsorship But then, maybe that's not fair. Obamacare is a really big topic in the news right now. Let's try a Google search term that's still politics-related but with less mass appeal, like infrastructure. The Congress-member-search spike is a bit more apparent here, but it's still dwarfed even by searches for the relatively nonsexy topic of infrastructure. The really striking comparisons come when you compare this "spike" to searches for nonpolitics-related topics. How about a newly released, poorly reviewed movie? What about a certain pop superstar who recently gave a catastrophic performance on national TV? OK, so the spike for Mariah Carey happened a couple of days earlier, but you get the picture. It's true that Google Trends data can say something about what people care about, and that can be super-useful in a democracy where politicians are theoretically supposed to represent those cares. For example, researchers reported in October that Trump searches outstripped Hillary Clinton searches. They subsequently concluded that "this could be evidence that Mr. Trump is doing better than the polls project." But when that data is presented without a reference point, it can overstate the importance of a particular search trend. In fact, to get a term that has comparable volume to the Congress member search, you have to get creative and do a lot of random Googling. As it turns out, searches for "who is my representative" are roughly equal to searches for a 1990s trend that people have mostly forgotten. So searches for "who is my representative" spiked, surpassing Beanie Baby searches for the first time in ... well, a long time. None of this is to say that this spike didn't matter; lots more people than usual did Google their Congress members' offices, and anecdotal evidence suggests that there was an increase in people calling their Congress members. But it is to say that Google data on only one search term can misrepresent the size of a phenomenon. Yes, plenty of people were Googling their Congress members this week. But plenty more were watching that Mariah video. office of congressional ethics search term member search congress member representative congress members government ethics president elect donald trump House Republicans Congress ethics Google Facebook Twitter Google+ Email NPRPolitics There's More To It NPR thanks our sponsors Become an NPR sponsor Homepage News U.S. World Politics Business Technology Science Health Race & Culture Education Arts & Life Books Movies Pop Culture Food Art & Design Performing Arts Photography Music First Listen Songs We Love Music Articles Tiny Desk Videos Programs About NPR Overview NPR Finances People at NPR Support NPR Visit NPR Press Room NPR Extra Blog Careers at NPR Corrections NPR Ombudsman Permissions Help Contact Terms of Use Privacy Sponsorship Choices Text-Only
Home Industry Google offers digital sops to India: launches free digital training, free website for Indian SMBs Google offers digital sops to India: launches free digital training, free website for Indian SMBs There are 51 million SMBs in India, of which only 32% are online, 68% are still offline, says Google By: Mohd Ujaley | Published: January 4, 2017 10:55 PM Google CEO Sunder Pichai interacts with Union Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad. (Express Photo by Praveen Khanna) Eying on India’s thriving small and medium businesses (SMBs), global technology giant Google launches a free digital training program – Digital Unlocked and previewed free website for SMBs in India. In an event in New Delhi today, Google CEO Sunder Pichai said that SMBs are backbone of India’s economy as they contribute 37% in country’s GDP but they are also the one who think that “Internet is not for them.” “There are 51 million SMBs in India, of which only 32% are online. The large number – 68% are still offline because most of them do not understand the benefit of going digital and they also face technical challenges,” said Rajan Anandan, ‎vice president, South East Asia and India at Google. Google says that is why it is important to provide the right tools and skills to digitise India’s SMBs. “We believe it is important for us to invest in training and equipping these individuals and small businesses to accelerate their journey of growth,” said Pichai. You May Also Like To Watch This: Company executives asserted that Digital Unlocked will address both these challenges and impart essential digital skills that will help SMBs to get online and start using the Internet to grow their business. Google has built this program across online, offline and mobile. The offline training is being conducted in partnership with industry body FICCI and over the next three years, 5,000 workshops will be held across 40 Indian cities. “A day workshop will comprise of an 8 hours rigorous training on going digital,” said Sapna Chadha, country marketing manager, Google India. The online training comprises a set of 90 self-paced video tutorials and is available free of charge at g.co/digitalunlocked. The tutorials cover a set of topics ranging from building a web presence and driving online growth to reaching customers over mobile and video. The trainings are certified by Google, Indian School of Business and FICCI. Google also launched Primer, a free mobile app designed to teach digital marketing skills in a quick, easy and interactive way. It is available for download through the Google Play and iOS app store. Primer also works offline and is currently available in English and Hindi with Tamil, Telugu and Marathi versions coming shortly. Company also previewed My Business Websites, aimed at offering SMB with a simple way to start their free optimised website. Currently less than 6% of SMBs have web presence and “Google plans to target 90% of them,” said Pichai. Available for Google My Business users later in the year, this new feature will provide simple, templated, editable websites for small businesses created from their data and photos on Google Maps. My Business Websites will be available in English, Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Marathi, Tamil, Urdu, Gujarati, Kannada, and Malayalam. Over 8 million Indian SMBs are already on these platforms. “Both of these platforms are going to help SMBs in India,” said IT secretary, Aruna Sundarajan, adding that “we need scale, speed and agility to serve large market like India.” Participating in the event, India’s IT minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said, “We missed industrial revolution, we missed entrepreneurial revolution but we don’t want to miss digital revolution.” He urged Google India to bring expertise to ensure security of the digital platform and focus on cybersecurity in India. “In 3-4 years time, India’s digital economy is going to be a one trillion business,” he said.

Sort Of Facebook Twitter Google+ Email January 4, 201712:21 PM ET Danielle Kurtzleben Twitter Amid this week's firestorm over Republicans' attempt to weaken the Office of Congressional Ethics (and subsequently, backpedal on that attempt), you may have seen this chart floating around the Internet. It depicts data from Google Trends about Americans' search interest in learning who their congressional representatives are, with a pronounced spike around 9 a.m. Tuesday. The Hill reported this on Tuesday, with the The New York Times later referencing the trend. The conclusion some are drawing is that people looked up their representatives, then called them to complain about the ethics issue, and that the groundswell of support got Congress members' attention. And, indeed, some Congress members reported that these phone calls did influence them. But there's a buyer-beware issue with this data, and with all Google Trends data — the problem of scale. While there's a "spike" here, there's no way to tell how big it is without comparing it to other popular — or unpopular — search terms. Depending on what you're comparing it to, that spike is little more than a speed bump. Here, for example, is the "who is my representative" search compared to searches for "Obamacare" in the U.S. over the past week. The spike nearly disappears here — as of 9 a.m. Tuesday, "who is my representative" registered at 7 on this chart, compared to 60 for Obamacare. Article continues after sponsorship But then, maybe that's not fair. Obamacare is a really big topic in the news right now. Let's try a Google search term that's still politics-related but with less mass appeal, like infrastructure. The Congress-member-search spike is a bit more apparent here, but it's still dwarfed even by searches for the relatively nonsexy topic of infrastructure. The really striking comparisons come when you compare this "spike" to searches for nonpolitics-related topics. How about a newly released, poorly reviewed movie? What about a certain pop superstar who recently gave a catastrophic performance on national TV? OK, so the spike for Mariah Carey happened a couple of days earlier, but you get the picture. It's true that Google Trends data can say something about what people care about, and that can be super-useful in a democracy where politicians are theoretically supposed to represent those cares. For example, researchers reported in October that Trump searches outstripped Hillary Clinton searches. They subsequently concluded that "this could be evidence that Mr. Trump is doing better than the polls project." But when that data is presented without a reference point, it can overstate the importance of a particular search trend. In fact, to get a term that has comparable volume to the Congress member search, you have to get creative and do a lot of random Googling. As it turns out, searches for "who is my representative" are roughly equal to searches for a 1990s trend that people have mostly forgotten. So searches for "who is my representative" spiked, surpassing Beanie Baby searches for the first time in ... well, a long time. None of this is to say that this spike didn't matter; lots more people than usual did Google their Congress members' offices, and anecdotal evidence suggests that there was an increase in people calling their Congress members. But it is to say that Google data on only one search term can misrepresent the size of a phenomenon. Yes, plenty of people were Googling their Congress members this week.

Login Register Public Release: 4-Jan-2017 What do Google search queries reveal about brand attitudes? Researchers worked with Google to compare brand surveys to online searches Drexel University Share  Print  E-Mail It has been widely thought that brand search volume -- the counts of queries that a search engine receives from users that include specific brand names, like "iPhone" -- can predict sales for that brand. Google makes this information available to marketers for free through Google Trends, an application that allows anyone to see how frequently popular brand names are searched, and it has become a valuable tool for marketers. But new research from Drexel University, Brigham Young University and Google shows there is a lot more to consider when looking at the large number of queries that include brand names. In order to investigate the relationship between brand attitudes and search engine queries, the researchers -- Jeffrey P. Dotson, associate professor of marketing and global supply chain at Brigham Young University; Elea McDonnell Feit, assistant professor of marketing at Drexel University; and Ruixue Rachel Fan, Jeffrey D. Oldham and Yi-Hsin Yeh of Google -- studied over 1,500 Google users who opted in to have their searches related to smartphones and vehicles tracked over a period of eight weeks and then linked their responses to a traditional brand attitude survey. "Using a panel of users who gave us specific permission to track their brand searches gave us a unique perspective on how brand attitudes relate directly to what individual users search for," said Feit. "It was a lot of work to recruit that panel and secure their permission, but the end result is some findings that we think are vitally important to marketers." They found that users who are actively shopping in a category are more likely to search for any brand. However, as users move from being aware of a brand to intending to purchase a brand, they are increasingly more likely to search for that brand -- with the greatest gains as customers go from recognition to familiarity and from familiarity to consideration. For example, someone who is just beginning to consider purchasing a car, is more likely to start with a general search that does not include any brands. As the consumer narrows their decision before a purchase, he/she will start searching for a specific brand. They also found that users who own and use a particular car or smartphone are much more likely to search for that brand, even when they are not actively shopping. This suggests that a substantial volume of brand search in these categories is not related to shopping at all -- something marketers should keep in mind if they see a sudden spike in search traffic for their brand. Positive brand attitude and consumer searches Specifically, in the smartphone category, the estimates from the research indicated that all five of the brand attitudes--recognition, recall, familiarity, purchase considerations and purchase intent--were positively associated with brand search. The data confirmed that customers who hold positive attitudes toward a brand are more likely to search for that brand. For example, in the smartphone category the odds of searching for a brand is seven times higher for a user who holds all five positive brand attitudes, versus a user who holds no positive brand attitudes. Similarly, for the automotive category, the odds of searching for a brand for a user who holds all five positive brand attitudes is five times higher than for a user who doesn't hold any positive attitudes. For both categories, they found the biggest increases in search propensity to search from customers who are familiar and would consider purchasing the brand. Customers who only recognize a smartphone brand and hold no other positive attitudes, were only 1.22 times more likely to search for a brand than those who don't recognize the brand. Behavior of customers in the market The researchers found that customers who are actively shopping are more likely to search for any brand in a category. "Customers who indicated that they were in-the-market during the observation period were significantly more likely to search for any brand," said Dotson. "Similarly, customers who indicated that they 'always pay attention to the category so that they know when to buy' are more likely to search for all brands in the category. This suggests that a substantial portion of the brand search queries that are submitted to Google are associated with users who are shopping for the product." Customers who own a brand The researchers found that owning a particular smartphone or vehicle brand is a very strong predictor of brand search, with the odds of searching being 2.5 times greater for brand owners versus non-owners in the smartphone category and 3.5 times greater in the vehicle category. The large increase in brand search among owners (regardless of whether that user is actively shopping), could be partially due to owners searching for information about how to use the product, according to the researchers. Marketers who are interpreting total brand search volume (e.g. Google Trends data), should expect that brand search will be higher for brands with more owners, irrespective of consumers' attitudes toward the brand. "Somewhat surprisingly, we did not find that owners who are having problems with the brand are significantly more likely to search for the brand than other owners, suggesting that information search is not simply associated with problems or product recalls, but that there is a steady volume of search produced by brand owners, where consumers are likely to have questions about usage and maintenance of the product they use daily," the researchers wrote. Product category effects It's also important to note that some categories of products will always draw more searches before a purchase because of the nature of the purchase. Research prior to purchase is likely to be greater for furniture, appliances, financial services, cars and smartphones. For these categories, an increase in brand attitude could lead to increases in search queries for the brand. For other product categories, searches prior to purchase may not apply but that doesn't mean that purchases are minimal. Coca-Cola, for example, may not have a high search volume in queries, but has a high volume of sales. "There is still a good deal of work to do to figure out exactly how marketers should interpret brand search volume for specific brands in specific categories, but this research confirms that marketers should start using brand search volume data to monitor their brand's health," said Dotson. Feit added, "Marketers have long used brand attitude surveys to monitor brand health but surveys are expensive and fewer and fewer people want to answer them. This research adds to the mounting evidence that we can track brands more passively using new data sources like brand search." The paper, "Brand Attitudes and Search Engine Queries," is forthcoming in the Journal of Interactive Marketing. ### Disclaimer: AAAS and EurekAlert! are not responsible for the accuracy of news releases posted to EurekAlert! by contributing institutions or for the use of any information through the EurekAlert system.

Music Business Worldwide reports that "high-level rumours" say Google is "very interested" in the acquisition, also claiming that SoundCloud could now be purchased by the company for closer to $500 million USD. This new price tag is around half of what Spotify had hope to initially acquire SoundCloud for. The report also highlights that should a sale to Google happen, Universal, Sony and Warner will all receive a cut thanks to their ownership stakes in the company, which were confirmed through looking at SoundCloud's financial filings. Rough approximations done by Music Business Worldwide show that the three majors would get a cut of $45 million USD between them. You can read the full report here.

Image Credit: Google Google’s DeepMind artificial intelligence (AI) research group is back again at the ancient Chinese game of Go. Rather than playing top-ranking Go players in person (with the help of a human to make its moves), now AlphaGo has gone up against players and beat them online — and covertly at that. Earlier today Google DeepMind founder Demis Hassabis posted a message to Twitter confirming that an updated version of AlphaGo had in fact played people online. “Over the past few days we’ve played some unofficial online games at fast time controls … to check that it’s working as well as we hoped,” Hassabis wrote. “We thank everyone who played our accounts Magister(P) and Master(P) on the Tygem and FoxGo servers.” This concludes the bout of wondering just who that very good online player was. A report today from China Daily indicates that many people weren’t sure, and that some suspected it was indeed a computer. One player, Gu Li, even offered up 100,000 yuan, or $14,300, to the person who could beat the Go player, according to the newspaper. In the message posted to Twitter, DeepMind said now that the unofficial testing is done, it’s “looking forward to playing some official, full-length games later this year in collaboration with Go organizations and experts, to explore the profound mysteries of the game further in this spirit of mutual enlightenment.” ABOUT CONTACT CAREERS ADVERTISE Terms of Service Privacy Policy © 2017 VentureBeat.

The alliance has shared its main goal of creating more choice for connecting smartphones with vehicles, which in turn could create some friction with Google, Apple, and their visions for integrating and controlling the user interface inside of cars. The history of this consortium started about six years ago as Ford and Toyota shared some concerns with how Google and Apple could take over the the in-dash entertainment system along with safety and security features. Toyota first agreed to collaborate with Ford on car telematics systems in 2011. The automakers worry that if CarPlay and Android Auto establish themselves as must-have options, the influence of Apple and Google over the industry will grow. The other automakers that have recently joined include, Mazda, PSA Group, Subaru (Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd.), Suzuki, and Peugeot (PSA Group). All of these manufacturers will have Android Auto on coming soon, while Ford includes the option for Android Auto on all of its 2017 models. Notably, Toyota doesn’t offer Android Auto at all. Toyota has resisted offering Apple’s CarPlay and Google’s Android Auto in its vehicles, citing concern that doing so would diminish safety and security. In their joint statement, Toyota and Ford provided a little more detail about their concerns, noting that “by enlarging the consortium, the automakers hope to maintain control over how much access infotainment apps have to vehicle data.” There are a few choices for aftermarket Android Auto options, but it seems they are becoming more and more difficult to retro-fit into newer vehicles. It will be interesting to see how this consortium will effect the future of Google’s integration with vehicles in the years to come.

Sensing a major opportunity, Indian-origin Google CEO Sundar Pichai has made two visits in less than a year. © Photo: pixabay Google Street View Catches Russian Bear in Action (PHOTO)New Delhi (Sputnik) — Riding on the support of the Indian Government, Google is targeting the key virgin market of small and medium Indian traders that can help double its market share in a very short span of time. Google's "Digital Unlocked" program aims to ensure that every single small business in India that wants to go digital has access to quality training. The training will be offered online, offline and on mobile phones. A research by KPMG, global research and audit firm, suggests that 68 per cent of the 51 million Indian small and medium businesses (SMBs) are offline. Google hopes to cash in on this unique opportunity by launching a training program to empower SMBs with essential digital skills that will enable them to get online and start relying on the internet to grow their business. © AP Photo/ After 'Toilet Locator', Google Now Hopes to Reap #Demonetization Bonanza in IndiaThe Indian Government's backing to Google can be gauged from the words of India's IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad who said, "Google is as much an Indian company as American. The sheer numbers of people in India who have accepted you mean you have an obligation for India as much as you have for the United States." The Indian government invites Google to involve in strengthening the country's move towards cyber commerce. "In a larger push, I want Google to be involved in a more meaningful way. The more digital we go, the more challenges there will be in terms of cyber security," Ravi Shankar said at an event in Delhi where Pichai announced the Digital Unlocked initiative for India's SMBs. Ravi Shankar's remarks are very important for Google as the Indian Government plans to launch a $150 million project related to cyber security. "Google India needs to tailor its operation more to India's psyche, local languages, local aspirations, local products… India's digital economy is going to be $1 trillion plus in the coming 3-4 years," Ravi Shankar said. © AP Photo/ Virginia Mayo, File After Public Outrage, Google Removes Holocaust-Deniers as Top Search ResultGoogle also previewed "My Business Websites" which aims to provide easy-to-use offerings to help businesses have a rich, mobile optimized digital presence that will be launched later this year. The free websites will provide simple, editable websites for small businesses created from their data and photos on Google Maps. My Business Websites will be available in English and several Indian languages such as Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Marathi, Tamil, Urdu, Gujarati, Kannada, and Malayalam. In 2016, Google had launched Google My Business aimed at helping SMBs gain an online presence on Google Search and Google Maps, without having to invest in a website or domain. Over eight million Indian SMBs are already on these platforms, with thousands more coming online every month. Revenue collection for Google India has witnessed a sharp jump in past two years and explains the reason for the continuing focus on the country. Its annual turnover crossed $887 million in 2015-16. ...

But thanks to a new partnership between Hyundai and Google Home, Hyundai owners will soon be able to send commands to their vehicles without lifting a finger. The new feature allows all functions available through the car company’s Blue Link service to be activated with voice control, The Verge reports. The collaboration was announced at this year’s Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada. Hyundai owners with Blue Link are already able to start their engines and unlock their doors using an Apple or Android device. When Hyundai launches their Google Home feature, users will be able to control their cars by talking into the voice-activated speaker inside their homes. Google Home can also send directions directly to your car from indoors. Just ask Google to search for a location and Blue Link’s Google Maps-powered Destination Search service will find the ideal route. Voice-controlled virtual assistants are slowly expanding their reach beyond just our phones and laptops. Last month, Microsoft revealed that they were developing Cortana software for toasters, thermostats, and fridges. This latest project between Hyundai and Google Home marks one of the first occasions a digital home assistant will be used to control the vehicles parked in our driveways. Hyundai didn’t say when to expect the feature, but they plan to announce more capabilities before its release.

According to a Google spokesperson, the initiative aims to help brands and their agencies produce episodic content designed to build an audience, while executing a “test-and-learn” approach. “The YouTube Labs motto is better done than perfect,” said a Google spokesperson in an email to Marketing Land. The program launched last year with L’Oreal as the exclusive brand partner within the U.S. Over the course of four weeks, L’Oreal produced two episodes that were shared on its Essie, Maybelline and Dark & Lovely YouTube brand channels, and ran as TrueView Instream ads. The Google spokesperson said that the program offers a new way for brands to work with creators. “The YouTube creators weren’t beauty experts, but rather cross-industry talent who were used behind the camera as a creative consultant, as opposed to being the talent,” said the Google spokesperson, “Creators were selected specifically according to brands’ challenges, ethos, and brief.” Google says it didn’t directly connect the creators to the brands, but worked with the influencer network, AwesomenessTV, to locate creators whose talents best fit the brand’s creative needs. According to a report from Ad Age, while L’Oreal had exclusive use of YouTube Labs in the U.S. last year, BMW, Johnson & Johnson and Mondelez were part of YouTube Labs test run in Europe. The Ad Age story says the program will be open to more brands in the U.S. this year. Google’s president of client and agency relations, Kirk Perry, told Ad Age that Google doesn’t make any money or charge a fee for the brand-creator arrangements, but the creators do. Perry says Google makes its money from the paid ad revenue generated by the videos on YouTube. Brands are also free to use the video content on other platforms or their own websites.

But 2017 could be the year that the field sheds its research-only image. Computing giants Google and Microsoft recently hired a host of leading lights, and have set challenging goals for this year. Their ambition reflects a broader transition taking place at start-ups and academic research labs alike: to move from pure science towards engineering. “People are really building things,” says Christopher Monroe, a physicist at the University of Maryland in College Park who co-founded the start-up IonQ in 2015. “I’ve never seen anything like that. It’s no longer just research.” Google started working on a form of quantum computing that harnesses superconductivity in 2014. It hopes this year, or shortly after, to perform a computation that is beyond even the most powerful ‘classical’ supercomputers—an elusive milestone known as quantum supremacy. Its rival, Microsoft, is betting on an intriguing but unproven concept, topological quantum computing, and hopes to perform a first demonstration of the technology. The quantum-computing start-up scene is also heating up. Monroe plans to begin hiring in earnest this year. Physicist Robert Schoelkopf at Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, who co-founded the start-up Quantum Circuits, and former IBM applied physicist Chad Rigetti, who set up Rigetti in Berkeley, California, say they expect to reach crucial technical milestones soon. Academic labs are at a similar point. “We have demonstrated all the components and all the functions we need,” says Schoelkopf, who continues to run a group racing to build a quantum computer at Yale. Although plenty of physics experiments still need to be done to get components to work together, the main challenges are now in engineering, he and other researchers say. The quantum computer with the most qubits so far — 20—is being tested in an academic lab led by Rainer Blatt at the University of Innsbruck in Austria. Whereas classical computers encode information as bits that can be in one of two states, 0 or 1, the ‘qubits’ that comprise quantum computers can be in ‘superpositions’ of both at once. This, together with qubits’ ability to share a quantum state called entanglement, should enable the computers to essentially perform many calculations at once. And the number of such calculations should, in principle, double for each additional qubit, leading to an exponential speed-up. This rapidity should allow quantum computers to perform certain tasks, such as searching large databases or factoring large numbers, which would be unfeasible for slower, classical computers. The machines could also be transformational as a research tool, performing quantum simulations that would enable chemists to understand reactions in unprecedented detail, or physicists to design materials that superconduct at room temperature. There are many competing proposals for how to build qubits. But there are two front runners, confirmed in their ability to store information for increasingly long times—despite the vulnerability of quantum states to external disturbance—and to perform quantum-logic operations. One approach, which Schoelkopf helped to pioneer and which Google, IBM, Rigetti and Quantum Circuits have adopted, involves encoding quantum states as oscillating currents in superconducting loops. The other, pursued by IonQ and several major academic labs, is to encode qubits in single ions held by electric and magnetic fields in vacuum traps. John Martinis, who worked at the University of California, Santa Barbara, until Google hired him and his research group in 2014, says that the maturity of superconducting tech­nologyprompted his team to set the bold goal of quantum supremacy. The team plans to achieve this using a ‘chaotic’ quantum algorithm that produces what looks like a random output (S. Boixo et al. Preprint at https://arxiv.org/abs/1608.00263; 2016). If the algorithm is run on a quantum computer made of relatively few qubits, a classical machine can predict its output. But once the quantum machine gets close to about 50 qubits, even the largest classical supercomputers will fail to keep pace, the team predicts. The results of the calculation will not have any uses, but they will demonstrate that there are tasks at which quantum computers are unbeatable—an important psychological threshold that will attract the attention of potential customers, Martinis says. “We think it will be a seminal experiment.” But Schoelkopf does not see quantum supremacy as “a very interesting or useful goal”, in part because it dodges the challenge of error correction: the ability of the system to recover its information following slight disturbances to the qubits, which becomes more difficult as the number of qubits increases. Instead, Quantum Circuits is focused on making fully error-corrected machines from the start. This requires building in more qubits, but the machines could also run more-sophisticated quantum algorithms. Monroe hopes to reach quantum supremacy soon, but that is not IonQ’s main goal. The start-up aims to build machines that have 32 or even 64 qubits, and the ion-trap technology will enable their designs to be more flexible and scalable than superconducting circuits, he says. Microsoft, meanwhile, is betting on the technology that has the most to prove. Topological quantum computing depends on excitations of matter that encode infor­mation by tangling around each other like braids. Information stored in these qubits would be much more resistant to outside disturbance than are other technologies and would, in particular, make error correction easier. No one has yet managed to create the state of matter needed for such excitations, let alone a topological qubit. But Microsoft has hired four leaders in the field, including Leo Kouwenhoven of the University of Delft in the Netherlands, who has created what seems to be the right type of excitation. “I tell my students that 2017 is the year of braiding,” says Kouwenhoven, who will now build a Microsoft lab on the Delft campus. Other researchers are more cautious. “I am not making any press releases about the future,” says Blatt. David Wineland, a physicist at the National Institute of Standards and Technology in Boulder, Colorado, who leads a lab working on ion traps, is also unwilling to make specific predictions. “I’m optimistic in the long term,” he says, “but what ‘long term’ means, I don’t know.” This article is reproduced with permission and was first published on January 3, 2017.

A #TalkingTech video LINK AKC smart collar helps find lost Fido and is one of 28 winners of the CES Innovation Awards. (Photo: Link AKC) Corrections & Clarifications: An earlier version of this story understated the number of products that received CES 'Best of Innovation' awards. LAS VEGAS — The trade show floor at CES 2017 doesn't open until Thursday, but we already know a few dozen of the coolest products here. The folks who put on CES, the Consumer Technology Association, have selected 35 products as worthy of the CES 2017 Best of Innovations Award,  defined as "a product or technology that scores above the threshold set for a specific category," says the association. The CTA recognizes honorees among 28 award categories: In several categories, including wearables and smart home, there are multiple winners. Here’s a sampling: — Augmented reality smartphone The brand new Phab Pro 2 smartphone from Lenovo brings Google’s Tango augmented reality technology to the phone for $499. Think Pokemon Go outside of the gaming world. As the company says, “look through the Phab 2 Pro, and you'll see objects and information overlaid onto the real world.” Examples include visualizing a new table or sofa at a store and how it would look in the home. —The smart dog collar Link's AKC collar promises to track where Fido is, and helps you find him should he get lost. The collar, just out, sells for $149, and there’s a monthly subscription charge as well, starting at $7 a month. The idea of a smart collar isn't new — there are many out there, including WUF and Squeaker. CTA didn't specific why it chose Link, so we look forward to checking it out on the show floor. — Do-it-yourself eye exams EyeQue looks to bring the eye exam into the home, via a smartphone app and a $29.99 optical device that connects to the app. The company is currently raising money for its product by taking pre-orders on a Kickstarter campaign that ends Wednesday. So far, nearly $120,000 has been raised, far exceeding the initial $25,000 goal. The rest of the winners: —Aipoly Vision — described as artificial intelligence that allows mobile phones to recognize thousands of items to assist the blind and visually impaired with exploring their surroundings. —Cota Tile - Traditional home ceiling tile that delivers wireless power without plugs and pads. —Cubit - A layout placement tool. —Goodix Live Fingerprint Scanner - Biometric security that determines your heartbeat signature from your finger. —HP Spectre - The new thin notebook from HP Inc. —Integrated Connectivity Cluster - An all-in-one information and communication system for motorcycles. —K'Track G - A wearable tracker that allows diabetics to measure in real time their blood glucose without blood extraction. —Lenovo Yoga Book - The 2-in-1 tablet.

Photo: Getty Images Alphabet, the company that owns Google, raked in $89 billion in revenue last year, analysts estimate, but there’s reason to believe that it could be making a lot more. Google is deliberately building its business slowly, bypassing revenue it could be making so it can draw in more users, says Bill Nygren, an investor from Chicago who runs the successful Oakmark fund. The comments came in an interview published in the latest issue of Barron’s. Nygren’s fund was up 18.7% in 2016. For instance, Google could be making more money off of YouTube.com if it charged for service or loaded it up with ads like a cable company might. But “rather than trying to monetize its viewership to its fullest extent right now, Alphabet is allowing it to grow.” YouTube could be worth as much as $300 a share, but right now investors are “paying almost nothing for it.” Barron’s estimated last year that YouTube is worth twice as much as Netflix. Nygren thinks Alphabet shares could rise 50%. On Tuesday, they were trading at $808. Alphabet also has divisions working on more speculative “moonshot” projects like driverless cars and artificial intelligence that may or may not pan out. Those projects look like “losses” on Alphabet’s financial statements because they cost the company money without immediate returns, but they could result in large financial gains in the future. And Alphabet has $130 per share in cash on its balance sheet, a massive sum that investors are not fully taking into account. Investors who aren’t looking at those details might think that Alphabet’s stock is expensive. But if people correctly account for all that cash and give the company more credit for its YouTube potential and the moonshots, then Alphabet is trading at an even cheaper multiple than the overall market. That makes it a value stock and worth buying. Read the full interview here at Barrons.com. Big Picture: Alphabet is worth more than the market thinks, in part because it’s been slow to monetize YouTube. Correction: An earlier version of this story misstated the amount of cash on Alphabet’s balance sheet. It’s $130 per share.

(Reuters/Susana Vera) Share Written by Carey Dunne January 04, 2017 On a frigid Saturday, pink and yellow Post-It notes scrawled with concerns about cybersecurity covered a wall of Eyebeam, a nonprofit art and technology center in Brooklyn. “Identity theft + surveillance = paranoia, plz help,” read one note. “How much of a threat do alt-right hackers pose on social media?” read another. “If you know your device has previously been accessed by NYPD, what can you do?” Fifty people had gathered at Eyebeam with their laptops and cellphones for a CryptoParty—basically a Tupperware party for learning encryption and web security. Founded in 2012 by Melbourne-based journalist Asher Wolf in response to increased internet surveillance in Australia, CryptoParty is a decentralized grassroots movement that offers free DIY workshops all over the world. If you’re concerned about online privacy (which everyone on the internet probably should be) but don’t know where to start, “Crypto Angels”—as the cybersecurity experts who volunteer at CryptoParties are called—will teach you how to use encryption tools to protect your information from government surveillance, cybercriminals, data-mining corporations, and other threats. Since the keys to the US surveillance state were handed over to a reality TV star who has spoken favorably about surveilling mosques and cracking down on free speech, interest in cybersecurity has surged, leading more people to seek out CryptoParties. Concerns are particularly high among groups who have been targeted in the past—including activists, journalists, people of color, immigrants, Muslims, and the LGBTQ community—but no one is immune to security breaches. CryptoParty-goers in Brooklyn that night included an immigration lawyer who wanted to help her clients avoid being digitally monitored, a tech-support consultant for leftist nonprofits, and a Justice for Palestine activist concerned about being surveilled during protests in the Donald Trump era. Adopting concrete cybersecurity habits is more involved than ticking off a quick checklist—install this app on your phone, install this plugin on your laptop, and boom, your information is encrypted!—and even for the tech-savvy, encryption is complicated and time-consuming with no one-size-fits-all solution. While it’s impossible to be completely safe online, you can always be safer. Here are 10 basic encryption lessons, courtesy of CryptoParty. 1. Consider using more secure alternatives than Google Docs “If you value anonymity and privacy from corporations or the government, you might not want to host all your work on Google’s infrastructure,” said Jamila Khan of Palante Technology Cooperative, who’s researching alternatives to Google Docs for progressive nonprofit clients. “When you use Google products, you’re not the customer—you are the product.” Google watches everything you do using their services, keeps all your data, and monetizes it through advertising. As for secure, private alternatives, Khan suggests word-processing platforms like Cryptpad or Riseup Pad; the latter is an Etherpad web service hosted by the activist network Riseup. These platforms offer real-time collaborative editing, but unlike Google Docs, they don’t collect your data. Riseup Pads are also automatically destroyed after 30 days of inactivity. 2. Don’t leave a digital breadcrumb trail If you want to keep a piece of information private, don’t put it online unless you have to. This one seems like a no-brainer, but plenty of people are cavalier about the stuff they text, email, write in Google Docs, and record digitally. The receiver of any communication you send can distribute those communications however they please. “People need to ask, ‘Should I be texting this or emailing it at all?’” said activist and poet Candace Williams, who led one of the CryptoParty workshops, and whose 70-Day Web Security Plan for Artists and Activists is a valuable resource. 3. Download a more secure messaging system Boost your email security by using encryption programs like GPG or PGP (“Pretty Good Privacy”). Getting the hang of PGP can be a bit complicated; here’s a handy guide by CryptoHarlem’s Matt Mitchell. Then try out encrypted text and email messaging platforms. The most popular encrypted messaging app is Signal, which Hillary Clinton’s US presidential campaign used after repeated data breaches. (Downloads spiked post-US election.) Webmail providers like May First/People Link, Riseup Mail, and ProtonMail, offer secure email and communication tools, some specifically designed for activists. But note that the only way to get end-to-end encryption is if both parties in communication use encrypted services (such as Proton to Proton, Riseup to MayFirst). 4. Surf the web safely For anonymous web browsing, download Tor. Use a search engine that doesn’t track you, like DuckDuckGo. The Tor browser protects your anonymity by bouncing your communications around a distributed network of Tor servers around the world, and encrypting that traffic so that it can’t be traced back to your computer. 5. If you go to a protest, leave your phone at home “When it comes to securing your phone at a protest, the threat model is tricky,” says activist Rose Regina, who taught a workshop on threat modeling at the CryptoParty. Depending on the nature of the protest, demonstrators’ phones might be surveilled by local police with stingray tracking devices, or even the FBI; as the Intercept first reported, US federal agencies have regularly monitored the Black Lives Matter protest movement since Ferguson, even watching over events like a funk music parade. “If it’s a low-key climate march, you might not need to take extra steps,” Regina says. “But if you’re going to do a hardlock in front of construction equipment building a pipeline, the likelihood is pretty much 100% that you’ll get arrested and your phone will be taken.” In that case, think about leaving your phone at home. If you can’t bear to part with it, use Signal to communicate while at the protest, making sure your phone has a screen lock that’s protected with a passcode. You should also disable fingerprint activation, which the police can ask you to use if they have a search warrant for your phone, and perhaps craft a signal-blocking cell phone pouch like the ones protesters used at the Republican National Convention. 6. Get serious about your passwords Enable two-factor authentication on all online accounts. Change your passwords every few months—and make sure they’re strong, which means random and unique. As goes the tech-nerd motto, “The only secure password is one you can’t remember.” Store your passwords using tools like 1Password, Dashlane, or LastPass, which will both securely store your passwords and generate random new ones for you. 7. Think about how you present yourself on social media The information you’re providing about yourself on social media profiles could become a liability. In the event of a crackdown on free speech, your posts on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and YouTube could become a form of self-incrimination, even if you haven’t committed a crime. In mid-November, for example, after a Rutgers University lecturer tweeted about flag-burning and other “incendiary” topics, the New York Police Department showed up at his door and forced him to undergo a psychiatric evaluation. The NYPD’s persistent monitoring and targeting of people of color on social media platforms has been called the new stop-and-frisk, which warrants caution about even jokingly posting online about criminal activity. 8. Know your threat models In cybersecurity land, “threat modeling” is the process of systematically analyzing the vulnerabilities of a given network or individual and identifying what measures should be taken to protect against probable threats. Whether you’re devising a threat model for securing your phone at a protest, your laptop when you don’t trust your roommate, or your online banking, ask yourself who you’re protecting yourself from, and how many layers of security you need. 9. Adopt encryption measures even if you don’t think you’re a likely target Some people still assume that if they’re a law-abiding citizen, they have nothing to hide and therefore don’t need encryption. But history suggests that’s naive. (See: Snowden’s warning about the NSA collecting your dick pics.) “A dream is to make being safe on the internet as automatic and normal as buckling your seatbelt in a car,” Candace Williams said. “The more people adopt privacy practices, the safer everyone is. It’s partly a future-proofing strategy.” 10. Don’t get paranoid, if you can help it “Power, not paranoia,” goes one CryptoParty catchphrase. While countless books and how-to articles teach DIY encryption, attending a CryptoParty has the added benefit of connecting you to real live humans with similar concerns, which can allay paranoia. “If you Google how to protect yourself online, it can be like looking up symptoms on WebMD—you’re going to get nightmare scenarios,” Williams says. Alternatively, attending a CryptoParty is like visiting a doctor who offers individualized advice—and tells you not to freak out. The beauty of the CryptoParty movement isn’t just the way it makes encryption more accessible: It also helps build activist communities and networks of resistance, encouraging average citizens to take their civil liberties into their own hands when they can’t trust people in power to protect those liberties for them.

 DeepMind secretly unleashed its Go-playing AI online, and it beat some of the world's best players 50-0 Sam Shead Jan. 4, 2017, 10:40 AM 11,365 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google DeepMind CEO Demis HassabisYouTube/Royal Television Society The creator of a mysterious artificial intelligence (AI) that has beaten some of the world's best human players at the Chinese board game Go over the last few days has been revealed as Google DeepMind. Demis Hassabis, the cofounder and CEO of Google DeepMind, tweeted a screenshot of a DeepMind update that stated: "We've been hard at work improving AlphaGo, and over the past few days we've played some unofficial online games at fast time controls with our new prototype version, to check that it's working as well as we hoped. "We thank everyone who played our accounts Magister (P) and Master (P) on the Tygem and FoxGo servers." Hassabis's announcement came within hours of a Business Insider story reporting that people were keen to know who was behind the Master AI.  "This whole thing is just really cool," wrote Reddit user Open_Thinker. "I hope we learn who the author(s) are soon." The anonymous AI had beaten more than 50 top Go players and some Reddit users were speculating that it could be world Go champion Lee Sedol in disguise. But others were quick to point out that not even the best human Go players could perform as well as the Master AI was performing. "It seems highly unlikely that any known human player could amass that record," wrote one Reddit user.  So a mysterious AI, 'Master', is trouncing top Go players online 50-0, likely superhuman, and no one knows who created it. How cyberpunk. — gwern (@gwern) January 4, 2017 Go is a complex game that has been notoriously difficult for computers to crack because of the sheer number of potential moves. It is a two-player turn-based strategy game where each player puts down either black or white stones in an attempt to outmaneuver and surround the other player. It's easy to pick up but takes years to master. Google Last year, DeepMind's AlphaGo AI managed to defeat Sedol over a five game tournament. After the opening game, Hassabis said in a press statement: "What an incredibly exciting game. Lee Sedol is a formidable opponent, famed for his fighting style, and AlphaGo decided to go toe-to-toe with him, which made for a tense, close-fought game. We still have four games to go, so anything can still happen. Whatever the outcome, we feel this match is a testament to the power of human ingenuity."

People who are sick or think they might be tend to search more for “flu treatment” or “flu symptoms”. The idea is that by monitoring millions of users’ behaviours online, the large number of Google search queries that are gathered can be analyzed to reveal the presence of flu-like illness in a population. In the United States, researchers have found that Google search data could be used to predict regional outbreaks of flu up to 10 days before they were reported by the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. One such peer-reviewed report, from a team of Harvard researchers, combines it with other data sets to more accurately track flu outbreaks. It is a good example of discoveries that can be make with “big data”, a term used to describe the analysis of massive amount of data to reveal trends. However, we cannot discard the possibility that the recent peak in search for the word flu on Google is also due to avian flu cases. The Swiss Federal Office of Public Health reported that during the last week of 2016, flu was widespread in Switzerland with 64 declared cases per 100,000 inhabitants. It largely exceeds the number of cases for the same week in 2014 and in 2015. © swissinfo.ch The above content produced by swissinfo.ch is not intended for commercial use and may not be republished by third parties either wholly or in part. 0 Comments To This Article Leave a Reply Most Read More workers forced to work shorter hour...

We round up the best media-streaming devices you can buy in the UK in 2017. We round up the best media-streaming devices you can buy in the UK in 2017 By Chris Martin | 04 Jan 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments These days you don't need to go to the expense of a smart TV to access services such as Netflix, Amazon or BBC iPlayer. We round up the best media streaming devices you can buy in the UK in 2017 that let you stream media to smartphones, tablets, PCs and laptops. Also see: Best Gadget Deals See also: Amazon Fire TV Stick vs Chromecast vs Roku Streaming Stick. There has been an enormous price crash in the market for media-streaming devices in the past year or so. Devices such as the Sky Now TV Box now cost less than a DVD – the disc, not the player. None of the devices on test here costs more than £99, and it’s now almost a no-brainer to connect one of these devices to your living-room TV instead of stumping up extra for a so-called ‘smart TV’. In fact, even if you have a TV with internet connectivity, it's bound to offer an inferior experience - not to mention a deficit in content - compared to the media streamers we've reviewed here. See also: Best Blu-ray players 2017 The content available through each streamer is the most important factor for most people. This is why it's crucial to check that the services you want are available. It's rare for one device to offer everything, but Roku has the biggest range going with hundreds of apps to choose between. The advantages of having a media streamer are manifold. You can stream films or TV shows from services such as Netflix or the BBC iPlayer without having to plug your laptop into the TV or have a noisy PC whirring away – all of these devices are silent in operation and consume very little power. Smartphone and tablet owners can beam content from their phones to the television wirelessly with many of these devices, so if you want to show the family the video you shot earlier that day, or perhaps play a family game using the Scrabble app, you simply press a button on your phone and beam the picture to the big screen so that everyone can see it instantly. See also: Amazon Prime Instant Video vs Netflix. Some of these media streamers can display content stored on other PCs, laptops and NAS drives connected to your home network, letting you enjoy your music collection in the lounge for family parties or share photo slideshows. Apps for online media services such as Spotify, Flickr and YouTube are also common now: you install those you want, and ignore those you don't. We’ve got two different types of media streamer on test here. Some are traditional set-top boxes that can work independently of any other device. Prices range from just £9.99 to £99, but there’s a huge discrepancy in features and capabilities from top to bottom, so read the individual reviews to see which best meets your needs. Then we have the Chromecast (of which a new version has recently been launched) and its thinly veiled imitator, the EZCast, which have to be used in conjunction with a smartphone, tablet or PC to serve content to them. These dongle-like devices plug straight into the TV and can be practically hidden from sight. The Roku Streaming Stick and Amazon Fire TV Stick are also dongles but come with remote controls and can work without another device such as a smartphone. Content continues below Gaming is a relatively new addition to media streamers. You can play casual games such as Tetris on Roku and Amazon devices as well as the Google Nexus Player, or opt for the Nvidia Shield TV for something a little more console-esque. You can even buy optional game pads if you're serious about wanting a games console experience. Best media streamers 2017 UK 1. Roku Streaming Stick Rating: Reviewed on: 1 October 14 RRP: £49 inc VAT The Roku Streaming Stick is one of the best media streamers around and worth the extra money compared with the Chromecast if you want more content at your fingertips plus the physical remote control and user interface. Read our Roku Streaming Stick review. 2. Roku 3 Rating: Reviewed on: 17 November 15 RRP: £99 inc VAT The Roku 3 is a premium player with a superior feature set to rivals. The wireless headphones are a boon and the UK content selection is superb, although we experienced lip-sync issues and network media playback is too unreliable. Read our Roku 3 review. 3. Google Chromecast 2 Rating: Reviewed on: 25 November 15 RRP: £30 inc VAT Owners of the original Chromecast have very little reason to upgrade the new model. Google has improved the design with the Chromecast 2 and added better Wi-Fi. We also like the new app and, in general, the device is a bargain at £30. However, the Roku Streaming Stick outclasses it for less than £10 extra with more content available, a remote control and excellent user interface. Read our Google Chromecast 2 review. 4. Amazon Fire TV Stick Rating: Reviewed on: 23 November 16 RRP: £35 inc VAT Thanks to its powerful internals and nice interface, the Fire TV Stick is a great gadget for watching Prime Instant Video, Netflix, and UK catchup TV. The remote may lack a mic, but you can still use voice search in Prime Instant Video using the iOS, Amazon or Android app. We still prefer the Roku for its sheer breadth of content, but if you're a Prime member, this is one of the best ways to watch the Instant Video service. Read our Amazon Fire TV Stick review. 5. Google Chromecast Rating: Reviewed on: 6 October 14 RRP: £30 inc VAT A brilliant, low-cost add-on for Android device users in particular, providing a blissfully simple way to beam video from your device to the big screen. People who want to stream their own media collection should look elsewhere. The Chromecast is cheap and easy to use, but there aren’t many apps that support it yet. This situation is bound to change over the coming months, but for now you might find your existing smart TV offers more. Read our Google Chromecast review. 6. Apple TV (2014 - PCA) Rating: Reviewed on: 3 October 14 RRP: £79 inc. VAT From a technical point of view, the Apple TV is as slick and neatly designed as you'd expect from Apple. However, its reliance upon iTunes and Netflix is frustrating for users outside the US, and the Apple TV won't live up to its considerable potential until Apple bites the bullet and opens it up to a wider range of online video services. Read our Apple TV (2014 - PCA) review. 7. Sky Now TV Box (2015) Rating: Reviewed on: 10 February 16 RRP: £14.99 inc VAT For under £15 and various value bundles, the second generation Sky Now TV Box is a great budget media streamer. It not only allows contract-free access to a wide range of Sky content but also a number of other apps including BBC iPlayer and ITV Hub. It's just a big shame that Now TV is limited to just 720p. Read our Sky Now TV Box (2015) review. 8. Amazon Fire TV 4K (2015, 2nd generation) Rating: Reviewed on: 14 November 16 RRP: £79.99 inc VAT The Fire TV is an excellent set-top box which is powerful and well designed. The voice search works well too, and Alexa is coming, which will make it far better. The interface is slick and easy to use, even if it can be confusing working out what you can watch on an Amazon Prime subscription. The Fire TV is one of the best video streamers, but it really makes sense if you pair it with a Prime Instant Video subscription and use Amazon's other services. 4K content at no extra cost is a huge bonus but don't forget that many 4K TVs already have the Prime Instant Video app. This means it's going to appeal to people who want 4K Prime Instant Video (or Netflix) but their TV doesn't have it. If that's you, just double-check your TV has an HDMI port which supports HDCP 2.2, otherwise you'll find 4K videos won't play. Read our Amazon Fire TV 4K (2015, 2nd generation) review. 9. Apple TV 2015 (4th-gen) Rating: Reviewed on: 22 March 16 RRP: 32GB: £129 ($149); 64GB: £169 ($199) For some people - mainly those with iOS devices and no 2nd- or 3rd-generation Apple TV - the new box is a great media streamer and games machine. However, there's no escaping the high price and limited selection of apps. And if you're not interested in gaming, you're just as well off buying a 3rd-generation Apple TV or Roku for less than half the price. Competition from other gaming media streamers is stiff, too, with Amazon's £79 Fire TV offering more UK catch-up TV as well as similar gaming performance, expandable storage and support for 4K content. Ultimately, the 4th-gen Apple TV has potential (Apple may even upgrade the software so it supports 4K at some point) but right now that potential is far from realised. Read our Apple TV 2015 (4th-gen) review. 10. Nvidia Shield TV Rating: Reviewed on: 9 January 17 RRP: £149.99 We’re extremely impressed by the Nvidia Shield both as a media streamer and as a games console. The beautiful UI and game-streaming technology is powered by one of the most impressive mobile processors on the market at the moment, and provides an experience akin to playing a PS4 or Xbox One. The native 4K resolution that supports 60fps playback is better than any other offering in the UK at the moment, with the Fire TV only being able to support [email protected] GeForce Now has been coined as the ‘Netflix for gaming’ and although the library may be a bit sparse at the moment, the experience is great – being able to choose from a library and play it instantly is an intriguing experience and gives us a glimpse at the future of on-demand gaming. The only real disappointment comes with the selection of catch-up TV apps, as we could only install BBC iPlayer, leaving those who want to use the likes of All4, Demand5 or ITV Hub without any option. The Shield is so close to being the perfect media streamer but without access to popular apps like those mentioned, it’ll always fall short. Read our Nvidia Shield TV review. 11. Roku 2 (2015) Rating: Reviewed on: 15 July 15 RRP: £69 inc VAT The Roku 2 is yet another decent media streaming box from the market leader and we like the new Roku Search and MyFeed features. However, these are available on the other Rokus and the slightly high price means you'll want to pay the extra for the better remote which comes with the Roku 3 or save money by getting the similar Streaming Stick. Read our Roku 2 (2015) review. 12. Google Nexus Player Rating: Reviewed on: 29 April 15 RRP: £79 inc VAT The Nexus Player is a decent media streamer, but it’s not an unqualified success. It’s only truly good if you’re pairing it with an Android phone or tablet in order to stream a much wider selection of content. However, if you only want to do that, you may as well buy a Chromecast which costs as little as £20 these days. iOS users are better off with an Apple TV. If you want to play games, it’s a pretty much a toss-up between the Fire TV and Nexus Player. Adding the cost of the Bluetooth gamepad, which is a must, the price shoots up to £115, which is dangerously close to previous-generation games consoles. And we haven't even mentioned the Roku 3, which offers a heck of a lot of content for basically the same price. For those in the UK, the Roku 3 and Streaming Stick are hard to beat. Read our Google Nexus Player review. 13. WD TV Live media streamer Rating: Reviewed on: 23 September 14 RRP: £80 inc. VAT The WD TV Live media streamer supports the streaming of many different video and audio formats, is easy to use and it performs well. Read our WD TV Live media streamer review. 14. Sky Now TV Box Rating: Reviewed on: 25 September 14 RRP: £9.99 inc VAT A perfectly capable media streamer, with dedicated remote control, for only £10 may look an indisputable bargain. It's light on features and obviously geared towards Sky's content, but if you want an inexpensive, fuss-free way of watching the occasional football match or TV series, it would be just the ticket providing Sky sorts out its streaming servers. Read our Sky Now TV Box review. 15. EZCast (M2) Rating: Reviewed on: 24 September 14 RRP: £14.95 inc VAT A poor impersonation of the Chromecast, which fails to get many of the basics right. Streaming video is choppy, screen sharing is awkward and there's no third-party app support. Simply not worth the £15 saving on Google's hardware. Read our EZCast (M2) review.

Comcast is transforming its Xfinity gateway to a smart digital home platform Watch out, Wi-Fi systems! Comcast is transforming its Xfinity gateway to a smart digital home platform Comcast's new cloud-based platform will bring ease of use, whole home Wi-Fi coverage and useful features to its broadband customers. Internet Services by Dong Ngo January 4, 2017 7:01 AM PST @riceandstirfry Up Next Nintendo's Fils-Aime: The Switch won't oust the 3DS Comcast announces all-in-one home Wi-Fi service and hardware at CES 2017 Comcast wants its customers to use its products and software to connect to the internet, and it's creating an easier, more powerful gateway to entice users. by Ashley Esqueda 1:26 Close Drag If you're one of those Comcast customers that has purchased your own cable modem and a separate router, or a mesh system like the Google Wifi, I hear you. Comcast's gateways -- the modem/Wi-Fi router combo box that you have to pay some $10 monthly rental fee to use -- tend to have short Wi-Fi range and limited features. That's about to change, however. Today at CES 2017 Comcast is demoing an all-new cloud-based platform for digital home that's slated to make life better for some 10 million customers that are currently using the broadband Xfinity gateways. On the surface, this is Comcast's effort to transform the existing gateways into a smarter a Wi-Fi solution to address the rise in popularity of cool solutions like the Google Wifi, the Eero or the Starry. Deep down, however, this shows the company's ambition to dominate the Wi-Fi system market. It has been working on a completely new and more capable gateway, called Advanced Gateway, that's due out in a few months. Powered by Intel Puma 7 SoC this new gateway is a full home mesh Wi-Fi system that will eventually replace all existing Comcast gateways. So what does this new platform include? Three things: new firmware that makes the gateway smarter, a back-end system that hosts Comcast cloud-based services, and a new front-end interface with a mobile app (iOS and Android) that users can utilize for both setup and ongoing management of their home network. The end result is similar to having a Wi-Fi system, like Google Wifi or the Eero, including: Easy setup: Customers can use the mobile app to scan a QR code on the gateway device and finish the initial setup process, including the device activation process, within a few minutes. Better connectivity: Comcast says its new Advanced Gateway, apart from being a powerful Wi-Fi router itself, will support compact, zero-configuration Wi-Fi extenders that users can place around the home to automatically increase Wi-Fi coverage when necessary. This resembles the new Covr Wi-Fi system that D-Link announced yesterday, though details on the extenders are still scratchy. Comcast says when extenders are used, customers can use the mobile app to test Wi-Fi signal strength to ensure that they are placed at an optimal distance from the Advanced Gateway for best performance. More features: Users can manage their home network with lots of practical features, including parental control, monitoring, scheduling, internet pause and so on. The system will also have voice and TV integration, allowing subscribers to use the Xfinity X1 and the voice remote, for example, to perform certain network-related tasks, such as displaying a list of all connected devices on the TV screen. Comcast says the new platform will also have built-in defense against phishing and malware. On top of that, more features will be made available via the regular updates. The new cloud-based platform for digital home will turn Comcast's once-limited gateway into a robust home Wi-Fi system that can be managed via a web interface, a mobile app or a big-screen TV. Photo by Comcast The new platform will be pushed to all existing supported gateways -- namely the Arris 1682G, the Cisco 3941T, and the Cisco 3939 -- in the first quarter of 2017 at no cost to the consumers. Customers who get the new Advanced Gateway -- which will be rolled slowly starting sometime in the first half of the year -- won't need to pay extra, either, but only the monthly rental free. So if you don't mind using Comcast equipment, this will be by far the biggest and coolest update, comparable to getting yourself the best Wi-Fi system. Considering the large number of customers who use Comcast gateways -- which Comcast expect to increase to 15 million by the end of 2017 -- this also means Comcast will soon have the largest share of Wi-Fi systems on the market, affording it a treasure trove of information relating to its customer's home network and online habits. This is because moving to the new platform also means your home network will be connected to Comcast at all times, via a Comcast.net account, the way Google Wifi is to Google. Comcast says it won't collect personal information, such as websites you visit or movies you stream and so on, and customers can choose to opt-out. Or they can still use their own equipment and therefore stay off Comcast's new cloud-based platform completely. Click here to find out what else is happening at CES 2017.

By: FE Online | New Delhi | Updated: January 4, 2017 8:58 PM The company’s vice president in South East Asia and India Rajan Anandan said that the country has seen explosive growth in digital payments. (ANI) The Google has today said that that the digital payments in India has increased much more than expected. The company’s vice president in South East Asia and India Rajan Anandan said that the country has seen explosive growth in digital payments which can be seen from the download of BHIM app which has crossed 5 million. Earlier in the day, in order to further tap into the small and medium businesses (SMBs) market in India, Google’s India-born CEO Sundar Pichai came out with several new initiatives to help these enterprises go digital. He said that the company is working on products for India that can be expanded globally. Speaking at a company’s event in the national capital, Sundar Pichai said that when Google solve for a place like India, it solve for everyone around the world. That has led the global firm to grow team in India and spend more time and ensure the products are useful for everyone.

Artificial intelligence in the home has been making big gains at CES over the last several years, according to the Consumer Technology Association (CTA) in a statement released Tuesday. CTA projects 2017 unit sales for voice-controlled, stand-alone digital assistant devices with a cloud-based operating system -- including Amazon's Echo and Google Home -- to reach 4.5 million units, a 52 percent increase, and reach $608 million in revenue, up 36 percent. And with home robots, companies at CES in 2017 will be looking to upstage intelligent home assistants like Google Home and Amazon Echo.   Kuri: This home robot from Mayfield Robotics is all about personality. An erstwhile Pixar animator was one of the lead designers of Kuri, according to Robotics Trends. The robot has “emotive eyes and a friendly disposition” and cruises around your home “smartly avoiding obstacles,” says Mayfield Robotics. Kuri's eyes are equipped with a camera that can capture photos and video, recognize faces, and monitor your home when you’re away. It will be priced at $699. Olly: This is a “tabletop bot” that that “recognizes different household members and adapts it personality to suit each one,” according to Jordan Edelson, CEO of Appetizer Mobile, in a statement about CES trends this year. More specifically, Olly's personality “evolves” depending on interaction patterns,” says Emotech Inc., the company behind the robot. Olly’s AI engine was created by a group a neuroscience and machine learning scientists. APPLE’S COMING ATTRACTIONS IN 2017: RADICAL NEW IPHONE, RESIZED IPAD? Intelligent Vision System: Industrial Technology Research Institute (ITRI), one of Taiwan's leading high-tech applied research institutions, announced it will show off an Intelligent Vision System for Companion Robots. "ITRI invites...attendees to booth 2015, Tech East, Westgate, to play chess and have coffee with a robot commanded by ITRI’s Intelligent Vision System."  Aristotle: Mattel’s Aristotle is an Amazon Echo assistant that is programmed to understand your kid, since a child’s speech patterns are different than an adult’s. Aristotle “is built to live in a child’s room—and answer a child's questions—rather than rule the entire home,” according to FastCompany.com’s Co.Design. It is expected to be priced at $300. THE BEST LAPTOPS OF 2016 CES 2017 proves intelligent, voice-controlled digital assistants are here to stay. “We've had more progress in voice-activated digital assistants in the last 30 months than in the first 30 years,” Shawn DuBravac, CTA chief economist, said in a statement on Tuesday. “Word recognition accuracy has improved from nearly zero percent in the 1990s to 75 percent in 2013 to about 95 percent today - enabling these devices to enjoy immense consumer adoption.” TVs: TVs are a CES mainstay and companies like Samsung and LG will be showing off the latest in TV tech. Samsung: The tech giant will show off its QLED TV, based on Quantum Dot technology, which allows deeper blacks and better detail no matter how light or dark the scene is or whether you’re viewing it in a brightly lit or dark room, Samsung said. The new TVs can also reproduce 100 percent color volume. “For example, a leaf can be perceived as different colors from yellowish green to turquoise, depending on brightness of the light,” Samsung said. LG: LG is rolling out its newest Super UHD TVs, the SJ9500, SJ8500 and SJ8000 featuring Nano Cell LCD technology, which creates “more subtle, accurate colors that can be viewed from wider angles than other TVs.” THE 5 BEST SMARTPHONES OF 2016 Computers: Lenovo: The computer maker has announced its X1 Carbon, X1 Yoga, X1 Tablet. With its popular X1 Carbon, Lenovo has shrunk a 14-inch display into a 13-inch chassis, among other, more subtle improvements to all three portables. HP: HP is bringing out a new lineup that includes the EliteBook x360 for business, a redesigned 15.6-inch Spectre x360, and a HP ENVY Curved All-in-One, the AIO 34, with a massive 34-inch display. Dell: Dell has updated its popular XPS 13 with a 2-in-1 design, the first XPS 13 with a 360-degree hinge. Like the previous XPS 13 laptops, it sports a very-high-resolution QHD+ InfinityEdge touch display and fits a 13-inch laptop into a 12-inch chassis.   Advertisement Trending in Tech 1 Chilean Navy admits it ‘can’t explain’ chilling footage of bizarre craft 2 Marines get groundbreaking, unstoppable new rifle magazine 3 YouTube removes influential conservative website's channel 4 Seven unexpected things Amazon's Alexa can do for you 5 5 questions to ask before buying a 2-in-1 computer See all Trends Scitech Connect Subscribe to the daily Geek Sheet for the top science and technology stories.

According to the lawsuit, the 30-year-old woman broke up with her boyfriend last year, the New York Post reported. After the end of their three-month relationship, the man uploaded a video onto the internet of the two engaged in sexual acts. The video was secretly recorded by the ex-boyfriend without her knowledge, the lawsuit states. Because the woman is of West African descent, she has a unique four-letter last name, thus search results of her name are limited to the raunchy video.  A New York woman is taking Internet giants Google, Yahoo! and Bing to court, demanding that they delete her name from their search engines because she was victimized by 'revenge porn' (stock image) Now the woman wants the search engines to delete all references to her name because any search of the name will yield results from X-rated pornographic sites with links to the video. Her lawyer says the 'revenge porn' has had an adverse impact on her career prospects while it has also done damage to her reputation.

Share this article Share 58 shares 'If you Google her name, everything is right there,' said Ryanne Konan, the plaintiff's attorney. 'She can't even get an internship.' Konan wants the court to force the search engines to delete any remnant of her online, an unprecedented request. Because there are no laws in the state of New York against non-consensual sex videos, police did not arrest the ex-boyfriend when Konan's client filed a complaint. A legal expert interview by the Post doubted whether the woman would win the lawsuit since her name is a matter of public record. The expert said that the Manhattan court will likely rule in favor of the search engines.  While asking Google and other search engines to delete one's identity is unprecedented, there is a mechanism in place for removing 'revenge porn.' Google's support section does offer users step-by-step instructions on taking down images and videos of an explicit sexual nature that were posted without consent. Yahoo! also offers similar instructions, which require aggrieved users to submit ID and URL information. Last year, Microsoft agreed to allow users to file requests to remove revenge porn on its various platforms, including Bing, Xbox Live, and OneDrive. Other internet and social media companies issued clarifications on their guidelines which regulate what is and what is not permitted on their sites. Instagram, the photo-sharing service owned by Facebook, said that it would not allow any nudity or pornography, though it would permit images of women breastfeeding, nude statues, and post-mastectomy. 'We know that there are times when people might want to share nude images that are artistic or creative in nature, but for a variety of reasons, we don't allow nudity on Instagram,' the company said. 'This includes photos, videos, and some digitally-created content that show sexual intercourse, genitals, and close-ups of fully-nude buttocks.'   Read more: Revenge porn victim to Google: Make me disappear | New York Post Remove "revenge porn" from Google - Search Help Get help if someone posts intimate content of you without your permission | Yahoo Help - SLN26123 'Revenge porn': Putting victims back in control - Microsoft on the Issues Community Guidelines | Instagram Help Centre Share or comment on this article e-mail 58 shares Most watched News videos Gloria Williams waves extradition for kidnapping Kamiyah Mobley Kitesurfer unaware of great white shark swimming below Disgusting moment cyst puss eruption covers cell phone Enraged kick-boxer strikes husband's mistress NINE times 2017's luckiest man: Pedro Grendene Bartelle win's $3.5m Man takes his cat Weston Sledding in the snow Sheep attack shepherd after being frightened by a car in Germany She's falling for him?

Technology CES: Apple, Google Car Apps Get Pushback From Ford, Toyota Ford (that's a Ford Focus above) and Toyota aren't about to concede the auto app game to Apple and Google. (EPA/Newscom) REINHARDT KRAUSE 1/04/2017 Reprints Apple's (AAPL) CarPlay and Google's Android Auto are facing a push back from automakers led by Ford Motor Co. (F) and Toyota Motor (TM). Ford and Toyota on Wednesday said four medium-sized automakers — Mazda Motor, PSA Group, Fuji Heavy Industries and Suzuki Motor Corp. — have joined their SmartDeviceLink Consortium, which aims to develop an open-source software platform that app developers can use as an alternative to Apple's CarPlay and Google's Android Auto. Apple and Google have revved up efforts to integrate their smartphone technologies with auto communications systems. Apple's CarPlay technology is built around its iOS software. Alphabet (GOOGL)-owned Google unveiled an "autocentric" variant of Android N at its Google I/O developer's conference in May. General Motors (GM) and Harman (HAR) have announced plans to build Android-based infotainment systems for GM vehicles. IBD's TAKE: Apple stock has formed a cup pattern with a technical buy point of 118.79. Learn more on Apple at IBD Stock Checkup. Toyota plans to launch a new infotainment system that integrates SDL in 2018, Bloomberg reported. QNX Software Systems, a subsidiary of BlackBerry (BBRY), has also pushed into Web-connected infotainment and telematics systems, along with AT&T (T). Ford and Toyota announced the new consortium members at the CES consumer electronics show, which is going on all week in Las Vegas. Ford stock hit a five-month high, rising 4.6% to 13.17 in the stock market today, helped by solid December U.S. sales. Toyota stock rose 2.2%. Google and Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCAU), which have teamed on autonomous-driving technology, on Tuesday said they would expand their relationship to create an in-car infotainment system using Google's software. Chipmaker Intel (INTC) on Tuesday said it will buy a 15% stake in Here, a developer of digital mapping technology for self-driving cars, deepening its ties to German automakers as well as to auto tech firm Mobileye (MBLY). Here's owners include BMW, Daimler (DDAIF) and Volkswagen's (VLKAY) Audi. Autonomous vehicles and next-generation auto technology again are again taking the spotlight at CES along with the Internet of Things — web-connected consumer and industrial devices. On Wednesday, Mobileye, Intel and BMW announced that they will roll out autonomous vehicles for testing in the second half of 2017 as part of their plan to sell self-driving cars to consumers in a few years.

The move comes amid high-profile hacks of Yahoo, Target, and other massive American firms in recent years. From Mashable: India’s outspoken IT, Law and Justice Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad today requested Sundar Pichai to make Google more involved with India’s cyber security efforts. “In a larger push, I want Google to be involved in a more meaningful way. The more digital we go, the more challenges there will be in terms of cybersecurity,” Shankar said onstage at an event where Pichai announced Digital Unlocked initiative for India’s small and medium sized businesses. “Google is as much an Indian company as American. The sheer number of people in India who have accepted you means you have an obligation for India as much as you have for the United States,” Prasad continued. The feeling is reciprocal. Google recently unveiled plans to bring free internet access to over a billion users worldwide, with hundreds of millions of those residing in India. It’s already partnered with Indian rail companies to provide access via certain train stations, with many more on the way. Alphabet Inc shares were unchanged in premarket trading Wednesday. Over the past year, GOOGL has gained 3.86%, versus a 13.12% rise in the benchmark S&P 500 index during the same period. GOOGL currently has an StockNews.com POWR Rating of A (Strong Buy), and is ranked #1 of 44 stocks in the Internet category. This article is brought to you courtesy of StockNews.com.

The Latest New Products Must-See Join CNET Member Benefits Sign In to CNET My Profile Forums Sign Out Australia China France Germany Japan Korea United Kingdom US Editions English Español Here's everything Google Home's doing at CES 2017 The Google Home gets in the game. After a slow start, Google Assistant made some noise at CES. Tyler Lizenby/CNET Smart Home by Andrew Gebhart January 9, 2017 5:00 AM PST @GebAndrew Up Next Amazon could start dropping off packages inside your home Google Home has some catching up to do. It's been chasing its rival, the Amazon Echo, since Google's always-listening smart speaker launched in November. Since the Echo's been around for a couple of years, it makes sense Amazon's connected assistant Alexa works with more products and has more features. I was hoping Google would use this CES -- the first since its release -- to gain some ground. That didn't happen. Alexa announced lots of new friends and Google Home was relatively quiet. Here's everything Google announced. Note that we're counting everything announced for the Google Assistant -- the digital helper built into the Home. A Home can't do everything that a Google Pixel with the Assistant can, for instance. But integration with Google Assistant should mean a product will work with Home soon. We've been waiting for a Belkin WeMo Switch that also dims the lights. CES brought the answer -- the Belkin WeMo Dimmer Switch. Handily, you can also control the switch with voice commands via a Google Home. Belkin also announced a petite new smart plug at CES. You'll be able to fit two Belkin WeMo Minis in a standard wall outlet. You'll be able to control the switches with a Google Home. Google Home will be able to control your car -- if you have a Hyundai that is. Say the word and you can send directions to your car's navigation system, and even start the engine. Don't worry, Google will ask you for a PIN before complying with the latter order. Google Assistant will also be integrated into the upcoming Chrysler 300, though details are scarce about what exactly you'll be able to do with the Assistant. Later in 2017, you'll be able to purify the air with a Google Home using the Coway Airmega. For easily installed smart lights, look to the sleek new Switchmate Bright. Snap it on to your ordinary light switch, and you'll be able to command your bulbs with your voice using a Google Home. Switchmate also has a new smart plug at CES called the Switchmate Power. The Power will also work with the Google Home when it comes out in February. Use your voice to watch TV with the Nvidia Shield TV. Nvidia built the Google Assistant into its $200 streamer (which roughly converts to £161 or AU$272). The Nvidia Spot works with Nvidia Shield. You can move the Google Assistant built into the round Spot from room to room and attach it to your wall. Thanks to VoiceGenie from Sensory, you'll soon be able to put the Google Assistant right into your ear. Say "Hey Google," to your Bluetooth headphones, and you can issue your command without touching your phone. We also kept score -- tracking the announcements of all three major voice control platforms. Though Alexa clearly had the most new integrations over Siri and the Google Assistant, Google took a quality over quantity approach, with a large percentage of its announcements qualifying as "actually smart" integrations on our board. Still, Alexa ended up with more in all of our categories. Google Home now has even more catching up to do. 57 Check out all the smart home products at CES 2017 (so far) Share your voice 0 comments Tags CES 2017 CES 2017 Tech West Smart Home Alexa Google Siri 8 Features 8 Usability 8 Design 7 Performance CNET Review Google Home Google Home is taking on Amazon's Alexa in the battle to control your whole home.

You don’t have an infinite amount of time or money on your hands to throw away on marketing tactics that don’t have a strong return on investment. I’ve pulled together a list of the top three digital marketing tactics to retire in 2017 and what you should replace them with to save your dealership time and money. National Pay Per Click (PPC) Advertising. If you’re advertising on search engines using PPC ads, you’ve started down the right track. However, if you’re advertising at the national level instead of targeting your ads to your local geographic area, you could be throwing money down the drain. Every time someone clicks on your PPC ads on Google or other search engines, you get charged for their click. In an ideal situation, that shopper would go on to buy a motorcycle or ATV from you, and you would earn far more money from them than you paid when they clicked on your ad. Now, let’s say you use PPC to advertise nationally and your dealership is located in Montana. If a shopper in Florida clicks on your ad, chances are they’re not going to be buying a major unit from you, because there isn’t a convenient way for them to pick it up. That means you paid Google for their click, but you made no money from them. That’s money down the drain. Instead of casting a wide net and advertising across the entire country, focus on advertising only in your local area. Google AdWords allows you to target specific geographic areas, and for most dealers, focusing on a radius of 50 miles or so from your dealership can help you reach only shoppers who are actually close enough to buy from you. Organic Social Media. The landscape of social media is changing, especially on major platforms like Facebook. Facebook is increasingly becoming a pay-to-play platform for businesses, and if you’re still relying on the unpaid content you post on your Facebook page, you may be wasting your time. The organic reach (the number of people who see a post naturally in their timeline) of the average business page’s Facebook posts is less than 6%. That means less than 6% of your Facebook fans are seeing any given post you create on the platform. There are two things you can do to make a wiser investment in social media. First, limit the amount of time you spend managing your social media profiles. Take advantage of free social media management tools like HootSuite to schedule your posts ahead of time instead of going in and manually posting content regularly, and don’t be afraid to share content from other pages. Sharing a post about the latest and greatest snowmobile from one of your OEMs saves you the time of having to craft original content. Second, invest in social media advertising. Facebook Ads is very budget-friendly and can help you reach a wider audience than the few Facebook fans who might see your organic posts. Like PPC advertising, Facebook allows you to target your ads to your local geographic area, but it takes things a step further. You can use Facebook’s huge database of demographic information to target the shoppers who are most likely to buy from you – like Facebook users who have indicated an interest in powersports equipment or who fall within a certain income bracket. Black Hat SEO. Resorting to black hat SEO tactics can actually harm where your website lands on the search results page. Google is smart enough know when you’ve created a page with little or no content to try to boost your SEO or if you’re loading pages with irrelevant keywords, and it could take action against your site if you’re using these tactics (you can find Google’s full list of techniques to avoid here). Definitely not a good use of your time or the money you spend on your website! Instead of resorting to these black hat methods to try to boost your rank on the search results page, optimize your online presence for local search to help your chances of getting found. Set up a Google My Business profile, work on generating customer reviews and focus on providing a great customer experience online and in-store. You can learn more about the importance of local search in one of my previous PSB posts.

We spoke with Pete Jameson, ODG's operating chief. By Larry Dignan for Between the Lines | January 3, 2017 -- 22:00 GMT (14:00 PST) | Topic: CES 2017: The Big Trends for Business Osterhout Design Group recently raised $58 million with a plan to expand its smart glasses and augmented reality footprint from government and enterprise customers to consumers. At the Consumer Electronics Show, ODG made good on its expansion plans as it unveiled its R-8 and R-9 smart glasses. Special Feature Wearables: Fit For Business? Read More At CES 2017, ODG highlighted how its new smart glasses are designed to complement existing devices, provide augmented reality experiences and 3D interfaces for gaming. Specifically, ODG introduced the R-8 and R-9, two smart glass devices designed to bridge work and consumer applications. The R-8 will access familiar phone apps on a private screen that floats in your view. There are also augmented reality and virtual reality uses. ODG's bet is that headworn devices will replace other screens, but for now smart glasses will be worn and removed frequently. The R-9 has a 50 degree field of view and a 1080p platform. The R-9 is designed for prosumer and light enterprise uses. ODG's headsets are aimed at bringing entertainment and work uses. The ODG smart glasses land as Lenovo entered the fray earlier on Tuesday. Also: CNET CES 2017 coverage | The 4 tech trends that will shape 2017, predicted by ZDNet editors What's unclear is how fast the consumer smart glasses market will take off. ODG's smart glasses historically have revolved around a full computing platform in eyewear. While Google Glass popularized the notion of smart glasses for the enterprise--ODG and Vuzix could send Google a thank you note--computing specs faced some backlash for the masses. Enter ODG. We caught up with Pete Jameson, chief operating officer of ODG, to talk about how smart glasses and augmented reality is working for businesses. While the consumer move is notable there's real work being done. Here's a recap of our chat with Jameson and what you need to know about ODG, which will raise its profile at CES, but has had plenty of traction on its own. Previously: Osterhout Design Group raises $58 million to boost its smartglasses lineup The ODG history. Ralph Osterhout, CEO of ODG, incorporated his namesake company in 1999 almost as a think tank as he focused on other areas. By the late 2000s, ODG was focused on government and "man packable computers," explained Jameson. ODG worked on smartphones with fingerprints and biometrics and multicore portable servers that could be used by the military in the field. "Headworn displays became a big focus for us in 2010. We wanted manpackable computers in glasses form. A lot of it is classified, but you could capture face comparisons with watch lists and relevant information that would be pulled from a server," said Jameson. That government focus bridged to the enterprise nicely and business accelerated courtesy of Google Glass. Enterprise interest. Jameson said that ODG started garnering enterprise interest after its government success. "The enterprise was a natural way to broaden our footprint," he said. "We got into the enterprise to understand where the opportunity was with B2B. There were applications in healthcare, transportation and logistics. All of those use cases were going on early with our government customers," said Jameson. The enterprise use cases began to become more visible to ODG in 2013. ODG's R6 smart glasses were the first entry into the industrial market because it was designed for government use, but has broad applications from the armed forces to agencies. The R7 device, in the market for about a year, was the first product that pushed into the enterprise completely. The impact of Google Glass. Google Glass was a "boon to the industry," said Jameson. "Google Glass brought awareness and an introduction to use cases even if Google was aggressive with what it could actually do," said Jameson. "Google Glass was very helpful to us." Indeed, the largest Google Glass developer, Advanced Medical Applications, became ODG's largest partner when it saw the R7, which is built on an Android core. "Google educated the marketplace with awareness and use cases. Google also pulled developers into the market," said Jameson. Advanced Medical Applications still develops for Google Glass as well as ODG and Vuzix. special feature VR and AR: The Business Reality Virtual Reality and Augmented Reality are going to be useful for far more than just gaming. We explore the ways the technology will be used for training, marketing, product design, and much more. Read More Will consumers give smart glasses a shot? Jameson noted that the consumer market has a lot of potential, but is complex. The difference between the enterprise and consumer market is that smart glasses are a work tool that must be worn. "The consumer market is in the early days, but it will still be about what the product does and use cases. Google Glass was positioned as a connected camera display and you walked around with it," said Jameson. ODG could find a niche in the consumer space as a "heads up computer." In that respect, smart glasses could be used purposefully and gain adoption like tablets did, he added. "In the early days of the tablet it was used because it was easier and simpler to do tasks you'd do before. It's early days, but I see that as well for smart glasses," said Jameson. Industries for smart glasses. Jameson said healthcare is the "biggest market opportunity we see right now." Healthcare providers are using smart glasses to interact with patients, perform medical procedures and use telepresence. Transportation including large equipment, assembly and inspection is also a large vertical. Energy, oil and gas and logistics are other key areas. "Engineering and construction is also emerging. The ability to take a 3D CAD model, project those and interact is powerful," said Jameson. Education is another area with promise. Returns and leading uses. Jameson said there are roughly a handful of drivers for smart glass adoption for business and there are some overlaps. Here's the breakdown: Telepresence and remote expert. Multiple industries need the ability to have connection between a person doing a task and a remote expert. The ROI is clear, says Jameson. If something goes down, you don't need to put that expert on a plane. Training is also a big use case. Augmented reality. Overlays such as information, step-by-step instructions, video tutorial and inspections are key for augmented reality uses. Jameson said there is typically industries that combine augmented reality and telepresence. Heads up displays. In this use case, smart glasses replace monitors. This screen swap allows a doctor to look at a patient instead of a monitor. A driver can operate a vehicle and get new information. 3D visualization. Engineers are increasingly using AR and smart glasses to bring an object up, create a visual representation and then walk around it. Maturity of implementations. Jameson said that health care has the most implementation traction, but isn't the most mature market. Jameson said healthcare has the most consistent adoption, but is more about the pilots and first phase implementations (pilots) in real work environments. Healthcare does have some mature applications along with transportation, but most deployments are early. Enterprises are working smart glasses into the overall workflow, developing content and the connectivity on the backend. Jameson noted that there aren't many third phase use cases where smart glasses are involved with the day-to-day workflow and integrated into processes. Many enterprises are between the pilot and a second phase where smart glasses are clearly a useful tool.

Apple and Google are drooling over the ever-growing importance of technology in our cars, and if there ever were two companies who know a thing or two about mobile devices, then these are definitely it. Up until now, the two have limited themselves to things such as Apple CarPlay or Android Auto - mere ways of turning the vehicle's display into an extension of the smartphone, with all the computing done inside the handheld device. At this year's CES show, Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and Google are introducing a Uconnect system concept powered by Android, Google's open-source smartphone operating system. It may not be the first time the Android gets converted into a car infotainment OS, but this time it's done under Google's own personal supervision. Just like it does now with smartphone developers, Google would like to sell its OS to carmakers in the future. On the other hand, car brands would have to invest incredible sums of money and effort to catch up with Google, so working together would make sense for both parties. “This collaboration with Google has been an extremely beneficial opportunity for both companies to explore how in-vehicle infotainment and connectivity technology continues to evolve, and what it takes to meet consumers’ increasing desire for innovation of information with minimal distraction,” says Chris Barman, Head of Electrical Engineering, FCA. “With Android, we are able to maintain our unique and intuitive Uconnect user interface, all while integrating our easy-to-use systems with Android’s features and ecosystem of applications.” “Google is committed to building Android as a turn-key automotive platform that integrates deeply with the vehicle in a safe and seamless way,” said Patrick Brady, Director of Android Engineering, Google. “This collaboration with FCA brings together the industry standard for connected car systems with Android to create powerful infotainment systems designed for the digital age.” The pioneering software runs on an 8.4-inch Uconnect system inside a Chrysler 300 sedan and can be seen between January 5 and 8 at the CES, in Las Vegas.

Ford and Toyota said that Mazda Motor Corp, PSA Group, Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd and Suzuki Motor Corp joined their SmartDeviceLink Consortium. The non-profit group’s goal is to promote more choice in how smartphones get connected to in-vehicle technologies like dashboard displays and voice recognition, and in other programming, Ford and Toyota said in a joint statement on Wednesday. Toyota has resisted offering Apple’s CarPlay and Google’s Android Auto in its vehicles, citing concern that doing so would diminish safety and security. Ford offers them on all its 2017 model vehicles. But the No. 2 US automaker still wants an open-source software platform that all app developers can use as an alternative to those of Google and Apple. “Encouraging innovation is at the centre of Ford’s decision,’’ said Doug VanDagens, global director of Ford Connected Vehicles and Services. Suppliers Elektrobit Automotive GmbH, Luxoft Holding Inc, and Xevo Inc also joined the consortium, according to the statement. Honda Motor Co. had contemplated the move but wasn’t mentioned in Wednesday’s announcement. Carmakers, auto industry suppliers and technology companies such as cloud computing specialists are forming a range of partnerships to develop autonomous cars and vehicles that can communicate over the internet. On Wednesday, Peugeot-maker PSA, communications-equipment manufacturer Ericsson AB and French phone company Orange SA said they’ve agreed to try using 5G wireless technology to improve self-driving features and road safety. Updating internet access is crucial in helping autonomous cars gather and exchange information about street conditions and traffic. 2011 deal Toyota first agreed to collaborate with Ford on car telematics systems in 2011. The automakers worry that if CarPlay and Android Auto establish themselves as must-have options, the influence of Apple and Google over the industry will grow. Ford’s version of the SmartDeviceLink technology is already available on 5 million vehicles globally, and provides drivers with popular apps like Pandora, Spotify, iHeartRadio, and AccuWeather. By enlarging the consortium, the automakers hope to maintain control over how much access infotainment apps have to vehicle data, according to the statement. “We are excited to collaborate with many auto manufacturers who share our view,” said Shigeki Tomoyama, president of Toyota’s Connected Company.

(NYSE: FCAU) (“FCA”) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL)’s Google teams up following an announcement on January 02, 2016 that they will unveil a next-generation connected car system by integrating FCA’s Uconnect car display console with Google’s Android operating system. The prototype of the new combined Uconnect with Android system will be showcased inside a Chrysler 300 sedan during the CES 2017 technology trade show which is scheduled from January 05-08, 2017 at Las Vegas. Register with us now for your free membership and blog access at: http://www.activewallst.com/register/. Today, AWS is promoting its blog coverage on FCAU and GOOGL. Get all of our free blog coverage and more by clicking on the links below: http://www.activewallst.com/registration-3/?symbol=FCAU http://www.activewallst.com/registration-3/?symbol=GOOGL FCA is the seventh largest Automotive company based on its annual sales and designs, engineers, manufactures and sells vehicles under the Chrysler, Jeep, Dodge, Ram, and FIAT brands. Commenting on the new prototype, Chris Barman, Head of Electrical Engineering FCA said: “With Android, we are able to maintain our unique and intuitive Uconnect user interface, all while integrating our easy-to-use systems with Android’s features and ecosystem of applications.” Patrick Brady, Director of Android Engineering, Google added: “This collaboration with FCA brings together the industry standard for connected car systems with Android to create powerful infotainment systems designed for the digital age.” About the integrated Uconnect with Android system The prototype dashboard screen will use FCA’s 8.4-inch connected vehicle system Uconnect and will be integrated with the latest version of Google’s Android, 7.0 Nougat. The integrated system is built for connectivity and compatibility with several popular Android applications available on the various smartphones. The new system has been integrated with Google Assistant, Google Maps, and Android apps like Pandora, Spotify, NPR One, and Pocket Casts. Both companies are fine tuning the prototype so that it includes features like radio tuning and climate controls. FCA’s engineers and Google are working on the next version the Uconnect Android infotainment software so that it does not remain just a prototype but can be used in the cars manufactured by the FCA in future. Win &#8211; Win situation for both The collaboration is a win-win situation for both companies. On one hand, FCA will be able to offer one of the most advanced infotainment systems to its customers and on the other hand it will help Google expand its reach across other car manufacturers. Google also gets a one-up over rival Apple’s CarPlay. Since the Android system is an open source operating platform it can be easily customized, which makes it very attractive for auto manufacturers. This new prototype is seen as an upgraded and complex version of Google’s Android Auto which was launched in 2015. Android Auto allows Android smartphones to be operated in automobiles through the dashboard’s head unit. In May 2016, Google had demonstrated the system after it installed the Android Auto system in a Maserati Quattroporte, and used Nougat to power the entire console, including the speedometer and other gauges. The new system is not in any way linked with the existing FCA &#8211; Google partnership for self-driving minivans for Waymo. FCA and Google have an existing partnership with specially designed Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid minivans which are a part of Waymo’s self-driving car fleet. Incidentally, Waymo and Google are both subsidiaries of Alphabet Inc. Stock Performance At the closing bell on January 03, 2017, FCA’s stock closed the trading session at $9.55, rising 4.71% from its previous closing price of $9.12. A total volume of 8.81 million shares have exchanged hands. Fiat Chrysler’s stock price advanced 23.39% in the last month, 47.83% in the past three months, and 68.13% in the previous six months. The stock is trading at a PE ratio of 8.60 and currently has a market cap of $12.31 billion. At the closing bell, on Tuesday, January 03, 2017, Google parent company Alphabet’s (GOOGL) stock rose 1.96%, ending the trading session at $808.01.

Google representatives thrilled children at Goldthorpe Primary School when they called by demonstrate what can be done using virtual reality. Year four teacher Brad Hitchen said: “The day was aimed at children from key stages one and two, so those aged seven to 11, and their teachers. “Google brought in their cardboard virtual reality headsets...they’re incredible! The teachers were shown how to use them first and then we led sessions with the children. “The kids were so engaged, I mean we seriously had so many ‘wow’ moments throughout the day.” He continued: “I was really impressed with it too - all the teachers were. “We were genuinely excited and when the teachers are excited, you know the lesson is going to be good. “It was brilliant to be able to put headsets on and completely immerse yourself in something. “Google had images on these glasses, and, just like that you were in space, or underwater, or inside Buckingham Palace, or walking the Great Wall of China. It was incredible.” Mr Hitchen explained that each image had been chosen to fit with something that the children had been working on recently. He added: “Our project was ‘ocean commotion’ so we were looking at underwater images and the kids were blown away with it all. “Once they put the headset on, I was able to control what they were looking at, and indicate things and point things out for them to notice. “They were able to look up, down, and side-to-side. “It was a real 360 experience.” The Google expedition day was a great success with all those who experienced it and is expected to be repeated in the future.

More About: The Changing Automotive Landscape Advertisement Ford Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. have formed a consortium with four medium-size automakers to speed development of auto-industry standards for in-vehicle apps, a step toward preventing Apple Inc. and Google from controlling how drivers connect smartphones to their cars and trucks. Ford (IW 500/4) and Toyota (IW 1000/6) said that Mazda Motor Corp., PSA Group, Fuji Heavy Industries Ltd. and Suzuki Motor Corp. joined their SmartDeviceLink Consortium. The non-profit group’s goal is to promote more choice in how smartphones get connected to in-vehicle technologies like dashboard displays and voice recognition, and in other programming, Ford and Toyota said in a joint statement Wednesday. Toyota has resisted offering Apple’s CarPlay and Google’s Android Auto in its vehicles, citing concern that doing so would diminish safety and security. Ford offers them on all its 2017 model vehicles. But the No. 2 U.S. automaker still wants an open-source software platform that all app developers can use as an alternative to those of Google and Apple. Popular Now Top 10 Manufacturing Countries in 2020 Ball Corporation: Finding Innovation Everywhere What Comes After a Gemba Walk? “Encouraging innovation is at the center of Ford’s decision,’’ said Doug VanDagens, global director of Ford Connected Vehicles and Services. Suppliers Elektrobit Automotive GmbH, Luxoft Holding Inc., and Xevo Inc. also joined the consortium, according to the statement. Honda Motor Co. had contemplated the move but wasn’t mentioned in Wednesday’s announcement. Carmakers, auto industry suppliers and technology companies such as cloud computing specialists are forming a range of partnerships to develop autonomous cars and vehicles that can communicate over the Internet. On Wednesday, Peugeot-maker PSA, communications-equipment manufacturer Ericsson AB and French phone company Orange SA said they’ve agreed to try using 5G wireless technology to improve self-driving features and road safety. Updating Internet access is crucial in helping autonomous cars gather and exchange information about street conditions and traffic. 2011 Telematics Deal Toyota first agreed to collaborate with Ford on car telematics systems in 2011. The automakers worry that if CarPlay and Android Auto establish themselves as must-have options, the influence of Apple and Google over the industry will grow. Ford’s version of the SmartDeviceLink technology is already available on 5 million vehicles globally, and provides drivers with popular apps like Pandora, Spotify, iHeartRadio, and AccuWeather. By enlarging the consortium, the automakers hope to maintain control over how much access infotainment apps have to vehicle data, according to the statement. “We are excited to collaborate with many auto manufacturers who share our view,’’ said Shigeki Tomoyama, president of Toyota’s Connected Company.

Google has designed this coffee-can shaped digital assistant so that it can only be addressed with the words “OK, Google” or “Hey, Google.” Me: “Hey, Google. How do you spell omnipotent?” It (she?): “Omnipotent is spelled o-m-n-i-p-o-t-e-n-t” Me: “Hey, Google. When is the Warriors’ next game?” It: “The Golden State Warriors will be playing the Toronto Rappers Wednesday at 7:30 p.m.” “Hey, Google. Hay is for horses.” Ha. Just kidding. That’s how my mom used to remind us that it’s not polite to say “hey.” I might add that mom knew how to spell omnipotent and, on balance, seemed to get along fine without guidance from inanimate objects – although she was prone to criticizing them, as in: “That darn toaster is taking too long!” Google Home competes with Amazon’s Echo, which for nearly two years has been the hottest thing on the planet. It answers to “Alexa.” “Hey, Google. Do you know someone named Alexa?” “Sorry, I don’t know how to help with that, but I’m still learning.” “Hey, Google. Do you know Siri?” “She has a nice name.” Since I’m writing this on my iPad, I thought I’d ask Siri, “What do you know about Google Home?” Siri: “I found this on the Internet: ‘Home,’ a 2015 film. An alien on the run makes friends with a girl.” Seems these devices are still easily confused. Yet, for some people the lonely days of waiting to hear, “You’ve got mail,” have been replaced by the semblance of conversation with an entity that knows how many miles it is to the nearest pizza place, can convert dollars to Yen, and has a Silicon Valley sense of humor. “Hey, Google. Tell me a joke.” “Who designed King Arthur’s Round Table? Sir Cumference.” Back in the eighties our family had a Chrysler station wagon with limited vocabulary and laughably halting pronunciation. We’d jump in and the car would declare: “A...door...is...a...jar.” That made us laugh, and it prompted my sister to quip, “I always thought a door was a fork.” Nowadays I can barely make it out of the driveway without audio cues from GPS. My alarm clock volunteers the temperature, and the moving sidewalk warns when it’s coming to an end. What’s next? Bob, the talking toothbrush (“Don’t forget to scrub your tongue”). Hank, the grouchy lawnmower (“Gotta do something about that crabgrass”). Marge, the nagging refrigerator (“Save some of that apple pie for tomorrow, big guy”). I think Google might have erred by not giving its gadget a name. Product reinforcement is one thing, but it becomes a real pain after you’ve said “Hey, Google” or “OK, Google” several dozen times. We humans assign anthropomorphisms to many things in our lives––from pets to potted plants. Heck, the first thing Tom Hanks did when he was stuck on an island was name his soccer ball Wilson. As for conversing with inanimate objects, we’ve come a long way. In 1949, when my dad, Allen Funt, hid a speaker in a mailbox in Manhattan so it could “talk” to passersby, folks were aghast. Even after settling in to conversation, not a single person asked the mailbox for the high temperature in Philadelphia, or to play a tune by Perry Como. Nowadays young people think nothing of chatting with the machines in their lives. I suspect, however, that many of them wouldn’t know what to make of a mailbox.

ClickZ ClickZ Intelligence ClickZ Learn ClickZ Live header-ad-slot January 16, 2017 Search Engine Watch Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports Toggle navigation Home Industry SEO PPC Analytics Social Local Mobile Video Content Development Reports How a new AI powered search engine is changing how neuroscientists do research More News SEO 04 Jan 17 | Adam Stetzer Facebook0 Linkedin249 Google+27 Twitter 276 When you think of artificial intelligence, images of futuristic robots or memories of bad sci-fi films might come to mind. However, the reality of AI is actually a lot more tame: a friendly search engine, for instance. But while we type our queries into Google and usually get fairly useful results, the same has not always been true for the information gleaned by scientific researchers. Although existing resources like Google Scholar and PubMed provide scientists with resources much faster than the methods of old, they don’t always cover the nitty-gritty details that are needed. Now, a new, free search engine called Semantic Scholar is using AI technology to help these scientists find relevant information much more quickly. Semantic Scholar has been labeled a game-changer for these professionals, who previously had no way of effectively combing through mountains of dense research. While Google Scholar has a huge database – it has indexed more than 200 million articles to date – it’s lacking in terms of providing access to metadata. It can help scientists find studies, but it won’t tell them how often a paper or author has been cited. Essentially, it can make a scientist’s job even more difficult because the research tool they’re using isn’t comprehensive. But Semantic Scholar is different. Developed by Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen in conjunction with his non-profit organization, the Allen Institute for Artificial Intelligence, Semantic Scholar first launched last November. Known as AI2, the non-profit built the engine in collaboration with Allen’s other research organization, the Allen Institute for Brain Science. Originally launched as a research tool for computer science, Semantic Scholar’s real appeal is its AI-based design. Instead of simply listing a study’s abstract and bibliographic data, this new search engine is actually able to think and analyze a study’s worth. GeekWire notes that, “Semantic Scholar uses data mining, natural language processing, and computer vision to identify and present key elements from research papers.” The engine is able to understand when a paper is referencing its own study or results from another source. Semantic Scholar can then identify important details, pull figures, and compare one study to thousands of other articles within one field. So why is Semantic Scholar a better option? “Medical breakthroughs should not be hindered by the cumbersome process of searching the scientific literature,” Allen stated in a press release. “My vision for Semantic Scholar is to give researchers more powerful tools to comb through millions to academic papers online, to help them keep up with the explosive growth of science.” As it stands now, scientists can use other search engine databases as a jumping-off point, but what they find often requires additional research. The results don’t give the full picture of a study, its variables, or the overall impact. The CEO of AI2, Oren Etzioni, notes that the current options can result in too much information with no real ranking method. “If you’re dealing with information overload, you want these things to help you cut through the clutter, [and] slice and dice the results.” Because the search engine uses natural language, it’s able to think and make judgments about which studies are most relevant to a given search. TechCrunch notes that “it can make intelligent judgements on … which related or cited papers are most relevant, or what other work the current paper has helped lead to… Results are fast, relevant, and easily sorted or drilled down into. For a scientist who frequently consults such articles, this is a huge advance.” What does this mean for Google Scholar? AI2 doesn’t want to compete with Google; that would be a fool’s errand, says Etzioni. They just want to provide a better option. “Our goal is to raise the bar” by providing scientists with more effective options to conduct their research, he says. In fact, many scientists are planning to use both engines to conduct their research, in part because the current state of Semantic Scholar is somewhat limited in comparison to more established engines. In addition to computer science, Semantic Scholar now covers the neuroscience field and is able to search 10 million published papers. While that sounds impressive, it pales in comparison to Google Scholar’s current database.

The future of Semantic Scholar Despite its shortcomings, industry professionals see huge potential in Semantic Scholar. Not only is the engine free of charge, but due to its design, it’s more powerful and thorough than other available options. Developers have already expanded its territory to the biomedical and neuroscience fields, and they intend to keep growing. Etzioni says that the engine could eventually become a hypothesis engine, guiding scientists to look at the bigger picture or to view a problem from a different angle. In so doing, it could act like a department head who points out when a method was previously effective, or an area that has remained untested. It could help give scientists direction and result in better quality research. And even though the engine is still being developed, it’s already been quite successful. Since Semantic Scholar was first launched, 2.5 million people have used the service and have performed millions of searches. It may still have a long way to go as far as indexing, but the institute hopes to fully expand the engine’s biomedical research library by the end of 2017. By putting AI at the service of the scientific community, Semantic Scholar ensures that only the best and most relevant studies are used. This will, in turn, lead to higher quality and more advanced research — a concept that stands to benefit everyone.

Pichai, who is scheduled to visit his alma mater IIT Kharagpur tomorrow, said the company is working on products for India that can be expanded globally. "When we solve for a place like India, we solve for everyone around the world. That has led us to grow our team here and spend more time and ensure the products are useful for everyone," he said at a Google event here. He added that SMBs are a growth driver for the Indian economy. "It is important that they have the right tools and skills to digitise. We believe it is important for us to invest in training and equipping these individuals and small businesses to accelerate their journey of growth," he said. Over 8 million Indian SMBs are already using Googles platforms. A joint research study by Google-KPMG estimates that 68 per cent of the 51 million Indian SMBs are offline. It also states rising Internet penetration and greater uptake for digital by SMBs could help increase their contribution to Indias GDP by 10 percentage points, taking it up to 46-48 per cent by 2020. Profits of digitally engaged SMBs grow twice as fast (compared to their offline peers) and they are also able to grow their customer base significantly, it added. The report cited the lack of understanding of the benefits of digital technologies and technical skills as the essential reasons for being offline. To overcome these challenges, Google has launched Digital Unlocked -- a training programme to enable SMBs get online and start using Internet to grow their business. The training is being conducted with FICCI. Over the next three years, 5,000 workshops will be held across 40 Indian cities. The online training comprises a set of 90 self-paced video tutorials, curated specifically for India and will be available free of charge. The trainings are certified by Google, Indian School of Business and FICCI. Besides, it also launched Primer -- a free mobile app uniquely designed to teach digital marketing skills in an interactive way. Available for Android and Apple phones, Primer will also work offline and is currently available in English and Hindi with Tamil, Telugu and Marathi versions coming shortly. The US-based firm also previewed My Business Websites to help businesses to have a rich, mobile-optimised digital presence that will be launched later this year. "SMBs have always been key users of our platform right from the beginning," Google Vice-President India and South-East Asia Rajan Anandan said. IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad and MeitY Secretary Aruna Sundararajan were also present at the event.

What's the best smartphone camera? iPhone 7 Plus vs Google Pixel vs OnePlus 3T vs Galaxy S7 and many more By Jim Martin | 09 Jan 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments   Contents The aim of this test Photo and video comparisons April 2016 comparison As the old adage goes, the best camera is the one that’s with you. Since most people carry a phone with them just about everywhere, it’s no wonder we’re taking more photos on phones than cameras these days. But which phone has the best cameras? Which phone takes the best photos? Is it also the best for taking videos? What about selfies? Also see: Best phone for audio and music & Fastest phones of 2017 (If you're considering buying an older phone. we've also compared the best phone cameras of last year.) Here, we’re comparing the following phones: Apple iPhone 7 Plus Samsung Galaxy S7 Google Pixel Lenovo Moto Z OnePlus 3T LG G5 HTC 10 Evo Huawei P9 Sony Xperia XZ Xiaomi Mi5s If you don't want to look through the photos, you can jump straight to our verdict. Here are the Best Phone Deals when you're ready to buy one. Best phone camera 2017: The aim of this test First, we should explain that this is not the kind of scientific test where we put phones on tripods in ‘lab’ conditions. No. The aim here was simple: to use the phone cameras exactly as people do in the real world, and present the photos and video so you can see them all side by side. Some people will only be concerned by photo quality, others video. For some the selfie camera is the most important. Comparing cameras is a tricky business at the best of times, but we hope that the slideshows below help you to decide which you like best and offer the chance to see how they perform in real-world conditions. If your priority is video, it is well worth going for a phone with good stabilisation as this make a big difference to the footage. Don’t forget sound, either. You can listen to the quality of the microphones in each of the clips (links below). How we tested So we went out into the real world, took real photos of people and places, holding the phones in our hands. Content continues below We think this is the most useful way to test a phone’s camera, and we took all the photos in each location with a minute or two of each other in order to keep lighting conditions consistent. The only exception was the LG G5, which unfortunately arrived in the post an hour after we’d finished taking photos on the other phones. However, it had arrived in time to take the selfie and low light shots alongside all the other phones. For each phone, we made sure it was set to use the full sensor resolution. Some are set to this out of the box, while others default to a lower resolution so they shoot at 16:9. We also did this for the front cameras, and turned off any ‘beauty’ modes where we could. For video, we again set the cameras to the highest resolution – 4K – and where this wasn’t available, we used the next highest resolution, typically 1920x1080, at the highest available frame rate. We enabled video stabilisation, again, where available. Not all phones offer stabilisation at their highest resolution (or frame rate), especially those which use electronic rather than optical stabilisation. We took a few photos on each phone at each location, using the stock camera app, then chose the best to present here. If a phone has multiple rear cameras, we took a photo on both (for the outdoor photo) in order to show the difference between them. The LG G5, for example has normal and wide-angle lenses, while the iPhone 7 Plus has normal and telephoto lenses. We didn’t use special modes which are unique to only that phone, since it’s not possible to compare them with other phones, and that’s the whole point here: apples-to-apples comparisons. Best phone camera 2017: Photo and video comparisons Click on the images below to take you to the slideshows where you can see the photos St Pancras Cartwright Gardens Portrait - British Library Selfie Low light Videos These links take you to the clips we've uploaded on YouTube. Be sure to watch full screen, preferably on a 4K monitor (and make sure YouTube is streaming the 4K version by clicking on the cog icon at the bottom of the video). iPhone 7 Plus: 4K Samsung Galaxy S7: 4K Google Pixel: 4K Lenovo Moto Z: 4K HasselBlad True Zoom (Moto Mod): 1080p30 OnePlus 3T: 4K LG G5 (normal): 4K LG G5 (wide angle): 4K HTC 10 Evo: 4K Huawei P9: 1080p60 Sony Xperia XZ: 4K Xiaomi Mi5s: 4K Best phone camera 2017: Verdict Outdoor, landscape, portrait photos All cameras perform at their best outdoors when there’s plenty of light available. We took three photos in these conditions and quite a few of the 10 phones produced great results which many people would be very happy with. In our top three, however, are the Google Pixel, Sony Xperia XZ and OnePlus 3T. The Google Pixel stands out as the best, though, as it manages to consistently produce excellent images regardless of subject or complexity. Key to this is its improved HDR+ mode (which happens to be the default setting in the native camera app). It combines several RAW images to produce a JPG with high dynamic range, yet without any trace of blurring or ghosting caused by movement in the scene. Better still, you can take several HDR+ photos without any slowdown so, unlike the older Nexus phones where poor performance meant you wouldn’t want to use HDR+, on the new Pixels, you can. Low light In low light the Pixel again does an excellent job, preserving detail without lots of noise. So does the Galaxy S7, which captures low light scenes remarkably well for a phone. Worthy of mention here are the iPhone 7 Plus and HTC 10 Evo, which both also produce more than usable shots in dim or very low light conditions. Selfie Yet again, the Google Pixel delivers the goods. Unlike a lot of phones which serve up a doctored, soft-focus, skin-enhancing image by default, the Pixel’s 8Mp front camera produces crisp photos with lots of detail. Some people might prefer it didn’t, which is why other manufacturers such as Samsung and LG default to blemish-reducing Beauty modes. One feature we don’t like is the way the OnePlus 3T, HTC 10 Evo and LG G5 flip their photos so it’s like looking in a mirror. However, the latter two (and the iPhone 7 Plus) do all take great selfies. Video Video quality will be more important to some buyers than photos, but equally important will be the video modes and features on offer. Aside from the Huawei P9, all the phones here can record in 4K at 30 frames per second. But if you prefer to record high-frame-rate video, you’ll want at least 60fps at 1080. Plenty of phones here will oblige, but the Pixel goes one better and will shoot at 120fps. (The iPhone 7 Plus does too, but plays it back at 30fps to create slo-mo). Both phones shoot excellent video, with great colour and detail, and minimal noise and artifacts. Their stabilisation differs slightly:  the iPhone uses optical tech along with software, the Pixel uses software only. Both systems deliver excellent results whether shooting at 4K or 1080p. Final thoughts We’re comparing camera quality here, but there are other considerations. One is features. For example the LG G5 offers a wide-angle camera which makes is a good choice if you’re after an action-camera look to photos and videos without resorting to an add-on wide-angle lens. The iPhone 7 Plus has a ‘telephoto’ lens which means you don’t always have to crop your photos when you can’t get close enough to your subject. Dual lenses also give depth information which means you can take convincing portrait shots with blurry background – a neat feature. Don’t forget, too, that the iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 are water resistant so can take photos and videos in conditions where other phones wouldn’t survive, including underwater. The Pixel may not have any of these features, but remains one of the best phones for photography you can buy right now. If you don’t want an Android phone, you won’t be disappointed with the iPhone, but the Pixel just pips the Galaxy S7 (our previous winner for phone cameras) as the best Android phone for photography.

Android phone buying advice and best Android phone reviews.  Also see: Best Phone Deals We have removed the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 from our smartphone chart due to the ongoing battery issues which, in some cases, are catching on fire. It has been discontinued so if you have one, stop using it and return it for a refund. Android has the largest market share in the smartphone world, but whereas Apple’s share is divided between just a few iPhones with obvious differences between them there are hundreds of Android phones available to buy. And the choice gets even more confusing when you consider that each Android phone manufacturer has multiple Android phone product lines, each with its own features and benefits. Also see: Best smartphones 2017 UK In our best Android phones chart we focus primarily on flagship devices, with the exception of where a phone lower down the range stands out for its excellent value (see the OnePlus X and Moto G4), feature set or performance. The phones in this group are those most likely to be bought on a contract, however, and their initial cost will be largely irrelevant. If you are buying them SIM-free you should check out our best SIM-only deals, but if budget is a primary consideration for you, also see our round-up of the best budget phones.  Specs to look for in an Android phone When we talk about flagship smartphones, we really just mean the top model in a company’s phone line-up. You’d usually expect to pay between £500- and £600 for it SIM-free, or around £40- to £50 a month on a contract. But cheaper phones can have flagship specs - and especially when you consider some of the surprisingly affordable Chinese phones we review.  In 2017 a flagship Android phone specification will look something like this:  • Android 6.0 Marshmallow (Android Nougat will increasingly be available on new Android phones soon) • Slim, lightweight metal frame Content continues below • 5-5.5in Quad-HD IPS display with Gorilla Glass 4 • Qualcomm Snapdragon 820/821 quad-core processor or comparable octa-core chip • 4GB+ of RAM • 32GB of storage, plus microSD support • Fingerprint scanner • 12Mp-plus primary camera with dual-tone flash, optical image stabilisation, laser autofocus and large apertures, plus support for 4K video recording • 5Mp selfie camera • 4G LTE Cat.9 • Dual-band 802.11ac Wi-Fi • Bluetooth 4.2 • NFC, GPS, GLONASS, OTG • Circa-3000mAh battery with fast charging We’ve placed the Samsung Galaxy S7 edge at the top of our list because it is the fastest Android phone in our benchmarks, with the longest battery life, the best camera quality, and it has a load of extra features such as the dual-curved-edge screen, heart-rate scanner and new always-on display (also seen in the standard Galaxy S7 and LG G5). We love its premium metal-and-glass, waterproof build, and although there isn’t a huge amount new in this year’s model Samsung really didn’t need to make any huge improvements to retain its crown for best Android phone. Also see: Best kids' phones 2017. But that’s not to say the other phones in our list are not worth a second look, and especially now that we get closer to the point where it’s impossible for phone makers to differentiate their devices on traditional grounds such as performance (all are excellent). The LG G5, for example, has a cool new modular design that lets you bolt-on accessories to expand its functionality, and it’s one of few flagship phones to feature a removable battery. The Samsung Galaxy Note 5 has a large screen with stylus support for enhanced productivity, while the HTC 10 supports Hi-Res audio, and the Sony Xperia Z5 ties into PS4 Remote Play. For the ultimate in screen quality, the Premium variant of the Xperia Z5 has a crazy-high-resolution 4K screen. The Xiaomi Mi 5s is significantly cheaper than the competition here, but offers many of the same features. This is the International Edition, which ships with Google Play support and, as such, most users will quickly find themselves in its MIUI 8.0 UI. For a pure Android experience there can be no better than Google’s own Nexus 6P, Pixel and Pixel XL, and as Google devices they will always be first to receive new operating system updates.  (Also see: What's the fastest smartphone 2017 for comparison with more Android phones.) Of course, with all the best Android phones on a similar level of awesomeness, your choice may come down purely to how it looks - and that’s something we can’t help you with, other than to point out the build quality information not visible from the PR shots and offer our own opinion on how they look.

Samsung Galaxy S7 edge Rating: Reviewed on: 12 January 17 RRP: £639 inc VAT Compare: all Samsung Galaxy S7 edge deals The Galaxy S7 edge is no longer the semi-gimmick it was before. Although some of the main features are things from the Galaxy S5 – Micro-SD and waterproofing – Samsung has given fans what they want. It's now a refined, sophisticated and highly desirable piece of technology. The battery isn't removable but the phone lasts longer than before and has seriously powerful specs under the hood. It has almost everything you could want from a phone even though the IR blaster is gone. We're also very impressed with the new camera and unless the screen is too big for you (despite some software features to help out) we think it's worth getting the S7 edge for the extra £70 with its gorgeous looks and extra functionality. Right now, this is the best smartphone money can buy. Read our Samsung Galaxy S7 edge review. 2. Samsung Galaxy S7 Rating: Reviewed on: 12 January 17 RRP: £569 inc VAT Compare: all Samsung Galaxy S7 deals The Samsung Galaxy S6 was the best phone of 2015 and, although it’s still early days, the Galaxy S7 is a serious contender for best phone of 2016. Samsung has taken into account what its fans want, addressing the three main areas of concern: removable storage, waterproofing and battery life. It’s also upgraded the core hardware and photography gear, added an always-on display and some useful software. Right now the Galaxy S7 is simply unbeatable. Read our Samsung Galaxy S7 review. 3. LG G5 Rating: Reviewed on: 5 May 16 RRP: £529 inc VAT Compare: all LG G5 deals The LG G5 is one of the most radical phones to come along in a while and we’re glad the firm has shaken things up with the modular design. The G5 is innovative and interesting with unique features but it’s a shame the design and build feels unfinished in areas. It’s a top-notch device which can hold its own with the best phones in performance and cameras, but it’s LG’s modular design which is the real selling point here. There is bags of potential but the future of this is unclear so it’s hard to be definite right now. The G5 is one of the best phones around but for completely different reasons to the Galaxy S7. Read our LG G5 review. 4. OnePlus 3T Rating: Reviewed on: 4 January 17 RRP: From £399 Buy from OnePlus Compare: all OnePlus 3T deals The OnePlus 3T will be unfairly compared, for now at least, to the phone that came before it. So let’s ignore it. On its own, the OnePlus 3T is everything a modern smartphone should be; slim, fast, and responsive, with above average battery life and cameras that produce stunning images. And then there’s the price. OnePlus may not like being known for it, but £399 remains an absolutely amazing price point for the phone on offer. As long as you don’t want an iPhone, this Android handset stands side by side with the Samsung Galaxy S7 as the best example of a smartphone on the market today – once we’ve all got over that it came a little sooner than we had expected. Read our OnePlus 3T review. 5. Xiaomi Mi5s Rating: Reviewed on: 29 November 16 RRP: £282.75 inc. VAT Buy from GearBest Compare: all Xiaomi Mi5s deals We cannot recommend the Xiaomi Mi5s enough. This is the smartphone every 2016 flagship wanted to be, and it comes with a price tag half that of theirs. Fantastic build quality, fantastic performance, fantastic storage, battery and connectivity options - the Xiaomi Mi5s gets a big thumbs-up from us. Read our Xiaomi Mi5s review. 6. Google Pixel Rating: Reviewed on: 9 December 16 RRP: £599 inc VAT Compare: all Google Pixel deals The Pixel has plenty going for it: it’s small, well built, speedy and has excellent cameras. It also supports Google’s Daydream VR headset and runs the plain version of Android 7 – complete with Google Assistant - and will get timely updates. But it isn’t waterproof, doesn’t have a microSD slot or stereo speakers and we’d have preferred a quad-HD screen for VR use at this price. If those downsides don’t bother you, and the OnePlus 3T is too large, then the Pixel is a fine choice and a great Android phone. Read our Google Pixel review. 7. Google Nexus 6P Rating: Reviewed on: 28 April 16 RRP: From £449 inc VAT Compare: all Google Nexus 6P deals Originally, Nexus phones stood out for being excellent value at a price that was low, but not the lowest. They weren't an alternative to flagship phones, but they had the advantage of running stock Android and getting the next version more quickly. The 6P, though, is not only a flagship, but is arguably the best Android phone to buy at the moment. It won't suit everyone due to its size, nor those looking for a phone with dual-SIM slots or a removable battery. There's no support for wireless charging either. But the excellent screen, front-firing speakers, quick charging, great cameras, speedy performance and Android Marshmallow add up to make this a phone that's a pleasure to use. And yes, it's also cheaper than its rivals, so unless you think it's worth shelling out extra on the Note 5, Galaxy S6 Edge+ or iPhone 6S Plus, the Nexus 6P is the one to buy. Read our Google Nexus 6P review. 8. HTC 10 Rating: Reviewed on: 9 May 16 RRP: £569 inc. VAT Compare: all HTC 10 deals There's a lot to like with the new HTC 10 including a number of hardware upgrades across screen, camera and audio, plus a Nexus-like stock Android experience. However, we're not totally sold on the design and it's tough at the top these days. While the HTC 10 is a solidly good phone and a respectible upgrade for M9 owners, it doesn't blow the competition out of the water. The features which appeal the most are more niche than mass market. Read our HTC 10 review. 9. Xiaomi Mi Note 2 Rating: Reviewed on: 8 December 16 RRP: £472.99 Buy from GearBest Compare: all Xiaomi Mi Note 2 deals The Mi Note 2 was wrongly overshadowed at its launch. This is a gorgeous big-screen Android phone with very decent performance, a great camera and plenty of storage. We'd like to see a Quad-HD screen on Xiaomi's flagship phone, but this one should prove plenty sharp and clear. Google apps are not preinstalled, but there is a workaround if you are happy to do some tweaking. Read our Xiaomi Mi Note 2 review. 10. Huawei P9 Rating: Reviewed on: 27 April 16 RRP: £449 Compare: all Huawei P9 deals When comparing the P9 to other flagships, it’s important to remember the £449 price which makes it considerably cheaper than many of its rivals (but not the identically priced Nexus 6P that's also made by Huawei). Overall, we're impressed with the phone: it's well built, feels good and looks good. The cameras aren't the absolute best out there, it doesn't top the charts in game tests and the screen isn't Quad HD, but these minor quibbles are outweighed not only by the price but also because, unlike the Nexus, the P9 lets you stick in a microSD card to expand the storage. If you can afford it, the Galaxy S7 is a better phone overall, but this is a great choice if you can't. Read our Huawei P9 review. 11. Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Rating: Reviewed on: 15 October 15 RRP: £484.99 Buy from Samsung Compare: all Samsung Galaxy Note 5 deals So, what do we think of the Galaxy Note 5? We’re very fond of just about every aspect of the Galaxy Note 5, from its curved and sleek design to its vibrant display and high-resolution camera. It can handle almost anything you can throw at it thanks to its CPU, GPU and 4GB of RAM and we experienced no lag during our testing. The only bad point is that the Note 5 would sometimes falsely detect the S Pen detaching – and to point out such a minor fault says a lot about the quality of the handset. With this being said, we’re both surprised and sad that the Galaxy Note 5 won’t be heading to UK shores any time soon. Read our Samsung Galaxy Note 5 review. 12. Honor 8 Rating: Reviewed on: 5 September 16 RRP: £369.99 inc VAT Compare: all Honor 8 deals The Honor 8 is a fantastic smartphone, but the price has gone up from the Honor 7. In return for the additional expense you get a fantastic dual-camera, a sleek and stylish design, a faster fingerprint sensor and a beautiful display, which combined make the Honor 8 a worthy competitor to the OnePlus 3. Read our Honor 8 review. 13. Sony Xperia XZ Rating: Reviewed on: 31 October 16 RRP: £539 inc VAT Compare: all Sony Xperia XZ deals The Xperia XZ is an attractive phone in design if you can get on with the angular style and while it's cheaper than rivals such as the iPhone 7 and Google Pixel, you can get better value with some older phones like the Samsung Galaxy S7. While the hardware is decent, we can't help but mention the very similar Xperia Z5 will save you a lot of money. Read our Sony Xperia XZ review. 14. Google Pixel XL Rating: Reviewed on: 24 October 16 RRP: £719 (32GB) £819 (128GB) Compare: all Google Pixel XL deals While the Pixel XL is an attractive phone (if you can get used to the glass section) with decent combination of hardware and software, we can't help but feel a bit disappointed. It's very similar to the much cheaper Nexus 6P and OnePlus 3. You can get plenty of other Android phones for less which have extra features like waterproofing and expandable storage. Sorry Google, but things have gone a bit wrong here. Read our Google Pixel XL review. 15. Moto Z Play Rating: Reviewed on: 11 November 16 RRP: £379.99 inc VAT Compare: all Moto Z Play deals The Moto Mods accessories are the main reason to buy the Moto Z Play, but it's a decent mid-range phone regardless. For an affordable price Lenovo offers premium design, good specs and a well-rounded software experience. You only really need to splash out on the Moto Z for the Quad HD screen, Snapdragon 820 and OIS camera should you feel the need for those features (but also bear in mind the more expensive version has no headphone jack and a smaller battery). Read our Moto Z Play review. 16. Sony Xperia Z5 Rating: Reviewed on: 29 April 16 RRP: £549 inc VAT Compare: all Sony Xperia Z5 deals There's no doubt that the Xperia Z5 is a solid flagship smartphone from Sony and an improvement on the Z3+. We certainly like the new frosted glass rear cover and the addition of a fingerprint scanner in that slim power button. The camera isn't great compared to the best phone cameras out there though, and you can get a better phone for similar money. The price has dropped, and it's now a decent-value waterproof flagship with a Micro-SD card slot. However, you can't use it underwater, and there are newer rivals which are better value, take better photos and have better performance. Read our Sony Xperia Z5 review. 17. Motorola Moto G4 (2016) Rating: Reviewed on: 18 November 16 RRP: £169 Compare: all Motorola Moto G4 (2016) deals Although the new Moto G4 is more expensive than the third-generation, Motorola is offering a Full HD screen, better processor, more storage and memory. Not everyone will enjoy the jump to 5.5in or the lack of full waterproofing but this is still a brilliant phone for under £200. Just bear in mind that the 3rd-gen Moto G is now a great buy at £149 and the Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 offers similar specs for just £125 (albeit SIM-locked). Read our Motorola Moto G4 (2016) review. 18. Sony Xperia Z5 Compact Rating: Reviewed on: 22 October 15 RRP: £429 inc VAT Compare: all Sony Xperia Z5 Compact deals The Xperia Z5 Compact is the best small phone around, but then there's not much competition in this area anymore and there are a number of phones offering decent specs for a lot less. Those looking for Z5 design and specs in a smaller frame will be pleased but it's a shame about the chunky design with the sharp edges. The fingerprint scanner is a great addition and the Snapdragon 810 with almost stock Android provides slick performance. However, the camera isn't as good as Sony makes it out to be. Read our Sony Xperia Z5 Compact review. 19. Google Nexus 5X Rating: Reviewed on: 12 April 16 RRP: £299 inc VAT Compare: all Google Nexus 5X deals Those looking to upgrade from a Nexus 5 will be happy and sad in almost equal measure. The 5X is a fantastic phone overall, with excellent cameras, a good turn of speed and an excellent screen. But it's noticeably bigger than its predecessor despite the small increase in screen size, it has limited storage compared to the Nexus 6P and it lacks a couple of camera features due to the slower processor. The absence of wireless charging is another blow for some, but additions such as the fingerprint scanner will make it a great upgrade for others. Read our Google Nexus 5X review. 20. Sony Xperia X Compact Rating: Reviewed on: 6 October 16 RRP: £379 Buy from Carphone Warehouse Compare: all Sony Xperia X Compact deals The Sony Xperia X Compact is an odd little smartphone. On the one hand its build quality, lack of waterproofing and lack of a standout feature make it harder to recommend compared to the older Xperia Z5 Compact. However, if you want a sub-5in Android smartphone with excellent battery life it’s the best current option out there. For all its flaws, we also kept coming back to the phone largely due to its sheer portability. Just don’t buy the blue one. Read our Sony Xperia X Compact review.

What is OxygenOS? What is MIUI? What is EMUI? Best custom Android UIs 2017 | Custom UI vs Android What is TouchWiz? What is OxygenOS? What is MIUI? What is EMUI? We look at the key differences between standard Android and the custom UIs installed by the likes of Samsung, OnePlus, Xiaomi and Huawei. By Marie Brewis | 04 Jan 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments Android is today every bit as easy to use as iOS, and most users will be familiar with the standard interface no matter which version of the OS they use. But every so often you pick up a phone that looks and feels completely different, a phone to which the manufacturer has applied its own skin. Google, too, talks about presenting Android as it should be in its Nexus and Pixel devices, so what is the difference between all these UIs? In this article we look at some of the most common and notable departures from standard Android, and what you can expect as a user of that UI. The four big ones we cover here are TouchWiz, used by Samsung, Xiaomi’s MIUI, OnePlus’ OxygenOS and Huawei’s EMUI. These are just a handful of the custom Android UIs out there, but they will give you a taste of what to expect from a custom UI. Also see: Best Android phones and best Android tablets What is TouchWiz? By Chris Martin  If you have a Samsung Galaxy smartphone or tablet then the Android user interface, or skin, is called TouchWiz. A year ago we would have told you it was very different to stock Android, but Samsung has since taken steps to streamline its UI and make it less of a burden on resources.  Samsung has come under criticism over the year for TouchWiz being a little over complex and busy. Luckily it has seen sense and cleaned it up with a more minimalist look and feel, fewer preinstalled apps and improved overall performance.  That said, it's still packed with handy features - many of which are now finally part of stock Android - such as Multi-window, which lets you can run two supported apps side-by-side, and Themes. We also like the useful and customisable notification bar and the intuitive Settings menus. Some features, however, are hidden away in said menus like Smart Stay and various gestures.  It might not be our favourite, but it’s certainly no longer the case that we'd actively avoid TouchWiz. You might also like: How to disable TouchWiz and our Samsung Galaxy S7 review and Samsung Galaxy S7 edge review What is MIUI 8? By Marie Brewis MIUI 8 is the custom Android UI used by Xiaomi in all its devices, and is based on Android 6.0 Marshmallow. It’s quite the departure from standard Android, though, with no app tray, a re-ordered Settings menu, and Xiaomi’s own apps in place of Google ones - in fact, there’s no support for Google Play at all out the box. That isn’t a reason to avoid MIUI, provided you’re comfortable with using Xiaomi’s apps or with sideloading apps and installing Google services yourself. This is easily achieved by sideloading the Google Installer APK, but removing or replacing all the Chinese-language apps, notifications and even keyboard can take a little longer. MIUI 8 has a lot of great features to recommend though, and although we find the lack of an app tray odd it’s something that may appeal to switchers from iOS for its familiarity. Given how large phone screens are getting these days, one of our favourites is the One-handed mode, which can shrink the screen to 3.5-, 4- or 4.5in, and move it to the left or right side of the display to suit both left- and righthanded users. This goes hand in hand with the Quick Ball, which places onscreen a movable icon that gives you quick access to back, home, screenshot and other options. This UI is easily cutomisable by the user, with multiple Themes to choose from. You can also tweak the screen colours and contrast, change the font and text size, customise the ordering of the buttons below the screen, the colour and behaviour of the notifications LED and more. The drop-down notification bar has been redesigned in MIUI 8, with new quick access icons running along its top. Xiaomi has also introduced some new features such as double-tap to wake, Second Space (which creates a separate space on your phone), individual App Lock and support for Mi Wallet mobile payments. There are enhanced video-editing tools, and some new photo features that allow you to add doodles to stickers and quickly share snaps. We’re particularly interested in the new Dual Apps feature, which taps into the dual-SIM advantages of all Xiaomi phones by allowing you to run two instances of all apps. So, for example, you could run a version of WhatsApp for each phone number. You might also like: How to buy Xiaomi devices in the UK and our Xiaomi Mi Note 2 review and Xiaomi Mi5s review What is EMUI 5? By Lewis Painter Huawei- and Honor-branded devices feature a custom Android skin called Emotion UI, or EMUI for short. While some skins strive to be as close to stock Android as possible, Huawei’s option has been, historically, as far from stock as you can get - until now, anyway. The completely overhauled EMUI 5 looks to fix long-time complaints like the lack of an app tray, and an over-complicated interface. Huawei prides itself on the fact that you can reach 93 percent of all functions of an EMUI 5-enabled smartphone within three taps, a huge change when compared to the confusing EMUI 4. It’s much cleaner and crisper too, featuring a rather attractive blue-and-white colour combination throughout the OS and within Huawei’s own apps too. It also brings a miss-touch feature that doesn’t register accidental taps, but this is exclusive to the only curved screen Huawei smartphone, the Porche Design Mate 9. EMUI 5 also features many relatively untouched features found in Android N, including multi-window, quick app switching and Google Now on Tap. The most impressive feature of the software? Huawei claims that EMUI 5 can keep the performance of the smartphone up regardless of how often you use the phone. It does this by using an algorithm that learns how you use your phone to make sure there’s always enough resources to run the apps you use most often. This is done via a combination of smart CPU management, storage defragmentation, memory compression and GPU acceleration thanks to native Vulcan support. The company has gone as far as to say that it could even perform better than originally after a year of use, more than enough time for EMUI 5 to optimise the smartphone for you. EMUI 5 is currently available on the Huawei Mate 9 with support for the Huawei Mate 8, P9 and P9 Plus all receiving the update in early 2017. Beyond that, the Honor 8, along with other Honor-branded devices, should receive the update in Q2 2017. You might also like: Huawei Mate 9 review and our Honor 8 review What is OxygenOS? By Henry Burrell OnePlus handsets run a skin called OxygenOS. While its smartphones run closer to stock Android than most, the company’s version of the OS is clean, crisp and easy to use. Much remains the same; the app tray, notifications and menus are only slightly changed in appearance, but there is a unique text messaging app rather than Google’s standard.  The latest version (3.5) runs on the OnePlus 3T and is a modification of Android Marshmallow, though this will be updated to Nougat in December 2016. A swipe right from your home screen gets you to the handy Shelf where you can type a memo, see your recent contacts, apps and more. OxygenOS also gives you tweaked versions of the Gallery, Music, Weather and file manager apps, and you can resize and customise the appearance of all app icons on the home screens and app tray. Pair this with a dark or light theme to suit your mood and change the entire feel of the user interface. The overall effect is slightly warmer than the sparseness of fully stock Android.  A neat trick also is the App locker that lets you assign fingerprint entry into certain apps you want to keep private even if your phone screen is unlocked.

We round up the best smartphones including best Android phones and best iPhones - best phone reviews. Also see: Best new phones coming in 2017. Also see: Best Phone Deals When we review smartphones we take into account their build quality and design, ease of use, features, performance and value, although the latter isn’t always such a big deal when it comes to a phone you are most likely to buy on a contract. Generally speaking a flagship phone will cost between £500- and £600, or between £40- and £50 per month on a contract. If you are buying SIM-free then you should also check out our best SIM-only deals. Value becomes more important when you consider older-generation phones. For example, we still think the Samsung Galaxy S6 is better than many of the phones in this chart, especially when you consider that it’s now available under £400 SIM-free. However, we move all older-generation smartphones to our best mid-range phones chart, and you’ll now find the Galaxy S7 and S7 edge sitting at the top of this best phones chart. We also have a best budget phones round-up if you're looking to minimise costs. Also see: Best kids' phones 2017 Note that we have removed the Samsung Galaxy Note 7 from our chart due to Samsung's discontinuation of it following battery problems. Best phone 2017: Android vs iOS vs Windows There are multiple mobile phone operating systems, but really only two worth talking about: Android and iOS. Windows phones account for around 1 percent of all phones sold, so it makes more sense to go with Android or an iPhone. If you do have your heart set on Windows, also see our list of the best Windows phones 2017. (Similarly, for purely Android choices see Best Android phones.) The vast majority of phones available run the Android operating system, with Marshmallow the latest version. While Apple’s iOS platform has a much lower market share, developers always release their apps on iOS so it has one of the best app stores you'll find. For more, see Android vs iPhone. Also, for a more in-depth look at each OS see our Android Marshmallow review, iOS 10 review and Windows 10 Mobile review. If you have an Android phone or and iPhone and want to move to the other type of phone, it's fair easy move your contacts and other data from one to the other. See How to move from Android to iPhone and How to move from iPhone to Android. What you can't move is paid-for apps, so keep this in mind if you're considering a change of platform. Content continues below Best phone 2017: Why you should buy an unlocked phone An unlocked phone is one which is not tied to any particular mobile operator, such as Vodafone or EE. Buying unlocked usually means buying the phone outright without a SIM. The most important point is that an unlocked phone is almost always a better deal than buying a phone on contract. The only real exception to this are Apple's iPhones - because of their traditional popularity, operators do often subsidise the cost of buying an iPhone in order to lock you into a lucrative long-term deal. Generally speaking, however, if you can afford the upfront cost of the handset, you will pay less over the life of your phone by buying unlocked.  More importantly, you are not locked in. If you want a new handset at any time, you can buy one without having to up-purchase your way out of a contract, or commit to another two years.  SIM-free vs unlocked One thing to be sure of when purchasing an unlocked or 'SIM-free' phone is that not all SIM-free handsets are unlocked. The excellent Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 is a classic example of this. It is SIM-free, but if you want to use it for any network other than Vodafone you have to first use it for a month with a Voda SIM, and then pay £20 to get it unlocked. EE's own branded phones are similar. In both cases it may well still be better to buy network branded phones and go through the pain of getting them unlocked, than to buy on contract. But you should do your research before you take the plunge. We can help with that with our feature: 'How to unlock any phone'. The right SIM One other thing to consider is the size and shape of the SIM required for your phone. Make sure you get a nano-SIM if a nano-SIM is what your phone requires. If you get that wrong it is easily solvable - every network will gladly send over a different-sized SIM. SIM cards tend to come in all three sizes - you simply pop out the one you need. But that's assuming you are getting a new SIM, and if you're looking for a SIM-free phone or unlocked phone you probably already have one. You can buy adaptors that let you fit a Nano-SIM or Micro-SIM in a Micro-SIM or full-size SIM slot for a very small charge. More important is to make sure that if you want 4G you get a 4G-enabled phone and SIM. Best phone 2017: Smartphone material poll 20 best phones 2017 UK: Reviews Every single phone in our top 20 is here because we think it is an excellent device, with which few people will be disappointed. All are plenty fast for general tasks and gaming (see our benchmark results in What's the fastest phone?), have nice screens and decent photography capabilities. However, subtle differences mark them out in a fiercely competitive market. You can read the full, in-depth review of each of the 20 reviews below by clicking on the link. 1. Samsung Galaxy S7 edge Rating: Reviewed on: 12 January 17 RRP: £639 inc VAT Compare: all Samsung Galaxy S7 edge deals The Galaxy S7 edge is no longer the semi-gimmick it was before. Although some of the main features are things from the Galaxy S5 – Micro-SD and waterproofing – Samsung has given fans what they want. It's now a refined, sophisticated and highly desirable piece of technology. The battery isn't removable but the phone lasts longer than before and has seriously powerful specs under the hood. It has almost everything you could want from a phone even though the IR blaster is gone. We're also very impressed with the new camera and unless the screen is too big for you (despite some software features to help out) we think it's worth getting the S7 edge for the extra £70 with its gorgeous looks and extra functionality. Right now, this is the best smartphone money can buy. Read our Samsung Galaxy S7 edge review. 2. Samsung Galaxy S7 Rating: Reviewed on: 12 January 17 RRP: £569 inc VAT Compare: all Samsung Galaxy S7 deals The Samsung Galaxy S6 was the best phone of 2015 and, although it’s still early days, the Galaxy S7 is a serious contender for best phone of 2016. Samsung has taken into account what its fans want, addressing the three main areas of concern: removable storage, waterproofing and battery life. It’s also upgraded the core hardware and photography gear, added an always-on display and some useful software. Right now the Galaxy S7 is simply unbeatable. Read our Samsung Galaxy S7 review. 3. LG G5 Rating: Reviewed on: 5 May 16 RRP: £529 inc VAT Compare: all LG G5 deals The LG G5 is one of the most radical phones to come along in a while and we’re glad the firm has shaken things up with the modular design. The G5 is innovative and interesting with unique features but it’s a shame the design and build feels unfinished in areas. It’s a top-notch device which can hold its own with the best phones in performance and cameras, but it’s LG’s modular design which is the real selling point here. There is bags of potential but the future of this is unclear so it’s hard to be definite right now. The G5 is one of the best phones around but for completely different reasons to the Galaxy S7. Read our LG G5 review. 4. Apple iPhone 7 Rating: Reviewed on: 4 October 16 RRP: £599 (32GB), £699 (128GB), £799 (256GB)  The iPhone 7 is an evolution of the 6S, so if you were expecting a revolution you’ll probably be slightly disappointed. However, aside from the underwhelming battery life, it is an excellent phone. It’s waterproof, has fantastic cameras and performance, and the new stereo speakers sound great. There’s now 32GB of storage as a minimum, which helps to mitigate the higher prices. If you have an iPhone 6s, it’s hard to justify upgrading (even for some people with a 6) but if you’re out of contract and want a small phone, it’s the best Apple has made yet. Read our Apple iPhone 7 review. 5. OnePlus 3T Rating: Reviewed on: 4 January 17 RRP: From £399 Buy from OnePlus The OnePlus 3T will be unfairly compared, for now at least, to the phone that came before it. So let’s ignore it. On its own, the OnePlus 3T is everything a modern smartphone should be; slim, fast, and responsive, with above average battery life and cameras that produce stunning images. And then there’s the price. OnePlus may not like being known for it, but £399 remains an absolutely amazing price point for the phone on offer. As long as you don’t want an iPhone, this Android handset stands side by side with the Samsung Galaxy S7 as the best example of a smartphone on the market today – once we’ve all got over that it came a little sooner than we had expected. Read our OnePlus 3T review. 6. Xiaomi Mi5s Rating: Reviewed on: 29 November 16 RRP: £282.75 inc. VAT Buy from GearBest We cannot recommend the Xiaomi Mi5s enough. This is the smartphone every 2016 flagship wanted to be, and it comes with a price tag half that of theirs. Fantastic build quality, fantastic performance, fantastic storage, battery and connectivity options - the Xiaomi Mi5s gets a big thumbs-up from us. Read our Xiaomi Mi5s review. 7. Google Pixel Rating: Reviewed on: 9 December 16 RRP: £599 inc VAT The Pixel has plenty going for it: it’s small, well built, speedy and has excellent cameras. It also supports Google’s Daydream VR headset and runs the plain version of Android 7 – complete with Google Assistant - and will get timely updates. But it isn’t waterproof, doesn’t have a microSD slot or stereo speakers and we’d have preferred a quad-HD screen for VR use at this price. If those downsides don’t bother you, and the OnePlus 3T is too large, then the Pixel is a fine choice and a great Android phone. Read our Google Pixel review. 8. Apple iPhone 7 Plus Rating: Reviewed on: 19 October 16 RRP: £719 (32GB); £819 (128GB); £919 (256GB)   The iPhone 7 Plus is an excellent phone. It’s Apple’s best yet, but it is also Apple’s most expensive yet, with a huge starting price. In some respects, the upgrades seem to justify this, but at the same time some features are arguably only catching up with what the competition has been offering for a while now – water-resistance for one. Taken as a whole, the performance, battery life, camera quality and stereo speakers are all compelling reasons to upgrade. But our advice remains much the same as for the iPhone 7: if you already own the previous generation, there’s not enough here to justify ditching a 6S Plus, especially if you’re halfway through a two-year contract. Those just coming out of contract on the iPhone 6 or 6 Plus would do well to grab a 7 Plus.   Read our Apple iPhone 7 Plus review. 9. Google Nexus 6P Rating: Reviewed on: 28 April 16 RRP: From £449 inc VAT Originally, Nexus phones stood out for being excellent value at a price that was low, but not the lowest. They weren't an alternative to flagship phones, but they had the advantage of running stock Android and getting the next version more quickly. The 6P, though, is not only a flagship, but is arguably the best Android phone to buy at the moment. It won't suit everyone due to its size, nor those looking for a phone with dual-SIM slots or a removable battery. There's no support for wireless charging either. But the excellent screen, front-firing speakers, quick charging, great cameras, speedy performance and Android Marshmallow add up to make this a phone that's a pleasure to use. And yes, it's also cheaper than its rivals, so unless you think it's worth shelling out extra on the Note 5, Galaxy S6 Edge+ or iPhone 6S Plus, the Nexus 6P is the one to buy. Read our Google Nexus 6P review. 10. HTC 10 Rating: Reviewed on: 9 May 16 RRP: £569 inc. VAT There's a lot to like with the new HTC 10 including a number of hardware upgrades across screen, camera and audio, plus a Nexus-like stock Android experience. However, we're not totally sold on the design and it's tough at the top these days. While the HTC 10 is a solidly good phone and a respectible upgrade for M9 owners, it doesn't blow the competition out of the water. The features which appeal the most are more niche than mass market. Read our HTC 10 review. 11. Xiaomi Mi Note 2 Rating: Reviewed on: 8 December 16 RRP: £472.99 Buy from GearBest The Mi Note 2 was wrongly overshadowed at its launch. This is a gorgeous big-screen Android phone with very decent performance, a great camera and plenty of storage. We'd like to see a Quad-HD screen on Xiaomi's flagship phone, but this one should prove plenty sharp and clear. Google apps are not preinstalled, but there is a workaround if you are happy to do some tweaking. Read our Xiaomi Mi Note 2 review. 12. Huawei P9 Rating: Reviewed on: 27 April 16 RRP: £449 When comparing the P9 to other flagships, it’s important to remember the £449 price which makes it considerably cheaper than many of its rivals (but not the identically priced Nexus 6P that's also made by Huawei). Overall, we're impressed with the phone: it's well built, feels good and looks good. The cameras aren't the absolute best out there, it doesn't top the charts in game tests and the screen isn't Quad HD, but these minor quibbles are outweighed not only by the price but also because, unlike the Nexus, the P9 lets you stick in a microSD card to expand the storage. If you can afford it, the Galaxy S7 is a better phone overall, but this is a great choice if you can't. Read our Huawei P9 review. 13. iPhone 6s Plus Rating: Reviewed on: 9 September 16 RRP: From £619 inc VAT The iPhone 6S Plus is a remarkable phone, and it's still a fantastic phone 12 months on. The 16GB model has finally been banished and the new minimum storage of 32GB should be workable for a lot of people. 3D Touch can sound gimmicky, but it’s absolutely not. It requires effort to force yourself to use it to begin with, but it quickly becomes second nature and app developers have put it to use in apps and games. Read our iPhone 6s Plus review. 14. Samsung Galaxy Note 5 Rating: Reviewed on: 15 October 15 RRP: £484.99 Buy from Samsung So, what do we think of the Galaxy Note 5? We’re very fond of just about every aspect of the Galaxy Note 5, from its curved and sleek design to its vibrant display and high-resolution camera. It can handle almost anything you can throw at it thanks to its CPU, GPU and 4GB of RAM and we experienced no lag during our testing. The only bad point is that the Note 5 would sometimes falsely detect the S Pen detaching – and to point out such a minor fault says a lot about the quality of the handset. With this being said, we’re both surprised and sad that the Galaxy Note 5 won’t be heading to UK shores any time soon. Read our Samsung Galaxy Note 5 review. 15. iPhone 6S Rating: Reviewed on: 9 September 16 RRP: From £539 We're really impressed by the iPhone 6s. It's fast, has a great screen and a good main camera. It misses out on some of the 6s Plus's features, including optical stabilisation, but most people won't really notice. In short, the iPhone 6s is a great phone, and it's even better now it's cheaper and the base model has 32GB of storage. Read our iPhone 6S review. 16. Honor 8 Rating: Reviewed on: 5 September 16 RRP: £369.99 inc VAT The Honor 8 is a fantastic smartphone, but the price has gone up from the Honor 7. In return for the additional expense you get a fantastic dual-camera, a sleek and stylish design, a faster fingerprint sensor and a beautiful display, which combined make the Honor 8 a worthy competitor to the OnePlus 3. Read our Honor 8 review. 17. Google Pixel XL Rating: Reviewed on: 24 October 16 RRP: £719 (32GB) £819 (128GB) While the Pixel XL is an attractive phone (if you can get used to the glass section) with decent combination of hardware and software, we can't help but feel a bit disappointed. It's very similar to the much cheaper Nexus 6P and OnePlus 3. You can get plenty of other Android phones for less which have extra features like waterproofing and expandable storage. Sorry Google, but things have gone a bit wrong here. Read our Google Pixel XL review. 18. Sony Xperia XZ Rating: Reviewed on: 31 October 16 RRP: £539 inc VAT The Xperia XZ is an attractive phone in design if you can get on with the angular style and while it's cheaper than rivals such as the iPhone 7 and Google Pixel, you can get better value with some older phones like the Samsung Galaxy S7. While the hardware is decent, we can't help but mention the very similar Xperia Z5 will save you a lot of money. Read our Sony Xperia XZ review. 19. iPhone SE Rating: Reviewed on: 11 April 16 RRP: £379 inc VAT (16GB); £429 inc VAT (64GB) Buy from Apple The SE is what many iPhone fans have been asking for, and it's a great upgrade if you're still using an iPhone 5. For 5S owners, things aren't quite as clear cut. If you're not happy with the 5S's performance, the SE should solve that problem. However, unless you really want to shoot 4K videos, you're not going to notice a massive improvement in photo quality. There's a much bigger jump in quality if you're coming from an iPhone 5 (or earlier), however. Make sure 16GB is enough before you order: we'd recommend the 64GB version for most people. Read our iPhone SE review. 20. Motorola Moto G4 (2016) Rating: Reviewed on: 18 November 16 RRP: £169 Although the new Moto G4 is more expensive than the third-generation, Motorola is offering a Full HD screen, better processor, more storage and memory. Not everyone will enjoy the jump to 5.5in or the lack of full waterproofing but this is still a brilliant phone for under £200. Just bear in mind that the 3rd-gen Moto G is now a great buy at £149 and the Vodafone Smart Ultra 6 offers similar specs for just £125 (albeit SIM-locked). Read our Motorola Moto G4 (2016) review.

Steve Dent, @stevetdent 01.04.17 in Wearables Comments 525 Shares Share Tweet Share Save NextVR has expanded its NBA virtual reality coverage, now offering it on more than one headset and in countries other than the US. Along with the current Samsung Gear VR offering, you can now catch broadcasts on Google's Daydream platform. In addition, viewers in Canada, the UK, Germany and Australia will be able to catch on-demand games and highlights, though live broadcasts are limited to the US. US-based viewers will be able to watch NBA games on-demand, along with highlights and features, for free in the NextVR app. The offering is available on both Samsung's Gear VR and Google's Daydream View headset. Viewers in other regions can catch any on-demand games that follow NextVR's Spurs versus Raptors broadcast from January 3rd. You'll need to download the NextVR app and have compatible hardware to use it on either platform. From there you'll get an experience that's closer to sitting court side than it is watching the game on TV. In terms of how it feels, NextVR switches between eight RED cameras to give you the best view. Although, as a word of warning, this Engadget editor watched the Rio Olympics on a Gear VR headset, as shot by the IOC. The experience was great, but the view can get heavily pixelated, which is little surprise considering the bandwidth and headset resolution limitations. So don't expect to believe that you're really there... at least not yet. In all, NextVR's NBA broadcasts have received generally good reviews, though. If you already have an NBA League Pass and a Samsung or Google Pixel phone, we'd call it a no-brainer to get the Daydream View or Gear VR headset, since they're both less than $100. However, it'd be a stretch to sign up for the service just to get VR matches, given the quality limitations. In a year or two, however, VR sports might be good enough to become a fan destination on their own.

Like this story, share it with millions of investors on M3 Google is as much Indian as American: Ravi Shankar Prasad In an event where Google CEO Sundar Pichai was present, Telecom and IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said that India’s digital economy will cross USD 1 trillion in the next 3-4 years, aided by demonetisation. Post Your Comments Share Cancel Moneycontrol Bureau The world’s largest internet company Google is ‘as much Indian, as American’ said Minister of Telecom and IT Ravi Shankar Prasad at an event in the national capital stressing upon the acceptance that the country with over 350 million internet users has shown to the search giant. Unlike China, where Baidu is the dominant search giant, Google is dominant internet player in India through web search as well as its mobile platform Android. Prasad was addressing an event organised by Google where its global CEO Sundar Pichai announced new initiatives for the small and medium businesses (SMBs) in India. Referring specifically to India’s 33 million small and medium businesses, Google CEO Sundar Pichai said that the internet will be an engine of growth for India. “Today, anyone can become an entrepreneur, a developer, or a creator, but it is important that they have the right tools and skills to digitize.” Pichai launched ‘Digital Unlocked’, a training program that will help Indian SMBs to get online and ‘Primer’, a free mobile app to teach digital marketing skills. Prasad said that due to demonetisation India has witnessed massive growth in digital transactions which increased to over 30 million per day in 2016 compared to 20 million in 2015. “Digital economy will cross more than USD 1 trillion in 3-4 years. India missed the industrial revolution. We missed the entrepreneurial stage in the late 80-90s. But we will not miss this digital revolution happening in the world," Prasad added. He emphasised that ‘the agenda of Prime Minister Modi is to transform India through digitization’. In November, the Modi government came up with a demonetization drive and banned old currency notes of Rs 500 and Rs 1,000. Last week, the PM also launched a mobile app BHIM to enable easier digital payments and transactions through Unified Payments Interface (UPI). Prasad candidly shared that PM Modi let him go off an ongoing cabinet meeting to meet Pichai and address this event. Launched in 1998, Google is the world's most valuable internet company employing over 57,000 people. During his address, Pichai said, “The Internet is a powerful equaliser and we are motivated to bring the benefits of information and technology to as many people as possible.” Google also unveiled a joint research study with KPMG. The study iterates that 68% of the 51 million Indian SMBs are still offline. The study also found that profits of digitally engaged SMBs grew twice as fast compared to offline SMBs. Google also previewed My Business Websites, a tool that will help businesses to have a mobile optimised digital presence that will be launched later this year.

The program related for the SMBs in India will enable them to get online and start using the power of the internet to grow their business. It also previewed the 'My Business Websites', an easy-to-use offering to help businesses to have a rich, mobile optimized digital presence that will be launched later this year. Making the announcements at an event in New Delhi, Pichai highlighted the representatives from hundreds of small and medium business from across the country on the benefits of the web and digital technology. "The Internet is a powerful equalizer and we are motivated to bring the benefits of information and technology to as many people as possible. Building for everyone and making it available in the hands of as many people is at the heart and core of what we do. And we do this by investing in open ecosystems," said CEO-Google, Sundar Pichai. He said that anyone can today become an entrepreneur, a developer, or a creator, but it is important that they have the right tools and skills to digitize. "We believe it is important for us to invest in training and equipping these individuals and small businesses to accelerate their journey of growth," he added. Setting the context for the initiative Google unveiled a joint research study with KPMG titled "Impact of internet and digitization on SMBs in India". The study reiterates that 68 percent of the 51m Indian SMBs are offline. With Digital Unlocked, Google is committed to ensuring that every single small business in India that wants to go digital has access to quality training. In keeping with the varied learning needs of the millions of businesses in India, we've built this program across online, offline and mobile. The offline training is being conducted in partnership with FICCI and over the next three years, 5,000 workshops will be held across 40 Indian cities. Further, for India's mobile-first audience, Google also launched Primer, a free mobile app uniquely designed to teach digital marketing skills in a quick, easy and interactive way. The app will be available for download through the Google Play and iOS app store. Primer also works offline and is currently available in English and Hindi with Tamil, Telugu and Marathi versions coming shortly.

PHOTO: Binyamin Mellish Given the increasing reliance on digital systems to accomplish many everyday tasks, there’s no denying the performance — specifically, speed and reliability — of these systems is critical to ensuring end users will have a positive experience. At the forefront are industry giants like Google and Facebook, which are constantly pushing the limits of speed through innovative delivery techniques.  While consumers welcome endeavors like Google's Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP) Project and Facebook's Instant Articles, they also raise the bar for all internet companies. In this environment, companies that fail to meet users’ tough performance expectations will soon find themselves falling behind the competition — not just in terms of performance, but revenue as well. According to a recent Harris poll survey my company sponsored, 76 percent of respondents said they avoid shopping at poorly performing sites and apps after just one poor experience.  This negative reaction extends beyond just ecommerce: half of frequent online shoppers are also less likely to visit a retailer’s brick-and-mortar store if they have a negative experience shopping online. The Double-Edge Sword of 3rd Party Services To keep up with expectations, companies are relying on third-party services such as cloud providers, content delivery networks and tags (such as marketing analytics and social media plug-ins) to help them optimize their delivery and the user experience. However, these external services are a double-edged sword as they add to the complexity of digital systems. The result: when something outside of one’s direct control breaks, identifying and isolating the problem requires the ability to sift through the many layers of site architecture to get to the root cause. According to a recent survey from Enterprise Management Associates (EMA), an IT and data management research and consulting firm, 77 percent of IT professionals cite lack of insight into the performance of the cloud and other third-party services as a major obstacle to identifying and troubleshooting root causes of problems As digital architecture gets more complex, that inability to assess exactly what is happening in those third-party services and systems will only get worse. The Right Digital Experience Monitoring Strategy So where does all this leave you? You don’t want to avoid using third-party services, because they can provide a valuable advantage as you scale your business to reach new consumers, as well as add features to your website. What then is the key to delivering the best possible online customer experience without shooting yourself in the foot? The most important aspect of a digital experience monitoring strategy is to keep track and verify the performance of every aspect of your digital service delivery, be it your own first-party infrastructure and software, or a third-party service. This ability to segment first- and third-party elements on the page will be invaluable when it comes to the all-important processes of diagnosing and troubleshooting performance issues. Obtaining that bird’s-eye view into your own performance, as well as that of external third-party services, will not only allow you to solve problems faster, but hold third-parties accountable as far as SLA compliance is concerned. 2016 Black Friday/Cyber Monday Performance The challenges that third-party services can present  (most notably tags) were apparent during the most recent Black Friday/Cyber Monday long holiday weekend. Even though the overall performance of ecommerce companies was the best it’s been in years, several major retailers suffered as a direct result of third-party performance degradations.  The reality is that most third-party tags are not designed to handle massive traffic loads. Williams-Sonoma had ongoing performance issues because of problems with Photorank, a customer photo display service that integrates within a retailer’s website and is designed to help drive conversions. Both the retailer’s desktop and mobile sites had load time spikes around 25 seconds — unacceptably slow. Elsewhere, Walmart experienced several issues throughout the long weekend, including spotty desktop web performance starting in Phoenix then extending to New York City and Denver as the weekend progressed, all resulting directly from an issue with a Rubicon Project tag. The desktop sites of Lenovo, QVC and Newegg also experienced issues directly attributable to third-party tags on Cyber Monday, with Lenovo’s webpage load time spiking to more than 18 seconds in the middle of the day. How to Protect Your Website If you want to use third-party tags, your first line of defense needs to be a thorough vetting of any third-party service before you put them into place. You wouldn’t hire a stranger to housesit for you while you’re away, so why would allow just anyone onto your digital properties? Less is often more when it comes to third-party tags, and you should not only be asking yourself if a particular service is capable of providing the top-notch service you require, but also whether that service is even necessary. This vigilance becomes even more important during peak traffic periods, when the risk of misbehaving third-party tags multiplies. Monitor Cloud Service Providers, CDNs In addition to monitoring third-party tags, it is critical to monitor cloud service providers and content delivery networks (CDNs) as well. Clouds can provide instant scalability, while CDNs provide a valuable bridge to help you cut down content delivery latencies, improving the user experience for geographically dispersed users. But remember, peak periods for you are likely peak periods for these external infrastructures as well, and they must be monitored constantly to ensure that they are performing up to par and protecting your users’ experience, and ultimately your brand.   With ecommerce maturing, there are fewer and fewer excuses for poor performance during both peak and non-peak traffic periods. Certainly, catastrophic failures like a massive power outage are always a possibility. However, even as the internet increases in complexity, most problems are still within your zone of control. Deriving actionable intelligence amidst a sea of growing IT complexity is the key. About the Author Mehdi Daoudi is co-founder and CEO of Catchpoint Systems, a digital performance analytics company.

Sean Gallagher - Jan 4, 2017 12:00 pm UTC Enlarge / Alexa, how do I create something that combines AI with a creepy 1980s toy? Sean Gallagher reader comments 90 Share this story It's been 50 years since Captain Kirk first spoke commands to an unseen, all-knowing Computer on Star Trek and not quite as long since David Bowman was serenaded by HAL 9000's rendition of "A Bicycle Built for Two" in 2001: A Space Odyssey. While we've been talking to our computers and other devices for years (often in the form of expletive interjections), we're only now beginning to scratch the surface of what's possible when voice commands are connected to artificial intelligence software. Meanwhile, we've always seemingly fantasized about talking toys, from Woody and Buzz in Toy Story to that creepy AI teddy bear that tagged along with Haley Joel Osment in Steven Spielberg's A.I. (Well, maybe people aren't dreaming of that teddy bear.) And ever since the Furby craze, toymakers have been trying to make toys smarter. They've even connected them to the cloud—with predictably mixed results. Further ReadingBearDuino: Hacking Teddy Ruxpin with Arduino Naturally, I decided it was time to push things forward. I had an idea to connect a speech-driven AI and the Internet of Things to an animatronic bear—all the better to stare into the lifeless, occasionally blinking eyes of the Singularity itself with. Ladies and gentlemen, I give you Tedlexa: a gutted 1998 model of the Teddy Ruxpin animatronic bear tethered to Amazon's Alexa Voice Service. Introducing Tedlexa, the personal assistant of your nightmares I was not the first, by any means, to bridge the gap between animatronic toys and voice interfaces. Brian Kane, an instructor at the Rhode Island School of Design, threw down the gauntlet with a video of Alexa connected to that other servo-animated icon, Billy the Big Mouthed Bass. This Frakenfish was all powered by an Arduino. I could not let Kane's hack go unanswered, having previously explored the uncanny valley with Bearduino—a hardware hacking project of Portland-based developer/artist Sean Hathaway. With a hardware-hacked bear and Arduino already in hand (plus a Raspberry Pi II and assorted other toys at my disposal), I set off to create the ultimate talking teddy bear. To our future robo-overlords: please, forgive me. His master's voice Amazon is one of a pack of companies vying to connect voice commands to the vast computing power of "the cloud" and the ever-growing Internet of (Consumer) Things. Microsoft, Apple, Google, and many other contenders have sought to connect voice interfaces in their devices to an exponentially expanding number of cloud services, which in turn can be tethered to home automation systems and other "cyberphysical" systems. While Microsoft's Project Oxford services have remained largely experimental and Apple's Siri remains bound to Apple hardware, Amazon and Google have rushed headlong into a battle to become the voice service incumbent. As ads for Amazon's Echo and Google Home have saturated broadcast and cable television, the two companies have simultaneously started to open the associated software services up to others. I chose Alexa as a starting point for our descent into IoT hell for a number of reasons. One of them is that Amazon lets other developers build “skills” for Alexa that users can choose from a marketplace, like mobile apps. These skills determine how Alexa interprets certain voice commands, and they can be built on Amazon’s Lambda application platform or hosted by the developers themselves on their own server. (Rest assured, I’m going to be doing some future work with skills.) Another point of interest is that Amazon has been fairly aggressive about getting developers to build Alexa into their own gadgets—including hardware hackers. Amazon has also released its own demonstration version of an Alexa client for a number of platforms, including the Raspberry Pi. AVS, or Alexa Voice Services, requires a fairly small computing footprint on the user's end.  All of the voice recognition and synthesis of voice responses happens in Amazon's cloud; the client simply listens for commands, records them, and forwards them as an HTTP POST request carrying an JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) object to AVS' Web-based interfaces. The voice responses are sent as audio files to be played by the client, wrapped in a returned JSON object. Sometimes, they include a hand-off for streamed audio to a local audio player, as with AVS's "Flash Briefing" feature (and music streaming—but that's only available on commercial AVS products right now). Before I could build anything with Alexa on a Raspberry Pi, I needed to create a project profile on Amazon’s developer site. When you create an AVS project on the site, it creates a set of credentials and shared encryption keys used to configure whatever software you use to access the service. The Amazon Developer Console, where you create the configuration for a prototype Alexa device. First, it needs a name. The next step in creating a configuration: the generation of a security profile. These are used to authenticate the device via OAuth with Amazon's Alexa back-end. These source addresses for the device are required to allow local setup details to be passed via OAuth to Alexa. The first set of URLs under each setting here are for the AWS sample app's configuration; the second set (including the third address) are for the AlexaPi code I used on this project. Note they're not HTTPS—something to fix later. Amazon wants some more details on your "product" to finish the configuration profile. Once you've got the AVS client running, it needs to be configured with a Login With Amazon (LWA) token through its own setup Web page—giving it access to Amazon's services (and potentially, to Amazon payment processing). So, in essence, I would be creating a Teddy Ruxpin with access to my credit card. This will be a topic for some future security research on IoT on my part. Amazon offers developers a sample Alexa client to get started, including one implementation that will run on Raspbian, the Raspberry Pi implementation of Debian Linux. However, the official demo client is written largely in Java. Despite, or perhaps because of, my past Java experience, I was leery of trying to do any interconnection between the sample code and the Arduino-driven bear. As far as I could determine, I had two possible courses of action: A hardware-focused approach that used the audio stream from Alexa to drive the animation of the bear. Finding a more accessible client or writing my own, preferably in an accessible language like Python, that could drive the Arduino with serial commands. Naturally, being a software-focused guy and having already done a significant amount of software work with Arduino, I chose…the hardware route. Hoping to overcome my lack of experience with electronics with a combination of Internet searches and raw enthusiasm, I grabbed my soldering iron. Plan A: Audio in, servo out My plan was to use a splitter cable for the Raspberry Pi’s audio and to run the audio both to a speaker and to the Arduino. The audio signal would be read as analog input by the Arduino, and I would somehow convert the changes in volume in the signal into values that would in turn be converted to digital output to the servo in the bear’s head. The elegance of this solution was that I would be able to use the animated robo-bear with any audio source—leading to hours of entertainment value. It turns out this is the approach Kane took with his Bass-lexa. In a phone conversation, he revealed for the first time how he pulled off his talking fish as an example of rapid prototyping for his students at RISD. "It's all about making it as quickly as possible so people can experience it," he explained. "Otherwise, you end up with a big project that doesn't get into people's hands until it's almost done." So, Kane's rapid-prototyping solution: connecting an audio sensor physically duct-taped to an Amazon Echo to an Arduino controlling the motors driving the fish. Enlarge / Kane texted me this photo of his prototype—audio sensor and breadboard taped atop an Amazon Echo. Brian Kane Of course, I knew none of this when I began my project. I also didn't have an Echo or a $4 audio sensor. Instead, I was stumbling around the Internet looking for ways to hotwire the audio jack of my Raspberry Pi into the Arduino. I knew that audio signals are alternating current, forming a waveform that drives headphones and speakers. The analog pins on the Arduino can only read positive direct current voltages, however, so in theory the negative-value peaks in the waves would be read with a value of zero. I was given false hope by an Instructable I found that moved a servo arm in time with music—simply by soldering a 1,000 ohm resistor to the ground of the audio cable. After looking at the Instructable, I started to doubt its sanity a bit even as I moved boldly forward. I need sanity check on this Instructs le: wtf with the soldering? https://t.co/Mc3HlqqNtW — Sean Gallagher (@thepacketrat) November 15, 2016 Me, after a few hours with a soldering iron. pic.twitter.com/16aaWkI4Em — Sean Gallagher (@thepacketrat) November 15, 2016 While I saw data from the audio cable streaming in via test code running on the Arduino, it was mostly zeros. So after taking some time to review some other projects, I realized that the resistor was damping down the signal so much it was barely registering at all. This turned out to be a good thing—doing a direct patch based on the approach the Instructable presented would have put 5 volts or more into the Arduino’s analog input (more than double its maximum). Getting the Arduino-only approach to work would mean making an extra run to another electronics supply store. Sadly, I discovered my go-to, Baynesville Electronics, was in the last stages of its Going Out of Business Sale and was running low on stock. But I pushed forward, needing to procure the components to build an amplifier with a DC offset to convert the audio signal into something I could work with. It was when I started shopping for oscilloscopes that I realized I had ventured into the wrong bear den. Fortunately, there was a software answer waiting in the wings for me—a GitHub project called AlexaPi. Page: 1 2 Next → Sean Gallagher Sean is Ars Technica's IT Editor.

Right now, virtual reality (VR) gaming is not only limited to big and bulky desktop computers. Today?s mobile devices can now provide VR gaming experience on-the-go. And with the Asus Zenfone AR, augmented reality gets thrown into the fray. Last January 4, Qualcomm inadvertently spilled the beans about the Asus Zenfone AR. According to the ARM chip maker, the new Asus Zenfone AR will be equipped with a Snapdragon 821 processor. READ ALSO: Could an iPhone SE 2 Still Be Possible in 2017? Here?s the Most Likely Answer The post also implied that the new Asus phone will be the first Tango-enabled smartphone powered by the Snapdragon 821. It also features support for Google?s Daydream virtual reality platform. Unfortunately, the link has now been put down since its premature release. However, Evan Blass was quick enough to pick up the slack. In a recent Twitter post, Blass outed a few rendered images of the supposed Asus Zenfone AR.

Project Tango is Google?s technology platform for augmented reality. It uses a mobile device?s camera hardware to detect and approximate spacial orientation and position. It does this without the help of global positioning systems or other external signals. READ ALSO: Blackberry Mercury DTEK70 Coming to CES 2017; Will Be Verizon Exclusive Because the Zenfone AR supports both the Project Tango and Google Daydream VR, it effectively bridges the two technologies together. This opens up a myriad of possibilities for the phone itself. Not only that user can make use of its VR capabilities, developers can also combine this with augmented reality. The Asus Zenfone AR is quite promising indeed. And, with its top-of-the-line hardware specs, consumers will surely enjoy both VR and AR contents on the smartphone. The phone will be unveiled at this month?s Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas. The event will run from January 5 to 8.

"Small businesses are the backbone of India's economy. Internet is for everyone," Pichai said, addressing the media here. "The Internet is a powerful equaliser and we are motivated to bring the benefits of information and technology to as many people as possible," he said. "Building for everyone and making it available in the hands of as many people is at the heart and core of what we do. And we do this by investing in open ecosystem," Pichai added. Pichai said that Google, along with the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci), has developed a training programme called 'Digital Unlocked', to empower thousands of Indian SMBs with essential digital skills that would enable them to get online and start using the power of the internet to grow their businesses. The programme would be certified by Google, Ficci and Indian School of Business - Hyderabad. It would offer online and mobile courses to SMBs across the country. "We plan to impart 5,000 training workshops in 40 cities in three years," he added. The global search giant also started another initiative 'My Business Website'. It is a free tool, which would help make a website in 10 minutes. "Any small business can sign up. Internet is as much for the local players as it is for a high-flying one. It will first start in India (later this year), and then will be launched in other countries," Pichai said. 'My Business Website' would be available in English, Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Marathi, Tamil, Urdu, Gujarati, Kannada, and Malayalam languages. There are around 51 million small and medium scale businesses in India. Google unveiled a joint research study with KPMG titled "Impact of internet and digitization on SMBs in India", which said that 68 per cent of the 51 million Indian SMBs were offline. "Profits grow twice as fast for those SMBs who have digital business," Google's Vice President, South-East Asia and India, Rajan Anandan said. The micro small and medium entreprises contribute 37 per cent to the Indian gross domestic products (GDP), he added. Further, for India's mobile-first audience, Google also launched Primer, a free mobile app uniquely designed to teach digital marketing skills in a quick, easy and interactive way. Primer also works offline and is currently available in English and Hindi. Tamil, Telugu and Marathi versions are coming up shortly. Appreciating all the initiatives by Google, IT and Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said: "Google is as much an Indian company as American."

Image: AP By Manish SinghIndia2017-01-04 11:46:03 UTC With India increasingly embarking the digital age, the government has grown worried about all the threats the country faces online. With no hesitance, it is looking at Google for help.  SEE ALSO: Google plans to get India's 51 million SMBs online with 'Digital Unlocked' India’s outspoken IT, Law and Justice Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad today requested Sundar Pichai to make Google more involved with India’s cyber security efforts. "In a larger push, I want Google to be involved in a more meaningful way. The more digital we go, the more challenges there will be in terms of cybersecurity," Shankar said onstage at an event where Pichai announced Digital Unlocked initiative for India’s small and medium sized businesses.  Prasad added, "Google is as much an Indian company as American. The sheer number of people in India who have accepted you means you have an obligation for India as much as you have for the United States."  Prasad’s remarks comes at a especially crucial time for India. The government was reportedly scrambling its databases and other records last month in the wake of several high profile Twitter hacks. A hacker group Legion breached Twitter accounts typhoon Vijay Mallya, Congress leader Rahul Gandhi, as well as of two Indian journalists. The hacker group had hinted that it was going to make public several government records soon.  An American multinational technology company ramping up security efforts in India to help the government isn’t unheard of. Last year, Microsoft launched its full-scale Cybersecurity Engagement Centre in the country.  The "first-of-its-kind centre", located in the heart of the country's capital city of New Delhi, is positioned to help public and private sector organizations in India with deeper cybersecurity collaborations with Microsoft.  At the time, Microsoft pointed that Indian firms were highly vulnerable of cybersecurity attacks. The company said IT assets were "unmanaged and unregulated" across several organisations, with onsite staff unable to timely monitor, detect, and remove threats.  Prasad's comment about Google being as Indian as its American might not sit well with some. Last month, some of India's poster boys of successful startups had urged the government to favor Indian companies over their foreign counterparts.  BONUS: Discovery's 'Killing Fields' is your next true crime obsession Topics: Google, it, security, Tech About Us Jobs Advertise Subscribe Privacy Terms Mashable is a global, multi-platform media and entertainment company.

NEW DELHI: Terming Google "as much an Indian company as American", IT Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad today said it needs to play a larger role in the domestic market by tailoring its products and working more on cyber security. "Google is as much an Indian as American. The sheer extension which I would say... the manner in which people of India have accepted you... therefore, Google has as much obligation for India as you have for the US and the world," Prasad said at a Google event here. He stressed that Google India needs to tailor its operation more to the country's psyche. "Google India needs to tailor its operation more to India's psyche, local languages, local aspirations, local products... India's digital economy is going to be USD 1 trillion plus in the coming 3-4 years," he said. Stressing that Google should be more involved, the minister highlighted areas including cyber security where the technology giant could play a bigger role. A growth of digital payments will lead to stronger challenge of cyber security, which "our Prime Minister has termed as a bloodless war", he said. "I would appeal to Google to work more to ensure digital security... There has to be greater technological strengthening of the IT walls," he added. There has been a spike in digital transactions across platforms like mobile wallets, UPI and USSD after the liquid cash crunch following the government's move to scrap old Rs 500 and 1,000 notes. This has put digital payment companies under severe scrutiny as users and experts question their preparedness to deal with cyber attacks.

NEW DELHI: Intensifying it's efforts to conquer the small and medium business market in India, Internet giant Google announced two new initiatives on Wednesday, to train and help SMBs capitalise on the digitisation wave faster. Google's Chief Executive, the Chennai-born Sundar Pichai, who is currently touring India in a personal and work trip, said that in the coming months, Google will provide digital training to "thousands of small businesses". Digital Unlocked is essentially a training programme in association with industry body FICCI, to provide Indian SMBs essential digital skills to enable them to get online and connect to customers in different parts of the country. Under the second programme called "My Business Websites", Google will provide free websites and web tools to small businesses in order to bolster their digital presence. "Today, anyone can become an entrepreneur, a developer, or a creator, but it is important that they have the right tools and skills to digitize. We believe it is important for us to invest in training and equipping these individuals and small businesses to accelerate their journey of growth," Pichai said. Google has been looking to tap into the small and medium business market through its enterprise offerings such as Google for Work, Google Cloud and others. As more and more Indians come online, it is now trying to aggressively chase market share in the segment. In a joint study conducted by Google and consultancy KPMG on the "Impact of internet on digitization on SMBs in India", it was found that 68% of the 51 million SMBs are offline. It further found that digitization of SMBs could help increase their contribution to India’s GDP by 10 percentage points, taking it up to 46-48% by 2020. Speaking at the event, Ravi Shankar Prasad, the minister of Electronics and Information Technology welcomed Google's efforts to engage with Indian SMBs, but urged the Internet giant to understand and implement more solutions with the local context in mind. He said the company could focus on bringing Dalit and scheduled caste and scheduled tribes entrepreneurs into the fold of the mainstream, and added that Indian digital economy was going to be a $1 trillion economy in the coming years. The IT secretary Aruna Sundararajan also praised the spirit of entrepreneurship, and the ability to adapt to changing needs of the country by SMBs, and said "every aspect of India is in the midst of an unprecedented transformation triggered by technology". Ascertaining the benefits of going digital for small businesses, the Google-KPMG joint study also determined that profits of digitally engaged SMBs grow twice as fast compared to offline SMBs. Likewise digitally engaged businesses are able to grow their customer base significantly with 52% catering to customers beyond their home city versus only 29% offline SMBs. The report cites the lack of understanding of the benefits of digital technologies and technical skills as the essential reasons for being offline. Google also launched Primer, a free mobile app to teach digital marketing skills using interactive methods. The app, available onGoogle Play store and the Apple app store, also works offline and is available in English and Hindi with Tamil, Telugu and Marathi versions coming shortly.

We want to be the leaders," Prasad said. India's digital push has led to a rethink in the level of preparedness and resilience needed to ward of a cyber attack and India's telecom, IT and law minister Ravi Shankar Prasad on Wednesday asked Google CEO Sundar Pichai to play a greater, 'more meaningful' role in countering threats. However, questions remain on the role Google can play in cyber security, if any. "In a larger push I want Google to be involved in a more meaningful way. The more digital India becomes, there would be challenges. I would appeal to Google to work more to ensure digital security. We have taken a lot of initiatives, but there has to be greater strengthening of the IT walls," said Prasad. Prasad added that India will become a big hub in the field of digital security and the government is willing to walk the extra mile. "The digital empowering of India may one day become a case study for the world. Digital delivery of India would be a benchmark for the rest of the developing world and that is how we see it. I would appeal to Google to become a part of the change that India is witnessing," he added. What will be Google's next step? Google is the backbone for the consumer facing Internet services and for a vast majority of the population, being on the Internet is being on Google. However, it is not very clear how Google can play a role in strengthening cyber security. To suddenly expect Google to become a gatekeeper and determine what is right and wrong seems like a difficult proposition. Also, this would raise questions about revenue generation and driving away customers by curating content. Google is not a cyber security company and it's helping India get cyber secure is not aligned to its core business. However, where Google can play a role is to ensure, for example, is ensuring apps on its Play Store are genuine and not malicious in nature. There have been instances when people searching for Pokemon Go have ended up downloading fake apps. Being secure Cyber security was always a cost structure in India, and if one does a Google search on the state of cyber security in India, there would be hardly two or three reports on the subject. Numbers are sketchy and it is only recently that cyber security has suddenly become a mainstream agenda. In 2015, Prasad told Parliament that as many as 54,483 cyber security incidents such as phishing, spam and malicious code had been reported. The number for 2016 is not immediately known, but would definitely see a spike. The latest incident of Twitter and server hacks by the group Legion has made it amply clear that cyber security cannot be taken lightly. In Delhi to announce the Digital Unlocked certificate course, Pichai launched new tools, that would help SMBs get online by creating a website in less than 10 minutes. Prasad lauded Google's effort to get SMBs online and made it amply clear that the Government's digital push is here to stay and it is very serious about it. "We missed the industrial and entrepreneurial revolutions, but we do not want to miss the digital revolution. We want to be the leaders," Prasad said. Prasad went on to add that Google is as much Indian as its American. "The sheer number of people in India who have accepted you means you have an obligation for India as much as (the) US and the world. Google India needs to tailor its products to Indian psyche and ecosystem. Local languages, local products make good business sense for Google too. India would be a 1 trillion dollar digital economy in the next 3-4 years and it makes business sense for Google to have more India-centric products," Prasad said.

(Shekhar Yadav | EPS) NEW DELHI: Aiming to give a technological edge to the small and medium businesses (SMBs) in India, Google CEO Sundar Pichai on Wednesday announced two initiatives 'Digital Unlocked' and 'My Business Website'. "Small businesses are the backbone of India's economy. Internet is for everyone," Pichai said, addressing the media here. "The Internet is a powerful equaliser and we are motivated to bring the benefits of information and technology to as many people as possible," he said.  "Building for everyone and making it available in the hands of as many people is at the heart and core of what we do. And we do this by investing in open ecosystem," Pichai added. Pichai said that Google, along with the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci), has developed a training programme called 'Digital Unlocked', to empower thousands of Indian SMBs with essential digital skills that would enable them to get online and start using the power of the internet to grow their businesses.  The programme would be certified by Google, Ficci and Indian School of Business - Hyderabad. It would offer online and mobile courses to SMBs across the country.  "We plan to impart 5,000 training workshops in 40 cities in three years," he added. The global search giant also started another initiative 'My Business Website'. It is a free tool, which would help make a website in 10 minutes. "Any small business can sign up. Internet is as much for the local players as it is for a high-flying one. It will first start in India (later this year), and then will be launched in other countries," Pichai said. 'My Business Website' would be available in English, Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Marathi, Tamil, Urdu, Gujarati, Kannada, and Malayalam languages.  There are around 51 million small and medium scale businesses in India. Google unveiled a joint research study with KPMG titled "Impact of internet and digitization on SMBs in India", which said that 68 per cent of the 51 million Indian SMBs were offline. "Profits grow twice as fast for those SMBs who have digital business," Google's Vice President, South-East Asia and India, Rajan Anandan said. The micro small and medium entreprises contribute 37 per cent to the Indian gross domestic products (GDP), he added. Further, for India's mobile-first audience, Google also launched Primer, a free mobile app uniquely designed to teach digital marketing skills in a quick, easy and interactive way.  Primer also works offline and is currently available in English and Hindi. Tamil, Telugu and Marathi versions are coming up shortly. Appreciating all the initiatives by Google, IT and Law Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said: "Google is as much an Indian company as American."   TAGS Google Digital Unlocked My Business Website O P E N Coupon Flipkart Shopclues eBay Latest US worked to ensure fair Paris Mideast statement: Kerry 26 killed in latest Brazil jail bloodbath Eight men own half the world's wealth: Oxfam Venezuela president renews crisis controls, snubs foes Bahrain executions spark violent protests Petrol price hiked by Rs.0.42, diesel by Rs. 1.03 per litre Govt to arrange exam results via SMS for J&K students BJP moves EC against SP's smartphone scheme Gallery Army Day: A show of strength and valour Makara Sankranti: Cattle jumping over fire in Karnataka arrow Videos Army Day celebrations in Chennai Dramatic visuals of Bihar boat tragedy arrow FOLLOW US Copyrights New Indian Express. 2017 Dinamani | Kannada Prabha | Cinema Express | Malayalam Vaarika Contact Us | About Us | Privacy Policy | Search | Terms of Use | Advertise With Us Home | Nation | World | Cities | Business | Columns | Entertainment | Sport | Magazine | The Sunday Standard

Google also previewed My Business Websites, an easy-to-use offering to help businesses to have a rich, mobile optimised digital presence that will be launched later this year. Making the announcements at an event held in the city today, Google CEO Sundar Pichai spoke to representatives from hundreds of small and medium business from across the country on the benefits of the web and digital technology. My Business Websites will be available in English, Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Marathi, Tamil, Urdu, Gujarati, Kannada, and Malayalam. Google India reaffirmed its commitment to digitally empower India’s 51 million strong small and medium business community. During his address, Sundar Pichai said, “The Internet is a powerful equalizer and we are motivated to bring the benefits of information and technology to as many people as possible. Building for everyone and making it available in the hands of as many people is at the heart and core of what we do. And we do this by investing in open ecosystems.” Referring specifically to small and medium businesses, Pichai added, “the Internet and digital technology will be an engine of growth for the Indian economy. Today, anyone can become an entrepreneur, a developer, or a creator, but it is important that they have the right tools and skills to digitize. We believe it is important for us to invest in training and equipping these individuals and small businesses to accelerate their journey of growth.” Setting the context for the initiative Google unveiled a joint research study with KPMG titled "Impact of internet and digitisation on SMBs in India". The study reiterates that 68 per cent of the 51m Indian SMBs are offline. Highlighting the macro-economic impact of the internet, the research found that rising penetration and greater uptake for digital by SMBs could help increase their contribution to India’s GDP by 10 percentage points, taking it up to 46-48 per cent by 2020. Ascertaining the benefits of going digital for small businesses, it determined that profits of digitally engaged SMBs grow twice as fast compared to offline SMBs. Likewise digitally engaged businesses are able to grow their customer base significantly with 52 per cent catering to customers beyond their home city versus only 29 per cent offline SMBs. The report cites the lack of understanding of the benefits of digital technologies and technical skills as the essential reasons for being offline. With Digital Unlocked, Google is committed to ensuring that every single small business in India that wants to go digital has access to quality training. In keeping with the varied learning needs of the millions of businesses in India, we’ve built this program across online, offline and mobile. The offline training is being conducted in partnership with FICCI and over the next three years, 5,000 workshops will be held across 40 Indian cities. The online training comprises a set of 90 self-paced video tutorials, curated specifically for India and is available free of charge at g.co/digitalunlocked. The tutorials cover a comprehensive set of topics ranging from building a web presence and driving online growth to reaching customers over mobile and video. The trainings are certified by Google, Indian School of Business and FICCI. Further, for India’s mobile-first audience, Google also launched Primer, a free mobile app uniquely designed to teach digital marketing skills in a quick, easy and interactive way. It is available for download through the Google Play and iOS app store. Primer also works offline and is currently available in English and Hindi with Tamil, Telugu and Marathi versions coming shortly. At the event, Google also previewed My Business Websites, aimed at equipping the vast majority of small businesses with a simple way to start their digital journey by creating a free, mobile optimised website, easily and instantly. Available for Google My Business users later in the year, this new feature will provide simple, templated, editable websites for small businesses created from their data and photos on Google Maps. Several small businesses that have leveraged Google’s products and technologies were also present at the event. Three of them - Walnut, Go Co-op and Maganlal Dresswalla - were in conversation with Sundar Pichai and shared their journey to digital using Google offerings including Google My Business, Google AdWords as well as the Google Cloud Platform. The announcement today is a continuation of Google’s efforts to support Digital India. Last year Google had launched Google My Business, a program aimed at helping small medium businesses get an online presence on Google Search and Google Maps, without having to invest in a website or domain. Over 8 million Indian SMBs are already on these platforms, with thousands more coming online every month. tags GoogleCEOSundar PichaiDigital UnlockeddigitisationSmartphoneWebsitesIndian School of BusinessFicci Trending EC to screen govt ads; PM photo on hoardings disallowed 'Choose Your Twinkle' on Valentine's Anup Viswanathan quits Sony Entertainment Television 'India needs 80 lakh hotspots; metros' spectrum 1/10th of U.S' IOA suspension revoked following Kalmadi, Chautala's removal   Latest Reads Indian digital industry to be worth Rs 20k cr by '20: EY report MUMBAI: The Indian digital sector is anticipated to cross Rs 20,000 crore by 2020 which includes OTT and digital advertising.

It makes for one of the best smartphones on the market today. Here’s our OnePlus 3T review. Five months after the OnePlus 3 comes this better, more expensive sequel - and it's now running Android Nougat By Henry Burrell | 04 Jan 17 Share Tweet Send ﻿ Hi. I saw this on PC Advisor and thought you should see it too. Comments Specifications Android Marshmallow 6.0.1 with Oxygen OS 3.5.1 5.5in 1920 x 1080 AMOLED display, 401ppi 2.35GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 quad-core processor Adreno 530 graphics 6GB RAM See full specs Expert's Rating OVERALL BUILD QUALITY FEATURES VALUE FOR MONEY PERFORMANCE Price when reviewed From £399 Best prices today Retailer Price Delivery   OnePlus From £399 View Price comparision from , and manufacturers OnePlus 3T review OnePlus is a company that doesn’t much like its reputation in the smartphone business as a plucky upstart. Yet that’s what it is, competing as it must with the likes of Apple, Samsung and Google for the crown of best smartphone in the world. The OnePlus 3, launched in June 2016, was a sublime blend of design and performance for just over £300 but nevertheless, here’s our OnePlus 3T review. See also: Best phones 2016. So it’s odd that just five months later OnePlus has ended production of that handset, sticking to it’s motto of ‘never settle’ and released this upgraded version of the same phone, the OnePlus 3T. The company that prides itself on listening to its fans’ reaction to its products has boldly dared to update a handset that people have had for less than half a year. Will the move gain new fans while annoying existing ones, or both? It’s hard not to compare this phone, when reviewing it, to the OnePlus 3. Since there’s only five months between iterative updates to a high-end phone, we have to compare the two to fully understand the reasons why. OnePlus 3T review: Price and where to buy The OnePlus 3T is on sale SIM-free and unlocked directly from OnePlus. Click here to view it – it’ll cost you £399 for the 64GB version and just £40 more for the £439 128GB version. Both are currently available in the Gunmetal colour, which is slightly darker than the Graphite version of the OnePlus 3.  There will be a Soft Gold version of the 64GB OnePlus 3T out in the next few weeks. In the UK you can get the OnePlus 3T from O2 on a 24-month contract deal. Bear in mind that it’s only available on O2’s Refresh tariff that allows you to upgrade your handset more regularly. OnePlus 3T review: Design and build Even the ‘s’ iterations of iPhones have an ‘s’ stamped on the back, but in this case there is absolutely no design change from the OnePlus 3 to the OnePlus 3T. The only change is in the darker colour option, the grey of which on the rear is a tad darker than the old model. The forthcoming Soft Gold option is exactly the same, and visually indistinguishable from its five month old brother. This reinforces that OnePlus sees the 3T as a small tweak for the line, hoping as it does to not frustrate loyal fans that shelled out for a 3. The 3T happily retains an outstanding design, with build quality to rival any premium smartphone maker in the land. It does what Apple has still failed to do and made a 5.5in screen phone slim, svelte and usable with one hand (just). Apparently carved out of one piece of space-grade aluminium alloy the OnePlus 3T measures 153 x 75 x 7.4mm and weighs 158g. The frame of the handset houses a power/lock button on the right edge, a USB-C port, speaker, mic and 3.5mm headphone jack on the bottom and a volume rocker and OnePlus’ excellent Alert Slider on the left, leaving the top edge flat, curved and smooth. With a front facing fingerprint scanner that relies on haptic feedback as opposed to a physical button, this is a phone that screams ‘use me’ from the second you take it out the box. In that box it also already comes with a screen protector pre-applied, handy if you want to use it with one. The only lines that break the dark gunmetal of our review unit are the aerial lines and the OnePlus logo that sits beneath a 16Mp camera that protrudes ever so slightly from the casing. The front facing camera sits next to the earpiece and is also an amazing 16Mp, something we’ll explore later. At the launch event for the OnePlus 3T, co-founder Carl Pei explained that the company is always striving to do better; he used Apple’s design as a benchmark and the phone is one of the best looking handsets on the market, rivalling the matte black iPhone 7 Plus in the looks department, which is no mean feat. It does however remain slightly slippy, and is a phone that could be destroyed with one drop onto the pavement. We recommend one of OnePlus’ subtle but grippy cases that fit both this and the older OnePlus 3. OnePlus 3T review: Specs, hardware and performance Much of the 3T's spec sheet remains the same as its predecssor but there are also some important upgrades. Let's take a look. OnePlus 3T screen Despite initial rumours, the OnePlus 3T has exactly the same display as the OnePlus 3. It’s a 5.5in Optic AMOLED with Full HD (1920x1080) resolution and 401ppi. By its own admission, OnePlus continues to ship a screen that recreates colours more vibrantly than most, but with the Oxygen OS skin of Android that it runs this feels right; the handset and feel of the software that the screen runs is right at home with the popping colours and bright whites. There’s the option to calibrate the colours to your tastes though, and this is one example of the granularity of Android helping the OnePlus 3T more than most become a truly personal device. OnePlus 3T processor, memory and storage The OnePlus 3T’s upgrades are mostly all internal, and while they’re all welcome, it took a fair few days of use to see why it’s come to be. We’ve used the OnePlus 3 for a few months, so can draw decent comparisons – straight off, you need not upgrade for fear of missing out on processor power, speed or battery life if you own the older model. Having said that the 3T is faster, yet only noticeably so if you are really hammering it at full pelt. It joins the Google Pixel and Pixel XL in having Qualcomm’s top of the line Snapdragon 821 processor, the current pinnacle of smartphone chips. While only the most graphically intensive games and busiest of multitasking days will make the 820 sweat, the 821 is faster on the OnePlus 3T. Going from the 3 to the 3T, the difference is noticeable if incredibly subtle. In a full week of use we experienced absolutely no lag, slow app changes or overheating. It is truly like using a desktop at some times, and even has more RAM than some of those computers with 6GB on board. Pair that with Adreno 530 graphics and you have an obscenely powerful smartphone in your pocket – alongside your fat wallet full of the money you’ve saved by choosing it. Our benchmarks show the OnePlus 3T runs equal with the best smartphones out there, though remember these benchmarks don’t represent real world use. The phones in this graph are the absolute best you can get right now, and broadly all perform to the same unbeatable standards. The OnePlus 3T is available with 64GB of internal storage, but bear in mind there’s no SD card slot. The fact you only need to spend £30 more to get an impressive 128GB shows you that Apple charging £100 more for that jump in storage for the iPhone 7 is unnecessarily high. For most, spending that extra money will be well worth it. OnePlus 3T fingerprint scanner and other specs The fingerprint scanner is on the front bottom face of the device, which is still where these sensors work best, despite Sony trying the side and Huawei and others the back. The button is non-moving and gives the perfect level of feedback when unlocking the device or using a compatible app like Android Pay to verify your identity. Unlike the iPhone 7, it doesn’t feel like the whole phone is clicking down – it’s way better here. Tapping the same sensor acts as a home button, and is so good that when we try phones with physical buttons it feels wrong. The best devices change our habits for the good, and the OnePlus 3T has the best fingerprint sensor/home button combo of any current smartphone on the market. OnePlus 3T battery life The non-removable battery clocks in at 3,400mAh, a step up from the 3,000 of the OnePlus 3. The internals are exactly the same dimensions but the battery is denser, hence the increase. In general use the phone will last a full working day which is about average. We left the house most days at 8am with 100%, and by the time we rolled in from work at about 6.30pm the OnePlus 3T had about 30% left in the tank. This was when using the device as our primary email sender and using apps like Slack, Spotify, Pocket, WhatsApp, train timetable apps, GPS battery-drainers like Google Maps and several others throughout the day. The battery percentage chugs down at the expected rate, and we didn’t experience any dramatic unexpected fall-off. On one particularly busy Google Maps day out in Barcelona even after 12 hours on the go the battery was sitting at 15%, and that was with the phone used to navigate, take photos and video and more besides. Obviously it depends what you’re doing on the device, but for all but the most intensive users, the OnePlus 3T will last the whole day no questions asked and lighter users should be able to get a decent chunk into a second day with the 3T. Included in the box is OnePlus’ Dash Charger. The brick and cable, only when used together (important to note this point) charge the phone to 60 percent in 30 minutes. This is OnePlus’ claim, and it rings true – Dash Charge is excellent. It means you need not charge your 3T overnight, instead giving it a quick boost when you get up in the morning. There's also a Dash Charger for your car in the shop. Not only does this encourage a better way to charge your phone (sometimes lithium-ion batteries degrade with overnight overcharging) while allowing you to top up very quickly, but also more importantly means you won’t panic about running out of juice for all but the most phone-focussed of days – and that is something that every smartphone user wants, bar none. The slight downside is that this fast charging only works with the included combo of plug and cable. Any other USB-C cable will charge it, but at a slower rate. OnePlus sells the Dash Power Bundle for £27.53. OnePlus 3T cameras The slim casing of the 3T means the camera protrudes slightly. This is an acceptable pay-off for what is an excellent sensor: a 16Mp lens with f/2.0 aperture and an LED flash. It’s also capable of shooting video at 4K resolution or 1080p resolution at 60 frames per second. We used the camera extensively in Barcelona, and the results were very impressive. The panorama mode stitched together a mountain view exceptionally well, giving full detail to the scene. A football match in cloudy weather was reproduced well with no blur and in a low-lit church the camera reproduced colour and shadow to a high quality level. The front-facing 16Mp camera is an upgrade on the 8Mp of the OnePlus 3, and is one of the highest resolution selfie cameras on the market, matching as it does the megapixel count of the rear one. It’s an impressive upgrade, but one that only the most ardent of selfie fans will notice. However, it did improve the quality of video calling considerably, and will benefit those into Snapchat stories and similar services. OnePlus 3T review: Software Refreshingly the software update that the OnePlus 3T ships with changes the user experience in all the right ways to represent a clean, intuitive and pleasant to use Android version that is every bit as good as Google’s own version. By basing its Android skin Oxygen OS closely to stock Android Marshmallow 6.0, OnePlus has been able to make small tweaks that don’t completely change the way we used the phone, but enough to notice positive improvements day to day. An update to Android 7.0 Nougat began rolling out for the OnePlus 3 and OnePlus 3T at the end of December, ahead of many of its rivals. Note that we have reviewed this phone running Marshmallow, not Nougat. Oxygen OS 3.5.1 is the new version, compared to the 3.2.7 we had installed on the older OnePlus 3 at the time of writing. Nevermind the decimals, here are the differences. Menus, in settings for example, look cleaner with no lines between options, a neater top bar and a bluer default font from the green of the 3. To be honest, they are minor changes, like the layout of the notification bar that you pull down from the top of the screen. In the comparison pictures below you can see the changes (OnePlus 3 on the left, OnePlus 3T on the right). The OnePlus 3T cleverly combines a physical slider with profile changes to quickly switch between modes. Here, the three-position switch goes between Silent, Do Not Disturb and Ring. These are customisable and are useful for putting your phone into a quieter mode for meetings or when you go to bed for example. This is different to how the slider worked on the OnePlus 3, where it went between Silent, Priority Notifications and All Notifications. The functions are basically the same, but again have some software tweaks within the settings menu. All in all, the alert slider is a great idea, improving on Apple iPhone silencer switch, and is a button you’ll miss if you use other phones afterwards. The best thing about these tweaks is the way they simply blend into the OS and are intuitive, thoughtful upgrades. OnePlus confirmed that the 3 and the 3T will both receive updates to Android Nougat 7.0 in December 2016. We hope there is more of the same incremental updates rather than a full overhaul, because Oxygen OS 3.5.1 is very good indeed. Nor would it make sense for OnePlus to work so hard on an upgrade that most users would only see for one month. OnePlus 3T review: Should I upgrade from the OnePlus 3 to the OnePlus 3T? So it’s crunch time; you bought a OnePlus 3 in June and five months later, do you upgrade? Well, no, you shouldn’t in our opinion. The OnePlus 3T may have, on paper, a better processor, bigger battery and better selfie camera but if you own the 3, it isn’t worth spending another £400 for those features. If you can sell on your old device for a good price then perhaps you’d be tempted, but if the company has done the 3T this fast, it surely can’t be that much longer until we see a OnePlus 4. The OnePlus 3 has, like the newer 3T, 6GB RAM and come December will also run Android Nougat. Sure, we love the changes to the 3T and the Gunmetal colour is awesome, but you can’t even see it with a case on and in everyday use, you can barely notice the difference in speed. You can just about tell the battery life is better though, but it was already excellent on the OnePlus 3. Don’t panic – you don’t need to upgrade unless you want a OnePlus phone with 128GB of storage. OnePlus 3T review: Should I get the OnePlus 3 or the OnePlus 3T? This is a trickier question, and one that ran with a time limit – OnePlus has ceased production, so once they’re gone, they’re gone and the 3T will be the only phone the company still sells. On the day the 3T sent on sale in Europe, the OnePlus 3 was completely sold out on the company's website.  At the time of writing however the OnePlus 3 was still available on contract from O2. We'd wager this is the last way in the UK to get the old model brand new - otherwise, look to eBay. At the RRP, if you only need 64GB and want to save £70, the OnePlus 3 remains an outstanding piece of hardware that will be more than adequate at the high end of the market for at least another year and a half. That £70 could buy you OnePlus’ new Bullets earphones, an official case and a spare Dash Charge Bundle with change to spare.  However, if you want 128GB on board storage, you’ll have to go for the OnePlus 3T, setting you back £439. It’s also the best way to get hold of the Soft Gold colour if you prefer – the OnePlus 3 has sold out of this colour, while the 3T will soon be stocked in it. So you’ll have to wait if you prefer Gold to Gunmetal, but the 3T is the way to go. Yet for all the similarities, we’re still inclined to recommend the OnePlus 3T. It has a bigger battery, lightning fast speeds and a selfie camera that means video calls are actually worthwhile experiences. While nitpicking indeed, the software updates are also commendable, and the overall experience is (just) better than the five month old, soon-to-be-gone OnePlus 3. It’s an odd dilemma to have from a company that had until now made your buying choice very simple. In a few weeks you’ll only be able to get a OnePlus 3T, but for now, there’s a decision to be made for prospective buyers. OnePlus 3T: Specs Android Marshmallow 6.0.1 with Oxygen OS 3.5.1 5.5in 1920 x 1080 AMOLED display, 401ppi 2.35GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 quad-core processor Adreno 530 graphics 6GB RAM 16Mp main camera, LED flash, support for videos in 4K and 1080p at 60fps 16Mp front camera 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi Bluetooth 4.2 4G LTE Nano-SIM GPS NFC 3,400 mAh non-removable battery 152.7 x 74.7 x 7.4mm 158g Android Marshmallow 6.0.1 with Oxygen OS 3.5.1 5.5in 1920 x 1080 AMOLED display, 401ppi 2.35GHz Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 quad-core processor Adreno 530 graphics 6GB RAM 16Mp main camera, LED flash, support for videos in 4K and 1080p at 60fps 16Mp front camera 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac Wi-Fi Bluetooth 4.2 4G LTE Nano-SIM GPS NFC 3,400 mAh non-removable battery 152.7 x 74.7 x 7.4mm 158g OUR VERDICT The OnePlus 3T will be unfairly compared, for now at least, to the phone that came before it. So let’s ignore it. On its own, the OnePlus 3T is everything a modern smartphone should be; slim, fast, and responsive, with above average battery life and cameras that produce stunning images. And then there’s the price. OnePlus may not like being known for it, but £399 remains an absolutely amazing price point for the phone on offer. As long as you don’t want an iPhone, this Android handset stands side by side with the Samsung Galaxy S7 as the best example of a smartphone on the market today – once we’ve all got over that it came a little sooner than we had expected.

Internet is for everyone,” Pichai said, addressing the media here. “The Internet is a powerful equaliser and we are motivated to bring the benefits of information and technology to as many people as possible,” he said. “Building for everyone and making it available in the hands of as many people is at the heart and core of what we do. And we do this by investing in open ecosystem,” Pichai added. Pichai said that Google, along with the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry (Ficci), has developed a training programme called ‘Digital Unlocked’, to empower thousands of Indian SMBs with essential digital skills that would enable them to get online and start using the power of the internet to grow their businesses. The programme would be certified by Google, Ficci and Indian School of Business – Hyderabad. It would offer online and mobile courses to SMBs across the country. “We plan to impart 5,000 training workshops in 40 cities in three years,” he added. The global search giant also started another initiative ‘My Business Website’. It is a free tool, which would help make a website in 10 minutes. “Any small business can sign up. Internet is as much for the local players as it is for a high-flying one. It will first start in India (later this year), and then will be launched in other countries,” Pichai said. ‘My Business Website’ would be available in English, Hindi, Bengali, Telugu, Marathi, Tamil, Urdu, Gujarati, Kannada, and Malayalam languages. There are around 51 million small and medium scale businesses in India. Google unveiled a joint research study with KPMG titled “Impact of internet and digitization on SMBs in India”, which said that 68 per cent of the 51 million Indian SMBs were offline. “Profits grow twice as fast for those SMBs who have digital business,” Google’s Vice President, South-East Asia and India, Rajan Anandan said. The micro small and medium entreprises contribute 37 per cent to the Indian gross domestic products (GDP), he added. Further, for India’s mobile-first audience, Google also launched Primer, a free mobile app uniquely designed to teach digital marketing skills in a quick, easy and interactive way. Primer also works offline and is currently available in English and Hindi. Tamil, Telugu and Marathi versions are coming up shortly.

International Business Times, India Edition International Business Times, India Edition India US World Business Technology Sports Entertainment Auto Photos Video Search Search Home Technology Smartphones CES 2017: Microsoft envisions bigger role in automobile sector; teaser hints at Cortana-powered Nissan smart car Microsoft and Nissan are scheduled to showcase smart cars featuring Artificial Intelligence-based Cortana assistant. Rohit KVN   January 4, 2017 16:23 IST xbox.com Besides Elon Mask-owned Tesla, Google is undoubtedly the most popular tech major in the Silicon Valley to have shown keen interest in driverless smart car technology. Now, Microsoft has announced plans to foray into the automobile sector. The Redmond-based company has joined hands with top carmaker Nissan to make vehicles smarter with Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based Cortana digital assistance, which has already made a big name in the smartphone segment. Also read: CES 2017: LG to showcase new line of AI-based Robots to challenge Amazon Alexa and Google Home at Las Vegas event Nissan Motors, which is scheduled to host a keynote presentation at CES 2017 on January 5, has released a teaser showcasing Cortana's note-taking features. In the teaser video, a Nissan executive is heard asking queries on the CES 2017 event and the company's participation in Las Vegas. It is widely reported that Nissan will integrate Microsoft's digital assistant into its future vehicles. Last month, Microsoft had released Cortana Devices SDK (Software Development Kit) and skill-set tools to encourage programmers and OEMs (Original Equipment Manufacturers) integrate Cortana directly into their devices, providing unique and intelligent experiences for consumers.

It looks like Nissan has found Cortana to be more exciting than Google Assistant or Amazon Alexa. Microsoft is also said to be working with four companies and an insurance firm Swiss Re to build safe and secure end-to-end mobility using AI-based bots, which are said to be capable of quickly assessing traffic, including pedestrian movement using car-to-car (V2V) and car-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, radar, camera and Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) systems, a remote sensing method that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure ranges. "This collaboration at CES 2017 is another example of how we work together to continue testing, to see what sticks, and to help automakers bring truly personalised experiences to drivers and services that learn unique behaviours and can make improvements over time," News 18 quoted Kevin Dallas, corporate VP of business development for Microsoft, as saying. The word on the street is that another major automobile firm Volvo is also expected to join the bandwagon. If Microsoft's Cortana succeeds in attracting more carmakers in CES 2017, the Redmond-based company, despite its late venture in the automobile game, will overtake rivals in no time. As of now, there is no word on whether the Cortana-based Nissan car will have auto-pilot mode or not. Watch this space for latest news on Microsoft Cortana and Nissan's smart car.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Hyundai’s Blue Link Agent starts working with the Google Assistant By Rei Padla - January 4, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Expect to hear more tech integrations this 2017. There will be more smart home devices and services working together plus automotive systems getting smarter each day. Yesterday, we’ve heard of Google and the FCA teaming up for Android-Uconnect integration. This time, it’s Google and Hyundai joining forces to make the Google Assistant work with the Blue Link Agent on most Hyundai vehicles. Since August last year, Hyundai has started delivering Android Auto software updates to more vehicles. Soon, your home and cars will be connected as Hyundai is set to demonstrate the Blue Link Agent and Google Assistant/Google Home compatibility today at the CES. With this integration, Google and Blue Link will work hand-in-hand to serve your needs. Sample voice commands include the following: “Ok Google, Tell Blue Link to start my Santa Fe and set the temperature to 72 degrees” “Ok Google, Tell Blue Link to send the address of the Mandarin Oriental, in Las Vegas to my Sonata” “Ok Google, ask Blue Link to lock my car”. “Ok Google, Find me a great steakhouse in Las Vegas.” “Ok Google, tell Blue Link to send the address to my Santa Fe.” “Ok Google, what is the weather like today?” “Ok Google, ask Blue Link to Start my Tucson and set the temperature to 75 degrees.” “9115.” “1978.” “Ok Google, Tell Blue Link to start charging my IONIQ” So the Google Assistant can relay any message to the Blue Link. It’s like having your own secretary or messenger but this time, they are digital tech assistants that can do many things for you. Smart home integrations are slowly growing and we’re guessing automotive and vehicle connected operations will also expand. Such improvements make our lives easier and more convenient. With this integration, you can tell Google to help you remote lock, remote start, set temperature, or remote manage EV charging among others.
