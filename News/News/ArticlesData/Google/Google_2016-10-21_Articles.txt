Plenty of people have expressed their interest in both handhelds and most likely went on to grab their units when the devices got released a couple of days ago. However, a good chunk is still undecided. While early reviews for the Pixel and Pixel XL are now out, they only detail the software experience and the surface of the hardware that the handhelds have. A deeper look into the hardware would require the smartphone to be taken apart. iFixit did just that with its Google Pixel XL teardown. Going In From the Top Noting of the Google Pixel XL's design similarities to the iPhone, iFixit decided to open the device and expose its innards by first detaching the display. After a minute of heat, another minute for prying and a couple of screws, iFixit finally separated the screen from the rest of the phone. "The OLED panel separated from the digitizer glass a little too easily for our liking. Super-thin components and no frame or bezel behind the display make it extra sketchy to remove," writes iFixit. Further scrutiny reveals that the 5.5-inch AMOLED display is from Samsung, and the touch controller that comes attached to its back is a Synaptics ClearPad S3708. The Midframe With the display off, the midframe was exposed. iFixit comments that the slim magnesium frame is more bendy than expected and that it is clipped very firmly to the phone's body. iFixit's Google Pixel XL teardown reveals that the midframe houses an earpiece speaker and a ribbon connector. With the frame off, the rest of the components, including the matte-black motherboard, are exposed. Taking Out the Battery While Google tags the Pixel and Pixel XL with a "Phone by Google" branding, it's not a secret that both handhelds came off HTC's assembly line. However, HTC did not leave any of its own branding aside from the one found on the 13.28 Wh battery. The battery's cover has a perforated portion, which, when pulled, turns into convenient strip for taking out the battery. The Motherboard And Modular Parts After taking out the interconnect board, 3.5 mm headphone jack and 8-megapixel front-facing camera, iFixit got access to the motherboard but not before the fingerprint sensor cable was detached. At the front, the motherboard has the Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 SoC, along with a 4 GB LPDDR4 mobile DRAM from Samsung. Qualcomm's power manager IC, Quick Charge 3.0 IC and LTE RF transceiver as well as the NXP audio amplifier, NFC controller and Wi-Fi controllers also take up some of the motherboard's front-side space. At the mobo's back is a 32 GB UFS 2.0 chip from Samsung, the audio codec, antenna matching tuner, LTE RF transceiver and power amplifiers. Attached to the motherboard, just beside the 12.3-megapixel rear camera that is also attached to the mobo, is a mini board that houses the microphone. The miniboard is also home to the rangefinder that the XL needs for its laser autofocus. The Daughterboard And the Fingerprint Sensor The fingerprint sensor is housed by the rear case and, as mentioned, is attached to the motherboard via a cable. Also in the rear case is the daughterboard, which is home to a microphone and the USB Type-C port. "This is a pretty bare-bones part, which means cheap USB port replacements," iFixit writes in addition to its prior comment on how the daughterboard pops out with relative ease. Repairability Score The Google Pixel XL's repairability score is 6 out of 10. iFixit sees the modular components, the perforated cover that makes battery removal a breeze and the uniform T5 Torx screws of the handheld as its positive points. However, the sketchy removal of the display as well as the snug, fit notches that made the midframe removal laborious pulled the XL down in terms of repairability. Note that the iPhone 7 Plus was awarded a 7 out of 10. Below is iFixit's teardown video for the Google Pixel XL.

Speaking after meeting on Friday with Ann Lavin, Google's director of public policy and government affairs in Asia- Pacific, he said the representative of the tech giant has recognised the government's concern and agreed to take additional steps to address it. The government had invited a Google executive to meet ACM Prajin, also acting Information and Communication Technology Minister, to discuss how to handle sensitive posts which cause confusion and frustration among the public following the passing of His Majesty King Bhumibol Adulyadej. According to ACM Prajin, the special team, which includes Thai nationals, will be formed to work around the clock to review complaints about sensitive content and video clips. A Thai-language complaint form will also be provided to facilitate the process. ACM Prajin said the team was expected to start working yesterday. "If we have the URLs or clips and the times [the contents were posted] they can proceed right away, but we have to submit the court orders later," he said. However, ACM Prajin said if the government wants access to information about user accounts, which are deemed private, it needs to proceed via other channels due to privacy laws. He said the Foreign Ministry is expected to coordinate with the US government in that matter. He said about 120 lese majeste cases were found last Wednesday and Thursday and that most of the posts were apparently by Thais. He pledged that the government would do its best to handle the issue. ACM Prajin said he has assigned another working team comprising technicians and legal experts to consult with Line, a popular chat application, and Facebook on the matter. The government has called on people to behave respectfully and refrain from posting "inappropriate content" online while the country mourns the passing of His Majesty. The warning comes after several incidents in which crowds gathered in some provinces to accuse individuals of posting inappropriate content about the passing of the King. Five people have been arrested on lese majeste charges since his Majesty the King's passing, deputy national police chief Srivara Ransibrahmanakul said yesterday. Most concerned messages posted online which breach Section 112 of the Criminal Code, better known as the lese majeste law, he said. No further details of who had been arrested or where were available.

Google, on the other hand, is regularly praised for its powerful knowledge graph and accuracy. You probably know that the search company’s exciting new feature, Assistant, recently made its debut on the new Pixel smartphones. With that in mind, YouTuber Marques Brownlee took it upon himself to pit the Pixel’s Assistant against the iPhone’s Siri in a cool side-by-side video comparison. Let the battle of the smartphone voice assistants begin! In the video below, Brownlee activates Google Assistant and Siri at the same time, then asks them the same questions and follow-ups to see how each one responds. Some notable observations: Both assistants successfully accomplished simple tasks like opening apps, setting appointments and timers, checking the weather and more Siri couldn’t answer a follow-up question about Obama’s height Assistant didn’t know if the Los Angeles Clippers won the latest game Siri didn’t know who won the Super Bowl and the team’s current quarterback Google Assistant can’t recognize songs yet And here’s the video. Brownlee felt Assistant was more conversational, understood context better, sounded less robotic and had more personality to it that Siri. Siri could handle contextual questions in multiple queries, but she’s not quite up there on the level of Assistant. On the other hand, Brownleee said Siri’s responses complete with images, charts and other visuals were ultimately more useful to him than Assistant’s spoken information. Many Pixel reviewers lavished praise on Assistant, but not The New York Times’s Brian X. Chen who called the built-in artificially intelligent virtual assistant “still fairly dumb.” Of course, as Google’s artificial intelligence gets smarter, the Assistant will become more helpful—but you could say the same thing about Siri, too. Too bad the technology just isn’t there yet for digital personal assistants to become truly useful, fully conversational and proactive. From Michael Nunez’s Pixel review: In fairness nobody has it, and Google’s is better than what’s offered by competitors like Apple’s Siri and Microsoft’s Cortana. The point is that as a whole, smartphone assistants aren’t smart enough to be defining features. They’re gimmicks, and Google unwisely decided to build a phone around one. Or as The Verge’s Dieter Bohn put it,  “Google Assistant is absolutely the smartest of the assistant bunch, but it’s not yet in a class of its own.” Apple seems to have been ramping up hiring for its new machine learning division. Its stealth work on artificial intelligence and machine learning came to light in a recent interview which detailed how these techniques have improved not just Siri’s brain and natural language processing, but also features like the Apple Pencil’s palm rejection or iOS 10’s autocorrect suggestions and the Memories feature in Photos.

I liked how he commented that SIRI was less conversational because she didn’t know how to answer “How tall is he?”, but I don’t think that was the issue (especially since she later answered several contextual questions). The real issue was that she didn’t know who the president of the US was and had to look that up on wikipedia (which I though was hilarious and a definite point for Google). Second thing I noticed was his example at the end about looking up photos of cats taken at his house in the last week. That’s actually something SIRI does too (just tried in in fact). Apparently SIRI just assumes that if you’re asking her you probably want her to find something you don’t already have whereas google defaults to showing you your stuff first. All in all I was actually impressed. I don’t use SIRI a lot and kind of expected it to be a one sided fight for Google but it was far more even than I thought. I’m impressed. I think the point about Google’s reading of content to you was also a valid one in that hearing it is probably more useful as the point of hands free is to not have to interact with the screen. Rowan09 Great review indeed. I asked Siri who is the president of the United States and it told me. You have to be specific with Siri just like a woman. Lol. If I ask “tell me the weather” it tells me but if i just ask “what’s the weather today” it will display the results. When it comes to GUI Siri has it by far. I agree from the praise on the web over assistant I really wasn’t as impressed as they made it seem. It’s great but not as great as the web is making it out to be. Jayy It didn’t work for me. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/95bc66cf35de94fbbf19638eba6b0e59b11e91dad602dff096474dd449713068.png Rowan09 I know tried it once and it showed the card and told me then the second time it gave me what you posted. When I asked “what’s the name of the president of the United States” it gave the answer. Different questions give totally different answers, Apple need to fix this. Jayy Yeah, I tried it saying “What’s the name…” And it worked. I just personally feel that card should’ve appeared no matter how it was phrased. Edit: Apple should have purchased ViV Rowan09 I agree PhoneTechJay Why does it matter, didn’t it take the same amount of time to get the answer? Jayy Not necessarily. PhoneTechJay What are we talking, milliseconds or seconds.. seriously.. Agneev Mukherjee Yes. They should’ve bought ViV. Agneev Mukherjee I hate to break it, maybe because of your jailbreak!? Jayy Possibly. Agneev Mukherjee Still you’re lucky to be jailbroken, I get up every morning and the first thing I do is Google jailbreak for iOS 10… Jayy Ah man, I know it’s not what you want to hear but I’m not on iOS 10 because of you. When iOS 10 first released I was actually going to give up my jailbreak for it then saw your comments, and thought about all the stuff I’d miss! Agneev Mukherjee I’m glad you stayed jailbroken. leart it worked for me https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/863e7de00b6bdcf9ddae8448322794d963ceefbb971120cf54cab8a242fdfa2d.jpg Jayy It would seem that iOS 4,5,6 or whatever version you’re using is smarter than iOS 9 lol p.s I miss that old Siri mic leart ios 6, no siri before ios 5.. the graphic is just amazing… obsolete but beautiful.. lol https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/85d2325dea6917696ec3a02d7df32ecde6cfd8a33fa68ee09970ab3e2d780a05.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/85d2325dea6917696ec3a02d7df32ecde6cfd8a33fa68ee09970ab3e2d780a05.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/85d2325dea6917696ec3a02d7df32ecde6cfd8a33fa68ee09970ab3e2d780a05.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/85d2325dea6917696ec3a02d7df32ecde6cfd8a33fa68ee09970ab3e2d780a05.jpg Jayy Lol yeah you are absolutely correct, I couldn’t remember because I had to manually put Siri on my iPhone 4 through jailbreaking. And yes the UI was nice! Impreza Given Google trawls every inch of your web activity, Assistant is bound to always have an overall advantage to a degree. From memory Soundhound had the most impressive demo of an assistant I ever heard/saw. I think it was Soundhound here on iDB. Rowan09 Great review. People said Google was light years ago but I would disagree, it’s great in certain ways and vice versa. Andrieux Querido If you think siri is dumb, you didn’t see it in another languages yet. Siri in Portuguese Brazil. is really dumb. Plus old voice. Shame on you Apple. YaBoyLilMayo U sound hurt zebonaut Apple needs to get to work on Siri; make it smarter; more conversational; with a touch of personality. So when you ask; whats the weather ; it should add “its raining; you might want to take an umbrella;” or if its sunny; “you can leave your jacket behind today” because it knows yesterday was cold…. Bill Google talks way too much. Makes me wanna pull a Hillary on an Android phone. (destroy it with a hammer…) John The most frustrating thing for me though, is the fact there’s so much for America and very little for people outside (for example, I would love to see sports scores and other sport statistics hard baked in to Siri for our two biggest football codes–AFL and NRL) Xee Why is IDB not covering the slow memory (in 32Gb models) and slow modem chips in certain models (depends on region sold/model number of iPhone) of iPhone 7!? Dave Kurt I wish they had demonstrated actual useful real world implications; controlling smart appliances, third party integration and hands-free control.

X Close Regional Home > News > Regional < Back to SMG 45 Sunday, 23 October 2016 Google to remove content with royal insults BANGKOK: Thailand’s government met with representatives from Internet giant Google, amid growing calls from Thai hardline royalists to bring those who insult the monarchy to justice. King Bhumibol Adulyadej’s death on Oct 13 has thrown the country of 67 million into mourning. It has also led to the rise of ultra-royalist vigilante groups that say they will punish anyone perceived to have insulted the monarchy during a highly sensitive time for Thailand. Deputy Prime Minister Prajin Juntong said he met with Google representatives here on Friday. Google affirmed in the meeting that it would continue to help the government remove content from YouTube, a Google subsidiary, that it deemed offensive, he said. “If any website is inappropriate, they said to get in touch with them and inform them of the URL and the time the content was found,” Prajin told reporters. That conforms with Google’s practice around the world, Alphbet Inc’s Google said. “We have always had clear and consistent policies for removal requests and we continue to operate in line with those policies,” a Google spokesman in California said on Friday. — Reuters Tags / Keywords: thai insults You May Be Interested Man rescued after threatening for third time to jump from bridge Traffic cop commended for calm after woman hurls abuse South Korean mystics claim presidential scandal has tarnished their reputation Where are you on the journey to financial freedom?

Thailand has some of the strictest laws in the world on speech critical or insulting of its monarchy. All reported incidents of insulting comments must be investigated by police and violators are subject 15 years in prison if convicted. That sentiment has only increased since Thailand's long-serving and widely beloved King Bhumibol Adulyadej died on Oct. 13. Since then, government officials said they have located more than 100 items online they said are defamatory of Bhumibol and petitioned Google to remove the items from its search registry, effectively making them impossible to find online using the world's most popular Internet search engine. As it has in the past, Google told the Thai government it would review the material in question and see whether it meets the Thai legal standard for insulting the monarchy. Google has delisted some 1,300 items over the last several years at the request of the Thai government, though in some instances it has determined the content does not meet its internal standard for removing it from the search registry. "We have always had clear and consistent policies for removal requests from governments around the world and we continue to operate in line with those policies," a Google spokesperson told the Australian Broadcasting Corp. Google only delists the items from searches done within Thailand. The items remain accessible to Google users anywhere else in the world, the company said.

We’ve just learned, thanks to a report from the Pew Research Center, that more than 40 percent of Americans find news on Facebook. That’s probably not surprising given Facebook’s huge user base, but it draws attention to the “trending news” features the social media giant offers, and reminds us that these continue to be a cause of controversy. Glance at your Facebook page and you’ll see trending topics in the top right corner. Back in May we learned through a site called Gizmodo that Facebook was using so-called “news curators” – people contracted by Facebook who chose the topics that would appear on the page. Facebook clearly had plans to become, among other things, a digital newspaper, but charges of bias led the company to fire its curators and use computer algorithms to select trending topics. Unfortunately, that move hasn’t solved the problem. Facebook is getting a reputation for trending stories that, upon closer examination, turn out to be bogus, or in some cases link to “news” in the form of nothing more than press releases. The site personalizes trends for each user, but the appearance of phony stories on everything from the September 11 attacks to the employment status of Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly has tarnished its image. The size of Facebook’s user base makes it a likely target for disinformation. The entire model of social media is to cluster people into categories, a fact made lamentably obvious when you see like-minded politicos swarming around a topic and echoing each other’s thoughts. These are personalized news feeds but they encourage an “us vs. them” mentality that discourages objectivity. All of this makes Facebook’s trending news stories an important thing to get right. News algorithms are going to get much better, but right now we’re still learning what they can do, and Facebook is hardly alone in its travails. I use Google Now a lot on my smartphone, letting it learn my interests and send me stories I can use in my writing. I’m continually startled when, having expressed my interest in astrophysics, I occasionally receive lurid tales of alien cities uncovered by our Mars rovers and hostile UFOs buzzing the International Space Station. Surely we can do better than this. Now I see that Google is going to add a fact-check feature to its Google News service (news.google.com), which pulls in stories from a wide variety of sources. The plan is to offer fact-based context with the help of a product called ClaimReview. Users will theoretically be able to check factual content in major stories as they break, drawing on labels that describe news content and allow Google to identify its sources. We’ll see how this works, but as I read it, content creators will be the ones to add fact-check tags to their posts, so we may wind up with a two-tier news presentation (at least on Google News) in which posts that have no fact-check capability become less trusted than those that do. This puts the onus on Google to keep an eye on content creators to make sure that tags are not being used inaccurately. We should start seeing the process in action on Google News soon. In my view, the best fix for bogus information isn’t new algorithms but a habit of critical thinking on the part of readers, who must make intelligent choices in what they read and trust. The Internet demands a digital literacy that compels users to weigh news sources and follow up controversial claims with supporting material. This new literacy includes honing our search skills to become fact-checkers rather than true believers whenever dubious claims are presented. But especially in election season, we live in an environment so fast-paced that bogus stories just disappear in the next onslaught of material before they are truly vetted. Yes, computer algorithms are going to get better. But the most important factor in getting accurate news is a skeptical reader who keeps asking questions, knowing how dangerous naive credulity can be. Paul A.

King Bhumibol Adulyadej's death earlier this month has thrown the country's 67 million people into mourning. It has also led to the rise of ultra-royalist vigilante groups who say they will punish anyone perceived to have insulted the monarchy during a highly sensitive time for Thailand. Deputy Prime Minister Prajin Juntong said he met Google representatives in Bangkok on Friday.  Thailand's government met representatives from Internet giant Google, amid growing calls from Thai hardline royalists to bring those who insult the monarchy to justice  Mourners gather outside of the Grand Palace to sing for a recording of the royal anthem in honour of Thailand's late King Bhumibol Adulyadej, in Bangkok A huge crowd of mourners gathered on Saturday outside Bangkok's Grand Palace to sing the royal anthem in honour of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died after seven decades on the throne 'If any website is inappropriate they said to get in touch with them and inform them of the URL and the time the content was found,' Prajin told reporters. That conforms with Google's practice around the world, Alphabet Inc's Google says. 'We have always had clear and consistent policies for removal requests from governments around the world and we continue to operate in line with those policies,' a Google spokesperson in California told Reuters on Friday. 'When we are notified of content that is illegal through official processes, we will restrict it in the country where it's illegal after a thorough review.'  Thailand's military government said on Tuesday it was tracking people suspected of insulting the monarchy following the king's death and would ask other countries to extradite them. Some critics of the monarchy living abroad have been named and shamed in Thai language web forums. Outside the world of the web, some Thais who have chosen not to wear black, the official colour of mourning, have been publicly jeered at. Among the mourners was the new King in waiting - Thailand's Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn People dressed in black travelled by bus, boat and on foot to Sanam Luang, a tree-lined open space that has been used for royal cremations outside the river-side Grand Palace, bringing the area to gridlock well before the singing Thailand's military government has tried to seek tighter censorship of social media from Facebook, Google and Japan-based instant messenger service LINE since it came to power in 2014 following a coup it said was necessary to restore peace to the country following months of unrest. Thailand's royal insult law, known as Article 112 in the criminal code, makes it a crime to insult the king, queen, heir or regent. Those who are found guilty face up to 15 years in prison. The law has curtailed public discussion about the monarchy's role and its future following the death of King Bhumibol who ruled for seven decades and was seen as a unifying figure. Since taking power in 2014, the junta, known officially as the National Council for Peace and Order, has taken a tough stance on dissenters. It has come under strong criticism from the international community for lengthy and unprecedented prison sentences handed down by military courts against civilians for violating the lese-majeste law since the junta took power. The military government has repeatedly rejected accusations of rights violations.  The announcement comes on the day that a huge crowd of mourners gathered on Saturday outside Bangkok's Grand Palace to sing the royal anthem in honour of King Bhumibol Adulyadej, who died after seven decades on the throne. The government has declared a year of mourning for the 88-year old king, who was seen as a father figure for generations of people, and, though a constitutional monarch, a calming influence over the country's often turbulent politics. People dressed in black travelled by bus, boat and on foot to Sanam Luang, a tree-lined open space that has been used for royal cremations outside the river-side Grand Palace, bringing the area to gridlock well before the singing. Police said more than 150,000 were in Sanam Luang and side streets with more people expected through the day.  The royal anthem, known as Sansoen Phra Barami, is played before the screening of every cinema show in Thailand, when the audience stands to honour the king as pictures of his life and work are shown on the screen RELATED ARTICLES Previous 1 2 Next 'Do you want to die here?': Rise of vigilante mobs in...

Share this article Share The royal anthem, known as Sansoen Phra Barami, is played before the screening of every cinema show in Thailand, when the audience stands to honour the king as pictures of his life and work are shown on the screen. Saturday's singing was recorded for use in cinemas, organisers said. 'Since he went to heaven we want all Thais to demonstrate their love and sing this song to show before film screenings,' Prince Chatri Chalerm Yukol, a movie director in charge of the filming of the singing, told reporters. Since the king died, people from across Thailand have flocked to the gilded Grand Palace to pay homage to the only king most of them have ever known, who is lying in state there.

'I wanted to be here to pay respects to His Majesty,' said Haysri Watanakulpipat, 47, who said she drove overnight from the eastern province of Prachinburi. The military government has not set a date for the royal cremation but it is expected in about a year. The government has said Crown Prince Maha Vajiralongkorn will ascend the thrown soon but he had requested that his succession be delayed for an unspecified period, so he can grieve with the people. The government has moved to quash uncertainty surrounding the succession and to reassure the country that the king's death will not derail plans for a return to democratic rule, which include a general election in late 2017. It has stressed business and government should carry on as normal and tourism should not be affected. Buddhist monks have been chanting prayers beside his coffin in an imposing throne hall, and they will chant for 100 days as part of the funeral rites The royal anthem was the national anthem of what was then Siam until 1932, when young army officers and bureaucrats staged a coup to end absolute monarchy Police said they expected more people at Sanam Luang through the day. 'There are more than 150,000 people here already but it could easily rise to 250,000 by the evening,' Thai deputy police spokesman Major General Songpol Wattanachai said. The Grand Palace is a former royal residence that is used only on ceremonial occasions.

With built-in artificial intelligence and a beautiful design, the Google Pixel is the newest alternative to the iPhone By Rob Waugh Event for The Mail on Sunday Published: 18:02 EST, 22 October 2016 | Updated: 19:20 EST, 23 October 2016 e-mail 25 shares 53 View comments Google Pixel £599, madebygoogle.com Rating: The last big smartphone I recommended was Samsung’s Galaxy Note 7, which turned out to be a bomb that runs Android. After the device was discovered to be so dangerous many airlines have banned it, I’m faintly grateful that mine didn’t blow up during the week I kept it in my trouser pocket. Regardless, I’m still withdrawing my five-star rating. So what should the thinking man who doesn’t fancy becoming a human fireball buy instead?  Google’s Android ‘own brand’ Pixel phones are a new option in smartphones  Big, powerful and with a few extra techno-tricks, the Google Pixel is pitched as the latest object of desire for those of us who would rather have root-canal surgery than be seen with an Apple iPhone Google’s Android ‘own brand’ Pixel phones are a new option. Big, powerful and with a few extra techno-tricks, they’re pitched as the latest object of desire for those of us who would rather have root-canal surgery than be seen with an Apple iPhone.

It’s so good it’s a chilling reminder of how predictable you really are. So is it a worthy Google phone? For want of a better word, Pixel certainly feels ‘Googly’, in that it bombards you with information all day long. It’s also extremely powerful – and probably the best Android mobile out there at present.  Swipe left and there’s a screen of ‘predictive’ stuff that Google thinks you will like, from news stories to reminders. It’s so good it’s a chilling reminder of how predictable you really are It has a superb camera and a screen so sharp the type can go to tiny font sizes, where it’s more like browsing the internet on a PC. God only knows what this new phone is doing to my eyes. There are neat touches to the design, too. The fingerprint sensor to unlock it is on the back, so you can lift and unlock it seamlessly.  It doesn’t have the gleaming, spaceship-esque curves of Samsung’s Note, though – but then it doesn’t explode like it’s been hit by a photon torpedo, either.   Read more: ma de by go og le Share or comment on this article e-mail 25 shares Bing Site Web Enter search term: Search Like DailyMail Follow MailOnline Follow DailyMail +1 DailyMail     DON'T MISS It's getting hot in here!

By Rick Delgado Published 4 weeks ago 12 Comments Tweet Failure. Disaster. Flop. These are just a few of the words used to describe Google’s foray into wearable and augmented reality technology known as Google Glass. When the first videos of Google Glass were released to the public, they sparked the imaginations of millions. Many began to dream up fascinating new applications for this innovative technology. Just think of how it would impact businesses! How would our everyday lives change with this powerful device going with us wherever we went? The possibilities were staggering, and a revolutionary change in how the world works appeared to be right around the corner. As we now know, Google Glass is little more than a footnote. From the way most tech blogs describe it, Google’s amazing new device failed to live up to expectations. It never caught on with businesses or the public at large, and the result was a disaster the likes of which Google isn’t familiar with. In fact, many websites are urging companies pushing similar devices to do everything they can to avoid Google Glass’s mistakes. If there’s one thing to learn from the Google Glass phenomenon, it’s that Google struck out with this attempt. But could the popular perception of Google Glass be missing the point? It turns out that many people may have gotten the wrong idea of what Google was trying to do with its Glass product. A combination of mistaken media stories, common misperceptions, and poor communication have likely contributed to the idea that Google Glass was a failure of Betamax proportions. The tide may be turning on opinion regarding Google’s wearable attempt, and history may be a little kinder toward those strange looking glasses tech geeks were wearing for a time. This noticeable shift in opinion over the Google Glass has in part been driven by a push to understand what Google was trying to accomplish with it in the first place. Many of the shortcomings and criticisms people lobbed at Google Glass can actually be answered once you know that what we saw from the product was really only Google’s Explorer program. Yes, Google Glass was expensive, thus severely limiting the number of people who could buy it. Yes, its capabilities were not clearly defined and made using it pretty difficult at times. Again, that was all intentional on Google’s part. The tech company wanted the first adopters of Google Glass to be a sort of test audience. They wanted to see what people would do with the product and keep the feedback in mind for future projects. Based off of this research, Google would be able to develop other products. In other words, the Google Glass we saw was more of a trial run, a beta that was never going to be released to mass audiences at all. That’s why we never saw Google Glass released as a standalone product made available in stores. When Google revealed the Explorer project was coming to an end in early 2015, many people quickly proclaimed Google Glass a miserable failure. What they didn’t realize was that Google was transitioning into a new phase -- the enterprise version of the device. This new and improved Google Glass is being made for businesses and industries for them to use, and for now, it is seeing success. From its use in the airplane manufacturing process to helping people with autism, Google Glass has gotten a new lease on life thanks to improvements made through that initial experimental phase. The more it catches on among larger enterprises, the more likely it will eventually be made into a consumer version. Even if Google Glass itself were never to see the light of day again, that doesn’t mean it can be declared a failure. After all, innovation often requires failure along the way, leading to the very breakthroughs that can be deemed giant successes. The technology used in Google Glass is already being put to use in other devices, like smart contact lenses and new camera technologies. If anything, Google Glass can be considered a pioneer in the field of wearable smart devices, a needed trailblazer that paved the way for other gadgets and modular solutions that will play important roles in our lives in the future. While it may be popular to kick Google Glass around, Google may actually have the last laugh. Rick Delgado has been blessed to have had a successful career and has recently taken a step back to pursue his passion of freelance writing. He loves to write about new technologies and ways of keeping ourselves secure in a changing digital landscape. He writes articles for several companies, including Dell. 12 Comments Tweet Got News?

While Google Now was a clever search engine, Google Assistant is Googles first real shot at a virtual engine along the same lines as Siri and Cortana. The question is, how well does it fare against Siri. After all, Google is positioning the Pixel squarely against the Siri and while Apple doesnt quite market Siri as the main draw for the iPhone quite the same way as Google is with the Pixel, it would still make for an interesting comparison. And thats exactly what happened. In a video by Marques Brownlee, aka MKBHD, Siri and Google Assistant were put through the same set of questions. The end results were bit interesting. For what its worth, I personally didnt expect Siri to do as well as it did here, because it has historically not worked super well for me. Both assistants had their ups and downs. Siri voice replies were brief and the focus was on the info cards that it showed, which are super attractive compared to the barebones white cards that Google shows. Siri is also conversational to an extent but that is something that really is the strength of Google Assistant. Google also likes to read out the entire card, which makes it the better choice when you cant actually look at the screen, like while driving or if the phone is not directly in front of you. Google Assistant also, obviously, works a lot better if you use Google services a lot and it uses a lot of info from them to provide better personalized search results. Overall though, they came out super close in this particular comparison. Thats been it. Thanks for reading, and Ill see you in the next article. Peace.

Three takeaways: Google Assistant is more chatty than old Google Voice Search; Google still seems to have an edge over Siri when it comes to follow-up questions based on topic inference (which Siri also does, but not as well); and, Siri holds up well in most types of questions asked by Brownlee. In my daily experience, however, Siri still falls short of basic tasks too often (two examples) and deals with questions inconsistently. There is also, I believe, a perception problem with Siri in that Apple fixes obvious Siri shortcomings too slowly or simply isn't prepared for new types of questions – such as asking how the last presidential debate went. In addition, being able to text with Google Assistant in Allo for iOS has reinforced a longstanding wish of mine – the ability to converse silently with a digital assistant. I hope Siri gets some kind of textual mode or iMessage integration in iOS 11. One note on Brownlee's video: the reason Siri isn't as conversational as Google Assistant is due to the way Brownlee activates Siri. When invoked with the Home button (or by tapping the microphone icon), Siri assumes the user is looking at the screen and provides fewer audio cues, prioritizing visual feedback instead. If Brownlee had opened Siri using "Hey Siri" hands-free activation, Siri would have likely been just as conversational as Google. I prefer Apple's approach here – if I'm holding a phone, it means I can look at the UI, and there's no need to speak detailed results aloud.

You might be the designated ‘tech person’ for your family or friends, making sure granny doesn’t get malware on her dusty Windows XP desktop. Some people need an actual person to help them, and that’s completely okay – that’s where Google Support Services comes in. One of the Pixel’s exclusive features is 24/7 support straight from the Settings app, which even allows support agents to control your device (if you allow them) if needed. Now Google has published the Google Support Services application to the Play Store, to allow updates without new system updates.

By Julia Angwin, ProPublica When Google bought the advertising network DoubleClick in 2007, Google founder Sergey Brin said that privacy would be the company's "number one priority when we contemplate new kinds of advertising products." And, for nearly a decade, Google did in fact keep DoubleClick's massive database of web-browsing records separate by default from the names and other personally identifiable information Google has collected from Gmail and its other login accounts. But this summer, Google quietly erased that last privacy line in the sand – literally crossing out the lines in its privacy policy that promised to keep the two pots of data separate by default. In its place, Google substituted new language that says browsing habits "may be" combined with what the company learns from the use Gmail and other tools. The change is enabled by default for new Google accounts. Existing users were prompted to opt-in to the change this summer. click to enlarge The practical result of the change is that the DoubleClick ads that follow people around on the web may now be customized to them based on your name and other information Google knows about you. It also means that Google could now, if it wished to, build a complete portrait of a user by name, based on everything they write in email, every website they visit and the searches they conduct. The move is a sea change for Google and a further blow to the online ad industry's longstanding contention that web tracking is mostly anonymous. In recent years, Facebook, offline data brokers and others have increasingly sought to combine their troves of web tracking data with people's real names. But until this summer, Google held the line. "The fact that DoubleClick data wasn't being regularly connected to personally identifiable information was a really significant last stand," said Paul Ohm, faculty director of the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law. "It was a border wall between being watched everywhere and maintaining a tiny semblance of privacy," he said. "That wall has just fallen." Google spokeswoman Andrea Faville emailed a statement describing Google's change in privacy policy as an update to adjust to the "smartphone revolution" "We updated our ads system, and the associated user controls, to match the way people use Google today: across many different devices," Faville wrote. She added that the change "is 100% optional–if users do not opt-in to these changes, their Google experience will remain unchanged." (Read Google's entire statement.) Existing Google users were prompted to opt-into the new tracking this summer through a request with titles such as "Some new features for your Google account." The "new features" received little scrutiny at the time. Wired wrote that it "gives you more granular control over how ads work across devices." In a personal tech column, the New York Times also described the change as "new controls for the types of advertisements you see around the web." Connecting web browsing habits to personally identifiable information has long been controversial. Privacy advocates raised a ruckus in 1999 when DoubleClick purchased a data broker that assembled people's names, addresses and offline interests. The merger could have allowed DoubleClick to combine its web browsing information with people's names. After an investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, DoubleClick sold the broker at a loss. In response to the controversy, the nascent online advertising industry formed the Network Advertising Initiative in 2000 to establish ethical codes. The industry promised to provide consumers with notice when their data was being collected, and options to opt out. Most online ad tracking remained essentially anonymous for some time after that. When Google bought DoubleClick in 2007, for instance, the company's privacy policy stated: "DoubleClick's ad-serving technology will be targeted based only on the non-personally-identifiable information." In 2012, Google changed its privacy policy to allow it to share data about users between different Google services - such as Gmail and search. But it kept data from DoubleClick – whose tracking technology is enabled on half of the top 1 million websites – separate. But the era of social networking has ushered in a new wave of identifiable tracking, in which services such as Facebook and Twitter have been able to track logged-in users when they shared an item from another website. Two years ago, Facebook announced that it would track its users by name across the Internet when they visit websites containing Facebook buttons such as "Share" and "Like" – even when users don't click on the button. (Here's how you can opt out of the targeted ads generated by that tracking). Offline data brokers also started to merge their mailing lists with online shoppers. "The marriage of online and offline is the ad targeting of the last 10 years on steroids," said Scott Howe, chief executive of broker firm Acxiom. To opt-out of Google's identified tracking, visit the Activity controls on Google's My Account page, and uncheck the box next to "Include Chrome browsing history and activity from websites and apps that use Google services." You can also delete past activity from your account. ProPublica is a Pulitzer Prize-winning investigative newsroom. Sign up for their newsletter.

Yoni Heisler BGR NewsOctober 22, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share During the original iPhone introduction, Steve Jobs referenced a favorite quote of his from legendary computer scientist Alan Kay: "People who are really serious about software should make their own hardware." This philosophy has formed the bedrock of Apple's business strategy for decades now, save for that brief dark period during the mid-90s when Apple sanctioned an ill-fated Mac clone initiative. Apple's devotion to both software and hardware is part of the reason why the iPhone often outclasses every other smartphones on the market. Undeniably, the ability to fine tune software and hardware to work together seamlessly and efficiently is a huge competitive advantage. That being the case, I've been especially intrigued with the Google Pixel as it marks Google's most serious effort to date to exert strict control over the entirety of the Android experience, from both a software and hardware perspective. We've seen Android flagships before, no doubt, but the Google Pixel was designed by Google from the ground up. DON'T MISS: iPhone 7 Plus vs Google Pixel speed tests: Closer, but Android was still crushed in the end As Google's Rick Osterloh explained to Bloomberg not too long ago, the Google Pixel has Google "managing inventory, building relationships with carriers, sourcing components, making supply chain deals and managing distribution." When reviews of the Google Pixel first started appearing online, I was excited to see if the hype behind the Pixel was real. Because competition is often a necessary component and driver of innovation, I was eager to see if the Google Pixel was a device that could potentially force Apple to step up its game. Most of the Google Pixel reviews I came across where overwhelmingly positive, but I couldn't help but notice that Google's smartphone, in many respects, was being afforded a pass that Apple's iPhone rarely, if ever, receives. Whereas the iPhone is seemingly criticized for minute and arguably petty reasons, some of the Google Pixel's shortcomings were curiously and conveniently glossed over with gusto. Touching on this very point, Rene Ritchie has a great piece up on iMore where he explains how the Pixel was graded by tech reviewers on curiously favorable curve. Remember: Google is a serious player in the smartphone business and the Pixel is priced as a premium handset. Consequently, one would imagine that the Pixel would be held up to the same level of scrutiny as the iPhone. Alas, this was hardly the case. The design of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6s was lambasted mercilessly, and rightfully so given those unsightly antenna lines. In fact, many even brought up said design as evidence that Apple had lost its innovative edge along with its eye for industrial design. Meanwhile, the Google Pixel borrows many design elements from Apple's 2014 iPhone design and nobody bats an eye. It strikes me as odd that in 2016, an iPhone and an Android phone can look extremely similar and evoke completely opposite sentiments from reviewers. The Google Pixel by and large looks like an iPhone but some reviews viewed this as a positive because it was "familiar."  Meanwhile, if Apple doesn't introduce a groundbreaking new iPhone design every year, it's a sign that there's trouble in Cupertino. So, everyone who'd been criticizing Apple and iPhone design immediately called Google out for aping it? Not so much. Well, at least they called Google and Pixel out for the same things they called Apple and iPhone out for? Again, not so much. Bizarrely, some of the subtle improvements Apple incorporated into the iPhone 7 that were immediately categorized as minor or insignificant are completely missing from the Google Pixel. Ritchie writes: Surely they drew the line at Google's 2016 flagship missing optical image stabilization — not just in the regular-size, but in the Plus XL model as well — stereo speakers, and water resistance — things that were pointed to last year as indicators Apple was falling behind? I'm not saying that Apple should be immune from criticism, but it'd be nice if other companies, especially big players like Google, were held to the same set of expectations and standards that Apple has to live up to. Taking a look at any number of Pixel reviews, Google is given a pass for items that the press would absolutely obliterate Apple for. Read More Take Walt Mossberg's review, for example. Calling the Google Pixel "first rate" and the best Android phone he's ever tested, Mossberg quickly mentions that that the device's battery life was disappointing relative to Google's advertised specs. "It also isn’t water resistant, and is exclusive to only a single carrier, Verizon," Mossberg mentions before quickly moving on. And then there are the Google Pixel headphones. Oh wait, the Pixel doesn't come with any headphones. Speaking of earbuds, there’s good and bad news. The good: Google retained the industry-standard 3.5mm headphone jack. The bad: it doesn’t supply any earbuds for a $649 phone. The company says it assumes everyone has many pairs of buds lying around. I wound up using an old Samsung pair. Can you imagine the vitriolic outrage that would have resulted if Apple shipped an iPhone of any model with no headphones? It's also interesting that Google's new AI feature -- Google Assistant -- is being heaped with praise mostly because of its underlying potential. Google Assistant does seem to be a step up from Siri since it can handle contextual queries much more ably, but is it really that compelling of a feature in its current form? Mossberg writes: Here’s a series of questions I asked about the state where I live, without ever saying the state’s name except in the first question. The Assistant answered every question but one with a vocal reply, and answered all quickly and accurately: — What’s the population of Maryland? — Who’s the governor? — What’s the average household income? — What’s the land area? — Show me the state flag. — What’s the biggest county? I’m pretty sure I could have gone on. When I tried this with Siri, it handled the first one nicely, vocally and with a Wikipedia page. It answered the second by displaying an article defining the term governor. That's a nice perk for the Pixel, but is this really a huge selling point? As far as I can tell, the AI that Viv Software showed off is far more impressive. Besides, there are things that Siri can do that Google Assistant can't do quite yet, like reserving an Uber or Lyft. Still, not everyone was a fan of Google Assistant, as evidenced by this review from Michael Nunez of Gizmodo. I was particularly disappointed with Google Assistant because it’s such a promising concept. Google is moving attention away from the search bar more than ever. Instead, the company wants you to “Google” by using the messaging app Allo or voice search in Google Assistant. Ultimately, the Pixel and Pixel XL are gateways for feeding the Google brain more information about yourself. As Google’s AI gets smarter, the Assistant will become more helpful. While some people might find this creepy, I think the idea is exciting, and it’s a letdown that the tech isn’t there yet. In fairness nobody has it, and Google’s is better than what’s offered by competitors like Apple’s Siri and Microsoft’s Cortana. The point is that as a whole, smartphone assistants aren’t smart enough to be defining features. They’re gimmicks, and Google unwisely decided to build a phone around one. Meanwhile, another Pixel review on The Verge was quick to call Google's smartphone a "home run." Almost comically, one of the first few paragraphs reads: The Pixel is not waterproof, which is dumb and annoying. I should also note that a very short fall managed to crack the screen on the smaller Pixel during our review. A sample size of one is obviously too small to say that these devices are less durable than they ought to be, but it's not a great sign. All that said, I think it's great that Google released the Pixel. It's nice to see some solid competition in the premium smartphone space from a company not named Samsung. The Pixel seems like a compelling device, but let's be honest, the grading curve for Android is still a whole lot more lenient than it is for the iPhone.

NBC reported that a senior intelligence official has told the network that the hack “does not appear at this point to be any kind of state-sponsored or directed attack.” It may be that new evidence emerges that leads the U.S. intelligence community to change its opinion and identify a major state as a responsible party. The scarier possibility is that it wasn’t a state that did it. – – – The attack targeted the domain name system The Internet relies on a complicated mix of systems and protocols to work. Friday’s attack targeted one key aspect of the Internet — the domain name system. Every time that your desktop or phone browser asks to load the webpage for, say, http://www.washingtonpost.com, specialized servers need to turn the web address into a series of numbers — the so-called ‘IP address’ to figure out where the request ought to be sent to. The company that was hacked Friday runs part of the domain name system. The hackers sent so many requests to the domain name servers that they were completely overwhelmed. This kind of attack is called a ‘Distributed Denial of Service Attack’ or DDoS attack. It used to be thought of as a relatively unsophisticated instrument, and many forms of DDoS attack can be easily repelled, once the target of the attack realizes what is going on. Both activists (such as many members of the loose ‘Anonymous’ collective) and state actors (looking to silence inconvenient dissidents offshore) have used DDoS attacks in the past. Such attacks led Google to create Project Shield which was intended to deploy Google’s massive resources to protect actors who might otherwise be effectively silenced by nefarious actors. – – – These attacks have escalated Unfortunately, such attacks have escalated dramatically over time. The problem started with unsecured computers. Many people (almost certainly including readers of this article) are bad at keeping their computer operating systems updated, with the result that their computers have been quietly subverted and made part of ‘botnets’ made up of thousands of slaved machines. These computers can then be turned against a target system, repeatedly bombarding it with demands until it is effectively taken off the Internet. Criminals have herded botnets to blackmail the owners of e.g. gambling websites by threatening to keep them offline with DDoS attacks until a ransom is paid. Recently, however, the stakes have escalated yet again. The so-called ‘Internet of Things’ — the many consumer products which are somehow connected to the Internet — has created new opportunities for botnet herders, because these products tend to be badly secured and are usually never updated. Brian Krebs, a prominent writer and consultant on security, has often been targeted by various attacks by the criminals he writes about. Last month, he was hit by a truly massive attack mounted by a botnet of compromised devices. Friday’s attack uses the same ‘Mirai’ system, which was recently released into the wild so that anyone with moderate technical skills can use it to compromise and set up their own network of devices. – – – Anyone could be responsible As Krebs pointed out in a follow-up blogpost, the truly frightening thing is that anyone could be responsible. It used to be that only states had the firepower to mount really dramatic attacks like this. Now, as one of Krebs’s friends puts it, “When it comes to DDoS attacks, nation-states are just another player. so that . . .[t]oday’s reality is that DDoS attacks have become the Great Equalizer between private actors & nation-states.” One shouldn’t push this analogy too far. Other kinds of cyberattack — such as the attack that the United States and Israel reportedly mounted on the Iranian nuclear program — require bespoke skills and customization, and are out of the reach of all but sophisticated nation states. Even so, taking down a large chunk of the Internet, as Friday’s attack apparently did, is well within the grasp of small criminal groups and other ordinary actors. Equally, the fact that this is possible for ordinary actors may provide opportunities for states to undertake nefarious activities without getting the blame. Many of the techniques used to identify the perpetrators of cyberattacks rely on ‘fingerprints’ in the computer code underlying the attack. For example, if you are mounting one attack, it may be cheaper and easier for you to redeploy code that you have already used in others, than to write everything from scratch. This may, in turn, make it easier to identify you. Such identification techniques will be harder to use against DDoS attacks like this one, which deploy code that is widely available, and hence impossible to attribute to another actor. There may be other means of identification (for example, there might be bugs in the source code that could be exploited to pinpoint whoever is running it), but we don’t know for certain. This might tempt states as well as non-state actors to use this system to mount DDoS attacks in the belief that others will likely be blamed. – – – The underlying problem is tough to solve These attacks are likely to continue — and get worse — as long as more devices are released that can be subverted and slaved by botnets. Unfortunately, as another prominent security expert, Bruce Schneier, argues, that’s going to keep on happening. The producers of buggy and insecure cameras, baby monitors and so on have no incentive to improve them, since no one can sue them for the side effects of their carelessness. The users of the products don’t have any reason to care either. Schneier suggests that we might at least begin to address the problem by regulating manufacturers, or by making it possible for the victims of attacks, like Krebs, to sue them. This is, as Schneier certainly knows, unlikely under current political circumstances. The business community has resisted such mandates and rights for decades, and almost certainly still has enough political clout to continue to resist.

McIntyre October 22, 2016 9:25 am EST Print Email Tweet Search tops portal and social media, according to new data about visits to America’s largest websites in September. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google topped the list with 234 million unique visitors for the month, according to comScore. Second on the list is Yahoo! Inc. (NASDAQ: YHOO), which probably will be bought by Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE: VZ). It had 207 million unique visitors last month. Yahoo has the bad fortune that its bread and butter, online display ads, have dropped in price. While native and video ads have replaced this somewhat, Google and Facebook have as much as two-thirds of online ad revenue. According to Bloomberg: Google, the leading Internet search provider, and Facebook, the biggest social network operator, claimed 64 percent of that revenue, according to Pivotal Research analyst Brian Wieser. Google scooped up $30 billion and Facebook gathered $8 billion, while other smaller companies lost market share, the analyst noted. Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB) had 205 million unique visitors. Following that is Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) with 192 million unique visitors. This includes MSN and visits to Microsoft company sites. Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), the online retail company, sits next at 184 million unique visitors. Wal-Mart Stores Inc. (NYSE: WMT) is well down the list in 22nd place, with 93 million unique visitors. It, and the revenue it gets online, show something of the wall that Wal-Mart has to climb. Two media properties are next: CBS Interactive from CBS Corp. (NYSE: CBS) at 168 million and Comcast Corp.’s (NASDAQ: CMCSA) NBCUniversal at 163 million. This includes all visitors to the cable, broadcast and studio sites, and gives some idea of why AT&T Inc. (NYSE: T) would want Time Warner Inc. (NYSE: TWX), the sites of which are broken into pieces. Turner Digital, the largest of them, had unique visitors of 132 million. Behind CBS and Comcast, AOL, a division of Verizon, has 158 million. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) is next at 153 million. Among social media companies, LinkedIn Corp. (NYSE: LNKD) had 124 million, Twitter Inc. (NYSE: TWTR) 113 million and Pinterest 98 million.

Speaking to this point, Walt Mossberg not too long ago penned a widely circulated post lambasting Siri for its frustrating inability to answer layered questions. Siri has undoubtedly come a long ways since its introduction on the iPhone 4s back in 2011, but there's no getting around the fact that Apple's intelligent personal assistant faces increasingly stiff competition not only from Google, but also from Amazon and upstarts like Viv (now a Samsung property). DON'T MISS: Everything we know about Apple’s exciting next-gen MacBook Pro Making blanket comparisons between Siri and Google Assistant tends to be convenient, but it can also be misleading at times. While there are some things that Google Assistant excels at, there are also things that Siri can do that Google Assistant cannot. As a quick example, Google Assistant -- in its current form -- cannot order you an Uber while Siri can. All that said, Marques Brownlee recently posted an interesting video where he puts Apple's latest incarnation of Siri up against Google's vaunted new Google Assistant in a side-by-side competition. For as much praise as Google Assistant has received and for as much flack as Siri tends to receive, the results may surprise you. Google assistant is expectedly more nimble with context-based queries but Siri's answers, when it does have an answer, tend to be more informative. Starting out with some basic queries (i.e wake me up at 7:30 tomorrow morning, what's Tesla's stock price?) both Siri and Google Assistant are up to the task and perform dutifully. About 3 minutes in, Siri shows its first sign of failure. When asked who the president of the United States is, Google Assistant is quick to come up with the answer while Siri throws the query to Bing and lists out a few search results. When Brownlee next asks, "How tall is he?", Google Assistant recognizes that the context of the question is Barack Obama and returns the correct answer. Siri, meanwhile, remains clueless and once again returns Bing search results. However, when straight up asking, "How tall is Barack Obama?", Siri is able to answer quickly. The full video, which is well worth watching, can be viewed below. Siri certainly has tremendous room for improvement, but the gap between the two virtual assistants may not be as wide as you might assume. One interesting tidbit is that Brownlee found Google Assistant to be more personable than Siri, a feature which Siri used to excel at. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JFiu5rfnhzo&feature=youtu.be Highlighting an instance where Siri outperforms Google Assistant, Brownlee at one point asks "Who won the Super Bowl?" While both return the correct answer, Siri's response contains more information as it displays a card with the final score along with a quarter-by-quarter scoring breakdown. siri-vs-google-assistantMore Trending right now: Everything we know about Apple’s exciting next-gen MacBook Pro Leaks show OnePlus is about to release an even faster smartphone Apple discovers that selling smartwatches for $15,000 doesn’t work See the original version of this article on BGR.com Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share What to Read Next Donald Trump is already proving he has no idea what he is in for Quartz iOS 10 Hidden Feature: The Magnifier Yahoo Tech Online freedom hit by pressure on social media, apps AFP New hybrid console takes Nintendo on the go Yahoo Tech How Good Are the Walmart Black Friday TV Deals?

Thailand presses Google over online royal insults BBC News 22-10-2016 © Provided by BBC News Well-wishers hold a picture of Thailand"s King Bhumibol Adulyadej at the Siriraj hospital where he is residing, in Bangkok, Thailand, June 9, 2016. Reuters Thailand is mourning the death of King Bhumibol - who is protected from insult by law Google has agreed to co-operate with the removal of online content insulting Thailand's monarchy, the country's deputy prime minister says. Prajin Juntong said he had met Google representatives to complain about material found using the search engine and on YouTube, a Google subsidiary. Google said it was following its existing policies on content removal. Thais, which have the some of strictest lese majeste laws in the world, are mourning King Bhumibol Adulyadej. Mr Juntong said more than 100 pieces of content insulting to the monarchy have been found on Google services since he died on 13 October. Thailand's lese majeste laws explained Thailand's revered king dies at 88 Chanting banned at World Cup qualifier Thai mourning: What should tourists do? A spokesperson for Google told Reuters news agency that the company was following its guidelines for removal requests. "When we are notified of content that is illegal through official processes, we will restrict it in the country where it's illegal after a thorough review," they said. © Provided by BBC News Google Logo AFP Google receives thousands of takedown requests from law enforcement and governments every year Google periodically publishes data on such requests in what it calls "transparency reports" . In the six months between July and December 2015, it received 33 requests from the government of Thailand to remove content. Those requests covered 1,566 individual content items, 97% of which were cited as "government criticism". Google says it complied with 85% of the Thai government's requests - around 1,300 items - though it did not publish full details on how many items were restricted from viewing within Thailand or removed completely. 'Insult or threat' Article 112 of Thailand's criminal code says anyone who "defames, insults or threatens the king, the queen, the heir-apparent or the regent" will be punished with up to 15 years in prison. This has remained virtually unchanged since the creation of the country's first criminal code in 1908, although the penalty was toughened in 1976. However, there is no definition of what constitutes an insult to the monarchy. Complaints can be filed by anyone and they must always be formally investigated by the police. The details of the charges are rarely made public for fear of repeating the alleged offence.

Home Mail Flickr Tumblr News Sports Finance Celebrity Answers Groups Mobile More Yahoo Search Search 0 Mail Tech Home Follow Us Reviews How To Deals Video Games Pogue Apple How to get Google's Pixel features on your Android phone Kyle Wiggers Digital TrendsOctober 22, 2016 Reblog Share Tweet Pin it Share You’ve undoubtedly seen the news about Google’s new smartphones, the Pixel and Pixel XL. Perhaps you’ve read a review or two. Maybe you’ve already double-checked your bank account and pre-ordered a unit. No matter which anticipatory stage you’ve reached, take comfort in knowing that some of the Pixel’s best features are based in software. Every Pixel admirer with an Android smartphone at his or her disposal can experience most of those features on the smartphone they already own, with a little patience, dedication, and electronic elbow grease. Related: Google’s Pixel is a new, exciting chapter for Android smartphones No unsanctioned procedure is without risk, of course, and that goes double for a device as indispensable as a smartphone. We can’t stress enough: if “APK” (Android’s app file format) and “sideloading” (shorthand for installing apps from unofficial sources) sound like foreign turns of phrase to you, and if you find the the idea of dealing with instability, missing features, and all-around bugginess the slightest bit unappealing, this guide isn’t for you. In the interest of covering our bases, there’s the elephant in the room: modified applications. Our guide links to apps that may or may not have been “messed with,” so to speak, at the code level. We’re taking care to source the files from a reputable website, but we can’t guarantee the apps in question don’t contain malicious or damaging code. Downloader be warned. If none of that’s deterred you and you’re confident in your ability to navigate the technical webs ahead, proceed with caution. Preparing your Android device First things first: you’ll need an Android device running Marshmallow 6.0 or newer. You’ll need to prepare it by (1) installing a freely available file explorer (e.g., ES File Explorer), and (2) permitting the installation of apps from third-party sources. Here’s how to allow the installation of apps from third-party sources: Open your device’s Settings menu. Scroll down and select the entry with the title Security or Lock screen and security. Tick or toggle the Unknown sources option. Press OK on the popup. Pixel Launcher extended-screenshot-2More One of the undisputed highlights of the Pixel’s new software is the Pixel Launcher, a home screen (technically) exclusive to the Pixel and Pixel XL. It’s cut from the same cloth as Google’s previous home screen app, the Google Now Launcher, in that it retains Android’s iconic app drawer, folders, and app shortcuts. But improvements and additions abound: There’s a new search icon and voice shortcut, plus a dynamic widget that reflects the current date and weather. There’s a new wallpaper picker, too, and a Google Calendar icon that matches the day’s date. If all that sounds appealing, good news: installing it is easy enough, but there’s a caveat. Thanks to myriad inter-dependencies, the Pixel Launcher won’t give you access to the Google Assistant, Google’s eponymous intelligent assistant. The Pixel Launcher’s “G” tab normally acts as a shortcut to the Assistant, but it’ll merely open the Google Search app on non-supported devices. Here’s how to install the Pixel Launcher: You’ll need two application files: the Pixel Launcher itself, and another that’ll pull a rotating collection of high-resolution wallpaper images from Google periodically, in the background. Download both using your device’s internet browser. Once both have finished downloading, use the file explorer you downloaded earlier to navigate to your device’s download folder and install the apps in question. After both finish installing, tap your device’s home screen. You’ll see an option to select the Pixel Launcher; tap it. That’s all there is to it! If you tire of the Pixel Launcher, switching back is easy enough. Here’s how: extended-screenshot-2More Read More Open your device’s Settings menu. Scroll down and select the entry with the title Apps. Tap the menu for the Pixel Launcher. Select the Clear defaults button. Tap your device’s home button and select the launcher of your choice. Camera app extended-screenshot-4More Google Camera may be available for compatible devices from the Play Store market, but the Pixel and Pixel XL pack a newer version of the app, v4.2, with features that haven’t quite made it to other phones just yet. There’s an overlay that adds shooting grids in 3×3, 4×4, and Golden Ratio configuration, plus a slider for manual exposure control. That’s not all: there’s also a lock focus option, new animations, and performance improvements across the board. The bleeding-edge Google Camera app doesn’t play as nicely with non-Pixel devices as the Pixel Launcher, unfortunately. Reddit and XDA users have reported success with the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P, but only models that have been updated to Android 7.0 Nougat; the app appears to crash on older Nexus devices, like the Nexus 6, and handsets from other manufacturers. There’s a sliver of a chance it might work on other phones, but for now, it’s likely a Nexus-only affair. If you’re willing to take the plunge, here’s how to install Google Camera v4.2: Download the Google Camera application using your device’s internet browser. After it finishes downloading, install it by navigating to your device’s download folder with your file manager of choice and tapping the Google Camera app. Tap Install. Once the installation finishes, you’ll see an icon for the Google Camera. That’s all there is to it. There’s another annoyance to note: if you’ve installed the Google Camera from the app store, it won’t replace it. Instead, you’ll have two Google Camera icons side-by-side in your app drawer. One workaround involves disabling or uninstalling the original Google Camera, but we recommend against it — put simply, it’s more trouble than it’s worth. Dialer extended-screenshot-3More There’s more to Google’s Pixels than a new home screen and camera app. Indeed, Google’s spruced up the Google Phone application — the dialer — with a cleaner, more intuitive UI. When you’re in a call, the background’s a translucent blue gradient atop your phone’s wallpaper. The in-call buttons have been enlarged, labeled a little more clearly, and moved below now-prominent Caller ID information. Incoming calls are now answered with an upward swipe (previously rightward) and declined with a downward swipe (previously leftward). On launchers that support it (including the Pixel Launcher and Action Launcher), the dialer’s icon lets you create a new contact from the home screen. The dialer, as with the camera, is a little capricious when it comes to compatibility. Users are reporting that it works on the Nexus 5X and 6P, but non-Nexus phones are a shot in the dark. Your mileage may very. Here’s how to install the Pixel dialer: Download the dialer application using your device’s internet browser. After the download completes, navigate to your phone’s download folder using a file browser, and select the Google Phone application. Tap Install. In order to use Google Phone, you’ll have to set it as your default dialer. Here’s how: Open Settings. Select the Apps menu. Tap the Gear icon in the top-right corner. Select Phone app from the list, and choose Phone. Rounded icons Fancy the Pixels’ spiffy rounded icons? You’re not the only one. Luckily, they’re easy to obtain: a crafty developer extracted them, packaged them in a compressed folder, and hosted the whole shebang online. Here’s how to nab ’em: extended-screenshotMore Download the icons using your device’s browser. Navigate to your device’s download folder using a file browser, and then extract the icons from the compressed folder. Install Awesome Icons, a free app from the Play Store. Now you’re ready to begin assigning new icons: Open Awesome Icons, and tap the image icon next to any compatible app. Select the entry under the Icons header, and then tap Picture. That’ll launch the Open from menu. From it, tap your file browser. Navigate to the folder containing the extracted icons, and select the icon that corresponds to the app you chose. At the cropping screen, ensure the selection area includes the entire icon. Hit Crop, then OK. Repeat the process for any remaining icons. The icons aren’t perfect, granted. They’ll only appear on your home screen, not your app drawer, and the list of supported apps is far from exhaustive, but for an unofficial fix, it ain’t bad. Google Assistant google-allo-hands-onMore There’s a way to get the Google Assistant on most modern Android devices, and it’s hardly a secret: Allo, Google’s new text messaging app. The Assistant’s accessible in a dedicated tab within the app, or by typing in “@google” before a query. We reviewed the Assistant thoroughly a few weeks back, but our consensus bears repeating: the Assistant’s really darn cool. It can look for restaurants nearby, pull up personal photos, run searches, look at flights, and find nearby events. It can provide quick access to a restaurant’s phone number and menu. It can play games like tic-tac-toe. And it can give you alerts at specific times of the day. Sadly, Google doesn’t intend to bring the Assistant to non-Pixel devices anytime soon. But take comfort in the fact that enterprising developers are actively attempting to shoehorn the Assistant into unsupported devices. Someday soon, you may not need a Pixel or Pixel XL to have Google’s conversational AI at your fingertips. Wallpapers google_wallpapers_phone-0More If you’re enamored by the incredible home screen wallpapers that ship with the Pixel and Pixel XL, good news: Google’s made it relatively easy to acquire something close to them. The firm’s Wallpaper app for Android provides a window into an extraordinary range of illustrations, photography, animations, and images optimized for your phone’s home screen, and they run the gamut in terms of content — you can expect subjects from solar phenomena to architectural hot spots. Perhaps best of all, the app packs an option to enable rotating Wallpapers: you can have the app select cycle through a gallery of pictures, if you so choose. Obtaining the Wallpapers app is easy enough. It’s available for download from the Google Play Store, and it’s compatible with Android devices running Android 4.1 and above.

 How Google embarrassed Apple Steve Kovach Oct. 22, 2016, 9:30 AM 189,277 facebook linkedin twitter email print Google CEO Sundar Pichai. Reuters/Beck Diefenbach This week didn't look good for Apple. Google's new Pixel phone launched to positive reviews, largely because of the phone's new digital helper called Google Assistant. As I wrote in my review of the new Google Pixel, it’s relatively easy to make a high-end smartphone these days. The real challenge is lighting it up with unique software that helps you do more. And the new Google Assistant accomplishes just that. Right out of the gate, Assistant is noticeably smarter and more capable than Siri, a stark embarrassment for Apple, which had a five-year head start on Google. AI and voice control are considered to be the next big step in how we compute (just look at the early success of the Amazon Echo), and Google has already pulled ahead. Assistant is so good because it taps into Google’s vast network of products and culls them together into a single, all-knowing app. The more Google services like Calendar, Photos, and Gmail you use, the smarter Assistant gets. It’s also better at answering questions than the competition, thanks to its ability to tap into Google’s vast Knowledge Graph and deliver the single answer to the question you ask. Google Assistant has so many impressive skills that it’s impossible to list them all now. I’m still discovering new capabilities after almost two weeks with the Pixel. Here’s how I put it in my review: I haven't even come close to unlocking everything Assistant can do, but I was routinely surprised whenever I dreamed up something new to ask. Pull up the photos I took from my latest trip to San Francisco. Done. Give me the fastest route home. Done. Remind me to chat with my boss when I get to work tomorrow. Done. Play that Calvin Harris and Rihanna song. Done. Then there's the ability to tap into Google's vast knowledge of the web and deliver answers to the questions you ask. What time is the next presidential debate? Did the Jets win? Are there any good ramen restaurants near me, and can I get a reservation? I could go on and on, but you probably get the idea. Google has tens of billions of answers logged into its system, and it can pull even more from trusted sources like Wikipedia if it's stumped. It's almost always able to get you what you're looking for, though I did experience some rare cases in which it would pull up a standard list of Google search results. The shame here is that Siri had a five-year head start on Google Assistant, and Apple totally blew it. Siri struggles to answer even the simplest of queries. It wasn’t until two tech columnists recently pointed out those flaws that Siri quickly learned the answers to some of the questions they were griping about. Curious! The reality is Apple can’t be reactive and improve Siri every time someone blogs about its flaws.  Luckily, the pieces are in place, as Apple has acquired a series of AI and machine learning companies over the last year or so. Most notably, it bought the UK-based startup Vocal IQ, which as I reported earlier this year had technology that allowed users to control a phone or computer completely with voice. That also jibes with Apple’s near-term goal to make Siri fully capable of controlling the iPhone within the next few years, as Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman reported. But for now, Google Assistant is clearly in the lead, and that lead will only get wider as more people use it and increases its intelligence.

BANGKOK – Thailand’s Deputy Prime Minister Prajin Juntong met with representatives from Internet giant Google, amid growing calls from Thai hardline royalists to bring those who insult the monarchy to justice, as many Thais look with uncertainty to a future without their revered king. King Bhumibol Adulyadej’s passing on Oct. 13 has thrown the country of 67 million into mourning. It has also led to the rise of ultra-royalist vigilante groups who say they will punish anyone perceived to have insulted the monarchy during a highly sensitive time for Thailand. Deputy Prime Minister Prajin Juntong said he met with Google representatives in Bangkok on Friday . Google affirmed in the meeting with the Deputy PM that it would continue to help the government remove content from YouTube, a Google subsidiary, that it deemed offensive, he said. “If any website is inappropriate they said to get in touch with them and inform them of the URL and the time the content was found,” Prajin told reporters. That conforms with Google’s practice around the world, Alphabet Inc’s Google says. “We have always had clear and consistent policies for removal requests from governments around the world and we continue to operate in line with those policies,” a Google spokesperson in California told Reuters on Friday. “When we are notified of content that is illegal through official processes, we will restrict it in the country where it’s illegal after a thorough review.” NAMED AND SHAMED Thailand’s military government said on Tuesday it was tracking people suspected of insulting the monarchy following the king’s death and would ask other countries to extradite them. Some critics of the monarchy living abroad have been named and shamed in Thai language web forums. Outside the world of the web, some Thais who have chosen not to wear black, the official color of mourning, have been publicly jeered at. Thailand’s military government has tried to seek tighter censorship of social media from Facebook, Google and Japan-based instant messenger service LINE since it came to power in 2014 following a coup it said was necessary to restore peace to the country following months of unrest. Thailand’s royal insult law, known as Article 112 in the criminal code, makes it a crime to insult the king, queen, heir or regent. Those who are found guilty face up to 15 years in prison. The law has curtailed public discussion about the monarchy’s role and its future following the death of King Bhumibol who ruled for seven decades and was seen as a unifying figure. Since taking power in 2014, the junta, known officially as the National Council for Peace and Order, has taken a tough stance on dissenters. It has come under strong criticism from the international community for lengthy and unprecedented prison sentences handed down by military courts against civilians for violating the lese-majeste law since the junta took power. The military government has repeatedly rejected accusations of rights violations.

Answer: Because if feels weird to be on camera all day. Now, a new generation of video chat apps offers flexible new ways to maintain always-ready video chat sessions without making people feel like they're always on display. The secret is to be "always on" and available, but not "always live." Always-on video chat is perfect for digital nomads like me, as well as work-from-home telecommuters. It removes a sense of isolation, creates opportunity for break-room style serendipitous conversation and breaks down the formality of scheduling video chat sessions. Always-on video chat is also great for, well, everybody! We all have family and friends who live or work elsewhere. It's nice to just drop in on people and spend time with them. Theoretically, always-on group video chat should feel like hanging out with friends or co-workers in the same physical room. But it doesn't. Speaking of hanging out Five years ago, Google invented a new kind of group video chat called Hangouts and built it into its social network, Google+. I wrote in this space about a new concept for group video chat, which I called "ambient Hangouts." The column hit just before Christmas, and I suggested ambient Hangouts as a way to bring far-flung families together for the holidays. Even today, a few people still use Google Hangouts for always-live group video chat sessions. Trouble is, with always-live video, the camera is on you all day, and that can be uncomfortable. Also, when a single user is the only Hangouts participant for a while, Google terminates the session. The 'portal' idea Another approach to always-on video connections is the "portal." By setting up a videoconference session on a tablet, monitor or big-screen TV and leaving it running all day, always-live, remote offices can quickly communicate by walking up to the screen and instantly begin talking. Foursquare does this internally to connect its East- and West-Coast offices. Others have cobbled together their own solutions using Apple's Facetime or Microsoft's Skype. One company built an app in 2012 called Perch, which invited users to mount an iPad in two different locations. The app maintained an always-on video connection, which was activated using motion- and face-detection for always-on video, or it could be used optionally for always-on video connections. The split for Perch usage was 50% always-on, and 50% always-live. Unfortunately, Perch closed its doors last month. Perch CEO Danny Robinson told me that that the Perch "idea, market, customers, revenue were all moving up and to the right," but that friction between new, potential investors and the board led to the collapse of the startup. The good news is that Robinson also said he has 12 parties interested in a possible acquisition, so Perch might return to the market. When people can come and go as they please Remember Meerkat? The app last year popularized live-streaming video, a space now dominated by Facebook Live and Twitter's Periscope. This kind of live streaming involves one person streaming to an audience -- it's a one-way stream, although viewers can comment. Meerkat depended on Twitter for the sharing and discovery of live streams, and the use of Twitter enabled the app to go viral in its first month. But after Twitter bought Periscope, Meerkat's access to the Twitter "social graph" was cut off. Ultimately, Meerkat couldn't compete with Twitter's own alternative given Twitter's exclusivity on the network. The Meerkat app was removed last month and the service was shut down on Oct. 4. Meerkat was created by a startup called Life On Air. After the demise of Meerkat, the company got to work on a free iOS and Android app called Houseparty. Unlike Meerkat, Houseparty is for video chat -- few-to-few chat, rather than one-to-many streaming. In an unusual move, Life On Air published Houseparty under a fake name. Its developer was the non-existent "Alexander Herzick," and it operated under the radar for 10 months. The reason was to enable the company to "experiment and iterate without any hype," according to co-founder and COO Sima Sistani. Houseparty is aimed at everyone, but the user base skews young. Some 60% of Houseparty users are under the age of 24, according to Sistani. (The app's logo is one of those red plastic cups that frat houses use for playing beer pong, so it's not aimed at enterprises.) Houseparty is available via the company's iOS app. An Android version is in beta but available to the public on the Play Store. The idea behind Houseparty is that you can create a video space that's always "there," and family and friends can come and go as they please. This approach makes video conversations more casual and instant -- the same way co-workers would drop in on your cubicle for a quick chat, or friends might swing by to say hi. Instead of "arranging a call" or interrupting someone while they're in the middle of something, you simply create an open invitation for any number of people, then tell the app you're "Here." Set it and forget it. When other invited users are available, they can pop in for a group chat. As new users join, each window gets smaller to make room for the additional participants. With a few people on a single call, it creates a kind of Brady Bunch effect, with video windows tiled all over the screen. The effect works whether in landscape or portrait mode, even when some participants hold their phone one way and others hold it the other. It doesn't matter. Meerkat was declared a runaway success when it gained 300,000 users. Houseparty already has more than a million users, according to Sistani. Houseparty solves the need to either schedule a video chat, or interrupt people when they're busy. By setting up an open invitation to chat with all your family and friends, you can enjoy spontaneous, casual interaction whenever it's convenient. When the team is always 'there,' but with instant video chat on demand Another approach comes from a new application called Sneek. Think of Sneek as a kind of desktop Houseparty for professionals, an always-on video chat application for teams. A software company called Analog Republic launched the service three weeks ago. The company has 12 employees scattered all over the U.K. and U.S. and needed a solution for staying connected all day, according to co-founder Del Currie. So they built it for themselves and liked it so much they launched a public version. Here's how it works: Each team member is represented by a photo, which their webcam snaps at a user-determined interval -- either every minute or every five minutes. You can also pose for and snap a static picture manually. By choosing pixelated mode, your photo will be pixelated for a little more privacy. You can set a status message, which is displayed under your face. To chat with anyone or everyone, a simple click on a face or several faces instantly launches a video chat with whoever was clicked on. You can chat in Brady Bunch mode, or go fullscreen. The full-screen mode works just like Google Hangouts. Whoever's talking goes fullscreen, but you can override this by clicking on a person's face to see only that one person. Users set availability. So if you're away, the camera turns off. If you're at your desk but too busy to chat on video, team members can see your picture, but can't instantly start video chat. When talking is urgent but a team member is busy, you can click on their photo, which plays a knocking sound, and they can answer if they choose. You can also use a couple of Slack commands to launch or invite others to Sneek, and also share other users' profile snaps. Sneek provides a sense of presence for the team, and the kind of immediacy with communication that you'd have working together in the same office, but with multi-layered options for privacy and to eliminate the weirdness of being on live video all day. Sneek operates on a freemium model, but the free version doesn't offer video chat. You can use the "presence" features, including the photo snaps and status messages, but then you'd need to establish a video chat using Skype or some other software. The Pro version costs $10 per month, or $108 per year, and gives you the full, instant-video chat feature I mentioned. Sneek offers a free, 14-day trial, so you can try the Pro version for two weeks. Sneak works in a Chrome browser, or in a downloadable desktop application, available on OS X and Windows. A Linux version is promised "soon." The company is also planning an iOS version in early 2017 and an Android version after that, according to Currie. Video chat and videoconferencing is a great medium. Doing it the old way was stilted, awkward and formal, and always-live video chat felt intrusive. With Houseparty and Sneek, you can break down the walls of formality and create a sense of "presence," without feeling like you're in the spotlight all day.

As ever, many thanks for reading. Bye! Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.25pm EDT 14:25 Saracens 44-26 Scarlets (full-time) Saracens run out comfortable winners in the end, they were not at their best, nowhere near as good as last week, but with the kind of individual brilliance that they have they did not need to be. Nick Tompkins was excellent as a late replacement for Brad Barritt, Owen Farrell continues to impress on his comeback from injury and Richard Wigglesworth was typically classy. The big concern will be Maro Itoje, who went off with a hand injury. The Scarlets deserve credit for sticking to the task but they were eventually outgunned and now face a daunting double header against Toulon. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.15pm EDT 14:15 Saracens 44-26 Scarlets (76 mins) That is typical of Saracens though. Less than a minute later Michael Rhodes cruises over after a delightful Farrell pass. The Scarlets really did make a mess of the restart. Saracens’ Michael Rhodes scores their fifth try.

Farrell converts so the Scarlets trail by 11 points and Sarries have a man in the bin. First things first, a losing bonus point … Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.09pm EDT 14:09 Saracens 37-19 Scarlets (70 mins) Ben Spencer goes to the sin-bin for a deliberate knock-on but the Scarlets wants a penalty try with Jonathan Davies denied receiving the ball with the try-line beckoning. It’s not awarded and Saracens win a penalty at the scrum. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.05pm EDT 14:05 Saracens 37-19 Scarlets (68 mins) There’s a lengthy stoppage while Jake Ball receives treatment. Farrell has added another penalty by the by. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.58pm EDT 13:58 Saracens 34-19 Scarlets (64 mins) Alex Sanderson has been interviewed on Sky Sports and asked about Itoje’s injury – he says he’ll have to see someone to have it assessed in a pretty matter-of-fact manner but that, combined with Itoje’s body language suggests it may not be good news. So if Itoje has an injury that means he can’t play against the Springboks, is that enough potential opensides out to constitute ‘exceptional circumstances?’ Does the new EPS agreement even contain the words ‘exceptional circumstances? Meanwhile, the Scarlets have a try. Aaron Shingler finishes off as the visitors pull a fast one from a five-metre lineout. Patchell converts. All credit to the Scarlets. Updated at 2.03pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.49pm EDT 13:49 Saracens 34-12 Scarlets (56 mins) Chris Wyles finishes off a swift counterattack from Saracens to wrap up the bonus point and end any distant hopes of a Scarlets comeback. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.42pm EDT 13:42 Saracens 27-12 Scarlets (48 mins) Oh dear, Maro Itoje has been forced off with what looks like a finger/hand injury. Eddie Jones will be worried about that. And after Alistair Hargreaves recent retirement, Kruis’ ankle surgery and a failure to agree a deal for Eben Etzebeth, Saracens are considerably short at lock if he’s out for any length of time. Jackson Wray replaces him. In better news, Marcelo Bosch has their third try after a rampaging run from Mako Vunipola and a delightful cross-field kick from Farrell, who lands the conversion. Updated at 1.43pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.40pm EDT 13:40 Saracens 20-12 Scarlets (44 mins) The Scarlets are playing some good stuff at the start of the second half – after going through plenty of phases it’s Mako Vunipola, who else, that forces a timely turnover for Saracens. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.15pm EDT 13:15 Saracens 20-12 Scarlets (half-time) Patchell and Farrell exchange penalties before the Scarlets fly-half adds another just before the break. Saracens are far from their best at the moment but some moments of individual brilliance from Mako Vunipola and Tompkins are enough for an eight-point lead. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 1.02pm EDT 13:02 Saracens 17-6 Scarlets (28 mins) Tompkins, a late replacement for Barritt remember, is having a blinder and he’s scythed his way through the Scarlets defence for Sarries’s second try. The hosts have indeed moved up a gear. Farrell converts from in front. Nick Tompkins dives over for Saracens’ second try. Photograph: Paul Harding/PA Updated at 3.22pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.58pm EDT 12:58 Saracens 10-6 Scarlets (24 mins) The Scarlets are certainly defending resolutely but Saracens are beginning to build some momentum, getting around the corner a couple of times. Farrell adds a penalty for a four-point lead. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.49pm EDT 12:49 Saracens 7-6 Scarlets (15 mins) Bad news for the Scarlets and potentially Wales as Liam Williams, so impressive last weekend against Sale, hobbles off. In better news, Patchell converts his second penalty. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.45pm EDT 12:45 Saracens 7-3 Scarlets (12 mins) Saracens have been probing so far – one early run from Schalk Brits was excellent and while Rhys Patchell had kicked Scarlets into an early lead, Sarries breakthrough on 11 minutes. Mako Vunipola – is there a better loosehead in the world at the moment – is the man with it. Owen Farrell adds the extras. Mako Vunipola of Saracens runs in to score their first try. Photograph: Henry Browne/Reuters Updated at 3.21pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.30pm EDT 12:30 There’s a late change for both teams at inside centre. Brad Barritt is ruled out with a neck injury so Nick Tompkins comes in and Owen Farrell is made captain. Fot the Scarlets, Scott Williams is a late withdrawal so Hadleigh Parkes comes in.

The long and short of it is another bonus point win for Clermont and what may prove an important losing bonus point for Bordeaux.

Photograph: Thierry Zoccolan/AFP/Getty Images Updated at 3.15pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 12.01pm EDT 12:01 Castres 41-7 Northampton (full-time) Emphatic. Castres were impressive, far better than their defeat to Leinster last weekend, but Northampton were just awful. They’ve scored only 10 tries in the Premiership – the second least – and for a long time they looked like they may finish scoreless. They had chances in the first half but they look completely drained of confidence. Jim Mallinder has major issues to address. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.59am EDT 11:59 Clermont 35-14 Bordeaux-Begles (65 mins) Clermont have their fourth try through Sebastien Vahaamahina and are heading for their second bonus point win of the competition. Indeed, they’re set to be the first team to make it two wins from two, but you’d fancy Saracens to join them a bit later. Clermont lock Sebastien Vahaamahina surges over to score.

The replacement scrum-half Antoine Dupont makes plonkers of the Northampton defence, dances around them and splashes over in the corner. If Saracens’ was the best away performance from an English side in Europe then this can’t be far off the worst. Dumora converts again. Antoine Dupont of Castres dives over for their fifth try.

Updated at 11.52am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.49am EDT 11:49 Castres 27-0 Northampton (71 mins) Castres are struggling to get the fourth try and it’s beginning to effect them – they’re giving penalties away with the try-line in sight. It’s a damning indictment of Northampton that their main goal now is to deny their opponents a bonus point but they deserve nothing for their own efforts. As an aside, Courtney Lawes has been average today. Following George Kruis’s ankle surgery you’d prefer him in better form if you’re an England fan.

As poor as Northampton have been, things aren’t going their way. Lee Dickson tapped a penalty and Kockott tackled him far too early. Having already been shown a yellow card it really should have been a red … but the referee didn’t agree. The fact that Castres then hooked Kockott immediately suggests the coaches did. Castres, to rub salt into the wounds, scythe through Northampton from their own line to the Saints 22. Northampton scramble though, so the put in to the scrum is theirs.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.32am EDT 11:32 Clermont 21-14 Bordeaux-Begles (43 mins) Clermont appear to have turned the tide against Bordeaux with their second try of the match, shortly after half-time.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.22am EDT 11:22 That’s the end of Dylan Hartley’s day, replaced by Mike Haywood on his first appearance for six weeks.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.20am EDT 11:20 Castres 27-0 Northampton (46 mins) Try No3 for Castres and that is game over. It came from a mistake from Michael Paterson and a clever dart from Kockott off the base of Castres’ dominant scrum and then the hosts just do the simple things right, work the ball wide to Smith on the left, who ghosts over for his second. Far, far too easy. Urdapilleta is on target with the conversion. David Smith of Castres breaks clear to score their third try. Photograph: David Rogers/Getty Images Updated at 12.07pm EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.15am EDT 11:15 Northampton are on their way back out, no doubt with their ears still ringing. They really should be closer to Castres on the scoreboard but basic mistakes have cost them. A losing bonus point is the target now you feel. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.13am EDT 11:13 Clermont 16-14 Bordeaux-Begles (half-time) Clermont have nosed themselves ahead at the break – Noa Nakaitaci’s try on 33 minutes converted by Parra but it’s a far closer contest there than at Castres … Clermont’s Fijian wing Noa Nakaitaci scores a try.

Spotting the Northampton right wing James Wilson out of position he kicks over the top, gets lucky with the bounce, and after a phase or two, the prop Antoine Tichit powers over. Urdapilleta converts just before half-time. Northampton are treading water. Game over? Updated at 11.21am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.55am EDT 10:55 Castres 13-0 Northampton (36 mins) Teimana Harrison is playing, apparently.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.51am EDT 10:51 Castres 13-0 Northampton (31 mins) But there’s the breakthrough. Tulou rampages through the middle again and this time David Smith is on hand to take the offload and cruise under the posts. Castres are down to 14 don’t forget. A long way back for Northampton. Updated at 11.21am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.49am EDT 10:49 Castres 6-0 Northampton (30 mins) Castres march Northampton back in the scrum again, and so Urdapilleta will have a ging from 50m. Castres came close to first try a few minutes ago, but Horacio Agulla was denied in the left corner after a fine break from Tulou up the middle. Urdapilleta doesn’t have the distance so it’s as you were.

Saints go for the corner again but Harry Mallinder’s grubber comes to nothing. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 10.39am EDT 10:39 Castres 6-0 Northampton (20 mins) Saints are coming back at Castres, whose No8 Alex Tulou is getting a ticking off from the referee Ian Davies. Northampton opt for the corner rather than the posts, they’re almost over … so we’ll go to the TMO. “Try, yes or no?” is the question, but Picamoles is short so we’ll have a scrum. It’s a huge scrum from Castres, who clear their lines through Rory Kockott.

They were down to 14 men for 61 minutes but they steamrollered Glasgow, who had no answer. CJ Stander, Dave Kilcoyne, Tyler Bleyendaal, Peter O’Mahony … Munster’s heroes were all over the pitch. You had to feel for Keith Earls and although his tip tackle on Fraser Brown probably warranted a red card, it was Earls who made the initial break for Bleyendaal’s first try which sparked this performance. The Fields of Athenry rings out again as there are more tears among the Munster players but this was an incredible performance of aggression, commitment and red fury and the emotion now is to be expected.

Twitter Always-on group video chat arrives Two innovative startups figured out all-day video chat sessions, without making it weird Mike Elgan (Computerworld (US)) 22 October, 2016 22:01 - - - - print email Comments Question: Why not launch video sessions with family, friends or co-workers and leave them running all the time? Answer: Because if feels weird to be on camera all day. Now, a new generation of video chat apps offers flexible new ways to maintain always-ready video chat sessions without making people feel like they're always on display. The secret is to be "always on" and available, but not "always live." Always-on video chat is perfect for digital nomads like me, as well as work-from-home telecommuters. It removes a sense of isolation, creates opportunity for break-room style serendipitous conversation and breaks down the formality of scheduling video chat sessions. Always-on video chat is also great for, well, everybody! We all have family and friends who live or work elsewhere. It's nice to just drop in on people and spend time with them. Theoretically, always-on group video chat should feel like hanging out with friends or co-workers in the same physical room. But it doesn't. Speaking of hanging out Five years ago, Google invented a new kind of group video chat called Hangouts and built it into its social network, Google+. I wrote in this space about a new concept for group video chat, which I called "ambient Hangouts." The column hit just before Christmas, and I suggested ambient Hangouts as a way to bring far-flung families together for the holidays. Even today, a few people still use Google Hangouts for always-live group video chat sessions. Trouble is, with always-live video, the camera is on you all day, and that can be uncomfortable. Also, when a single user is the only Hangouts participant for a while, Google terminates the session. The 'portal' idea Another approach to always-on video connections is the "portal." By setting up a videoconference session on a tablet, monitor or big-screen TV and leaving it running all day, always-live, remote offices can quickly communicate by walking up to the screen and instantly begin talking. Foursquare does this internally to connect its East- and West-Coast offices. Others have cobbled together their own solutions using Apple's Facetime or Microsoft's Skype. One company built an app in 2012 called Perch, which invited users to mount an iPad in two different locations. The app maintained an always-on video connection, which was activated using motion- and face-detection for always-on video, or it could be used optionally for always-on video connections. The split for Perch usage was 50% always-on, and 50% always-live. Unfortunately, Perch closed its doors last month. Perch CEO Danny Robinson told me that that the Perch "idea, market, customers, revenue were all moving up and to the right," but that friction between new, potential investors and the board led to the collapse of the startup. The good news is that Robinson also said he has 12 parties interested in a possible acquisition, so Perch might return to the market. When people can come and go as they please Remember Meerkat? The app last year popularized live-streaming video, a space now dominated by Facebook Live and Twitter's Periscope. This kind of live streaming involves one person streaming to an audience -- it's a one-way stream, although viewers can comment. Meerkat depended on Twitter for the sharing and discovery of live streams, and the use of Twitter enabled the app to go viral in its first month. But after Twitter bought Periscope, Meerkat's access to the Twitter "social graph" was cut off. Ultimately, Meerkat couldn't compete with Twitter's own alternative given Twitter's exclusivity on the network. The Meerkat app was removed last month and the service was shut down on Oct. 4. Meerkat was created by a startup called Life On Air. After the demise of Meerkat, the company got to work on a free iOS and Android app called Houseparty. Unlike Meerkat, Houseparty is for video chat -- few-to-few chat, rather than one-to-many streaming. In an unusual move, Life On Air published Houseparty under a fake name. Its developer was the non-existent "Alexander Herzick," and it operated under the radar for 10 months. The reason was to enable the company to "experiment and iterate without any hype," according to co-founder and COO Sima Sistani. Houseparty is aimed at everyone, but the user base skews young. Some 60% of Houseparty users are under the age of 24, according to Sistani. (The app's logo is one of those red plastic cups that frat houses use for playing beer pong, so it's not aimed at enterprises.) Houseparty is available via the company's iOS app. An Android version is in beta but available to the public on the Play Store. The idea behind Houseparty is that you can create a video space that's always "there," and family and friends can come and go as they please. This approach makes video conversations more casual and instant -- the same way co-workers would drop in on your cubicle for a quick chat, or friends might swing by to say hi. Instead of "arranging a call" or interrupting someone while they're in the middle of something, you simply create an open invitation for any number of people, then tell the app you're "Here." Set it and forget it. When other invited users are available, they can pop in for a group chat. As new users join, each window gets smaller to make room for the additional participants. With a few people on a single call, it creates a kind of Brady Bunch effect, with video windows tiled all over the screen. The effect works whether in landscape or portrait mode, even when some participants hold their phone one way and others hold it the other. It doesn't matter. Meerkat was declared a runaway success when it gained 300,000 users. Houseparty already has more than a million users, according to Sistani. Houseparty solves the need to either schedule a video chat, or interrupt people when they're busy. By setting up an open invitation to chat with all your family and friends, you can enjoy spontaneous, casual interaction whenever it's convenient. When the team is always 'there,' but with instant video chat on demand Another approach comes from a new application called Sneek. Think of Sneek as a kind of desktop Houseparty for professionals, an always-on video chat application for teams. A software company called Analog Republic launched the service three weeks ago. The company has 12 employees scattered all over the U.K. and U.S. and needed a solution for staying connected all day, according to co-founder Del Currie. So they built it for themselves and liked it so much they launched a public version. Here's how it works: Each team member is represented by a photo, which their webcam snaps at a user-determined interval -- either every minute or every five minutes. You can also pose for and snap a static picture manually. By choosing pixelated mode, your photo will be pixelated for a little more privacy. You can set a status message, which is displayed under your face. To chat with anyone or everyone, a simple click on a face or several faces instantly launches a video chat with whoever was clicked on. You can chat in Brady Bunch mode, or go fullscreen. The full-screen mode works just like Google Hangouts. Whoever's talking goes fullscreen, but you can override this by clicking on a person's face to see only that one person. Users set availability. So if you're away, the camera turns off. If you're at your desk but too busy to chat on video, team members can see your picture, but can't instantly start video chat. When talking is urgent but a team member is busy, you can click on their photo, which plays a knocking sound, and they can answer if they choose. You can also use a couple of Slack commands to launch or invite others to Sneek, and also share other users' profile snaps. Sneek provides a sense of presence for the team, and the kind of immediacy with communication that you'd have working together in the same office, but with multi-layered options for privacy and to eliminate the weirdness of being on live video all day. Sneek operates on a freemium model, but the free version doesn't offer video chat. You can use the "presence" features, including the photo snaps and status messages, but then you'd need to establish a video chat using Skype or some other software. The Pro version costs $10 per month, or $108 per year, and gives you the full, instant-video chat feature I mentioned. Sneek offers a free, 14-day trial, so you can try the Pro version for two weeks. Sneak works in a Chrome browser, or in a downloadable desktop application, available on OS X and Windows. A Linux version is promised "soon." The company is also planning an iOS version in early 2017 and an Android version after that, according to Currie. Video chat and videoconferencing is a great medium. Doing it the old way was stilted, awkward and formal, and always-live video chat felt intrusive. With Houseparty and Sneek, you can break down the walls of formality and create a sense of "presence," without feeling like you're in the spotlight all day.

(REUTERS/Dado Ruvic) These days, a new car is basically a computer with wheels. Trunks open automatically. The car parks itself. Rear cameras show you what you can’t see. If you lock your keys inside, you can open the doors by satellite. The flashiest new gadget: a touch screen in the middle of your dashboard. There’s a lot to love about these infotainment systems. Depending on the brand, you can organize your music, program the GPS and dictate text messages. Console screens are as wide as small tablets and they’re easy to read, even when you’re behind the wheel. But there’s a cost: Many of these services require subscriptions for services like in-vehicle Wi-Fi hotspots, Sirius XM satellite radio and live traffic data. You may start with a free trial, grow accustomed to the conveniences and then find yourself paying fees later on. These costs can add up over time, and the final tally might surprise you — especially when you set up automatic payment. You might not realize how much you’re shelling out for car-based infotainment until you look over your credit card statement. How do you avoid getting caught unaware? Here are some preventive measures. Grill the auto dealer Buying a car is an ordeal. Even when we’ve picked our dream car, we tend to drive away from the dealership exhausted. (Tip in a Tip: If you’re hunting for a new car, there’s an app that makes it easy. Click here to find your perfect car. ) The last thing you want to think about is whether the console uses Apple Maps or Google Maps. But this is a critical time, because the dealer may want you to subscribe to as many services as possible. Don’t let salespeople confuse you. There’s no reason to sign up for anything on the first day. All enrollments are voluntary, and these apps will be available whenever you want them. Infotainment systems are still new, and every car company has its own technology and services. Each system has distinct benefits and drawbacks: Volvo’s Sensus Connect has a touch screen you can use while wearing gloves. Ford’s Sync 3 uses a Blackberry-based system, and it’s a vast improvement on earlier versions. Android Auto will appeal to Google and Microsoft users, while Apple CarPlay is designed for Apple fans. Your preference for Apple or Android devices will likely influence your next car’s make and model. On my site, I have information about both systems. Most importantly, click here to see which system is preloaded into different car makes and models. A responsible auto rep will tell you all about these consoles and infotainment services. Ask how long the free trial lasts and how much the subscription will eventually cost. Grill them about cancellation policies, especially for features you’re not sold on. If any of these explanations sound fishy, just decline. Better to learn about your new car and drive it for a few hundred miles before adding features you may never even use. Remember your smartphone When it comes to vehicle infotainment, I don’t use any paid subscriptions. I use my phone instead. The truth is, most upmarket cars come with USB or audio ports that let you plug your smartphone directly into your vehicle’s system. For years, tech-savvy drivers have listened to music on their phones and held hands-free conversations through their car’s radio and speakers. An infotainment system is just a more sophisticated version of these radios and speakers. You can usually connect your phone directly to your infotainment console, which accesses all the music, podcasts, GPS, and streaming services you already have, and you don’t have to pay an extra penny. There is one downside: Using your phone for navigation and streaming services while driving may devour your data plan. The same goes for “tethering” a device to your phone, a technique some passengers use to access the internet during commutes. To avoid a data famine, you can download podcasts or audiobooks ahead of time, especially for long trips. It’s also a good idea to track your data use so you won’t go over the limit.

That’s right, no more clicking through to a lyrics site to get what you’re looking for, Google will return it immediately. This is made possible thanks to a multi-year deal between Toronto-based lyric licensing company LyricFind. The partnership between the two companies also creates a new revenue stream for artists. While the terms of the deal haven’t been disclosed, LyricFind CEO and co-founder Darryl Ballantyne has been quoted as saying it will be “a significant revenue stream” that could result in publishers and songwriters earning millions. The payout for artists is based on impressions. Royalties are earned whenever a set of lyrics is displayed in Google’s search results. So the more often a song gets searched for, the greater the payout for the artist. There’s no doubt that this addition to Google search will result in less traffic to lyrics sites — but is that necessarily a bad thing? Most lyrics sites earn money through advertising despite have no permission to reprint the lyrics contained on the site. In turn, that also means the artists receive no royalties when lyrics are viewed. This change is unfortunate for licensed lyrics sites who will almost certainly see their traffic decline going forward. The deal between Google and LyricFind creates a sense of legitimacy to lyrics search, as Google gets the rights to legally display song lyrics while artists receive the royalties they deserve. In addition, every lyrics snippet card will contain a link to purchase the song on Google Play, which could create even more revenue for Google and musicians. The new lyrics cards are live today in US English search results.

Google Has Quietly Dropped Ban on Personally Identifiable Web Tracking ProPublica 10/22/2016 Julia Angwin © Provided by ProPublica When Google bought the advertising network DoubleClick in 2007, Google founder Sergey Brin said that privacy would be the company’s “number one priority when we contemplate new kinds of advertising products.” And, for nearly a decade, Google did in fact keep DoubleClick’s massive database of web-browsing records separate by default from the names and other personally identifiable information Google has collected from Gmail and its other login accounts. But this summer, Google quietly erased that last privacy line in the sand – literally crossing out the lines in its privacy policy that promised to keep the two pots of data separate by default. In its place, Google substituted new language that says browsing habits “may be” combined with what the company learns from the use Gmail and other tools. Popular Searches Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 105.71 -2.72 -2.51% Microsoft Corp MSFT ▼ 58.12 -0.90 -1.52% Samsung Electronics Co Ltd SSNLF ▼ 1,250.00 -175.00 -12.28% Amazon.com Inc AMZN ▼ 719.07 -19.94 -2.70% The change is enabled by default for new Google accounts. Existing users were prompted to opt-in to the change this summer.   The practical result of the change is that the DoubleClick ads that follow people around on the web may now be customized to them based on your name and other information Google knows about you. It also means that Google could now, if it wished to, build a complete portrait of a user by name, based on everything they write in email, every website they visit and the searches they conduct. The move is a sea change for Google and a further blow to the online ad industry’s longstanding contention that web tracking is mostly anonymous. In recent years, Facebook, offline data brokers and others have increasingly sought to combine their troves of web tracking data with people’s real names. But until this summer, Google held the line. “The fact that DoubleClick data wasn’t being regularly connected to personally identifiable information was a really significant last stand,” said Paul Ohm, faculty director of the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law. “It was a border wall between being watched everywhere and maintaining a tiny semblance of privacy,” he said. “That wall has just fallen.” Google spokeswoman Andrea Faville emailed a statement describing Google’s change in privacy policy as an update to adjust to the “smartphone revolution” “We updated our ads system, and the associated user controls, to match the way people use Google today: across many different devices,” Faville wrote. She added that the change “is 100% optional–if users do not opt-in to these changes, their Google experience will remain unchanged.” (Read Google’s entire statement.) Existing Google users were prompted to opt-into the new tracking this summer through a request with titles such as “Some new features for your Google account.” The “new features” received little scrutiny at the time. Wired wrote that it “gives you more granular control over how ads work across devices.” In a personal tech column, the New York Times also described the change as “new controls for the types of advertisements you see around the web.” Connecting web browsing habits to personally identifiable information has long been controversial. Privacy advocates raised a ruckus in 1999 when DoubleClick purchased a data broker that assembled people’s names, addresses and offline interests. The merger could have allowed DoubleClick to combine its web browsing information with people’s names. Afteran investigation by the Federal Trade Commission, DoubleClick sold the broker at a loss. In response to the controversy, the nascent online advertising industry formed theNetwork Advertising Initiative in 2000 to establish ethical codes. The industry promisedto provide consumers with notice when their data was being collected, and options to opt out. Most online ad tracking remained essentially anonymous for some time after that. When Google bought DoubleClick in 2007, for instance, the company’s privacy policy stated: “DoubleClick’s ad-serving technology will be targeted based only on the non-personally-identifiable information.” In 2012, Google changed its privacy policy to allow it to share data about users between different Google services - such as Gmail and search. But it kept data from DoubleClick – whose tracking technology is enabled on half of the top 1 million websites – separate. But the era of social networking has ushered in a new wave of identifiable tracking, in which services such as Facebook and Twitter have been able to track logged-in users when they shared an item from another website. Two years ago, Facebook announced that it would track its users by name across the Internet when they visit websites containing Facebook buttons such as “Share” and “Like” – even when users don’t click on the button. (Here’s how you can opt out of the targeted ads generated by that tracking). Offline data brokers also started to merge their mailing lists with online shoppers. “The marriage of online and offline is the ad targeting of the last 10 years on steroids,” saidScott Howe, chief executive of broker firm Acxiom. To opt-out of Google’s identified tracking, visit the Activity controls on Google’s My Account page, and uncheck the box next to “Include Chrome browsing history and activity from websites and apps that use Google services." You can also delete past activity from your account.  Go to MSN Home More in Money Amazing Airstreams: The coolest tiny homes on wheels Lovemoney 8 ways President Trump will affect Wall Street U.S. News & World Report - Money 6 reasons to think twice before moving to Canada MarketWatch The 10 most expensive prescription drugs in America Fiscal Times How China's richest man is buying up the world Lovemoney 7 things you should never do online USA TODAY Up Next 20 tips for saving money at the grocery store U.S. News & World Report - Money AdChoices AdChoices AdChoices More from ProPublica Revenge of the Forgotten Class ProPublica Facebook Says it Will Stop Allowing Some Advertisers to Exclude Users by Race ProPublica Thousands of Potentially Wrongful Convictions; Years of Delayed Action ProPublica 2016 Election Lawsuit Tracker: The New Election Laws and the Suits Challenging Them ProPublica ProPublica View the full site Home News Weather Entertainment Sports Money Lifestyle Health & Fitness Food & Drink Travel Autos Video election 2016 © 2016 Microsoft Privacy Legal About our Ads Feedback Help MSN Worldwide Newsletter

Share Tweet Whatsapp Email Share Google removing Thai royal insults posts - Yahoo7 Pinterest Tumblr Thailand's government has met with representatives from Internet giant Google, amid growing calls from Thai hardline royalists to bring those who insult the monarchy to justice, as many Thais look with uncertainty to a future without their revered king. King Bhumibol Adulyadej's death on October 13 has thrown the country of 67 million into mourning. It has also led to the rise of ultra-royalist vigilante groups who say they will punish anyone perceived to have insulted the monarchy during a highly sensitive time for Thailand. Deputy Prime Minister Prajin Juntong said he met with Google representatives in Bangkok on Friday.

Some critics of the monarchy living abroad have been named and shamed in Thai language web forums. Outside the world of the web, some Thais who have chosen not to wear black, the official colour of mourning, have been publicly jeered at. Thailand's military government has tried to seek tighter censorship of social media from Facebook, Google and Japan-based instant messenger service LINE since it came to power in 2014 following a coup it said was necessary to restore peace to the country following months of unrest.

Thailand's military government has tried to seek tighter censorship of social media from Facebook, Google and Japan-based instant messenger service LINE since it came to power in 2014 following a coup it said was necessary to restore peace to the country following months of unrest.    Thailand's royal insult law, known as Article 112 in the criminal code, makes it a crime to insult the king, queen, heir or regent. Those who are found guilty face up to 15 years in prison.    The law has curtailed public discussion about the monarchy's role and its future following the death of King Bhumibol who ruled for seven decades and was seen as a unifying figure.     Since taking power in 2014, the junta, known officially as the National Council for Peace and Order, has taken a tough stance on dissenters.    It has come under strong criticism from the international community for lengthy and unprecedented prison sentences handed down by military courts against civilians for violating the lese-majeste law since the junta took power.    The military government has repeatedly rejected accusations of rights violations.      (Reporting by Pracha Hariraksapitak.

Nikita Richardson and Christina Farr 10.17.16 6:00 AM Roku As it introduces its next generation of TV sticks and players this fall, the country’s most popular enabler of cord cutting is already thinking beyond set-top boxes. Roku today commands 49% of the U.S. streaming-device market, ahead of Google and Amazon. But behind the scenes, the hardware maker is steadily becoming more of a streaming platform, an interesting move considering Roku’s origins as a Netflix spin-out in 2008. In the past two years, cable providers, including Time Warner, Charter, and, soon, Comcast, have added their own streaming services, and dozens of new TV shows, on Roku, making the platform even more of a one-stop shop for television. Meanwhile, smart-TV makers such as Sharp, Insignia, and Hisense have installed Roku’s in the back ends of their products, giving users access to Amazon Instant Video, Netflix, Hulu, and more. "We believe that the [operating system] phenomenon is now happening with TVs," says Roku CEO Anthony Wood. "Our business is to distribute our system to as many TV screens as we can and then monetize that base." The early results are promising: Just two years into its smart-TV efforts, Roku claims 15% of the market (behind Google’s 18%) and has seen its media and licensing sector grow from 20% to 44% of gross profit. And with 10.6 million subscribers across cable, TV, and devices, Roku can sell valuable demographic data to advertisers and marketers eager to reach cord cutters. "One aspect that’s an advantage for us is we’re a neutral party, we don’t make our own content," says Wood. "We’re a level playing field for content providers to compete on." —Nikita Richardson [Illustration: Kuocheng Liao] Milestones: In September, Roku landed in Asia, announcing a licensing deal with PLDT, the Philippines’ largest telecom company. Challenges: Google’s Chromecast device is growing more powerful, thanks to full integration with its Chrome web browser and the release earlier this fall of a new 4K-enabled version of the device. Buzz: Positive Digging deeper: 23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki wants scientists to use her genomic database to scale research. 23Andme This past August, with backing from Pfizer, researchers from 23andMe and Massachusetts General Hospital sent a ripple through the scientific community with the announcement that they had identified several genetic markers associated with depression, ending years of frustrated efforts to locate the genetic risks for the pervasive mental illness. Just as significant: The study was based on data from more than 120,000 people who had reported a diagnosis of depression to 23andMe, the genetics testing-kit company that has become a hit with people searching for their personal history in their DNA. A study of this size "wouldn’t have been possible before," says 23andMe CEO Anne Wojcicki. "We’re hoping to enable a kind of research that has never been done." The Silicon Valley company has come a long way since 2013, when federal regulators ordered Wojcicki and her team to stop marketing its at-home genomics service. Today, it is working closely with the Food and Drug Administration to share select genetic-derived health reports directly with consumers—without a doctor’s note. The vast majority of 23andMe’s 1.2 million customers, who sign up for an at-home genetic test, agree to participate in research studies and surveys. So far, they’ve answered more than 350 million survey questions. The company says the scientific community is now waking up to the potential of this database, though 23andMe has been engaging in research projects for years. "Research studies don’t normally have hundreds of thousands of people," says Wojcicki. "We can help with that." —Christina Farr Milestones: 23andMe’s new Genotyping Services for Research program has made it possible for scientists to access customer data for their own studies. Challenges: Some customers are wondering whether they should receive compensation for making their DNA available to researchers. Buzz: Positive HTC Milestones: Consumer electronics maker HTC is capitalizing on the success of its Vive virtual-reality device; it recently turned the division into a wholly owned subsidiary and launched a new $100 million VR accelerator. Challenges: The company faces wider financial issues, and with revenue down 44% year over year, sales of its new HTC 10 phone continue to flag. In August, T-Mobile stopped selling the phone after just two months. Buzz: Neutral SalesForce Milestones: In Septem­ber, the sales software maker announced Einstein, a new suite of AI-enabled products designed to help clients by predicting the most promising sales leads and alerting them when a competitor hones in on their territory. Challenges: Salesforce hopes to fend off both Oracle and Microsoft, which recently beat out the company to purchase LinkedIn for $26.2 billion. Buzz: Positive WeWork Milestones: In an effort to build more long-term relationships with clients, coworking-space startup WeWork is experimenting with a yearlong lease option with a significant discount. Challenges: After cutting its profit forecast by 78%, an internal memo from CEO Adam Neumann recently urged employees to save energy, reduce the number of expensed meals, and take other cost-cutting measures. Buzz: Neutral Sony Milestones: This month, Sony will release a new 4K- and high-dynamic range-enabled Pro version of its popular PS4 console in a bid to attract players looking for higher-quality gaming experiences. Challenges: Sony follows in the footsteps of rival Microsoft and its Xbox One S console (released earlier this year) and, with future iterations, promises to feature more powerful graphic-rendering software than the PS4 Pro. Buzz: Positive Kind Bars' new fruit bars Kind Snacks Milestones: In August, Kind became the first snack manufacturer to break out its added sugar numbers, two years ahead of the FDA’s deadline to publish such information. Meanwhile, the company is rolling out new fruit bars that contain between 14% and 56% less added sugar than prior recipes. Challenges: With U.S. sales of energy and nutrition bars hitting $2.5 billion in 2015, big players Pepsi­Co and Hershey are joining the fray with their own healthy snack brands. Buzz: Neutral Coursera Milestones: Looking to diversify its user base and find new revenue streams, online education site Coursera recently launched Coursera for Business, which companies such as L’Oréal, Axis Bank, and BCG will use to train their employees and enroll new talent. Challenges: Coursera is still struggling to become profitable, as many people use its online courses for free, and is running up against competitors such as Harvard Business School and Udacity for the same customers. Buzz: Negative Tala (Inventure) Milestones: Originally focused on offering short-term, credit-building loans to people in Africa and India, InVenture has taken a new name, Tala, and shifted to mobile banking services, allowing users to make and send payments and track their credit score in real time. Challenges: Tala is still relatively small and has yet to reach the size or potential of African mobile payments juggernauts like Safaricom’s M-Pesa, which currently has more than 20 million users in Kenya. Buzz: Positive Equinox Milestones: Equinox has hired Four Seasons exec Chris Norton as the first CEO of its forthcoming luxury hotel brand, due in 2019. Earlier this summer, Equinox also tapped Generator Hostels founder Josh Wyatt as the hotel’s president. Challenges: With the first hotel’s grand opening still nearly three years away, the gym brand must maintain its momentum to avoid playing catch-up with other wellness-themed brands, including Barry Sternlicht’s growing 1 Hotels, which feature SoulCycle studios.

And, for nearly a decade, Google did in fact keep DoubleClick's massive database of web-browsing records separate by default from the names and other personally identifiable information Google has collected from Gmail and its other login accounts. But this summer, Google quietly erased that last privacy line in the sand - literally crossing out the lines in its privacy policy that promised to keep the two pots of data separate by default. In its place, Google substituted new language that says browsing habits "may be" combined with what the company learns from the use Gmail and other tools. The web, by definition, isn't private. The web is like a busy shopping street; you wouldn't shout your secrets for everyone to hear there either. The sooner people accept this fact, the better they'll be for it. Note that I'm not saying I'm happy about this fact - I'm just saying it is what it is. There's nothing any of us can do about it, until authorities or regulators start stepping in. That being said, Google published a statement about this, stating this change is opt-in. Our advertising system was designed before the smartphone revolution. It offered user controls and determined ads' relevance, but only on a per-device basis. This past June we updated our ads system, and the associated user controls, to match the way people use Google today: across many different devices. Before we launched this update, we tested it around the world with the goal of understanding how to provide users with clear choice and transparency. As a result, it is 100% optional - if users do not opt-in to these changes, their Google experience will remain unchanged. Equally important: we provided prominent user notifications about this change in easy-to-understand language as well as simple tools that let users control or delete their data. Users can access all of their account controls by visiting My Account and we're pleased that more than a billion have done so in its first year alone. You can opt-out in the Activity Controls section of your Google account settings.

King Bhumibol Adulyadej’s death on Oct. 13 has thrown the country of 67 million into mourning. It has also led to the rise of ultra-royalist vigilante groups who say they will punish anyone perceived to have insulted the monarchy during a highly sensitive time for Thailand. Deputy Prime Minister Prajin Juntong said he met with Google representatives in Bangkok on Friday. Google affirmed in the meeting that it would continue to help the government remove content from YouTube, a Google subsidiary, that it deemed offensive, he said. "If any website is inappropriate they said to get in touch with them and inform them of the URL and the time the content was found," Prajin told reporters. That conforms with Google's practice around the world, Alphabet Inc's Google says. "We have always had clear and consistent policies for removal requests from governments around the world and we continue to operate in line with those policies," a Google spokesperson in California told Reuters on Friday. "When we are notified of content that is illegal through official processes, we will restrict it in the country where it’s illegal after a thorough review." NAMED AND SHAMED Thailand's military government said on Tuesday it was tracking people suspected of insulting the monarchy following the king’s death and would ask other countries to extradite them. Some critics of the monarchy living abroad have been named and shamed in Thai language web forums. Outside the world of the web, some Thais who have chosen not to wear black, the official color of mourning, have been publicly jeered at. Thailand's military government has tried to seek tighter censorship of social media from Facebook, Google and Japan-based instant messenger service LINE since it came to power in 2014 following a coup it said was necessary to restore peace to the country following months of unrest. Thailand's royal insult law, known as Article 112 in the criminal code, makes it a crime to insult the king, queen, heir or regent. Those who are found guilty face up to 15 years in prison.

Eurogamer.net Follow @eurogamer Home Reviews iPhone 7/ iPhone 7 Plus review Back in black. By Damien McFerran Published 22/10/2016 It apparently took "courage" to remove the 3.5mm audio jack from the iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus, according to Apple's senior vice president of worldwide marketing Phil Schiller. The company's less kind critics have voiced the opinion that it has more to do with bolstering sales of the new £160 AirPods and the wireless headphones produced by Apple subsidiary Beats Electronics, but whatever side of the fence you happen to sit on, this is a decision that has dominated the headlines and has been in very real danger of completely overshadowing this year's iPhone refresh. Apple's reasoning for ditching a socket which has been commonplace on practically every smartphone for the past decade may be flimsy at best, but where the Cupertino company leads, rivals invariably follow and we could well see an industry-wide shift towards wireless audio in the next year or so. It's almost a shame that this decision has generated such a sizeable reaction online as the products it impacts have a lot going for them. For the first time in iPhone history we finally have a device that can cope with getting wet, while the improved camera on both models and unique "taptic" home button are welcome improvements. However, Apple has chosen to cram all of these elements into a chassis which looks disarmingly similar to the design of the iPhone 6 and iPhone 6S - the first time in the history of the line that the same aesthetic look has been retained for a third consecutive year (the iPhone SE doesn't count as that came over a year after the iPhone 5S ceased being Apple's flagship). iPhone 7/7 Plus specs Akin to 2014 and 2015, Apple has two flagship options this year. Both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus benefit from the increased power afforded by Apple's A10 Fusion chipset, but the latter has 3GB of RAM compared to the standard model's 2GB. This year the 16GB storage option has been retired, with 32GB being the entry level point. The other big difference between the two phones is the addition of a second telephoto lens on the 7 Plus, which gives x2 optical zoom. First up, the iPhone 7 specs: Dimensions: 138.3 x 67.1 x 7.1mm Weight: 138g Chipset: Apple A10 Fusion Processor: Quad-core 2.23 GHz Graphics Core: Six-core graphics RAM: 2GB Screen: 4.7-inch LED-backlit IPS LCD, 750 x 1334 pixels (326 ppi) Storage: 32GB / 64GB / 128GB Camera: 12 MP, f/1.8, phase detection autofocus, OIS, quad-LED flash Connectivity: Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth v4.2, NFC (Apple Pay only) Other Features: IP67 certified, 1960 mAh battery And here's how the iPhone 7 Plus compares: Dimensions: 158.2 x 77.9 x 7.3mm Weight: 188g Chipset: Apple A10 Fusion Processor: Quad-core 2.23 GHz Graphics Core: Six-core graphics RAM: 3GB Screen: 5.5-inch LED-backlit IPS LCD, 1080 x 1920 pixels (401 ppi) Storage: 32GB / 64GB / 128GB Camera: Dual 12 MP (28mm, f/1.8, OIS & 56mm, f/2.8), phase detection autofocus, OIS (4-axis), dual-LED flash Connectivity: Wi-Fi 802.11 a/b/g/n/ac, Bluetooth v4.2, NFC Other Features: IP67 certified, 2900 mAh battery Black is the new "hero" colour of the range this year, with matte and glossy finishes available. This new colour scheme hides one of the big changes to the design, which is the repositioning of the plastic antenna bands to the top and bottom edges of the rear of the device. These bands are now practically invisible, with Apple's design guru Jony Ive claiming that this has resulted in the most "refined" take on this particular design. It's hard to disagree; while it may not be revolutionary when set alongside its 2014 and 2015 predecessors, the iPhone 7 is certainly an appealing slab of technology. There are many aspects to the phone's design that are instantly familiar to iPhone owners. The power button resides on the right-hand side, with the volume controls and silent switch found on the opposite edge. On the bottom there's the lightning port, but the 3.5mm headphone jack you'd expect to see to the left is gone, with the resultant void being filled by a speaker (the phone has two) and the phone's larger "Taptic Engine" force feedback unit. Around the back, the camera bump has become bigger compared to last year's model, but it looks a lot nicer - the metallic lens housing has been replaced by a more gradual raised section that appears to be more like part of the design than something that was hastily tacked on at the last moment. Gallery: Available in matte and glossy black, this year's iPhones will make many nostalgic for the iPhone 3G. The removal of the 3.5mm headphone socket has allowed Apple to fit two powerful stereo speakers, while inside the phone the expanded Taptic Engine allows for system-wide force feedback. Apart from size, the big difference between the two models is the dual camera setup on the 7 Plus. Flipping the phone over reveals the final big change - there's no physical home button this time around. The circular pad remains, but a push with your thumb yields no movement; instead, the iPhone 7's Taptic Engine delivers a pulse that gives the impression of pushing a button. Apple has used the same tech on the Force Touch screen, and it's a pretty convincing system - even if it does take some getting used to initially. By eliminating this moving part, Apple will hopefully have solved one of the biggest problems the iPhone line has faced along the years - a broken home button. While the 3.5mm headphone socket is, in Apple's eyes at least, now a relic of the past, there's thankfully still a way of using your old wired cans. Included in the box is a small connection cable that plugs into the lightning port and features - you've guessed it - a 3.5mm port on the other end. It's hardly an elegant solution and means you can't charge the phone while listening to music, but it should help you endure the transition to wireless audio - just make sure you don't misplace the adapter. The other big news this year is that Apple has finally made its flagship phones water and dust proof. Both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus boast IP67 certification, meaning they're able to withstand a 30 minute dip in the wet stuff to a depth of one meter. Again, there's a game of catch-up being played here - we've had waterproof Android phones for years - but it's a welcome upgrade over last year's offering and should ensure that an unscheduled fall in the sink or (even worse) the toilet no longer means a tragic end for your £600 smartphone. Both the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus benefit from backlit LED screens which are brighter and more colourful than before, but they retain the resolution we've seen in the previous two years. The iPhone 7 has a 4.7-inch 1334x750 screen while its larger sibling has a 5.5-inch 1920x1080 offering. Compared to what companies like Sony, Samsung and LG are shipping with their flagship devices it's clear that Apple is losing the pixels-per-inch war, but while it's annoying that iPhone fans have not had a resolution bump in the past three years, it matters little in day-to-day use. GFXBench's Manhattan test is a hard workout for the GPU, but the reality is that few games actually test cutting-edge graphics power these days. iPhone 7 iPhone 7 Plus iPhone SE iPhone 6S iPhone 6 iPhone 5S iPhone 5/5C Galaxy S7 Galaxy S6 Geekbench Single-Core 3000 3306 2496 2552 1605 1294 701 2171 1233 Geekbench Multi-Core 5330 5345 4343 4464 2901 2463 1267 6465 3964 3DMark Graphics 63668 62595 44059 41968 22824 19488 5232 32404 22954 3DMark Physics 15267 15231 12871 12998 9385 8042 8099 17730 17795 3DMark IceStorm Unlimited 37352 37015 28638 28067 17304 14797 5669 27370 21565 GFXBench T-Rex 120.1 122.4 79.9 79.7 42.8 28.9 6.9 87.0 58.0 GFXBench Manhattan 62.3 63.2 39.3 40.3 18.1 13.5 - 29.0 25.9 It's already almost impossible to discern individual pixels on this screen and we've long argued that 1080p is the absolute maximum you really need on a smartphone. Anything above that is simply adding strain on the processor (not to mention impacting battery life) for little visible reward - the only genuine use we can foresee for a resolution increase is for phones which are used to power virtual reality headsets, such as the Galaxy S7 and the newly-launched Google Pixel, where the user's eyes are close-up to the display. As the iPhone 7 has no VR application at present, it can't really be included in that argument. While the iPhone is eclipsed by its Android rivals when it comes to screen size, it continues to lead the pack in terms of raw processing power. The fact that the A10 Fusion chip is the first quad-core proposition from Apple might lead you to assume it is comfortably outclassed by competing handsets, but the benchmark results suggest otherwise. As ever, the merits of creating your own chipset speak for themselves; this is an industry-leading handset in terms of grunt. Another remarkable aspect worth noting is that the iPhone 7 has only 2GB of RAM (the 7 Plus has 3GB) yet it is capable of delivering performance levels which shame some of its RAM-obsessed Android challengers. It almost goes without saying that with such formidable specs the iPhone 7 is a solid platform for gaming. There are few titles which really exploit the additional power found within the handset at present but existing releases - such as the lush Zelda Wind Waker homage Oceanhorn and the ever-enjoyable Real Racing 3 - run as smooth as silk with none of the judders and frame-rate headaches seen in their Android equivalents. Mobile gaming doesn't really get any more polished than it does on an iPhone, and the iOS App Store continues to be the go-to platform for developers thanks to the relative lack of piracy when compared to Google's own digital store. Perhaps this is why Nintendo has chosen to bring Super Mario Run to iOS first, a move which will surely make Apple's devices even more attractive to dedicated gamers. Gallery: Incremental hardware upgrades means there's few games which fully exploit the power of the A10 Fusion chipset, but rest assured everything runs like clockwork on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus, with not stutter or frame rate hiccups. 3D Touch is supported by some games too, but not as many as we'd like. In terms of software, Apple has launched iOS 10 alongside its 2016 flagship phones. This update brings with it some visual changes - such as bubble-like notifications and the Google Now-style "Today" screen, which sits on the left-hand side of your main Home screen and gives you calendar updates and news stories - but perhaps the most significant difference is how 3D Touch has been embraced more enthusiastically this time around. Introduced in the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus, 3D Touch is based around pressure, allowing you to press down on the screen to "peek" at images and access more commands. In iOS 10 it's also used in a new "rich notifications" system, where pressing down an alert bubble allows you to expand it and - in some cases - respond without having to actually open the app in question. As was the case last year, you could argue that a simple long-press would work just as well but 3D Touch appears to be here to stay, at least as far as the iPhone is concerned. Another welcome introduction for iOS 10 is the ability to wake the phone's screen as soon as you pick it up, and lock screen widgets - recently expunged from Android - have been added so you can check vital information without unlocking your device. However, there are times when it feels like Apple's attempts to enrich iOS have been fumbled. The notification system is the main culprit, and remains unwieldy for those who have a lot of apps firing off messages at once. In Android, notifications from the same app are often grouped together so you can see at a glance which one you need to open first, but in iOS each message has its own entry and you often have to swipe through an entire stream of alerts before finding one of any real interest. Worse still, important alerts get buried amid eBay messages, emails and other less urgent notifications, which means they often get overlooked altogether. Granular access is given to this system so you can disable audio alerts for a particular app or prevent it from firing off a message on your lock screen, but it's still a poor second to the way notifications work in Android - an OS which has led the way in this area almost since day one. Another advantage Google has is better overall customisation and flexibility - bonuses which come hand-in-hand with weaker security and an app store which struggles to attract talent due to the fact that any Android user can side-load pirated apps and games without having to pay a penny. Swift to focus and capable of capturing life-like shots, the iPhone 7's camera is perhaps the best on any smartphone right now. Low-light photography is much improved thanks to the inclusion of OIS and a f/1.8 aperture. One area where Apple's phones have enjoyed a particular notable advantage over pretty much every other manufacturer on the market is photography. While the megapixel count of 12 remains unchanged when compared to the iPhone 6S, both of this year's phones has a six-optical lens, optical image stabilisation (reserved for the "Plus" models previously) and a wider f/1.8 aperture. This means shots are less prone to camera shake and low-light shooting is much improved. Apple claims that the camera on the iPhone 7 is 60 per cent faster than its direct predecessor, which is an impressive claim as the iPhone 6S could capture an image in double-quick time. Suffice to say, the camera is insanely swift to focus and snap, and produces images which have excellent contrast and colour replication. Some of the shots look somewhat dull when compared to the vibrant images obtained on Samsung's latest handsets, but they're notably free from oversaturation and unrealistic colours. In terms of video, you can expect 4K capture at 30fps, or if you prefer a smoother frame-rate you can drop down to 1080p60. Slow-motion and time-lapse modes are also included, and the 7-megapixel selfie-camera on the front is now aided by a flash - in reality, the screen simply fires up to illuminate your face. On the 7 Plus, Apple has opted for the dual camera approach seen on Android phones like the LG G5, Huawei P9 and HTC One M8. The phone comes with a 12-megapixel telephoto lens in addition to the standard 12-megapixel snapper seen on the standard iPhone 7 model. This telephoto lens effectively grants the end user x2 optical zoom, allowing you to zoom in on your subject without experiencing the image quality degradation that normally comes with digital zoom. It doesn't end there, though - the iPhone 7 Plus uses its dual-camera setup to create a "depth map", picking out close-up and distant objects. This information is then used to add an artificial bokeh effect to create the kind of depth-of-field you'd normally only get from a DSLR with wide aperture. It's an interesting use of the two cameras and allows for some really effective shots - expect to witness bokeh-overload on your Instagram feed as more people pick up the phone. The 7 Plus has the same 12 megapixel, f/1.8 aperture lens as the standard iPhone 7 but includes a second telephoto lens which allows for x2 optical zoom and realistic depth-of-field shots. The iPhone 7 has a larger battery than the iPhone 6S, and when teamed with the A10 Fusion's two "low power" cores, this should mean improved stamina. However, that isn't the case; the iPhone 7 doesn't seem to offer much of an advantage when compared to last year's model. The iPhone 7 Plus is a different story as the larger frame allows for a bigger capacity battery, but on the whole this feels like another area where Apple has lost ground to competitors. Phones like the Galaxy S7 and Xiaomi Mi5 are similar in size to the standard iPhone 7, yet they have larger power cells and consequently last much longer when away from a power socket. While we rarely got to the end of the day with a dead phone, there were a few times when overzealous usage caused the juice to drop to alarming low levels before bedtime - Pokémon Go usually being the main culprit. The iPhone 7's middling stamina is exacerbated by the fact that it lacks quick-charging and takes around 90 minutes to reach 100 per cent. Again, this is another area where Google has the upper hand; most leading Android handsets have some kind of fast charging capability which can fully boost the battery in less than an hour, while others also offer convenient wireless charging. Expect to see these features come to Apple's devices soon, when they will no doubt be acclaimed as totally ground-breaking. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus: the Digital Foundry verdict While the design might not have altered a great deal, it's clear that some big strides are made with this year's iPhones. Waterproofing is a huge plus point, and the traditional increase in processing power once again puts Apple at the front of the pack. Improvements with the camera and screen give further incentive for existing iPhone users to upgrade, and while the removal of the 3.5mm headphone socket is a pain, the expanded taptic engine does much to make up for it, allowing system-wide vibration feedback which can be felt in everything from scrolling menus to games. eSports already has a doping problem 'There is plenty of evidence that it can cause brain damage' Ditching the socket has also allowed Apple to include two powerful stereos speakers that sound leagues ahead of any other device on the market. The dual-camera setup on the 7 Plus is also worthy of note, with the secondary telephoto lens allowing for some neat tricks when it comes to composing the perfect image. It's also worth noting that this is the first year that Apple has made 32GB the base storage option - something that has been a long time coming. In terms of the basics, call audio quality is excellent, as is network and wireless connectivity. However, there's no denying that in some key areas, Apple's phones continue to lag behind the competition. Battery life is only a slight improvement over last year's offerings but remains disappointing when compared to rival handsets, and the lack of any kind of fast charging capability is almost unforgivable in 2016, especially on a phone which costs this much. While Samsung and Sony's flagships are in a similar price bracket, the Android sector is awash with much cheaper devices from companies like Xiaomi, Lenovo and Ulefone, many of which offer mod cons that are frustratingly absent on the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. The trade-off is getting one of the most powerful phones on the market with a well-stocked app store, tightly integrated software features and impeccable build quality. It's a sacrifice millions of users have been making for years, and the iPhone 7 is enough of an incremental update to maintain that pattern - and perhaps pick up a few new customers in the wake of Samsung's regrettable Galaxy Note 7 meltdown. iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 Plus review units kindly provided by Mobile Fun.

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Content Marketing Social Media Paid Search Work Life Events Advertise 4 Myths About Google Panda That Are Still Doing the Rounds SEO October 17, 2016 SEO Pratik DholakiyaOctober 17, 2016 558SHARES 1.5KREADS 558SHARES 1.5KREADS Pratik Dholakiya 558SHARES 1.5KREADS Google Panda was an update introduced in 2011, aimed at preventing low-quality content from gaming its way into the top ranking slots on SERPs. How Google feels about SEO is open to question, but we can say for sure that when you could just pump out reams of garbage content stuffed with keywords and get your site above the fold on the first page, they hated it. Panda’s whole purpose was to make search rank correlate with quality. Which is a good thing. Trouble is, Panda blew a lot of folks out of the water. Not just spammy listicles, keyword stuffers, and link buyers, but a whole slew of people who followed the best available advice in January 2011. Come February; Panda rolled out and their rankings were badly reduced. The workings of Google’s algorithms is always proprietary. We keep trying to guess; they keep changing the rules. As a result, there are beliefs about the way Panda actually works and even what it’s for that have clung on for years. Some of them aren’t true anymore; some of them were never true; all of them are myths that could lead you to waste your time and even potentially damage your search rank. #1 – There Will be a Panda Update Soon There sure will. Tomorrow, in fact – and the day after. In March of 2013, Google announced that Panda would become Panda “Everflux”, integrated with the basic search algorithm and updated constantly. This myth comes from the impact of the initial Panda rollout, when the desired effect of Panda – spammy sites tumbled down the rankings – were accompanied by numerous undesired outcomes including many scraped sites actually rising up the rankings. In short, the result of the initial Panda rollout was chaos. People look to the likelihood of a “new” Panda update in deep concern in case all that happens again. The worst downside of this myth is that we’re all like sportspeople taking our eyes off the ball to look at the (non-existent) UFO. There are important Google updates that are changing the way online business is conducted, and because they’re not labeled “Panda” we’re all looking the other way. Last April’s mobile-friendly update hit more sites than Panda (or Penguin, come to that) but it caused less of a stir. We’ve learned to live with Panda, and it’s helped a lot of us by making content marketing and search optimization a lot easier to align. #2 – The Duplicate Content Filter is Part of Panda This one is just totally untrue. It’s common, though, because they aim at similar results – rewarding quality – and they came in at the same time. In a Twitter discussion with Marie Haynes, Google’s John Mueller said categorically that “Those are 2 separate & independent things.” That seems pretty final. But it doesn’t mean that you’re not going to get slapped for having a bunch of duplicate content. Google has gotten a little more sophisticated at dealing with duplicate content over the years – after all, nearly every site has some. But large amounts will open you up to loss of traffic. It’s not technically a penalty. It sure feels like one when your traffic nosedives, but when you fix it and your site gets recrawled, the traffic should recover. That doesn’t happen with Panda penalties. There’s also a big difference between the effects of duplicate content within your site and duplicated content from elsewhere on the web: one dilutes traffic and the other sets red flags flying at Google HQ. E-commerce sites are particularly at risk here because they have thousands of product pages that might be using the manufacturer’s product descriptions or generic placeholders. Canonical tags for duplicate pages and your own copy are the cure. #3 – Too Much UGC Will Attract Panda User-generated content used to be the Holy Grail. It’s social proof, it’s content for free, and it’s proof of deep engagement. People don’t contribute content to websites they don’t care about. Post Panda, that began to change. And now SEOs are recommending that clients remove all the user-generated content from their websites. Once again, this is an overreaction based on misunderstanding what Panda’s all about. It’s not about user-generated, old, thin, whatever. It’s about quality. Some UGC is very high quality, while some is people telling you how you won’t believe how they made money online with this simple trick. Too much of that second kind can actually go against you, as Google’s John Mueller explains: “Another thing… which is common with forums is low-quality user-generated content. If you have ways of recognizing this kind of content, and blocking it from indexing, it can make it much easier for algorithms to review the overall quality of your website.” The alleged UGC price is even worse if your site is a forum or acts like one. In cases like Stack Overflow and Quora where almost all the content is user-generated, what is the risk that Google will hunt down spammy UGC? This very thing happened to Mozilla back in 2013. Mueller recommends cleaning house before you get hit with a penalty: “The same methods can be used to block forum spam from being indexed for your forum. Depending on the forum, there might be different ways of recognizing that automatically, but it’s generally worth finding automated ways to help you keep things clean & high-quality, especially when a site consists of mostly user-generated content.” It’s worth revisiting Mueller’s point about high-quality UGC: when you collate it right UGC campaigns can be among the best forms of content in Google’s eyes, as well as being inspiring and effective for users. Many forum sites run on a question-and-answer basis. One effective way of keeping poor content out of the bots’ claws without messing up your site’s running is to no-index pages that have questions but no answers or that have only posts from the OP of the thread. When useful content builds, those pages can be indexed. #4 – All Pages Need to be High Quality This is probably the biggest myth about Panda. That every single page needs to be perfect for the site to rank at all, and if there’s anything on there that Panda doesn’t like, the whole site will suffer. In fact, Panda is sometimes applied in quite a granular fashion and generally poor-quality penalties will hit individual pages, not the whole site. The site’s main pages can still rank well even if some of that site’s content doesn’t. What you’re looking for is the overall picture Google gets of your site. If you have an awesome site with a few bad pages, Panda might hit those pages but your site will rank well just the same. The other way around won’t work out so well. Yoast’s Joost de Valk explains: “Panda usually affects your site because you have too many low quality pages as a proportion of your overall number of pages.” Identifying pages that need to be fixed is a matter of checking in your analytics tool to find pages with low traffic and high bounce. Apply common sense: some pages might be really useful for the few visitors they get. Some might have what looks like a high bounce rate because visitors get what they need fast and leave. Conclusion Panda is a different beast when you look at it close up. Far from being capricious, Panda’s demands seem fairly reasonable when you know what they actually are and how to work with them. Don’t let myths about certain types of content, content length, or some impending Pandageddon update stop you from making your site Panda-friendly!

In other words, having good content may not be critical, but certainly highly beneficial. In addition, overall traffic to the site is beneficial to all internal pages, because people stay on the site longer and are more likely to click through various pages, lifting overall Pagerank.

Restaurants Home Nation / World Attack on internet: who did it? print Share | e-mail Facebook Tweet StumbleUpon Google Analysis Attack on internet: who did it? By Henry Farrell / Special to The Washington Post Published Oct 22, 2016 at 12:02AM As users of Twitter and many other services probably know, large parts of the internet weren’t working Friday, thanks to a hacking attack on the internet’s infrastructure. NBC reported that a senior intelligence official has told the network that the hack “does not appear at this point to be any kind of state-sponsored or directed attack.” It may be that new evidence emerges that leads the U.S. intelligence community to change its opinion and identify a major state as a responsible party. The scarier possibility is that it wasn’t a state that did it. The attack targeted the domain name system The internet relies on a complicated mix of systems and protocols to work. Friday’s attack targeted one key aspect of the internet — the domain name system. Every time that your desktop or phone browser asks to load the webpage for, say, http://www.washingtonpost.com, specialized servers need to turn the web address into a series of numbers — the so-called ‘IP address’ to figure out where the request ought to be sent to. The company that was hacked Friday runs part of the domain name system. The hackers sent so many requests to the domain name servers that they were completely overwhelmed. This kind of attack is called a ‘Distributed Denial of Service Attack’ or DDoS attack. It used to be thought of as a relatively unsophisticated instrument, and many forms of DDoS attack can be easily repelled, once the target of the attack realizes what is going on. Both activists (such as many members of the loose ‘Anonymous’ collective) and state actors (looking to silence inconvenient dissidents offshore) have used DDoS attacks in the past. Such attacks led Google to create Project Shield which was intended to deploy Google’s massive resources to protect those who might otherwise be effectively silenced by nefarious actors. These attacks have escalated Unfortunately, such attacks have escalated dramatically over time. The problem started with unsecured computers. Many people (almost certainly including readers of this article) are bad at keeping their computer operating systems updated, with the result that their computers have been quietly subverted and made part of ‘botnets’ made up of thousands of slaved machines. These computers can then be turned against a target system, repeatedly bombarding it with demands until it is effectively taken off the internet. Criminals have herded botnets to blackmail the owners of gambling websites by threatening to keep them offline with DDoS attacks until a ransom is paid. Recently, however, the stakes have escalated yet again. The so-called ‘Internet of Things’ — the many consumer products which are somehow connected to the internet — has created new opportunities for botnet herders, because these products tend to be badly secured and are usually never updated. Brian Krebs, a prominent writer and consultant on security, has often been targeted by various attacks by the criminals he writes about. Last month, he was hit by a truly massive attack mounted by a botnet of compromised devices. Friday’s attack uses the same ‘Mirai’ system, which was recently released into the wild so that anyone with moderate technical skills can use it to compromise and set up their own network of devices. Anyone could be responsible As Krebs pointed out in a follow-up blog post, the truly frightening thing is that anyone could be responsible. It used to be that only states had the firepower to mount really dramatic attacks like this. Now, as one of Krebs’ friends puts it, “When it comes to DDoS attacks, nation-states are just another player … so that today’s reality is that DDoS attacks have become the Great Equalizer between private actors & nation-states.” One shouldn’t push this analogy too far. Other kinds of cyberattack — such as the attack that the United States and Israel reportedly mounted on the Iranian nuclear program — require bespoke skills and customization, and are out of the reach of all but sophisticated nation states. Even so, taking down a large chunk of the internet, as Friday’s attack apparently did, is well within the grasp of small criminal groups and other ordinary actors. Equally, the fact that this is possible for ordinary actors may provide opportunities for states to undertake nefarious activities without getting the blame. Many of the techniques used to identify the perpetrators of cyberattacks rely on ‘fingerprints’ in the computer code underlying the attack. For example, if you are mounting one attack, it may be cheaper and easier for you to redeploy code that you have already used in others, than to write everything from scratch. This may, in turn, make it easier to identify you. Such identification techniques will be harder to use against DDoS attacks like this one, which deploy code that is widely available, and hence impossible to attribute to another actor. There may be other means of identification (for example, there might be bugs in the source code that could be exploited to pinpoint whoever is running it), but we don’t know for certain. This might tempt states as well as non-state actors to use this system to mount DDoS attacks in the belief that others will likely be blamed. The underlying problem is tough to solve These attacks are likely to continue — and get worse — as long as more devices are released that can be subverted and slaved by botnets. Unfortunately, as another prominent security expert, Bruce Schneier, argues, that’s going to keep on happening. The producers of buggy and insecure cameras, baby monitors and so on have no incentive to improve them, since no one can sue them for the side effects of their carelessness. The users of the products don’t have any reason to care either. Schneier suggests that we might at least begin to address the problem by regulating manufacturers, or by making it possible for the victims of attacks, like Krebs, to sue them. This is, as Schneier certainly knows, unlikely under current political circumstances. The business community has resisted such mandates and rights for decades, and almost certainly still has enough political clout to continue to resist. 15398049 View next article in Nation & World     Get Central Oregon's top headlines delivered to your inbox every morning GO print version Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus. comments powered by Disqus This image is copyrighted.

Using Ugly Email Extension To Identify Tracked Emails All that the user needs to do is just Open their Google Chrome browser on the PC, search for Ugly Email in the Webstore and click on "Add to Chrome" to save yourself from tracked emails. After adding it to Chrome, whenever the user login into their Gmail account or open emails, there will appear an evil eye sign, which means the email has been tracked by a hacker. #2 Google 2 Step Verification is the Best Way to Keep Hackers Away Google Verification process is extremely secure and safe and keeps Gmail accounts safe from various disasters and hackers. To make it work properly, the Gmail user has to provide with a one-time login code to a secondary device either via text or Google authentication app. Hence, in case someone is trying to hack your account, the hacker has to identify the security code for the secondary devices also, which is extremely difficult, and in turn protects your account. #3 Avoid Any Such Spam or Phishing Messages A Gmail user should avoid any malicious emails, and especially the ones starting with a subline like "Your money is waiting" "Claim your reward" and so on. It is recommended to not open such emails that you receive from unknown recipients. #4 Always Try to Keep Your Contact Number Up-to-Date It often happens that you change your mobile number, and your Gmail account, or other social media accounts are registered under your previous number. It is recommended to up to date your account with the number you are using, to keep an eye on any malicious activities happening with your account. SEE ALSO: 5 Easy Steps to Capture A Screenshot in Google Chrome Without Installing An Extension   #5 Using a Recovery Email Address is a Must Other than updating the mobile number to get updates on malicious activities, every Gmail user is required to update an alternative email address as well. This is because email address is the other option that Google uses for sending security codes and in case you forget your password, the security code to login to login to your Gmail account will be sent to the secondary email id.

Australia had 817 run metres to 583, and laid 86 tackles while forcing New Zealand into 183, plus also dominated possession for large periods of the game, but they lacked the finesse and finishing touch to get the job done. The disallowed try that would have made it 15-15 set them back, but they weren’t beaten by the ref. Their formidable opponent simply crushed them in the final 20 minutes. With this win, New Zealand have 18 straight Test wins, a new world record, and the Wallabies are still to break through for an Eden Park Test win since their last in 1986. That’s some hoodoo, but this is a helluva rugby team. There’s daylight between them and the Wallabies right now.

New Zealand win 37-10 as Australia run out of legs And with that, the All Blacks take their world record 18th straight win in what ended up a six tries to one drubbing, a scoreline that doesn’t reflect Australia’s guts and tenacity for a large part of that encounter. But...the Wallabies just weren’t good enough. No excuses. They lacked that little bit of polish and class, and fumbled around when chances presented themselves. Gallant, just not quite good enough. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.27am EDT 04:27 79 min: This game is just meandering to its conclusion now but in the interests of Trans-Tasman bitterness, the local fans are still doing a great job of booing Cooper and Israel Dagg soon scoots through for his second try after a pass from Cruden. But...it’s a forward pass. Dagg wastes an enthusiastic celebration of the feat, too. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.25am EDT 04:25 78 min: Oh dear, it’s getting worse for the Wallabies now as Reece Hodge is flattened in a big tackle.

Quade Cooper then appears for his heel turn and he’s welcomed onto the field with a quite predictable round of boos.

New Zealand 37-10 Australia (Coles 72) 72 min: This game is getting a little ragged now as the Aussies flag in their spirits and the All Blacks throw the ball around with no small amount of flair. They’ve got their foot to the floor and the Wallabies are a little helpless to stop it. Savea goes within half a metre of a hat-trick but turns in the tackle to put Dane Coles through instead! Coles deserved that as it was his big tackle on Dean Mumm that caused the turnover in the first place.

New Zealand 30-10 Australia (Savea 68) 67 min: Foley is still trying to find gaps but he’s monstered in a few big tackles. But...they Aussies produce an overlap and swiftly move to 22m before things break down and the All Blacks force a turnover, working it wide to Savea, who just pulverises a couple of would-be tacklers on his way to a second try. That was brutal. It’s all falling apart for Australia. That’s Savea’s 45th All Blacks try and his ninth double.

New Zealand 25-10 Australia (Cruden 64) 64 min: This game was alive 10 minutes back but an Aaron Cruden penalty goal here makes things difficult for the Wallabies. They’ve been gallant, but lacked polish. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.09am EDT 04:09 62 min: Reader Ken McMahon writes in from Switzerland and agrees that some of the All Blacks could slap a smile on their dials. “No doubt I am not the only one to think it: you’d think slick ball movement would make him smile more...or is that the preserve of Aaron Smith” he asks. Both sides are ringing the changes now (Perenara off, Kerr-Barlow on for the ABs) but this All Blacks buffer suddenly looks a healthy one. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 4.05am EDT 04:05 60 min: Australia are even winning lineouts tonight, as per one here 22m out. Foley gets it out to Folau and the Wallabies look like they’re on but the giant Aussie couldn’t quite release the pass when a host of options presented themselves. Australia have another one-man overlap on phase five but Reece Hodge has the same problem as Folau. A little slicker with their passing and Australia could be leading right now. So often they’ve released pressure right when they looked to have some ascendancy.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.52am EDT 03:52 50 min: just another incident out of that near-try: the big tackle on Rory Arnold has crocked the towering Australian and he limps off, grimacing noticeably. Israel Folau takes the Wallabies to 15m out and they’re on the charge again, as Simmons slips through to take them inside 10, where the All Blacks are offside. Matt Burke reckons the home side is “rattled”, but I might reserve judgement for another 20 minutes or so. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.49am EDT 03:49 47 min: Well, how will that call change the complexion of the game? The Wallabies need to get on with the job but that decision will have irked them. Replays indicated the try would be allowed but New Zealand got the rub of the green. And now...has Dane Coles scored a loose ball try after he kicked it clear for New Zealand from a Rory Arnold turnover? We see it from more angles than the Kennedy assassination but no try is the ruling! That seems almost karmic.

Was Ardie Savea blocked from getting near Speight in his pursuit of the try-scorer? Yes in the eyes of the refs! Oh dear. The Australians are fuming.

Not only that, but they have a half chance for another try as the hooter approaches. They go forward, there’s a string of passes....and then a turnover. And that’s it. An absorbing first half comes to its conclusion and New Zealand take the honours, but only just. “We’re playing in the right areas of the field,” says Wallaby Bernard Foley. “We’ve just gotta be resilient and stick at it... If we stay at it we’ll get the reward.

But for a knock-on, the All Blacks were on for a third try soon after. There was a finger-tip in it. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.12am EDT 03:12 30 min: Reece Hodge has a 50m kick now, and with that stiff breeze in the back of his mind, pulls it right.

New Zealand 10-5 Australia (Arnold 28) 28 min: Some action! Bernard Foley slips a tackle and gains a few metres and Phipps also has a bright moment, but it’s pretty sloppy work by the Wallabies as they meander their way forward but out of nowhere ‘Three storey’ Rory Arnold slips free with an ungainly try, which has come completely against the run of play! Put that one down to Bernard Foley, folks. Rory Arnold scores. Photograph: Fiona Goodall/Getty Images Updated at 4.05am EDT Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.07am EDT 03:07 26 min: As Matt Burke tries to think up new and ever more polite ways of describing Australia’s woeful scrum, and eventually settles on a theory that it “sucks the oxygen out of your legs” when you’re down there. I’m heading for an anatomy and physiology text book to verify that claim. I’ll let you know what I find. The crowd is so bored right now they’ve registered their disgust with a Mexican wave. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.03am EDT 03:03 23 min: Michael Collins arrives with our first email of the night: “I’m no expert in gate technology but isn’t a rusty gate actually going to swing open with some difficulty? (It’s early; I’m tired; and the cricket’s going badly. So I’m grumpy).” Hmm, you could be right there, Michael. Does Australia doing very badly in rugby balance out England doing very badly in cricket? That seems about right to me. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 3.01am EDT 03:01 22 min: This has been a half-decent five minutes for the Wallabies, but they’ve got nothing to show for it yet, and they’re penalised for not releasing when they spread it wide. Tackles? 43-13 in favour of New Zealand. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.59am EDT 02:59 21 min: Kepu has his first decent run of the night for the Aussies and Foley creates a nice opening. Sio charges forward towards the try line but a lack of composure costs the Wallabies as Kerevi eftly avoids three tacklers but then fires off a slightly shambolic pass, which goes forward into the hands of the All Blacks. One step forward, two steps back. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.56am EDT 02:56 19 min: Dean Mumm does a power of work to force a turnover and a scrum for his side out of an All Blacks lineout, bear-hugging a New Zealand opponent and the ball at the base of the pack. New Zealand waste their dominance of the scrum and Foley goes for touch in the aftermath. I think you know what happens next: the ABs pick the lineout like a dirty nose. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.54am EDT 02:54 17 min: Michael Hooper’s almost through for the Wallabies but his torso gets a little too far out in front of his legs as he streams forward and his face receives some panel-beating at the hands of the oncoming turf. There’s only brief moments of ascendancy for Australia. “It’s almost a hatred between the players at the moment,” says Gordon Bray, and the ref calls both teams in for a bollocking. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.52am EDT 02:52 16 min: Chaos! The Aussies make a hash of the possession but then so do the All Blacks as well in a helter skelter minute of rugby, when Australia twice look like scoring but eventually squander it. There’s a lot of niggle out there, as you’d expect. It’s lippy, chippy, and the Aussies are under the kosh. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.50am EDT 02:50 14 min: New Zealand have had 67% of the possession so far, if that wasn’t obvious from the scoreline. Israel Folau continues to charge in and try to make things happen for the Wallabies but they’re up against it as they fumble their way to the 22m line and earn a penalty. Foley uses it to go for touch – about eight metres out. I like it. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 2.48am EDT 02:48 12 min: Beauden Barrett has been sublime this season but he’s just missed his second conversion of the night as the swirling breeze continues to wreak havoc on both sides’ kicking game.

New Zealand 10-0 Australia (Brown 10) 10 min: Australia have already missed seven tackles, compared with New Zealand’s one, as the packs line up for a scrum and Aussie Scott Sio is punished by the ref for not binding. The All Blacks do far better with their second lineup of the night and Lienert-Brown scoots clear for another try in what’s been a shocking start for Australia. Henry Speight almost reeled in an interception there but in missing it he opened the path for an easy try. Anton Lienert-Brown touches down with ease.

We’ll start with the obvious. Australia haven’t beaten the All Blacks in New Zealand since 2001, when the Baha Men’s “Who Let the Dogs Out?” was enjoying its three-month run at the top of the charts and each member of The Strokes still had hair. What hope do the Wallabies have tonight at Eden Park? Well, none. They haven’t won at this venue in three full decades and face a side looking for its 18th win on the bounce. The ABs haven’t lost on home soil since 2009, nor at Eden Park since 1994. It’s been 18 matches since the Wallabies last won at any New Zealand venue. I’d call that a tall task of Robert Wadlow dimensions, wouldn’t you? The Aussies are sitting on three wins from nine starts this year – hardly imposing – but they’ve at least changed things up for tonight’s game; Quade Cooper heads to the bench, Bernard Foley returns to hatural habitat of flyhalf, while Reece Hodge pairs with Samu Kerevi in the centres. The net result is that Henry Speight gets to return on the wing. David Pocock is also back earlier than expected from a wrist injury (OK, quieten down there at the back of the room) and takes his place on the bench. New Zealand head into this one with a 57-15 thrashing of the Springboks as preparation. Julian Savea gets the nod in front of Waisake Naholo for the starting side, while Matt Todd is favoured ahead of Ardie Savea for the starting seven spot. Can the Wallabies cause the upset of the year and party like it’s 1986? With a lineout like theirs, probably not, but that shouldn’t stop the rest of us.

By Owen Hughes October 22, 2016 07:00 BST Unified Android toolkit for Pixel and Pixel XL devicesIBTimes UK The Pixel and Pixel XL have been built to showcase the power of Android and Google's vision of the operating system at its purest, most intuitive form. Google Assistant undoubtedly steals the spotlight, yet there are a number of features tucked beneath the surface that will let you get the most out of Alphabet's new flagships. We've dug out the best hidden features, tips and tricks to help get you up and running with your new smartphone, and be sure to check out our Google Pixel XL review when you're done. 1) Use a Night Light Studies have shown that the blue light omitted from smartphone displays and other gadgets can interfere with our sleep. Google has now built a Night Light feature straight into Android 7 that filters out blue light and help you get a better night's rest. You can toggle this manually from the notifications panel or set it to come on automatically by going to Settings>Display>Night Light>Turn on Automatically. You can set it to come on from sunset to sunrise, or use custom times. Moves add useful gesture inputs to the PixelIBTimes UK 2) Bust out the Moves The Pixel comes with a handful of gesture shortcuts that are disabled by default but are actually quite useful. This includes a feature that will let you quickly switch between the front and back camera by quickly double-twisting the phone, another for letting you boot up the camera from any screen by double-pressing the power button, and a gesture that will let you check your notifications by swiping down on the fingerprint sensor. All of these are easy to switch on by going to Settings>Moves, and from there you can toggle each Move as you wish. 3) Be a battery saver There's something reassuring about being able to see exactly how much battery you have remaining. You can modify the battery icon on the Google Pixel to show the percentage you have remaining by pulling down on the notifications bar and then holding the Setting cogwheel for a few seconds. A system message will pop up on-screen once you've done this successfully. Once unlocked, go to Settings and scroll all the way down to System UI Tuner at the bottom. Open it and go to Status bar>Battery>Always show percentage. Also worth setting up is battery saver mode, which will automatically kick your phone into a low-power mode when your battery dips below a certain threshold. You'll find this within Settings>Battery>Battery saver. 4K video capture isn't enabled by default, so you'll have to dip into your camera settingsIBTimes UK 4) Enable 4K video The Google Pixel is capable of shooting video in glorious 4K, and with Google offering free and unlimited cloud photo storage with its new flagship, there's no reason not to. The camera's video setting is set to 1080p by default though, so to crack up the resolution open the camera app, swipe right and hit Settings. Scroll down to Video>Back camera video resolution and hit UHD 4K. 5) Make Assistant work for you Google Assistant is Google's answer to Siri and one of the first things you should test out after purchasing your Pixel. You can make it even more useful by tailoring the info it serves you based on your location and interests. Sadly, this feature is only available in the US for now. To do so, launch Google Assistant by long-pressing the home button, tap on the menu icon in the top left corner and hit Settings. From there you can customise the websites it pulls your news from and what info to include in your daily agenda. 6) Liven up your wallpapers The Google Pixel's Live Data wallpaper shows a colour gradient that changes according to time and weather conditions where you are. This is all well and good for more exotic parts of the world, but in the UK this means you're likely to be staring at a grey background six days out of seven. Fortunately the Pixel also comes with a range of Google Earth and satellite pictures you can chose from. To keep things looking fresh, you can set this to change every 24 hours. You can do this by long-pressing the home screen, hitting Wallpapers, scrolling to the category of your choice and pressing Daily wallpaper. Head into your Wi-Fi settings to enable Wi-Fi AssistantIBTimes UK 7) Boost your browsing experience with Wi-Fi Assistant You can set your Pixel phone to automatically switch between Wi-Fi and 4G/3G networks while browsing the web depending on which has the strongest signal at a given time. This is useful because it helps you preserve mobile data, meaning worry-free browsing and content streaming. To activate Wi-Fi Assistant, go to Settings>Wi-Fi and press the cog wheel in the top right corner, then hit Use open Wi-Fi automatically. To keep you safe on public Wi-Fi networks, Wi-Fi Assistant automatically passes your data through a VPN to keep your personal information hidden and secure. 8) Dip into Developer settings The Pixel and Pixel XL are already pretty nippy devices, but you can make things even faster under your finger by tweaking animation settings. You first have to unlock the Developer options, which are hidden by default. To do this, go to Settings and scroll all the way down to About phone. Then scroll down to Build number and tap it repeatedly. This will unlock the hidden Develop options menu, which will now appear near the bottom of the main Settings menu. Once in Developer options, scroll down to Drawing. Beneath this are options for Window animation scale, Transition animation scale and Animator durations scale. These options let you tweak how long the respective animations last for. The lower the number, the quicker windows, transitions and animations will respond to touch input. There are a lot of other Developer options you can tweak from this menu, although it's been purposely hidden, intended only for power users. We'd recommend against fiddling around with them unless you know what you're doing. It won't damage the phone but could affect the way it works. Launcher shortcuts takes a leaf out of iOS's bookIBTimes UK 9) Use Launcher shortcuts Long-pressing app icons on the Pixel will bring up shortcuts similar to the iPhone 7's 3D Touch feature, which will let you dive into specific app functions. For example, holding the Gmail app icon will give you the option of jumping straight into composing an email. Similarly, long-pressing the phone icon will bring up your favourite contacts and let you dial them without having to leave the home screen. This feature appears to be limited to a selection of Google's own apps for the time being, although much like 3D Touch we expect it will be expanded to third-party developers in the near future. 10) Be security smart With fingerprint, face and retina scanning, smartphones are better than ever when it comes to keeping our content secure. That said, you can never be too careful and Google lets you add an extra layer of security to your phone with Smart Lock, which automatically keeps your phone tablet locked when it's not with you, and unlocked when your device is safe. For example, you can choose to have your device unlock when it detects another connected nearby device, such as a smartwatch, or when it's located in a 'trusted place' – at home or in the office, for example. To set up Smart Lock, head to Settings>Security>Smart Lock and chose when you want you Pixel to automatically lock. A word of caution: on-body detection will keep your phone unlocked while you're carrying it, but won't necessarily be able to tell the difference between you and someone else.

The Indian Express Nation World Opinion Entertainment Lifestyle Technology Viral Photos Videos E-Paper Apps RSS Home Compare News Mobile & Tabs Gadgets Science Indian Express Home Home Technology Mobile & Tabs Google Pixel positive reviews pushes Alphabet shares to record high Google Pixel positive reviews pushes Alphabet shares to record high With Pixel, Google is getting into Apple's territory displacing Samsung as Apple's major hardware competitor By: Tech Desk | Published:October 22, 2016 11:17 am With Pixel, Google is becoming Apple’s new competitor with some serious ambition (Source: AP) Alphabet Inc. shares hit a record high on Tuesday after mostly positive reviews for its new Pixel phones, the first line of phones designed in-house by its Google unit. The Mountain View, California-based company’s stock gained 2.5 percent to $826.85 at 2.43PM in New York, after earlier reaching $828, the highest price since August 19, 2004, when Google’s shares were first traded in the public markets. The mostly positive reviews are a change for Google, a company that has occasionally pushed out glitch-ridden devices before they were ready for mainstream consumption. Google executive Rick Osterloh told Bloomberg News earlier this month that the company would continue to produce new hardware annually. The Verge’s Walt Mossberg called the new phone “easily the best” Android phone he had ever tested, praising the device’s automated Assistant voice feature and camera system, but panning its battery life. TechCrunch’s Darrell Etherington said the Pixel’s camera is a “terrific photo and video experience,” but said Apple Inc.’s iPhone 7 still produces more accurate colors. Youssef Squali, an analyst at Cantor Fitzgerald, attributed Alphabet’s share gain to the support for the Pixel and confidence after Netflix Inc.’s positive quarterly results on Monday. “Part of it is the Pixel reviews, which have been more positive than I expected,” Squali said. “Partly it’s the Netflix effect. Great earnings. Google is reporting next week. There’s hope for a strong quarter from all internet companies.” J&K Schools: Amid Shutdown, Restrictions, Board Examinations Begin Ghazipur: PM Modi Flags Off Shabd Bhedi Express Ghazipur: PM Modi Promises To Open Files Of Patel Committee This Is How People Celebrate Guru Nanak Jayanti Nation Celebrates Guru Nanak Jayanti Demonetisation: Brinda Karat Calls PM Modi’s Speech ‘Drama’ Vizag Police Nabs Prisoners Escaped From Warangal Central Jail Demonetisation Will Affect Fashion Industry Only In Short Run, Feels Designer Sabyasachi New Zealand: Two Killed In 7.8 Magnitude Earthquake Demonetisation: Banking Correspondents Can Withdraw Cash Multiple Times, Says Shaktikanta Das PM Modi Claims Demonetisation Has Left Corrupts With ‘No Option’ Golfer Aditi Ashok becomes first Indian Woman to lift European Tour Event PM Modi at KLE: Win gold medals for India in 2020 Olympics Idea Exchange With Ujjal Dosanjh India Manage A Draw After Anxious Day 5 Google Pixel is a big deviation from Google’s older Nexus program.

These files could provide insights regarding these devices difference with models of the Nexus line.  ( Google ) Advertisement Google has already published the latest over-the-air (OTA) update images and Pixel factory images at the tech company's developers' page last Oct. 20. This news should be welcome for the tech-savvy crowd out there who likes to tinker with their Android devices. To those wondering what these "images" are all about, these are the files necessary to manually restore or update Google phones beginning with the Nexus line. The factory images can restore the phone's original factory setting. This is particularly handy for users who encountered errors when rooting or customizing their devices. Unlike the OTA images, however, the installation of the factory images will wipe out all data from the device. The OTA images, on the other hand, merely update the device. "This has the same effect of flashing the corresponding factory images, but without the need of wiping the device," Google explained how the OTA images works. Google has provided all the details and instructions such as the six-step OTA update application as well as key security warnings when proceeding with the update. But Nexus and Pixel phone owners are advised to proceed with caution especially if they do not have experience rooting their handsets. The posting of the Pixel and Nexus factory and OTA files also provides an opportunity for the public to compare the differences between the Nexus phones and the latest Google Pixel phones. However, since the files have been recently posted, there is still scant information in this respect. This is bound to change as developers start to evaluate all the information. So far, we only know that Google has provided the Google Pixel and Pixel XL three builds each. The former, which was also identified in the post as Sailfish, has the 7.1.0 (NDE63H), 7.1.0 (NDE63L) and 7.1.0 (NDE63P). The three downloadable builds for Pixel XL, also referred to as Marlin include 7.1.0 (NDE63H), 7.1.0 (NDE63L) and 7.1.0 (NDE63P). The three build versions are reportedly identical. The distinction is said to be based on the three regions where both phones are being sold. If you are ready to flash or update your Pixel device, do not forget to check if it is bootloader unlockable. As Tech Times previously reported, Pixel phones bought from Verizon are unlocked. You should also be mindful that unlocking the bootloader, which is necessary to flash your device, will void its support for Android Pay. Using the factory image will wipe all your phone's data.

Log in Sign up Login with Facebook Login with Google Go Advanced News Reviews Phones Home News Blog Reviews Comments (29) Post your comment Watch the Google Pixel and LG V20 go through scratch and burn tests 21 October 2016 YouTuber JerryRigEverything is back with a couple of new scratch and burn durability tests. He performs endurance tests on smartphones by testing how easily every component on the outside of the phone can be damaged with either razors, Mohs hardness picks, or a lighter to test the 'degradability' of pixels over time. Starting off with the scratch test, the Google Pixel features Gorilla Glass 4 and begins scratching above a Mohs hardness scale level of 6. Nothing out of the ordinary there. The earpiece is a concern at it is not a metal mesh, but made of some kind of tough fabric. The YouTuber reminds owners to be careful not to puncture the earpiece when cleaning. As for the razor test, the front glass resisted well against the blade while the rear glass showed light scratches. With the same razor, he scratched the aluminum unibody, but its worth noting that his key and coin scratches rubbed right off. As for the fingerprint scanner on the Really Blue model, the razor made deep scratches into the scanners coating, but the fingerprint scanner worked perfectly fine afterwards, nonetheless. The bend test of the Google Pixel really shows HTCs exceptional design. Unlike the case with the Nexus 6P, which failed the bend test on the YouTubers channel, twice, the Google Pixel is built very sturdy and the area near the volume key didnt dent like the 6Ps did. The LG V20 went off to a rocky start as both the top and bottom bezels of the phone are made of just plastic. But, thankfully, the earpiece is made of metal, just like all the buttons found on the device. Much like the Google Pixels fingerprint scanner, however, the LG V20s fingerprint sensor is also able to read a print 100% of the time, despite its surface being mercilessly scratched. While keys and coins mark the Pixel, they didnt cause any permanent damage, as the Pixels key and coin marks rubbed right off. It appears the iPhone 7 did better in the key test, and the Pixel did even better with the same test. The camera comes with a small protector which should be left on. As the YouTuber scratched the bare glass surface, a few seconds passed before the entire rear camera glass shattered as it became weak. Bringing it to the bend test, the removable battery of the LG V20 doesnt grant it the same amount of structural integrity found in other smartphones with internal batteries. So while the LG V10 handled the bend test a little better, the V20 still passes this guys durability test.

Most Popular Every weekday, we bring you the Ad Age/iSpot Hot Spots, new and trending TV commercials tracked by iSpot.tv, a company that catalogs, tags and measures activity around TV ads in real time. The New Releases here ran on TV for the first time yesterday. The Most Engaging ads are showing sustained social heat, ranked by SpotShare scores reflecting the percent of digital activity associated with each one over the past week. See the methodology here. Among the new releases, Lady Gaga teases her performance of "Joanne" on Facebook Live as part of her Dive Bar Tour with Bud Light and a man fails to leave a good impression with his new girlfriend's friends when eating Taco Bell's Rolled Chicken Tacos. Google introduces its Pixel phone with an ad that emphasizes its newness ("like doesn't have a version number new"), while Verizon promotes its exclusivity as the only carrier for the Pixel. Finally, execs at Verizon are seen sweating, fainting and hiding due to news of Sprint's network reliability and discounted rates in Sprint's latest spot.

So far we've seen a Halloween costume, a GTA V prank and an iPhone case depicting the discontinued handset. Now, even US President Barack Obama, who's been slyly upping his comedy game these last few months, has taken a shot at the Note 7. On Thursday, while speaking in Miami, he suddenly skewed off course to make an analogy about phones when discussing the Affordable Care Act (ie, ObamaCare). Advertisement - Continue Reading Below This is a simultaneous 🔥🔥🔥 on Samsung, Republicans and rotary phones. pic.twitter.com/HkHJeUfbL7 — Dan Diamond (@ddiamond) October 20, 2016 "If the phone has a few bugs, he said, they don't throw it away. They fix it. They upgrade it," Obama begins the explanation. Then, with a trademark giggle, he added: "Unless it catches fire. Then you pull it off the market." Damn, somebody out there apply cold water to the searing burn Samsung just received, please. Obama continued by saying: "But you don't go back to using a rotary phone. You don't say, 'Well, we're repealing smartphones. We're just gonna do the dial-up thing.' That's not what you do." It's not yet clear if Samsung will or won't release a rotary phone as a result of the Note 7 saga, with rumours actually indicating at this stage that the Galaxy S8 will steal certain features from the failed smartphone. Oh, and don't expect any more Note-related mishaps next year for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton to join in on, with Samsung reportedly set to only release one flagship in 2017.

You’ll receive free e-mail news updates each time a new story is published. You’re all set! Sign up *Invalid email address Got it Got it By Henry Farrell October 21 Follow @henryfarrell Twitter was unavailable for much of Friday after a massive attack on the underpinnings of the Internet. (Leon Neal/Agence France-Presse via Getty Images) As users of Twitter and many other services probably know, large parts of the Internet weren’t working Friday, thanks to a hacking attack on the Internet’s infrastructure. NBC reported that a senior intelligence official told the network that the hack “does not appear at this point to be any kind of state-sponsored or directed attack.” It may be that new evidence emerges that leads the U.S. intelligence community to change its opinion and identify a major state as a responsible party. The scarier possibility is that it wasn’t a state that did it. The attack targeted the domain name system. The Internet relies on a complicated mix of systems and protocols to work. Friday’s attack targeted a key aspect of the Internet — the domain name system. Every time your desktop or phone browser asks to load the Web page for, say, http://www.washingtonpost.com, specialized servers need to turn the Web address into a series of numbers — the IP address — to figure out where the request ought to be sent. The company that was hacked Friday runs part of the domain name system. The hackers sent so many requests to the domain name servers that they were overwhelmed. This kind of attack is called a distributed denial of service attack, or DDoS attack. It used to be thought of as a relatively unsophisticated instrument, and many forms of DDoS can be easily repelled, once the target of the attack realizes what is going on. Both activists (such as members of the loose Anonymous collective) and state actors (looking to silence inconvenient dissidents offshore) have used DDoS attacks in the past. Such attacks led Google to create Project Shield, which was intended to deploy Google’s massive resources to protect actors who might otherwise be effectively silenced by nefarious actors. These attacks have escalated. Unfortunately, such attacks have escalated dramatically over time. The problem started with unsecured computers. Many people (almost certainly including readers of this article) are bad at keeping their computer operating systems updated, with the result that their computers have been quietly subverted and made part of ‘botnets’ made up of thousands of enslaved machines. These computers can then be turned against a target system, repeatedly bombarding it with demands until it is effectively taken off the Internet. Criminals have herded botnets to blackmail the owners of gambling websites by threatening to keep them offline with DDoS attacks until a ransom is paid. Recently, however, the stakes have escalated. What’s called the “Internet of Things” — the many consumer products connected to the Internet — has created opportunities for botnet herders because these products tend to be badly secured and are usually never updated. Brian Krebs, a prominent writer and consultant on security, has often been targeted by the criminals he writes about. Last month, he was hit by a massive attack mounted by a botnet of compromised devices. Friday’s attack used the same ‘Mirai’ system, which was recently released into the wild so that anyone with moderate technical skills could use it to compromise and set up their own network of devices. Anyone could be responsible. As Krebs pointed out in a follow-up blog post, the truly frightening thing is that anyone could be responsible. It used to be that only states had the firepower to mount really dramatic attacks like this. Now, as one of Krebs’s friends puts it, “When it comes to DDoS attacks, nation-states are just another player. Today’s reality is that DDoS attacks have become the Great Equalizer between private actors & nation-states.” One shouldn’t push this analogy too far. Other kinds of cyberattacks — such as the attack that the United States and Israel reportedly mounted on the Iranian nuclear program — require bespoke skills and customization and are out of the reach of all but sophisticated nation-states. Even so, taking down a large chunk of the Internet, as Friday’s attack apparently did, is well within the grasp of small criminal groups and other ordinary actors. Equally, the fact that this is possible for ordinary actors may provide opportunities for states to undertake nefarious activities without getting the blame. Many of the techniques used to identify the perpetrators of cyberattacks rely on “fingerprints” in the computer code underlying the attack. For example, if you are mounting an attack, it may be cheaper and easier for you to redeploy code that you have already used in others than to write everything from scratch. This may, in turn, make it easier to identify you. Such identification techniques will be harder to use against DDoS attacks like this one, which deploy code that is widely available and hence impossible to attribute to another actor. There may be other means of identification (for example, there might be bugs in the source code that could be exploited to pinpoint whoever is running it), but we don’t know for certain. This might tempt states as well as nonstate actors to use this system to mount DDoS attacks in the belief that others will likely be blamed. The underlying problem is tough to solve. These attacks are likely to continue — and get worse — as long as more devices are released that can be subverted and slaved by botnets. Unfortunately, as another prominent security expert, Bruce Schneier, argues, that’s going to keep on happening. The producers of buggy and insecure cameras, baby monitors and so on have no incentive to improve them, since no one can sue them for the side effects of their carelessness. The users of the products don’t have any reason to care, either. Schneier suggests that we might at least begin to address the problem by regulating manufacturers, or by making it possible for the victims of attacks, like Krebs, to sue them. This is, as Schneier certainly knows, unlikely under current political circumstances. The business community has resisted such mandates and rights for decades and almost certainly still has enough political clout to continue to resist. 1 of 15 Full Screen Autoplay Close Skip Ad × See where the Internet lives: Inside Google’s data centers View Photos Take a look inside the company’s data centers around the world.

IVANCA About me Google will be your enemy, and one who knows you a little too well Do you think Google would sell all your personal information to ISIS for $200? I think they would, as long as nobody notices it, meaning if it doesn’t get bad PR or any sort of repercussion; plausible deniability could be enough: “We sold your information to someone! Oops we didn’t know it was ISIS! Sorry!” How did it come to this? Well, there wasn’t a clear point where you decided to give up your information in exchange for good search engines and a good mail system; it just was 1998 and you were in front of a computer looking to navigate this new thing called the Internet, and someone told you that there is this thing called Google where you can search anything at all; how convenient! The thing is, that first time they forgot to put in big red letters a message saying “Welcome to Google. We will track the searches -and every activity- you do today and every search you do from now on until the day you die, they all will be logged on our archive about you, we can and will do anything we please with such data, specially advertisement, but more importantly, we have no restrictions, even if there are any restriction written in our current terms-of-services it doesn’t matter, because our terms-of-service can by changed by us at any given time in the future without prior notice.” Until recently Google had a little rule about not tracking you on third-party sites, but no more, and the thing is, it doesn’t even matter if the sites you visited have Google plus or not, because tracking you was done (and is being done) with the help of Google Analytics, Google Maps, Gmail, Google JavaScript CDN, Google Play apps, Google Android (all of it), Google Images, Google APIs, Google Blogger Widgets, Google YouTube videos. Basically, they probably know more about you than yourself, you don’t remember what pages were you visiting this day one year ago? Well, Google does. Do you think removing this rule is where Google stops? Do you think tomorrow they will not try to push a little further what they allow themselves to do with your data? They will, even worst if Google stock starts falling when they will try to monetize your data with more ethically dubious tactics, and if the stock falls even further they will try something a little more unethical, and so forth. This is actually the only aspect where I believe Apple has an edge over the competition, is not the pretty smartphones or the cute user interfaces; its that their incentives are actually aligned with their clients interests’, because they don’t make money selling your info, they make money by selling you the next inane iPhone/iPad upgrade, and as long as you keep buying their incentives will match. I know, this all sounds too fear-mongering and I’m sure you are (and will be) more useful for Google if you continue breathing and out of jail, but the room for damage is big enough to be worrisome. Oh yeah, and then there is Facebook, but I will leave that one for your imagination, or perhaps your nightmares. 3 weeks ago 1 note devilduck liked this ivanca posted this

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Fabriq is the first Alexa-powered portable speaker By Ida Torres - October 21, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Alexa, the intelligent personal assistant that is part of Amazon Echo’s portable smart speaker, has been a pretty good competitor to the likes of Apple’s Siri, Window’s Cortana, and Google’s…well, Ok Google. But previously, you could only experience it on the aforementioned Echo. Until now, that is. Fabriq is the first Alexa-powered portable, all-in-one speaker. And the best part is that it actually looks pretty and can even be part of your house or office decorations. Fabriq looks like a decorative item that will go well with your other accessories at home or at your workplace but it of course serves not just as a speaker but your connection to your Alexa service as well. It has dual WiFi and Bluetooth connectivity and high quality sound so you can use it as stand-alone speaker or paired with other speakers for multi-room purposes. You will also be able to control the speaker or speakers through the Fabriq app on your smartphone. But of course the highlight of the Fabriq is that you can have it do “neat tricks” courtesy of Alexa. Aside from checking the weather and asking it to recite your schedule, you can also use it to control your supported music apps, control smart devices within and from outside your house, and even call an Uber for yourself. It has a rechargeable battery that can last up to five hours and comes with a 2” precision active driver, a 2” passive radiator, and 5W of power. Fabriq comes in three styles: Jack Plaid, Earl Grey, and Splat. The design has different colors, prints, and fabrics, wrapping up a 3.15” x 3.15” x 3.15” speaker. It is now available through Amazon.com for only $49.99.

A new iFixit teardown of the Pixel XL handset, outed by Google earlier this month, offers “almost zero evidence of this phone’s HTC manufacturing origin.” Without acknowledgement of the manufacturing partner on the outside of the device, Google has also done a pretty good job of hiding HTC’s involvement on the inside. The only place you’ll see an HTC logo is on the battery pack. Related: Google Pixel vs Pixel XL: Is bigger better? HTC says it was proud to build the phone for Google, but given the positive reviews offered to the Google Pixel, the firm could really have used some of the credit. Even more unfortunately for HTC, whose smartphone sales are falling considerably, this happens to be the most fixable smartphone it has ever made, according to iFixit. In that department, it gets a 6/10 rating (via 9to5Google).

There weren't too many surprises inside Google's $750 device. During disassembly, the site actually broke the Samsung-made OLED panel, noting "the OLED panel separated from the digitizer glass a little too easily for our liking. Super-thin components and no frame or bezel behind the display make it extra sketchy to remove." On the plus side for repairability, the OLED panel isn't bonded to the glass, so you can replace just the broken glass instead of having to buy another expensive OLED. Under the display, iFixit found a "slim and flexible" magnesium mid-frame that hides most of the components. Buried under that you'll find a (hopefully non-explosive) HTC-branded battery—the only sign of the device's true manufacturer—along with Samsung-provided storage and RAM. Interestingly, like the Nexus devices last year, the Pixel contains a Qualcomm Quick Charge 3.0 chip despite not actually being QC 3.0 compatible—it uses USB-PD. The phone earned a 6 out of 10 for repairability. On the plus side, iFixit found many modular components that can be easily replaced, along with an easily-removable battery and a single screw size. It cited the fragile display and clip-in mid-frame as items that will slow down any would-be phone repairers. The pictures are always the best part; see the Pixel XL stripped down over at iFixit. Expand full story Reader comments 84 You must login or create an account to comment.

SUBSCRIBE Direct answer fail: Google gives only one side of proposed gun ammo & magazine law It's yet another example of Google going broad for answers and having problems. Danny Sullivan on October 21, 2016 at 2:13 pm More Want to know about California’s Proposition 63, a measure to control gun ammunition sales and large magazines, which is on the state ballot this month? Google has the answer. It’s a “deceptive ballot initiative that will criminalize millions of law-abiding Californians.” So much for balanced search results. Google presents that answer at the very top of its results, when searching for “Prop 63” or “Proposition 63,” as shown below: To answer “What’s happening here,” as Medium CEO Ev Williams asked when spotting this four days ago: for all its smarts, Google is still pretty dumb. Over the years, Google has increased the frequency of showing direct answers in its search results — something it calls “Featured Snippets.” The idea is that mobile users especially want fast facts, not to have to click through to a website. That’s even a potential advantage in its forthcoming Google Home assistant. It should allow Google Home to answer questions well beyond rival Amazon Echo, because Google will rely on the entire web rather than a more limited set of curated resources, especially Wikipedia. For example, here’s Google Home answering a question it found from the web, making use of featured snippets, that I’d previous tested with Amazon Echo, which couldn’t do it: This is a question Amazon Echo couldn't answer for me yesterday that Google Home got thanks to the web & featured snippets #MadeByGoogle pic.twitter.com/50E0HtypLA — Danny Sullivan (@dannysullivan) October 4, 2016 (NOTE: the video above might not show due to temporary problems Twitter is having). To get these answers, Google effectively guesses (even with all that machine learning) at which site it thinks might have a definitive answer. But the downside is that when Google goes wide beyond curated sources, it makes mistakes. God only loves Christians. Dinosaurs are an indoctrination tool. A not-safe-for-work answer for eating sushi. These are real things that Google featured snippets have gotten wrong in the past. Heck, Google still will tell you that Barack Obama is “King of the United States” based on our own article about how a featured snippet originally screwed up this answer. These types of mistakes are embarrassing in web search results. They’re going to be even worse with Google Home, where Google will start reading aloud some of these crazy answers without at least the back-up of other search results. Potentially, that could even hinder the product. Indeed, as Google Home increases the attention that featured snippets get, it’s not unlikely that we might see companies actively working to spam them (more than they do now), or even rival groups trying to obtain their “side” as the preferred answer that Google gives. We’ve asked Google for comment and will update if one comes. About The Author Danny Sullivan Danny Sullivan is a Founding Editor of Search Engine Land.

CONTENT Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide POPULAR TOPICS Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Reviews Columns Buyer's Guide Popular Topics  Android Apple Cars Phones Tablets Gaming Computing Photography Apps Software Wearable Entertainment Science Twitter Google+ Facebook Youtube RSS Search SlashGear Search Google Pixel survives 30 minutes fully submerged in water Brittany A. Roston - Oct 21, 2016 3 Facebook Twitter Google Reddit The Google Pixel isn’t terribly water resistant in any official capacity with a rating of IP53, which is one of the downsides in comparison to other high-end competing handsets. Someone recently did a water test, though, and found that Google’s new smartphone held up pretty well to water exposure, including water submersion. Of course, we’re only seeing the short-term effects and not what problems may appear later, so don’t try this at home, folks. The test you see in the video below involves a trio of exposure scenarios, one spritzing the phone with water from what appeared to be a spray bottle, another submerging it somewhat in a puddle for a little while, and then another involving dunking it in a bowl of water for half an hour. Spoiler alert: the Google Pixel survives all three. The Pixel appears to be working perfectly fine after spending some time in the bowl, with the screen working well and there being no sign of water damage (though he didn’t specify whether the camera lens survived without moisture). Of course, you don’t want to get your phone wet, and don’t think Google’s lying when it says the phone only has an IP53 rating. There’s a good chance this phone will develop some issues later on related to the water exposure, something anyone who has gotten a non-resistant phone wet — only to experience phantom screen taps and charging problems later on — can tell you. Even if this phone does ultimately survive unscathed, that doesn’t mean your phone will survive its own dunking — especially if it’s in a more serious scenario, such as you falling into a swimming pool with the phone in your pocket.

Pocket-lint Sections Apps Cameras Cars Drones Fitness Trackers Gadgets Games Headphones Laptops Parenting Phones Smart Home Smartwatches Speakers Tablets TV VR News Reviews Features Deals YouTube Instagram Facebook Twitter Google+ search Phones Best Phone Cameras Fitness trackers Parent hub Smart home EE Pocket-lint Awards What is Google Chromecast and why should you care? Elyse Betters21 October 2016TV Pocket-lint Facebook Twitter Pintrest LinkedIn Google+ Mail Comment Google Chromecast is a device you can use to send things from a small screen to your big screen TV. It's super easy to figure out, set up, and use. With it, you can send a YouTube video on your phone to a TV, or you can send a website on your computer to your TV. And that's just two of the possibilities. To help you learn what Google Chromecast is, how it works, and what it can do, Pocket-lint has explained everything you need to know about the affordable HDMI dongle. What is Chromecast? Google launched the first $30 (£30) Chromecast in 2013. It's an affordable HDMI dongle that lets you wirelessly "cast" content to a television. It basically makes most TVs smart. Then, in 2015, Google launched $30 Chromecast 2. It's faster, more responsive, and just as affordable. And it arrived with an updated Chromecast app that serves as a one-stop shop for finding compatible apps and specific content across those apps. In 2016, Google introduced the $69 (about £50) Chromecast Ultra, which works identically to its predecessors but uniquely offers the ability to cast 4K streams. Google also offers a $35 Chromecast Audio. Unlike the other three Chromecasts, Audio lets you wirelessly "cast" to speakers. That means your old speakers will essentially be turned into modern day speakers capable of playing music streamed from your devices. For more information on Chromecast, check out these guides: Chromecast 2 review: Make any TV smart, effortlessly What is Google Cast for Audio? Chromecast now has a guest mode: Here's how to turn on the feature Roku Streaming Stick vs Google Chromecast Amazon Fire TV Stick vs Google Chromecast vs Roku Streaming Stick How does Chromecast work? Requirements In order for Chromecast to work, you need to plug it into an HDMI input on a TV/display as well as an open USB port on your TV/display (or an open power wall outlet). You also need a compatible Android device or iOS device with the latest version of the Google Cast app installed, or you need a compatible Windows computer, Mac computer, or Chromebook computer with the latest version of the Chrome browser installed. It's important that your Chromecast and device or computer are connected to the same Wi-Fi network. Otherwise, you cannot cast to your TV. Set up Chromecast Check out Pocket-lint's separate guide on how to set up Chromecast. The process involves plugging your Chromecast device into your TV's HDMI port and a power source (either via USB on your TV our a wall outlet), then in installing the Google Cast mobile app on your mobile device to begin the setup process, and following the app's setup instructions (also available here). The app will automatically find your Chromecast and prompt you to connect it to the same Wi-Fi network connected to your mobile device. You can also set up Chromecast to work with your computer. Simply install the Chrome browser on computer, and then navigate to chromecast.com/setup from the browser to setup Chromecast (or you can quickly install the Google Cast extension). Google Chromecast: How to set up Chromecast and get started with it Things you can do With Chromecast, you can cast movies, TV shows, and photos from Cast-enabled apps on Android smartphones, Android tablets, iPhones, and iPads. You can also cast entire sites or tabs from the Chrome browser on Windows desktops, Windows laptops, Mac desktops, Mac laptops, and Google Chromebooks. There's no remote required. To manage your Chromecast, use the Google Cast app or Google Cast browser extension. You can also cast your Android screen to your TV. Simply open the Google Cast app and tap the navigation drawer. From there, tap the Cast Screen button and select your Chromecast device. How to cast Check out Pocket-lint's separate guide on how to cast with Chromecast. But in a nutshell, all you have to do - once you set up Chromecast - is tap the Cast button from a Cast-enabled app such as YouTube on your mobile device, and the content will instantly appear on your big TV. From Chrome browser on your computer, you can also tap the Cast button in a video player like YouTube. Although it's not required, you can install the Google Cast extension in order to get the Cast icon in your browser toolbar. From there, simply click the icon, then choose the Chromecast device you would like to cast to, and wait for the contents of your tab in Chrome to appear on your TV. Which apps and sites are Cast-enabled? Google Apps Casting to your TV is a simple way to enjoy your mobile apps on a big screen. You can even use your mobile device or tablet as a remote and control everything from playback to volume. Within the Google Cast app, you can tap What’s On to browse content from Cast-enabled apps you’ve already installed. You can also tap Get Apps to find Cast-enabled apps you haven'y installed yet. Visit the Google's website to see a list of all Cast-enabled apps. Examples include Netflix, Spotify, HBO Now, Hulu, Angry Birds with Friends, Watch ESPN, Google Photos, YouTube, PBS Kids, Twitch, Pandora, and thousands more. Sites Some websites are Cast-enabled. Currently, YouTube, Netflix, Google Play Movies, Google Play Music, and more are Cast-enabled (see the full list here), and Google said it is adding new ones all the time. You will you know if a website is Cast-enabled when you see the Cast button on the website within the video player. For sites that are not Google Cast-enabled, you can use the Cast extension to view the content on your TV. Why should you care about Chromecast? Sometimes it's just fun to experience things on a bigger display. Let's say you're hanging out with friends and want to show them all a funny YouTube video. Instead of huddling around your phone, you can cast it to your TV and enjoy it on the big screen. Similarly, maybe you want to show your friends a cool website. Instead of crowding around a laptop, you can cast the site to your TV. It's easy to see the benefits of Chromecast. Plus, it's cheap and simple to use.

CDT October 21, 2016 PORTLAND, OR - MARCH 25: A bird lands on Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders podium as he speaks on March 25, 2016 in Portland, Oregon.  (Photo: Natalie Behring/Getty Images, 2016 Getty Images) CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST Bernie Sanders has dropped out of the race and endorsed Hillary Clinton, but Google data suggests he still might get a bunch of write-in votes on Election Day. According to Google, search interest in "write-in" has been surging nationwide. Google provides this data on a 0-100 scale. In mid-August, national search traffic for "write-in" hovered in the mid 40s; in October it has bounced around in the 80s and 90s, hitting a peak of 100 on Oct. 13. That was the day The New York Times published allegations from four women that Trump had made unwanted sexual advances many years ago. Sanders was the top mentioned candidate in "write-in" searches in 6 of 10 states with the highest "write-in" search intensity in October. Republican alternative Evan McMullin took the top spot in one of these states — Oklahoma — and in the three others, there was not enough data about individual searches for Google to release the data. Each state has its own rules for presidential write-in ballots, and only a handful allow write-in votes for candidates who have not registered their names. But among that handful are New Jersey, Vermont, Rhode Island and New Hampshire — the very states showing highest search interest in "write-ins" and where Sanders is the top searched name. Of course, since Sanders isn't actually running for president anymore, a flurry of write-in Bernie votes seem unlikely to have any impact on the race. Hillary Clinton leads Donald Trump by an average of about 7 points in the polls in the New Hampshire, and the other states are considered very safe Democratic territory. But it would be an interesting sign of Democratic dissatisfaction if Sanders takes a significant number of write-in votes in deep blue New Jersey or Vermont. More interesting could be the alternative Republican Evan McMullin, who is actively campaigning for write-in votes in several states. McMullin is the top searched candidate in "write-in" searches in Ohio and Arizona, two states where Clinton and Trump are essentially tied in the polls, and in both states, McMullin is a registered write-in candidate with an active ground operation, said adviser Joel Searby. Both states are in the top 20 for "write-in" search interest, according to Google. "We have state chairmen in both to get out the vote," Searby said. "We think we can impact the election in Ohio, Arizona, Wisconsin and Wyoming as a write-in." Clinton leads maintained a lead over Trump of about 7 points in recent Wisconsin polls, and Trump had a 35-point lead in an August Wyoming poll. Richard Winger, the editor of Ballot Access News, warns that in some states write-in votes are allowed but election officials don't bother reporting the totals. "Iowa has never reported any presidential write-in votes in history," Winger said, and in New Hampshire the secretary of state "makes an arbitrary decision which write-in presidential candidates to include" in public reports.   CONNECT TWEET LINKEDIN GOOGLE+ PINTEREST JOIN THE CONVERSATION To find out more about Facebook commenting please read the Conversation Guidelines and FAQs Leave a Comment TRENDING VIDEOS Trump gives first interview since winning presidential election Chili's accused of taking meal from veteran Mom investigated after video goes viral, sparks outrage Federal lawsuit filed over injured HPD inmate 2 dead in shooting outside mall Local astronaut, 64, still hits weekly hockey league SUV crashes into SmashBurger restaurant Episode 1: Vision Impaired Episode 3: Instant Replay More Stories Anti-Trump protester accused of punching police… Nov 14, 2016, 1:32 p.m. Lawsuit: Cop used excessive force against HPD inmate Nov 14, 2016, 11:37 a.m. One dead, 1 injured in SW Houston shooting Nov 14, 2016, 4:17 p.m. About Us Contact Us Reporters Index Help Connect With Us FCC Online Public Inspection File • EEO Public File Report Home Weather Health Detail Closings & Delays Location Search Radars Conditions Hurricane Central More...

Googling Clinton and Trump from A to Z Gary Craig , @gcraig1 8:22 p.m. EDT October 21, 2016 Skip Ad Ad Loading... x Embed x Share Google searches, by no means scientific, can provide some insight into just what people are wondering. And people have been wondering a lot about the presidential candidates. (Oct. 21, 2016) Len LaCara Is Trump/Clint a ...... (Photo: .) The question "Is Clinton friends with Trump?" apparently has been asked of Google millions of times. As has the question "Is Trump Canadian?" Google searches, by no means scientific, can provide some insight into just what people are wondering. And the presidential election — a vitriolic and occasionally crass campaign between two unpopular candidates — has prompted hundreds of millions of Google questions about Republican Donald Trump and Democrat Hillary Clinton. Can we learn anything from those searches? Maybe a little.  Regardless, at least we can inject some fun into a campaign markedly devoid of levity. So, here's what we did at the Democrat and Chronicle. We decided to take an open-ended question about the candidates and run it through the Google search engine from A to Z. For example, for the Democratic candidate the question began like this: Is Clinton ... ? Then, we typed in each letter of the alphabet individually, to see the common searches with that letter. For instance, the search "Is Clinton a ..." brought up the most searched question as "Is Clinton ahead?" We did the same search for Trump and the top-ranked question for the letter A was: "Is Trump ahead in Ohio?" Some explaining is needed here. Using this method, the Google searches do not immediately bring up the most popular searches in each instance. But, this being an unscientific approach to an unscientific ranking, we simply used the top three responses to our questions. If we don't list three responses here, it's either because some of the responses were so similar or Google didn't come up with three letter-specific answers about the candidates. (In some cases, there were no responses, or responses that had nothing to do with the candidates.) So, here they are, the candidate-specific questions and the Google responses by alphabet: A Is Clinton ahead of Trump in the polls? Is Clinton a good debater? Is Trump ahead in Ohio? Is Trump a fascist? Is Trump against unions? B Is Clinton beating Trump? Is Clinton behind in the polls? Is Clinton better? Is Trump beating Clinton? Is Trump banned from Canada? C Is Clinton Cash on Netflix? (This is the film alleging a vast pay-to-play conspiracy between the Clintons and some foreign governments.) Is Clinton Catholic? Is Clinton Cash on DVD? Is Trump Canadian? Is Trump campaigning today? Is Trump catching up? D Is Clinton dropping out? Is Clinton dead? Is Clinton Democrat? Is Trump dead? Is Trump dropping out? Is Trump Democrat? E (Clinton had nothing with e.) Is Trump electable? Is Trump ethical? Is Trump exhausted? F Is Clinton friends with Trump? (There is some crossover here, with the question posed about different members of the Clinton and Trump families.) Is Clinton Foundation under investigation? Is Clinton Foundation a charity? Is Trump for TPP? (This relates to the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement.) Is Trump funding his own campaign? Is Trump fascist? G Is Clinton going to win? Is Clinton going to lose? Is Trump going to be president? Is Trump gaining in the polls? H Is Clinton holding a walker? Is Clinton hawkish? Is Trump healthy? Is Trump hurting his business? Is Trump having a rally today? I Is Clinton in the lead? Is Clinton in favor of TPP? Is Clinton Irish? Is Trump in the lead? Is Trump imploding? Is Trump intelligent? J (No response with Clinton and j.) Is Trump just a distraction? (Other searches related to Donald Trump Jr., including the question, "Is Trump Jr. married?") K (For Clinton, the letter K brings up multiple questions about Clinton Kelly, one of the hosts of the ABC show The Chew.) Is Trump KGB? Is Trump killing the GOP? Is Trump Keynesian? L Is Clinton leading Trump? Is Clinton losing ground? Is Clinton leading Trump in the polls? Is Trump leading in the polls? Is Trump left handed? Is Trump losing? M Is Clinton more conservative than Trump? Is Clinton more liberal than Obama? Is Clinton more honest than Trump? Is Trump married? Is Trump Mexican? Is Trump moving up in the polls? N Is Clinton neoliberal? Is Trump nuts? Is Trump nice? Is Trump nominated? O Is Clinton or Trump ahead? Is Clinton or Trump going to win? Is Trump or Hillary winning? Is Trump on TV tonight? P Is Clinton pro-TPP?  Is Clinton pro-fracking? Is Clinton pro-union? Is Trump pro-gun? is Trump pro-TPP? Is Trump pro-union? Q Is Clinton qualified to be president? Is Clinton quitting? Is Trump quitting? Is Trump qualified to be president? R Is Clinton responsible for Benghazi? Is Clinton Republican? Is Clinton really ahead of Trump? Is Trump running for president? Is Trump really going to win? Is Trump rich? S Is Clinton still secretary of state? Is Clinton still ahead of Trump? Is Trump saying "bigly"? Is Trump speaking tonight? Is Trump self-funding? T Is Clinton the nominee? Is Clinton the next president? Is Trump trying to lose? Is Trump trying? Is Trump The Manchurian Candidate? (This is the suspense film about politics and a brainwashed soldier.) U Is Clinton up in the polls? Is Trump up in the polls? Is Trump using his own money? Is Trump under-polling? V Is Clinton vegan? (There is some crossover here with former President Bill Clinton.) Is Trump vegan? Is Trump Voldemort? Is Trump violent? W Is Clinton winning? Is Clinton worried? Is Trump winning? Is Trump winning Florida? Is Trump winning Ohio? X Is Clinton Xmas cards? (We didn't promise complete sentences as answers on Google.) The remaining alphabet provides nothing. And, let's face it, there are as many variations on this as there are questions. For instance, the question, "Does Clinton e ...?" provides for an answer: "Does Clinton ever wear dresses?" And, the question, "Does Trump v ...? leads to this: "Does Trump vape?" So, if bored or sick of this election, try your own version of the game by creating your own questions. Feel free to drop me the most entertaining responses you get at the email below.

Here’s how to disable it Google in June deleted a clause in its privacy settings that said it would not combine cookie information with personal information without consent Google has users’ (mostly) real names, email accounts and search data. Photograph: Baz Ratner/Reuters Olivia Solon in San Francisco Friday 21 October 2016 18.48 EDT Last modified on Monday 24 October 2016 12.56 EDT Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email Share on LinkedIn Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Since Google changed the way it tracks its users across the internet in June 2016, users’ personally identifiable information from Gmail, YouTube and other accounts has been merged with their browsing records from across the web. An analysis of the changes conducted by Propublica details how the company had previously pledged to keep these two data sets separate to protect individuals’ privacy, but updated its privacy settings in June to delete a clause that said “we will not combine DoubleClick cookie information with personally identifiable information unless we have your opt-in consent”. ProPublica highlights that when Google first made the changes in June, they received little scrutiny. Media reports focused on the tools the company introduced to allow users to view and manage ad tracking rather than the new powers Google gained. DoubleClick is an advertising serving and tracking company that Google bought in 2007. DoubleClick uses web cookies to track browsing behaviour online by their IP address to deliver targeted ads. It can make a good guess about your location and habits, but it doesn’t know your true identity. Have you given Pokémon Go full access to everything in your Google account? Read more Google, on the other hand, has users’ (mostly) real names, email accounts and search data. At the time of the acquisition, a number of consumer groups made a complaint to the Federal Trade Commission arguing that bringing these data sets together would represent a huge invasion of privacy, giving the company access to more information about the internet activities of consumers than any other company in the world. Sergey Brin reassured privacy campaigners, saying: “Overall, we care very much about end-user privacy, and that will take a number one priority when we talk about advertising products.” In 2012, Google made a controversial update to its privacy policy to allow it to share data about users between different Google services, but it kept DoubleClick separate. In practice, this means that Google can now, if it wanted to, build up even richer profiles of named individuals’ online activity. It also means that the DoubleClick ads that follow people on the web could be personalized based on the keywords that individuals use in Gmail. Google isn’t the first company to track individuals in this way. Facebook has been tracking logged-in users (and even non-users) by name across the internet whenever they visit websites with Facebook “like” or “share” buttons. Google says that the change is optional and is aimed at giving people better control over their data. “Google is actually quite late to this game. By now, most of the websites you visit are already sharing your activity with a wide network of third parties who share, collaborate, link and de-link personal information in order to target ads,” said Jules Polonetsky from Future of Privacy Forum. “Some users may appreciate relevant advertising, many others may not. What’s critical is that there are easy ways for those who want to avoid the more robust types of data targeting to be able to take easy steps to do so.” Facebook admits it tracks non-users, but denies claims it breaches EU privacy law Read more Technology companies argue that such tracking allows them to deliver much more targeted, relevant advertising across the internet. Paul Ohm from the Center of Privacy and Technology at Georgetown law school told Propublica that the fact that Google kept personally identifiable information and DoubleClick data separate was “a really significant last stand”. “It was a border wall between being watched everywhere and maintaining a tiny semblance of privacy. That wall has just fallen.” A Google spokeswoman said that its advertising system had been designed before the smartphone revolution, and that the update in June made it easier for users to control their ad preferences across multiple devices. The company says that more than one billion Google users have accessed the ‘My Account’ settings that let them control how their data is used. “Before we launched this update, we tested it around the world with the goal of understanding how to provide users with clear choice and transparency,” Google said. “As a result, it is 100% optional - if users do not opt-in to these changes, their Google experience will remain unchanged. Equally important: we provided prominent user notifications about this change in easy-to-understand language as well as simple tools that let users control or delete their data.” Users that don’t want to be tracked in this way can visit the activity controls section of their account page on Google, unticking the box marked “Include Chrome browsing history and activity from websites and apps that use Google services”.

Google's Unplugged service, meanwhile, looks to join in those ranks, and it's just added a major new draw to its operations: CBS. The newest reports suggest that Google's Unplugged—which will start on YouTube in the early going of 2017—will have CBS, and may have most of the other major networks following along. Deals with Fox, NBC, and ABC parent company Walt Disney may be in the offing. The Unplugged service will offer “skinny” bundles of live channels for between $25 and $40 a month, depending on what's all selected. The bad news, of course, is that Google will be arriving late to a very crowded party. Netflix and Hulu already have a big part of the subscription market, and with skinny bundles coming from companies like Dish Network with its Sling TV and Sony with its PlayStation Vue, Google may have a tough time on its hands convincing users to step away from current bundles and come over to a similarly-priced bundle. If it can offer better streaming, and lower bandwidth use, it may well manage to land some users. I tried Sling TV myself not so long ago and found the experience poor at best, with a lot of lag and similar issues; it wasn't even close to a match for Netflix streaming. Google will have one clear advantage on its hands; by playing on YouTube, there will be a lot of users in that neck of the woods already, and signing up even a comparatively slim number of said users means quite a bit of value. Individual channels on YouTube have millions of subscribers; if Google can get the equivalent of Markiplier's subscriber count shelling out $25 a month, that's better than a quarter-billion bucks monthly in the coffers. That's good, because Google's got another problem: at $25-$40, Google isn't even technically the value provider. Dish Network, for example, starts off its Top 120 package for $54.99 per month. This package contains over 190 channels total. Meanwhile, its own skinny bundle, the Flex Pack, matches Google's top price of $39.99 and offers over 50 channels with customization options. So for Google to really be able to compete, it's either going to have to drop some prices, offer content that can't be had elsewhere, or offer a whole lot more of it. Offering channels that most anyone can get with an outdoor aerial antenna for free will not do the job. Google likely knows the challenges it will face offering up this new skinny bundle, and has planned accordingly. If Google's final offering looks too much like its competitors, though, it may not manage to do more than skim the market, and end up an also-ran in the field.

Twitter Facebook Google+ LinkedIn Instagram YouTube RSS Skip to content SEO News Content Marketing Social Media Paid Search Work Life Events Advertise Mobile Search on the Rise: Almost Half of All People Search Only on Smartphones [STUDY] Mobile Search  News October 6, 2016 Mobile Search News Matt SouthernOctober 6, 2016 SEJ STAFF 663SHARES 1.4KREADS 663SHARES 1.4KREADS SEJ STAFFMatt Southern 663SHARES 1.4KREADS A detailed study released by Google reveals roughly 40% of people search only on a smartphone. More people are searching Google via smartphone than ever before the company says, with the most popular categories revolving around health, parenting, and beauty. Other top findings from Google’s study include: 80% of people use a smartphone 67% of people use a desktop computer 16% of people use a tablet 57% of people use more than one type of device 27% of people use a smartphone only 14% of people use a desktop computer only Dissecting these findings, it’s interesting to learn that of the people who only use one type of device, twice as many are using smartphones than desktop computers. On top of that, people who use smartphones use them a lot — up to 3 hours a day. By comparison, an average of 2 hours a day is spent using desktop computers, and 75 minutes is spent using tablets. That’s fairly solid evidence that we are living in a mobile-first world now more than ever. Google warns marketers that if you’re not making an attempt to reach customers on mobile you’re missing a quarter of your potential audience. ”We live in a world where people literally expect answers at their fingertips, and to find them, they’re turning to the nearest device” Desktop computers’ time to shine is around 8am, which is right around the time people may be starting their work day. Smartphone usage then takes over in the afternoon with a particular increase being seen around prime time viewing hours. Smartphone usage is said to be consistent throughout the day, peaking around noon and being used steadily during the afternoon and into the night. “There’s never really an off time”, Google says. Throughout 15 of the 24 hours in a given day, more searches are happening on mobile than on computers or tablets. Google’s data is based on findings from a behavioral measurement of 11,964 opt-in Google users between January 1, 2016, and March 31, 2016. Opt-in users include a U.S. demographic of 18 to 49-year-old cross-device users. More details from Google’s study can be read here in this PDF.

Doc Searls Weblog Home About Adblock War Series Subscribe to feed ‹ @Staples, you can Un faster than that.  •  Consumers can’t help health care. Customers can. › The problem for people isn’t advertising, and the problem for advertising isn’t blocking. The problem for both is tracking. October 21, 2016 in adtech, advertising, Business, Identity, Internet, Journalism, Law, marketing, privacy, problems, publishing, security | 4 comments In Google Has Quietly Dropped Ban on Personally Identifiable Web Tracking, @JuliaAngwin and @ProPublica unpack what the subhead says well already: “Google is the latest tech company to drop the longstanding wall between anonymous online ad tracking and user’s names.” So here’s a message from humanity to Google and all the other spy organizations in the surveillance economy: Tracking is no less an invasion of privacy in apps and browsers than it is in homes, cars, purses, pants and wallets. That’s because our apps and browsers, like the devices on which we use them, are personal and private. Simple as that. (HT to @Apple for digging that fact.) To help the online advertising business understand what ought to be obvious (but isn’t yet), let’s clear up some misconceptions: Tracking people without their clear and conscious permission is wrong. (Meaning The Castle Doctrine should apply online no less than it does in the physical world.) Assuming that using a browser or an app constitutes some kind of “deal” to allow tracking is wrong. (Meaning implied consent is not the real thing. See The Tradeoff Fallacy: How Marketers Are Misrepresenting American Consumers and Opening Them Up to Exploitation, by Joseph Turow, Ph.D. and the Annenberg School for Communication at the University of Pennsylvania.) Claiming that advertising funds the “free” Internet is wrong. (The Net has been free for the duration. Had it been left up to the billing companies of the world, we never would have had it, and they never would have made their $trillions on it. More at New Clues.) What’s right is civilization, which relies on manners. Advertisers, their agencies and publishers haven’t learned manners yet. But they will. At the very least, regulations will force companies harvesting personal data to obey those they harvest it from, with fines for not obeying. Toward that end, Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation already has compliance offices at large corporations shaking in their boots, for good reason: “a fine up to 20,000,000 EUR, or in the case of an undertaking, up to 4% of the total worldwide annual turnover of the preceding financial year, whichever is higher (Article 83, Paragraph 5 & 6).” Those come into force in 2018. Stay tuned. Companies harvesting personal data also shouldn’t be surprised to find themselves re-classified as fiduciaries, no less responsible than accountants, brokers and doctors for confidentiality on behalf of the people they collect data from. (Thank you, professors Balkin and Zittrain, for that legal and rhetorical hack. Brilliant, and well done. Or begun.) The only way to fully fix publishing, advertising and surveillance-corrupted business in general is to equip individuals with terms they can assert in dealing with others online — and to do it at scale. Meaning we need terms that work the same way across all the companies we deal with. That’s why Customer Commons and Kantara are working on exactly those terms. For starters. And these will be our terms — not separate and different ones that live at each company we deal with. Those aren’t working now, and never will work, because they can’t. And they can’t because when you have to deal with as many different terms as there are parties supplying them, the problem becomes unmanageable, and you get screwed. That’s why — There’s a new sheriff on the Net, and it’s the individual. Who isn’t a “user,” by the way. Or a “consumer.” With new terms of our own, we’re the first party. The companies we deal with are second parties. Meaning that they are the users, and the consumers, of our legal “content.” And they’ll like it too, because we actually want to do good business with good companies, and are glad to make deals that work for both parties. Those include expressions of true loyalty, rather than the coerced kind we get from every “loyalty” card we carry in our purses and wallets. When we are the first parties, we also get scale. Imagine changing your terms, your contact info, or your last name, for every company you deal with — and doing that in one move. That can only happen when you are the first party. So here’s a call to action. If you want to help blow up the surveillance economy by helping develop much better ways for demand and supply to deal with each other, show up next week at the Computer History Museum for VRM Day and the Internet Identity Workshop, where there are plenty of people already on the case. Then follow the work that comes out of both — as if your life depends on it. Because it does. And so does the economy that will grow atop true privacy online and the freedoms it supports. Both are a helluva lot more leveraged than the ill-gotten data gains harvested by the Lumascape doing unwelcome surveillance. Bonus links: All the great research Julia Angwin & Pro Publica have been doing on a problem that data harvesting companies have been causing and can’t fix alone, even with government help. That’s why we’re doing the work I just described. What Facebook Knows About You Can Matter Offline, an OnPoint podcast featuring Julia, Cathy O’Neill and Ashkan Soltani. Everything by Shoshana Zuboff. From her home page: “’I’ve dedicated this part of my life to understanding and conceptualizing the transition to an information civilization. Will we be the masters of information, or will we be its slaves? There’s a lot of work to be done, if we are to build bridges to the kind of future that we can call “home.” My new book on this subject, Master or Slave? The Fight for the Soul of Our Information Civilization, will be published by Public Affairs in the U.S. and Eichborn in Germany in 2017.” Can’t wait. Don Marti’s good thinking and work with Aloodo and other fine hacks. 4 comments Comments feed for this article Trackback link: http://blogs.harvard.edu/doc/2016/10/21/the-problem-for-people-isnt-advertising-and-the-problem-for-advertising-isnt-blocking-the-problem-for-both-is-tracking/trackback/ Warren Whitlock on October 21, 2016 at 2:13 pm There’s no reason that tracking needs be a dark science, hiding from users. Let’s tell consumers what we need to provide a better service and how it benefits them. Pingback from Doc Searls – The problem for people isn’t advertising, and the problem for advertising isn’t blocking – D’Arcy Norman dot net on October 23, 2016 at 11:06 am Doc Searls on October 24, 2016 at 7:51 am We’ve needed that all along, Warren. But it hasn’t happened. And when it does happen, it won’t work if every company does it a different way. What we need is for individuals to be the first party and companies the second party, and for companies to agree to terms we as first parties assert. This not only gives individuals scale across all the companies willing to agree (which in Europe they’ll have to once the GDPR gets teeth in 2018), but provides a much better market with much better conditions for both customers and companies. For example, if each of us has a #NoStalking term that says “just show me ads not based on tracking me”, publishers and broadcasters are not only off the hook with privacy regulations but in possession of a better demographic to sell to advertisers. sam d on October 27, 2016 at 7:27 pm Nice article, I use an ad-blocker on my browser too, I think tracking is a major concern among user rather than those annoying pop-up ads, there should be some way around these things such that we can have ads and not get tracked.

This front panel removal is the only method with which repair happen with this device, and it requires some heat. Once the rim of the front panel is hot, separation requires a bit of a pick and pull – therein lies the danger. When the front panel becomes removed in the incorrect way, it’ll separate with the swiftness. As iFixit shows, their first attempt at disassembly did not turn out well. This means the user will need to be extra outstandingly careful in trying to fix this device or replace any component therein. For now, this method is too dangerous to attempt. The rest of the teardown seems straightforward by comparison, save the “snug, press-fit notches” that hold the midframe in place. Everything else uses moderate amounts of adhesive or T5 Torx screws. It’s a shame the front is so difficult to remove without damage – the rest seems like a dream of ease. Inside you’ll find the one indicator that it wasn’t Google who put this device together. HTC’s own battery is inside, put there by Google’s manufacturer – HTC. SEE THIS: Google Pixel XL Review They’ve put this device together using parts from Qualcomm, NXP, Skyworks, and Samsung. Parts from Qualcomm include a PM8996, WTR3925 LTE RF transceiver, WCD9335 audio codec, and RF360 Dynamic Antenna Matching Tuner (QFE2550). Skyworks provided the quad-band power amp module (SKY77807), and there’s an Avago ACPM-7800 power amp in there too. Samsung provides the KLUBG4G1CE 32 GB flash storage (UFS 2.0). There’s a NXP TFA9891 smart audio amplifier inside this device as well as Samsung’s K3RG2G20BM-MGCJ 4 GB LPDDR4 mobile DRAM. It’s also confirmed that the Qualcomm SMB1350 Quick Charge 3.0 IC is present inside.

Slate Sign In Sign Up Google Changed a Major Privacy Policy Four Months Ago, and No One Really Noticed Google Changed a Major Privacy Policy Four Months Ago, and No One Really Noticed Slate Sign In Sign Up ASU | NEW AMERICA | SLATE Learn more about Future Tense » Slate Future Tense The Citizen's Guide to the Future Oct. 21 2016 4:06 PM Google Changed a Major Privacy Policy Four Months Ago, and No One Really Noticed By Suzanne Monyak   How closely do you read Google's privacy policies? Photo by LEON NEAL/AFP/Getty Images For almost 10 years, Google promised to protect users’ privacy from advertisers by keeping personally identifiable information about its users, gleaned from Gmail accounts and other Google services, separate from its subsidiary DoubleClick’s database of web-browsing records. But the company quietly updated its privacy policy in June to say that users’ activities on other sites “may be associated with your personal information,” ProPublica reported Friday. Google’s previous privacy policy, which is literally crossed through in front of its new one in Google’s new privacy policy, had pledged to “not combine DoubleClick cookie information with personally identifiable information” without users’ consent. Google Advertisement Google purchased DoubleClick, an online advertising company, in April 2007 for $3.1 billion in cash, outbidding Microsoft in a months-long battle. DoubleClick uses cookies to collect and store data about users from their browsing history to best place their clients’ advertisements. For example, a user who visits the sports section of a news site will be more likely to be shown ads for game tickets than ads for makeup. ProPublica’s Julia Angwin notes that at the time of the 2007 purchase, Google’s privacy policy stated that DoubleClick’s ad-serving technology will rely only on “non-personally-identifiable information,” which had allowed online ad tracking to remain anonymous. Angwin writes: The practical result of the change is that the DoubleClick ads that follow people around on the web may now be customized to them based on the keywords they used in their Gmail. It also means that Google could now, if it wished to, build a complete portrait of a user by name, based on everything they write in email, every website they visit and the searches they conduct. Existing Google users were prompted to opt in to the new policy. But it was enabled by default for new users. You can view what Google thinks your interests are, and choose to opt out of personalized ads, here. In its privacy policy, Google states that it does not sell any personal information, such as names, email addresses and payment information. This summer’s change follows a long-term trend of decreasing privacy standards for Internet users. In 2000, the Federal Trade Commission launched an investigation of DoubleClick’s handling of sensitive user information after it purchased Abacus Direct, a company that sells consumer purchasing data. Although the FTC dropped the investigation in January 2002 and determined there had been no violation, DoubleClick sold its subsidiary at a loss. And then in 2012, Google announced that it would share data between other Google products, but still kept the data separate from DoubleClick. Unlike this most recent update, the 2012 change was mandatory for all Google users. So how will this affect your life? Probably not much, even if you’ve opted in to the new change, given that your Gmail content was already fair game for ads displayed within Gmail. But we are now one step closer to a world, imagined in Slate by Evan Selinger and Shaun Foster, in which advertisements on the street and screens morph into images of your own avatar using or wearing the product. Future Tense is a partnership of Slate, New America, and Arizona State University.

The Pixel maybe just tipped the scales, and it did so right at the moment we’re getting ready to move on to something else. With so many voice-controlled, non-smartphone devices in our homes, it sure feels like we’re at a flux point. Also, the Google Assistant, which lives in the Pixel, is so so powerful, and we’re headed for more of that. Michael and David (who is back from Bogota) discuss the changes in the personal tech landscape. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: David’s review of the Google Pixel. A gallery of the full-size images he shot with the phone in Colombia. Tim Moynihan’s story about the Pixel’s advanced camera technology.

With recent reports of Fitbit’s profits dipping and the Apple Watch sales numbers not being super-great, a narrative has emerged over the last few weeks that wearables will soon be dead. There’s some truth to that, though in reality, it just means that the industry is changing to meet new consumer demands. David and Michael discuss what needs to happen for the market to get more interesting. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: IDC numbers are bad. Canalys numbers are way better.

We’re spending a lot of time talking to our devices. They’re talking back, too—products like Google Home and Amazon Echo can answer questions, give us helpful information, and tell stupid jokes. But what’s the end result of all this gabbing? Smarter AI assistants, sure. But the way we bark commands at our voice-controlled tech and treat the devices like lowly machines … is that making us ruder? Should we design the computers to talk to us more like humans in order to encourage empathy, or should we keep them cold and machine-like so we don’t get unhealthily attached? Is this even a problem? Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: The Google Home is now available, and David talks to it. Also, Tim Moynihan puts Google’s Assistant and Amazon’s Alexa head-to-head to see which one keeps him company better. A year ago, David wrote about the coming wave of “crazy-powerful” AI assistants.

This week saw the debut of two new Pixel phones (the first ever phones from Google), plus the retail release of Google Home and the Daydream View phone-based VR headset. The Pixel phones are exciting—not only because of their premium design, but also because they include the new Google Assistant, a more advanced version of Google Now that helps you communicate, make plans, and run your life more efficiently. But, maybe it doesn’t work super-great just yet. Podcast RSS iTunes Download Some notes: Watch Google’s presentation from Tuesday, and read our roundup of everything that was announced. Read Brian Barrett’s story on Pixel’s place in the Android world. Margaret Rhodes on Google’s “Trojan Horse” plan for AI.

What we watch, what we watch it on, and what we do while we watch it. Not only is the technology of TV changing, but the content is morphing in a way that alters what we think of as “television.” Is a YouTube video TV? Sure, right.

Sam Lubell Design Date of Publication: 10.21.16. 10.21.16 Time of Publication: 3:58 pm. 3:58 pm Here’s How Self-Driving Cars Will Transform Your City SWA/Kinder Baumgardner Elon Musk says every new Tesla comes with all of the hardware needed for fully autonomous driving. He is hardly alone in trying to spare humans the tedium of car operation. Audi, GM, Google, and Uber are among the many companies working toward the day when autos do everything and you’re just along for the ride. Musk, ever the showman, plans to see one of his cars drive across the country next year without a human doing anything more than  enjoying the scenery. Others lay out more conservative timelines for rolling out their technology, but make no mistake—robocars are coming, and sooner than you think. This technology promises to radically remake the very form and fabric of our cities, even if it remains to be seen just what those changes will look like. We asked eight urban planners and futurists to share their visions of a driverless future. Carlo Ratti, Director, MIT Senseable City Lab Ratti, whose lab anticipates how technology will transform the built environment, predicts that vehicle automation will require 80 percent fewer cars on any given highway. “In general, fewer cars could mean shorter travel times, less congestion, and a smaller environmental impact,” Ratti says. “Vast areas of urban land currently occupied by parking lots and roads could be reinvented for a whole new spectrum of social functions” like parks, public spaces, and maker spaces. Cars, he adds, could also become extensions of our homes. But Ratti warns: “We can also have nightmarish scenarios. For instance, if self-driving were to become so cheap that people would prefer jumping into a car than, say, taking the subway. In that case our cities could easily become gridlocked.” Erick Guerra, assistant professor of city and regional planning, University of Pennsylvania “I think in urban environments it will lead to less driving and urban space will be used in a more positive way,” Guerra says. At the same time, he’s skeptical of the utopian claims that we’ll all be inherently better off. “If you’re living in a low density suburban community, they’re finding it will increase travel when you use existing travel models.” In other words: There are still a lot of unknowns. “It’s a really hard thing to quantitatively predict,” he says. “There’s a good deal of uncertainty in terms of how it influences urban form.” Anthony Townsend, author of Smart Cities: Big Data, Civic Hackers, and the Quest for a New Utopia Townsend, who thinks a lot about how technology will impact cities and the people who inhabit them, argues that those studying the impacts of autonomous vehicles are focusing too much on passenger cars, and not enough on all the other self-driving vehicles that will soon pop up.”It’s actually trash trucks, trailers, delivery vans, taxis and other vehicles that take up much of the space in cities. They will be completely transformed by automated technologies,” he says. This change, along with automated mass transit, will make dense cities much more efficient and livable. But the technology, he adds, will also exacerbate sprawl unless legislators take action. “When you make an economic input cheaper, the net effect isn’t to use less. It’s to use a lot more of it. So without restrictions or disincentives, we’ll have more cars.” The good news: An automated vehicle whose software can be updated at any time can adapt dramatically over time. “There’s a lot more chances to get it right, because we can change it as we go along,” Townsend says. SWA/Kinder Baumgardner Kinder Baumgardner, managing principal, SWA Baumgardner, who leads landscape and urban design firm SWA’s Houston studio, recently published a paper entitled “Beyond Google’s Cute Car.” He predicts that a reduction in cars will transform urban cores, with entrepreneurs reimagining parking lots, parking spaces, and garages by converting them into housing, retail outlets, and public spaces. Already, he notes, garage operators are beginning to strategize how they can reuse or sell their properties. “Who knows, garages could become the cool place to live? You suddenly have an opportunity for space where it didn’t exist.” Suburbs, meanwhile, could become less isolated, as garages, driveways and cul-de-sacs become common spaces and walking replaces driving in town centers. “You’ll get to know your neighbors better,” says Baumgardner. “You’ll see changes pop up in an ad-hoc way.” Suburbs, he adds, will also become more desirable. “The one inconvenience, driving, goes away. There’s going to be more demand to live in those places.” David Ory, planning principal, San Francisco Metropolitan Transportation Commission Ory believes planners need to think broadly about how technology will change the urban environment, given how unpredictable it can be. “Instead of thinking about one future,” he asks, “do we think about dramatically different futures?” We won’t, he says, just have driverless cars, but automated, seamless systems for buses, subways, bicycles, and much more. The ideal scenario? A major reduction in land devoted to cars of all types—but that could vary widely based on an area’s resources. He also warns that we can get ahead of ourselves in planning for driverless cities. “There are a lot of revolutions that don’t come about. Driverless is the most promising, but it’s still somewhat speculative.” Jarrett Walker, president, Jarrett Walker + Associates Walker, a planning and transit consultant who has advised cities around the world, is also wary of utopian visions of the self-driving landscape. “A lot more money wants self-driving cars to be wonderful than wants us to remain skeptical,” he says.  He warns of induced demand: “If you make something easier, more people do it, so you have to think of the consequences of what it means for more people to do it.” That means there’s going to have to be a lot of regulation and intervention to manage this process to limit the otherwise devastating effects of induced demand. The real fight, in other words, will be policy-related. “The battle is to create a space in which the question is not how we get ready for self-driving vehicles but rather what kind of city we want.” Audi Lisa Futing, Project Manager, Audi Urban Futures Initiative “The biggest change to the urban fabric will be to parking infrastructure,” says Futing, whose initiative sponsors research collaborations with academic and cultural institutions dedicated to urban mobility. “Parking will be moved indoors and outside of city centers, freeing up outdoor lots and spaces for development and public space. Lots them will be able to accommodate 60 percent more cars thanks to smaller driving lanes, greater maneuverability, and a lack of need for stairs and elevators.” Brooks Rainwater, Senior Executive Director, Center For City Solutions, National League of Cities Rainwater warns that few cities are thinking about the problem of self-driving cars. His group has found that only 6 percent of the country’s major cities’ long-range transportation master plans consider them. His most novel prediction is that the traditional boundaries of the urban form—such as those between roads, sidewalks, and street walls— will begin to break down. “Through technology you can get to a point where you no longer need traffic lights or clear distinctions between roads and sidewalks. Our cities will be more data intense and human-centered. You can really see the urban form shifting in ways that are hard to imagine. Particularly in our densest cities.” Go Back to Top.

While die-hard iPhone users are adjusting to Apple’s questionable decision to remove the headphone jack from the iPhone 7, Android enthusiasts are anticipating the late-October release of the Google Pixel. While Google has been behind the Android software for many years, Google Pixel represents a noticeable change in strategy as Google pushes to create its own mobile hardware. In the fiercely competitive smartphone industry, Google’s decision to vertically integrate from software into hardware development undoubtedly puts the company into even more direct competition with Apple. Apple and Google are widely regarded as the world’s leading firms in terms of innovation. As such, they have always had a friendly rivalry — whether it be Google Maps versus Apple Maps or Chrome versus Safari — the two firms have been able to remain indirect competitors because they fundamentally have operated in slightly different industries. Whereas Google has always   remained committed to its search engine services, Apple has focused on its constant reinvention of “smart” consumer products. However, the Google-branded Pixel phone now places the company directly in Apple iPhone territory. But why does it matter? Most of us already believe that the companies have been competing against one another, even if it has only been indirectly. This shift should be important to consumers because it represents the two most innovative firms going head to head in a way they never have before. Competition is at the heart of any free-market economy. When there is more than one producer of any given good or service, each producer is forced to constantly improve upon or differentiate its offering to remain relevant to consumers. As a result, competition inherently pushes firms to deliver superior service, lower prices or in rare cases, both, in order to acquire and retain consumers. Ultimately, when there are more firms competing in a given industry to deliver essentially the same good or service, consumers are the ultimate beneficiaries. Following this same principle, the launch of Google Pixel will provide virtually unparalleled benefits for consumers in the mobile communication industry. Since both Google and Apple are regarded as the best in what they do, competition directly against each other will push their creativity and innovation even further. As both Google and Apple now attempt to provide consumers with the best mobile hardware and software, better mobile devices will undoubtedly be produced. For consumers, this means that the competition between Google and Apple will ultimately leave us with better cell phones in the future than what we have available to use today. And that is a good thing. For the average consumer, mobile devices are likely to continue to advance in their specifications as companies like Google and Apple collide in research and development. In artificial intelligence, our devices will become more and more interactive, better able to understand us and to respond to our needs and preferences. In software, they will support a dizzying array of applications and features, allowing us to explore our world in new ways, seek further knowledge or further entertainment with massive memory banks that support all of our activities in storage. In hardware, the devices will also become faster, brighter and lighter as well as more and more rough-and-ready, able to be seamlessly integrated into any and all of our daily activities. They will speed along with us during our busiest working days and stay with us in our relaxation on quiet nights. A new world of possibility thus awaits the consumers of today if present trends of competition and innovation keep up. It will just be up to us to know how to adapt to it while keeping our priorities in line. So while Google Glass may have not been the most successful launch into hardware development for consumers, Google Pixel is sure to leave consumers much better off than we are right now.

That being said, here is what we know so far about Daydream View: What it is: Daydream View is a mobile VR headset, which means that you’ll use a compatible phone as a display. It’s similar to Samsung’s Gear VR headset, with some notable differences: Daydream View is covered with cloth, which makes it a lot more comfortable. It also comes with an external controller that doubles as a Wii-like game pad, tracking motion for game play and other applications. Price and availability: Daydream View costs $79, and can already be pre-ordered via Google’s web store. It will also be sold at Best Buy and Verizon stores. There’s still no official launch date for the device, with Google only stating that it would be “coming this November,” but users who pre-order it on Google’s site are being told that it will ship within the next 2-3 weeks. Launch apps: Google promises that there will be more than 50 apps available for Daydream before the end of the year. Some of these apps will include Netflix, Hulu, HBO Now, YouTube, NBA, MLB, CNN as well as VR apps from the New York Times, the Wall Street Journal, the Guardian and USA Today. There will also be a Jaunt VR app and an app for Baobab’s “Invasion!” animated VR short film. Games will include “Eve Gunjack 2,” “Need for Speed No Limits,” “Lego Brick Headz Dream Builder,” and “Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them.” Compatible phones: At launch, Daydream View will work with Google’s Pixel and Pixel XL phones. The headset isn’t limited to Google’s phones, and will over time also work with other VR-optimized Android smart phones from Daydream partners like Huawei, Asus, Samsung and Xiaomi. However, Daydream isn’t backwards compatible, so don’t expect to be able to use your Samsung S7 with the headset. Also not supported at all: Apple’s iPhones. Limitations: Daydream doesn’t support positional tracking, which essentially means that the headset doesn’t know where you are in a room, or which way you are moving. This means that many of the apps available on high-end VR headsets like Oculus Rift, HTC Vive or PlayStation VR won’t work on Daydream. Also amiss from Daydream View is any kind of augmented reality. The headset fully covers your phone’s front-facing camera, so it’s impossible for apps to use the camera input for augmented reality experiences.

In addition to the usual stability improvements and bug fixes, the latest version of Google’s mobile browser for the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch packs in a charming side-scrolling mini game that you can play when without an Internet connection. “No internet connection? Smile and tap the dinosaur,” tease release notes accompanying a 98.9-megabyte download. To unwind this hidden perk, put your device in Airplane Mode and visit any webpage in Chrome. You’ll see a “You are Offline” message and a charming little dinosaur. Tap the Dino to begin playing the retro-looking game. And here it is in action. Knowing Google, this was probably written in HTML5. At any rate, Chrome’s built-in dinosaur game should help shorten the wait for Nintendo’s Super Mario Run, an endless runner that was designed for one-handed play. Chrome is a free download from the App Store.

If you buy a Google Pixel or Pixel XL then take out the SIM tray and look very closely, you'll see... Wait, what is that? It's Google's address. To be specific, it's the address of Google's headquarters, though in slightly shortened form. The full thing is 1600 Amphitheatre Parkway, Mountain View, California, 94043, the United States of America. Why would you want to see Google's address every time you put a new SIM card into your Pixel? That's a good question, isn't it? And if you have the black model of either phone, the text is very readable and does stand out (it's less so with the silver versions). Could this be a semi-stealthy (or at least harder to find) nod to Apple's famous "Designed by Apple in California" inscription? Maybe. No one knows for sure - perhaps not even Google. But there you have it. Your Pixel comes with an apt reminder of the exact place on this Earth where its maker's HQ is located. See, you do learn something new every day.

I also discuss cases of Google Penguin 4.0 declines in rankings. Google still only uses HTTPS in the URL as the only qualifier for the ranking boost. Google said sitewide ranking scores are current state. Google said they do not have a website authority ranking score. Google said they do have a bunch of original source detection algorithms. Google said there is no reason to disavow blogroll links. There is also no Google Penguin boost. HTTP2 won’t help you rank better. Google has a new Google Search Console advisory board. Google AdWords launches click to message and affiliate location extensions. Google AdWords reports to soon show all shared reports bad default. The Google keyword planner tool now can import keywords from existing campaigns. That was this past week in search at the Search Engine Roundtable.

But 2017's looking up – there'll be loads of IPOs, beams Intel An extraordinary, focused attack on DNS provider Dyn continues to disrupt internet services for hundreds of companies, including online giants Twitter, Amazon, AirBnB, Spotify and others. The worldwide assault started at approximately 11am UTC on Friday. It was a massive denial-of-service blast that knocked Dyn's DNS anycast servers offline, resulting in knock-on impacts across the internet. Folks immediately started reporting problems; millions of people are affected. After two hours into the initial tidal wave of junk traffic, Dyn announced it had mitigated the assault and service was returning to normal. But the relief was short lived: just about an hour later, the attack resumed and at the time of writing (1800 UTC), not only is Dyn's service still down but its website is too. (Aptly, Dyn researcher Doug Madory had recently given a talk on DDoS attacks.) By blasting Dyn offline, public DNS providers – such as Google and broadband ISPs – are unable to contact Dyn to lookup hostnames for netizens, preventing people from accessing sites using Dyn for DNS. OpenDNS is about the only major public DNS provider weathering the storm – if you're having problems connecting to websites, you should use OpenDNS's resolvers at 208.67.222.222 and 208.67.220.220. OpenDNS uses smart caching during outages to keep looking up hostnames even if the websites' backend DNS is flooded off the 'net. What's happening is basically this: your browser or app tries to connect to somewebsite.com using a public DNS resolver, such as Google's or your cable provider. That resolver tries to get hold of Dyn to lookup the IP address for somewebsite.com, but can't because Dyn's systems have been shoved offline so the resolver gives up. Your software therefore can't get an IP address to connect to and also gives up with an error message. Public DNS providers struggle to resolve websites amid the @Dyn DDoS. OpenDNS is holding up. Here’s servers trying to resolve Twitter pic.twitter.com/WrmBX35RX7 — The Register (@TheRegister) October 21, 2016 Efforts to uncover the root cause or source of the traffic tsunami have proven fruitless: even the main switchboard is going through to voicemail. Staff are not answer their email or mobile phones and the company's own separate status page has not been updated for over an hour at the time of writing. An update at 4.48pm UTC read: "This DDoS attack may also be impacting Dyn Managed DNS advanced services with possible delays in monitoring. Our Engineers are continuing to work on mitigating this issue." What's the impact? Dyn provides managed DNS services to a huge array of companies. Ironically, that means that it promises to protect companies from the very DDoS attack that is currently suffering. By paying for a company to manage your own organization's DNS, the theory is that you can save yourself a lot of time and money by not having to hire IT staff or purchase hardware to handle internet infrastructure issues like DNSSEC, IPv6, and a range of logging and reporting systems. Dyn is one of roughly 10 large companies that offers this service for anything ranging from $10 a month for a single domain to thousands of dollars a month for large internet companies. What is most remarkable about this attack however is that it is specifically targeted at the provider of those services, rather than any particular company. The US Dept of Homeland Security is "investigating all potential causes" of the @Dyn DNS outage. — The Register (@TheRegister) October 21, 2016 With no information coming out of Dyn, it is impossible to know exactly what is going on and why, but the fact that it comes just a month after an enormous DDoS on security researcher Brian Krebs' website is raising eyebrows. That also was a specific targeted attack and the reason behind it was thought to be Krebs' research on DDoS attacks. The attack was one of the largest ever seen online, and the make matters worse, the source code to create the botnet that was used in the attack was then released into the wild. It's not know if the person behind Krebs' attack is the same one that is attacking Dyn but since Dyn is a company really only known to DNS infrastructure people, it is looks likely. Experts A raft of security experts have jumped on the issue, with most warning that the DNS itself has very little to protect itself against such an attack. Richard Meeus, VP of technology at NSFOCUS, which specializes in handling DDoS attacks noted: "DNS has often been neglected in terms of its security and availability from an enterprise perspective – it is treated as if it will always be there in the same way that water comes out of the tap and electricity is there when you switch it on. "This attack highlights how critical DNS is to maintaining a stable and secure internet presence, and that the DDOS mitigation processes businesses have in place are just as relevant to their DNS service as it is to the web servers and datacentres." Lee Munson, a security researcher at Comparitech.com, noted the irony of Dyn going down: "Any company running its own website may well have its own technology in place to mitigate DDoS attacks, but it’s all for nought if the DNS provider itself is not applying a sufficient enough level of protection to its own servers and data centres." David Gibson, VP of strategy at Varonis, noted: "Like many of our aging technologies, DNS wasn’t built with security in mind… DNS is one of the aging technologies the industry is struggling to update, along with one-factor authentication and unencrypted web connections – the list is very long, and the stakes have never been higher." Craig Young, a security researcher at Tripwire, added to the general concern: "As with most software designs from the 1980s, security was generally not considered when creating DNS. Because the web is so dependent on this system, it becomes a very visible point of failure as is the case today with service provider Dyn." And Paul Calatayud, CTO of FireMon, reflected briefly on what this meant for Dyn itself: "What causes me to pause and reflect most in regards to this breaking news is that Dyn DNS is a DNS SaaS provider. Its core job is to host and manage DNS services for its clients. The impact and harm has a ripple effect attributed to the various clients Dyn services. As attackers evaluate their targets, and organisations run to the proverbial cloud for various reasons, it introduces interesting targets for the bad guys." While we don't know exactly what is going on behind the scenes, two things are for certain: first, this is a game-changer and will be reviewed and talked about for some time; and second, Dyn has suffered a huge loss in reputation; one that will only get worse the longer it stays offline. ® See our latest story Dyn DDOS explained, for latest updates Sponsored: Customer Identity and Access Management Tips and corrections 99 Comments More from The Register 152k cameras in 990Gbps record-breaking dual DDoS Hacked low-powered cameras and internet-of-things things 47 Comments Blizzard blighted by another DDoS storm Someone likes fragging servers 9 Comments 123-Reg drowns in ongoing DDoS tsunami Data centre target of attack of 30+ Gbps 8 Comments UK's 'FBI' hit by DDoS barrage It's just a 'temporary inconvenience', says agency 12 Comments Trick not treat: 123 Reg down on Halloween, DNS borked by DDoS In the 21st century, kids can be a real nuisance 25 Comments Google rushes in where Akamai fears to tread, shields Krebs after world's-worst DDoS 600 Gbps traffic flood overwhelmed CDN 43 Comments Whitepapers Data and Analytics Maturity Model and Business Impact How top performing enterprises use their IT investments to store, process, and use data to make more effective, real-time decisions.

Sam Shedden 19:50 Friday 21 October 2016 3 Have your say Sam Shedden whizzes through the Outer Hebrides as he endeavours to find out how many Scottish islands you can visit in one day. “That’s it, that’s the ferry, we’re going to make it!”, I yell at my travelling companion as the distinctive red funnel of a Calmac boat springs up from the horizon. It is fast approaching 14:40 and I had so far only managed to set foot on two Scottish islands during my madcap quest to visit as many as possible in a single day. We rush towards the port, leaving behind the rugged mountains of Harris. The terminal is in sight, but as I round one of the final corners several cows meander onto the road ahead. The bovine pedestrians stare at our car with vacant looks. “If we miss this ferry we’re not going to make it to all eight”, I say as I squeeze the steering wheel. The ferry departs from Ullapool and the journey begins. Picture: Stephen McIlkenny Earlier this year, ferry operators Caledonian MacBrayne announced they were adding new routes to their timetable. CalMac’s intricate network of crossings connect 22 remote islands off the west coast of Scotland. A fascination with maps that has lingered since childhood and a fervent belief that my navigational abilities surpass anything Google can offer, led me to examine the company’s various ferry routes. A colleague had recently returned from a 24 hour trip to New York and had got me thinking about just how much you can achieve in one day. So, I plotted a course on what I believed was the best way to visit as many islands as possible in one day. There was only one option, the Western Isles. Setting Sail I’d visited a handful of Scotland’s inner isles before but never ventured as far out as the 130 mile archipelago of the Outer Hebrides or Western Isles. The main route to the islands is via the ferry that links Ullapool with the town of Stornoway on Lewis. Watching the mainland diminish on a windy aft deck of a ferry is a great way to unwind. Work, bills and the general stresses of everyday life fade with the landmass you’re escaping. Not this time. Our journey began within the cosy confines of Ullapool’s Arch Inn which sits right on the waterfront and is the perfect spot to start any Hebridean adventure. We had realised the night before just how perilously tight the first leg of the trip would be. We had a two and half hour ferry to Lewis and then we would need to traverse the entirety of Lewis and Harris - the third biggest island in the British isles - to reach the port of Leverburgh on the southern tip. If our Stornoway ferry ran like clockwork we would have 90 minutes to get to the southern tip of Harris and board our second ferry. The problem was Google Maps believed it would take exactly 90 minutes to reach our destination. We couldn’t afford any delays. “It will be fine, we’ll make it,” my optimistic friend reassured me (not for the first or last time). Yeah, what does Google know anyway, I thought. As the ‘Isle of Lewis’ - the biggest ship in the Calmac fleet - rumbles out of Ullapool’s sunny harbour I begin to worry - we had been delayed by ten minutes already. 1 and 2. Lewis and Harris The largest of the Western Isles with two thirds of the group’s 27,000 population, Lewis and Harris are technically one, connected by a narrow sliver of land. However, they are considered separate by islanders, in part, due to their own distinct histories that legend says is due to a split in the Macleod Clan centuries ago. As our ferry approaches the tiny capital of Stornoway we anxiously head back to the car deck. We are lucky when exiting the ferry. Our car lane is the first to disembark and so are spared the frustrations of being stuck behind trucks and European motor homes. Stornoway’s granite streets are our first experience of the Hebrides. Brightly coloured fishing boats dot the harbour, Gaelic sign posts greet us and chattering school kids pass us by as we make our way south. Mercifully the roads are clear once we get out of the town and soon empty moorlands of orange and brown surround us, lonely bothies the only signs of civilization in this far-flung corner of Britain. The final check-in time for our ferry from Leverburgh to the isle of Berneray comes and goes, I collected all our tickets in Ullapool so I’m hoping that we can drive straight onto the boat provided we get there before the departure time. It’s a close run affair and not one I would recommend, but somehow we make it with four minutes to spare. Elated we park the car and swagger onto the ferry’s passenger deck, jubilant in our triumph over Google Maps. 3-7. Berneray, North Uist, Benbecula, South Uist and Eriskay After conquering the most challenging segment of the trip we have time to enjoy our surroundings are able to take a more leisurely pace through the next five islands. We have three hours to pass through the middle section of the Hebrides. The ferry drops us on one of the smallest of the Western Isle’s fifteen inhabited islands, Berneray, which is ringed by sand dunes and pristine white beaches. Crossing a stone causeway we arrive in North Uist and take time to stop off in the village of Lochmaddy - which has a ferry link to the isle of Skye - where we are greeted by the bleats of hundreds of sheep penned in for a livestock auction and the rhythmic chanting of the auctioneer. Scattered across North Uist and South Uist lonely ruins and weathered standing stones can be seen entrenched in boggy fields, hinting at the thousands of years these islands have been populated. Much of North and South Uist is pitted with water, thousands of small lochs create a flooded landscape that enhance our sense of isolation. Sandwiched between the two Uists is Benbecula, where we stop at a Great War monument (one of many) that remembers the sacrifices thousands of islanders made for the war effort. As the sun disappears behind grey clouds and dusk approaches we arrive at island number seven, Eriskay, to catch our final ferry. 8. Barra The screeching of my car alarm draws disgruntled looks from my fellow passengers - most of whom are trying to sleep in their cars - as the choppy crossing from Eriskay bounces our little ferry up and down. By the time we disembark it is pitch black and we scuttle around the island’s west coast until we come to our resting place for the night, the Croit na h-Aibhne B&B where the owner Mary Ann gives us a warm welcome. Starting at 10:30 our journey has encompassed, eight islands, 200 miles and three ferries. We had crammed the entire Outer Hebrides into one day but they deserve a lot longer. The varied landscapes and rich histories of each isle mean there are many reasons to come back and explore in detail. “Will you be doing any more islands?” Mary Ann asks. No, I reply assuming she means in the following days. It is not until the ferry back to the mainland the next morning we discover that Barra is connected to the isle of Vatersay at its southern edge via a bridge. We could have made it to nine! Next time, perhaps.

Google has repackaged its offerings into Regional and Multi-Regional tiers, as well as the new Coldline cold storage offering to complement its existing Nearline tier. In addition to the new classes, Google is undercutting Amazon Web Services (AWS) on storage pricing and adding automation for moving objects between tiers. Last year, Google rolled out its first foray into cooler storage with Nearline. The service was seen as Google's closest competitor to Amazon Glacier, but with significant differences: Nearline costs more per gigabyte, for example, but it comes with a cheaper retrieval fee and is intended for data that is accessed more frequently. Cold storage in the public cloud can be good for archival storage that is rarely accessed, but the downside to these services is the high cost of pulling data out. Google has priced Coldline storage at the same rate Amazon charges for its comparable Glacier service -- $0.007 per gigabyte, per month. The two providers charge differently for access to the data, however, with Google charging $0.05 per gigabyte for retrievals, compared with $0.05 per 1,000 retrieval or upload requests on Glacier. Video sharing and streaming service Vimeo Inc. uses Multi-Regional, as well as Nearline, and it works with Fastly, a real-time content delivery network service and Google cloud partner, to provide sub-150 millisecond response times for customers. Vimeo used Glacier, but moved to Nearline because of the time it took to get data out of the AWS offering. It's now exploring Coldline to fill that same role in some cases. "We want to be cost-effective as long as we're not compromising performance," said Narendra Venkataraman, senior director of engineering at Vimeo, based in New York. Coldline provides millisecond access to storage intended for long-term archiving accessed less than once a year for uses such as big data or multimedia content. Glacier, meanwhile, can take several hours to retrieve data. Vimeo was an early adopter of AWS and still uses the platform, as well as its own data centers, but it's found some advantages to using Google Cloud Platform. The high number of end points across the globe addresses latency and provides faster mobile uploads for users, and the platform enables users to resume a file upload anytime, rather than having to do it all in one chunk like they do on AWS, Venkataraman said. New Google Cloud Storage tiers cheaper than AWS The Multi-Regional tier is targeted at workloads that require high availability and geo-redundancy. It's priced at $0.026 per gigabyte, per month, including any and all replication and rerouting across the network. That service is currently limited to the U.S., EU and Asia regions, and any existing standard storage buckets in multiregional locations have been automatically converted to the new storage class. Google Cloud Storage Regional provides redundancy within a region and is intended for workloads that need to pair storage and compute for analytics, machine learning and other similar services. At $0.02 per gigabyte, per month, the new tier effectively represents a 23% drop in pricing from the current offering. It also comes in under what Amazon charges for its standard storage, which ranges between $0.0275 and $0.03 per gigabyte, per month. Trying to be the lowest cost for storage is one of the on-ramps to the cloud ... once you do that, you make it more frictionless to get the adjacent services. Jeff Katosenior analyst and consultant, Taneja Group The regional tier will be available Nov. 1, along with new API operations pricing for both Multi-Regional and Regional that cuts prices by up to 60% off the current rate, depending on the operations class customers select. Price cuts around storage are all about getting as much customer data on a platform as possible in order to sell higher-level services, said Jeff Kato, senior analyst and consultant at the Taneja Group Inc., in Hopkinton, Mass. Providers know customers will want to do more than just store the data, and the high cost to transfer data out of a public cloud often makes it easier to do things like analytics on the platform. "Trying to be the lowest cost for storage is one of the on-ramps to the cloud," Kato said. "The key is to get it there, and once you do that, you make it more frictionless to get the adjacent services." Lifecycle management now in beta Google also added a series of partners to its storage network, as well as a lifecycle management capability currently in beta. The new feature allows users to set policies that automatically move objects to colder tiers based on their age. Multi-Regional is an important tier for customers doing continuous integration and delivery that make configuration changes in real time, while the lifecycle management could be a compelling addition to the platform, said Lee Chen, head of strategic partnerships at Fastly, based in San Francisco. Fastly, which partners with all the major public cloud providers, connects to Google's cloud to provide edge connections and real-time performance analytics. Chen cited the example of customer-facing resources that can go months without getting touched, but can see massive, unexpected spikes in traffic. Being able to easily move data between the tiers could enable Google Cloud customers to improve the economics of cloud storage even further, he said.

UNCENSORED Robots Are Now Working in Translation Services and Retail This week, Inc. editors and writers talk about the rise of robots in translation services and retail stores. Ean Seeb, marijuana entrepreneur, discusses how he sold his dispensary and licenses to grow in Colorado to Willie Nelson. By Will Yakowicz Will Yakowicz is an award-winning journalist and a staff writer and podcaster for Inc. magazine. Before Inc., he reported from the West Bank and Moscow for Tablet Magazine; he covered business, crime, and local politics for The Brooklyn Paper; and he was the editor of Park Slope Patch. He lives in Brooklyn, New York. @WillYakowicz Staff writer, Inc.@WillYakowicz WRITE A COMMENT Pepper will be sold to retailers and researchers in the U.S. for the first time this year. CREDIT: Will Yakowicz Advertisement Welcome to the 87th episode of the Inc. Uncensored podcast! This week's episode is hosted by Inc. editor Jim Ledbetter. Reporter Zoe Henry talks about the advances in artificial intelligence-powered language and translation services like Siri and Google Translate. Google's new translation technology, called the Google Neural Machine Translation System, is now looking at entire sentences instead of prior methods that translated each word individually. Henry argues that Google's claims that the robot translators have human-level accuracy is flawed and that human translators should not be forgotten. According to this year's Inc. 5000 list, translation service is one of the fastest-growing industries this year, and there is a lot at stake if robots are trusted completely. Subscribe at the iTunes store Staff writer Will Yakowicz talks about his experience meeting SoftBank's robot Pepper. The robot, which can hold simple two-way conversations and is said to be able to recognize human emotions, will be sold to retailers to engage customers. While the robot is not perfect, it can be connected to cloud-based AI platforms like IBM's Watson. The group talks about how robots are being created to do certain tasks but the future of more advanced robots is coming. Lastly, the podcast crew interviews entrepreneur Ean Seeb, who co-founded one of the first and longest-running dispensaries in Denver, Colorado. Seeb and his co-founders recently sold their business and licenses to grow marijuana legally to Willie Nelson (who launched his marijuana brand Willie Reserve). Seeb talks about what it was like to build a multimillion-dollar business--and then say goodbye to his baby. You can listen to individual episodes of the Inc. Uncensored podcast, which is part of the Panoply network, or on iTunes--where you can also subscribe. We hope you enjoy. Stream the 87th episode above. Published on: Oct 21, 2016 Advertisement

He writes the Tech Report column for Inc.com. @jmbrandonbb Contributing editor, Inc.com@jmbrandonbb WRITE A COMMENT CREDIT: Getty Images Advertisement It's brand spanking new. The shrinkwrap is freshly crinkled, there's a faint smell of packing peanuts in the air. That's right, you're the proud owner of the Google Pixel or what many pundits are calling the best smartphone ever, or least the best challenger to the throne occupied by the iPhone. The good news? Your smartphone is probably smarter than you realize. These tips and tricks will help you do amazing things, impress everyone in the office, and even take a selfie by using your voice. Try doing that in your local Apple store and see what everyone says. 1. Take a selfie by voice That's right, your phone is a selfie master. When you say "OK, Google" you can ask the Assistant, which is like Siri but understands the context of your conversations, to snap a photo. When you do, there's a quick countdown and then a snap. Bonus if you use it for fake spy photos. 2. Ask the Assistant to recite a poem Try it now--it's awesome. The Assistant can recite a sonnet by Shakespeare or something by Emily Dickinson. It's proof that robots can read us books and poems to ease our stress. Make sure you say the exact phrase "recite a poem" or it won't work. 3. Set your phone to record 4K video The Pixel ships with HD video recording enabled, which is a bit puzzling until you realize how big these recorded files can be. You can record in 4K, though, just like the iPhone 7. And, the Pixel XL even has a 2560 x 1440 resolution screen for watching the results. Just start the camera, click the settings on the upper left, then Settings and look for video resolution. 4. Double-tap the power button to access the camera If you need to take a quick photo, double-tap the power button. It brings up the camera faster than I would expect so you can make sure Bigfoot doesn't slip back into the woods. 5. Long press on app icons Be sure to try holding down your finger on app icons. For example, if you hold press on the Messenger app for texting, you can quickly start a new conversation. I'm expecting more app developers to take advantage of this quick access feature. 6. Take advantage of quick charge If you're an iPhone user, you might not be used to this. With the PIxel, you can charge up the phone quite a bit--e.g., seven hours of usage in 15 minutes. It changes some of the dynamics. You can let the phone run all day without worrying too much and "reup" quickly. 7. Ask the Assistant to make the sound of a helicopter One of my favorites is asking the Assistant this exact question: "What sound does a helicopter make?" Make sure you use that phrase, because the bot will then play the sound of a helicopter. Why is that cool? Because bots will one day play clips from movies, pronounce words, and teach us how to sing. They will become more and more like a trusted friend. 8. Order a custom case You might not know this, but the Pixel lets you add custom designed cases. Just go to Google.com/livecase and upload your photo, pick a Google Maps locale, or pick a design. Cases also have a programmable shortcut button for a favorite app. The opinions expressed here by Inc.com columnists are their own, not those of Inc.com. Published on: Oct 21, 2016 Advertisement

Follow TechnoBuffalo This week, Google rolled out the first developer preview for Android 7.1, introducing features such as app shortcuts and image keyboard support. Unfortunately, the preview doesn’t include Google’s Night Light feature, which warms your screen so it’s not quite so hard on your eyes. There’s more. According to Ian Lake, an Android developer advocate, Night Light and fingerprint reader gestures won’t be coming to existing Nexus phones at all. If you want the best Android experience, you’ll have to pick up a Pixel. These features aren’t the only ones to be kept from Nexus owners. Google Assistant is also exclusive to the Pixel, although there are ways to get it up and running on devices running Android Nougat. Android Police points out the features aren’t coming to Nexus phones due to hardware limitations. If you want the best Android experience, you’ll have to pick up a Pixel. Night Light is particularly useful because studies show blue light emitted from mobile displays can negatively affect how well you sleep. Apple introduced a similar feature in iOS 10 called Night Shift. Nexus owners are still getting some pretty cool features in Android 7.1, but it still sucks hearing about features that won’t make it to older devices.

Published on October 21, 2016. AwesomenessTV, one of the companies cited in a complaint by advocacy groups over influencer marketing directed toward children. Credit: AwesomenessTV/Dreamworks Most Popular A group of industry watchdogs are calling for Google, DreamWorks' Awesomeness TV, Walt Disney's Maker Studios and two other companies to stop influencer marketing that targets children. The Center for Digital Democracy, Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood and Public Citizen on Friday filed a complaint with the Federal Trade Commission asking the agency to investigate and take action against the companies for what they called "unfair and deceptive practice of targeting influencer marketing toward children." They also urged the FTC to issue policy guidelines that would prohibit companies from using influencers to target children. It has become increasingly common for marketers to create content featuring popular personalities on YouTube, which is part of Google, and other online celebrities to promote their brands and products on social platforms. In a press release, the advocacy groups argued that these "'influencer' ads take unfair advantage of kids, who do not have the ability to recognize that companies use social media and YouTube celebrities to pitch toys, junk food and other products." The advocacy groups pointed to videos of child stars unboxing toys, playing games and sampling junk food that appear on YouTube channels. Representatives of Google, Awesomeness TV, Maker Studios and the FTC did not respond to requests for comment. (Update: A Google spokeswoman said in an email that YouTube wants content creators to be up front with viewers if their videos include any kind of paid promotion. "As our long-standing policy makes clear, anyone uploading videos to YouTube has a legal obligation to disclose to YouTube and their viewers if a video contains paid promotion," she said. "Any videos that have disclosed paid product placement or endorsements are restricted from the YouTube Kids app.") The Institute for Public Representation at Georgetown University Law Center is representing the groups making the complaint. "Child-directed influencer marketing is misleading to children because their developing brains do not process or understand advertisements the way adults do -- especially advertisements disguised as content," said Laura Moy, director at the institute, in the press release. FTC regulations require influencer marketing to be identified as advertising. But the groups argued Friday that disclosure is not enough because it "would not negate the inherent deceptiveness of child-directed influencer marketing." The Center for Digital Democracy and Campaign for a Commercial-Free Childhood have previously filed complaints with the FTC concerning child-directed marketing practices on YouTube and its Kids hub, specifically for mixing ads and content. The FTC did not take any action. Last year YouTube added parental controls to its Kids app to allow parents to restrict their kids' searches. The FTC has been cracking down on influencer marketing. The agency has said celebrities who are getting paid to promote a product need to indicate such in their social posts. From the marketers' perspective, however, hashtags like "#ad" or "#sp" for "sponsored" make the posts seem less authentic and natural. Warner Bros. settled charges with the FTC this summer over its marketing for the video game "Middle Earth: Shadow Mordor." The FTC charged that Warner Bros did not ensure that influencers disclosed that they had been paid to promote the video game. And earlier this year Lord & Taylor settled charges over a social campaign where it paid influencers to post photos of themselves wearing a dress but influencers did not disclose the sponsorship.

Launched on October 4, both new Google-designed smartphones, the Pixel and Pixel XL, are exclusive to Verizon in the U.S. Contract-free Pixels are available via Google’s online store and from Best Buy. Before we get to the teardown, YouTuber JerryRigEverything yesterday conducted a durability test of his Pixel XL, confirming that the speaker slit is made of cloth. “This is the first thing that surprised me,” said the YouTuber. “The earpiece made is made of cloth unlike the plastic and metal speaker grilles on other phones.” It will be interesting seeing how the use of cloth affects audio quality over time, but cleaning the earpiece won’t be a trivial affair due to possible puncturing. Pixel XL has these key features: 5.5-inch 534ppi AMOLED display with 1,440 x 2,560 resolution Curved 2.5D Gorilla Glass 4 64-bit Qualcomm Snapdragon 821 processor with a pair of 2.15 GHz high-performance CPU cores and two power-efficient 1.6 GHz cores 4GB LPDDR4 RAM 12.3-megapixel f/2.0 back camera with phase detection autofocus, laser detection autofocus, no unsightly bump and no optical image stabiliziation 8-megapixel front camera 32 GB or 128 GB built-in storage Pixel Imprint back-mounted fingerprint sensor USB Type-C port and 3.5 mm headphone port No Home button (onscreen button instead) Android 7.1 Nougat Now on to iFixit’s teardown analysis. The Pixel XL uses standard T5 Torx screens, unlike Apple’s special Pentalobe screws in the iPhone. The vivid Samsung-made AMOLED panel separates from the digitizer glass easily. The display assembly not so much due to thin components and no frame or bezel behind the display. The touch controller is a Synaptics ClearPad S3708 module. iFixit notes that Google has a different take on the “pull to remove” battery tab in the form of a perforated portion of the sleeve that, when peeled away (without heat), “becomes an impressive pull tab.” The HTC-made 13.28 Wh battery beats out the iPhone 7 Plus’s 11.1 Wh battery, but falls behind the 13.86 Wh one in the Galaxy S7 Edge (the Note 7 packed a 13.48 Wh battery). iFixit praises Google’s use of modular components that can be easily replaced, like the 3.5mm headphone jack, the front-facing camera and an interconnect board with a status LED, an ambient light sensor and a microphone. iFixit wrote: These smaller bits aren’t always so modular. In other phones, we often find them clustered together on the main board. More modularity means cheaper and easier repairs—if a single component fails, you don’t have to replace the entire motherboard or embark on a risky microsoldering adventure. Other components iFixit was able to identify include an NXP-made NFC controller, Samsung-made NAND flash chips and Qualcomm-made audio codec, dynamic antenna matching tuner, LTE RF transceiver, power management circuitry and fast-charging Quick Charge 3.0 platform. The USB Type-C port is a bare-bones part, meaning cheap USB port replacements. Component design and layout point to the Pixel being the first truly Google-made smartphones in a way that the Nexus family was not. “With nearly everything out of the case, we’ve seen almost zero evidence of this phone’s HTC manufacturing origin” aside from the HTC mark on the battery, notes iFixit. As mentioned, most parts can be easily replaced once the display assembly is removed because most parts are modular, the battery has a removal tab and is adhered by a modest amount of adhesive and the screws are standard T5 Torx ones. In conclusion, iFixit gave the Pixel XL a repairability score of six out of ten, the best repairability score of any HTC-manufactured device.

Source: iFixIt Y’all guys just changed iFixit to iFixIt everywhere in this article… Christian Zibreg Me too 😀 Thanks for the heads-up! Agneev Mukherjee You’re welcome 😀 leart I’m wondering how much Google payed to get reviews for this device, i mean not in this site but around the internet lol Matt Just as much as every other company smh… leart i dont think so.. really, google has no appeal at all Dave Kurt A lot… YouTube, for instance, it’s riddled with corruption. These influential internet personalities have, for a long time, been advocates of the Android operating system… Bashing the iPhone for the ‘lack’ of features; water resistance, expendable storage, wireless charging, et cetera. So I ask, how can these people who have bashed the iPhone for the lack of these features, in the same damn breath, praise the Google pixel?! Like, of course, now it doesn’t matter… Of course, now it’s simplicity that matters. 😀 Get real! What made the iPhone sh*t is what makes the Pixel good? Great logic. leart here’s a epic picture, lol 4 devicee on its first iOS release .. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/f971808a72e0d1e9964494032475db600b6117c9e559c0d63ce27730ff7aec88.jpg PhoneTechJay Eww it’s just another HTC no thank you. askep3 If the iPhone 7 had an 8 megapixel front facing camera they could’ve advertised it as just as good as the 6’s actual camera (if it performed just as well of course) 5723alex . It is almost impossible to teardown the Pixel without breaking the screen. Matt Foot Overpriced, over-hyped junk. I can buy 3-6 pristine Lenovo ThinkPad laptops for the same price, get WAY more productivity out of them, and they’ll outlast this junk by 10-15 years! Legend Thinkpads are crap laptops.. you’d be lucky if you got a year out of them… Lets not kid ourselves. Matt Foot Sure, they *really* must be awful if they are the ONLY laptops that have, and are certified by NASA for use on space missions for many years. Yep, only a year of use can be had from them… that’s why I am typing this on a Lenovo ThinkPad R61, released in 2007 and STILL working flawlessly. Yep, that seems to give credence to your statement, eh? My Uncle has a *sixteen* year old ThinkPad T21 (okay, very slow) STILL working perfectly and in long time use since day one. Yep, continuing this trend of being “crap laptops” is the 760E, released in the mid 1990s, STILL WORKING PERFECTLY as seen in my video, here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_63iPYjW0Ms And finally we have a brand new, consumer grade smartphone, so new and shiny as to be an unknown quantity, but what IS known is that the likelihood of it still being in undamaged, full working order and serviceable in 21 years time, is ZERO. Maybe SOME of the more recent, consumer grade Lenovo notebooks are rubbish, yes, but not ALL. So… tell me again about how “crap” ThinkPads are? Legend BRUV buy a REAL laptop …. like a Macbook pro…. CLOWN. Can’t afford it? Can only afford $100? that’s your fault BUM Matt Foot I am not your “bruv”, sonny Jim. Being able to afford something or not is irrelevant – if I wanted ten MacBook Pro laptops I’d buy them TOMORROW. Don’t confuse wealth with intelligence, you’re a shining example of that fallacy falling flat on its face. Any fool can be rich, but only the biggest fool makes assumptions regarding the things they think other “ought to buy”. Cheerio. Legend BRUV… you have a THINKPAD!!!! You’re broke. I’M DONE LMFAOOOOO Matt Foot Making the common mistake of assuming wealth increases intelligence… gosh, you’re really up the creek if you think so. You’re a shining example of someone as shallow and superficial as to not notice your own deficiencies and the foolishness of your erroneous assumptions. Duh.

Music News Entertainment Politics Features Share < br />this article: Google dropped its ban on personally identifiable web tracking In News by Jamie Peck / October 21, 2016 Share < br />this article: Follow @jamie_elizabeth Good news for people who hate online privacy: Google quietly lifted its ban on personally identifiable web tracking. When Google first began tracking users’ web history as a way to target ads via the DoubleClick network back in 2007, Google founder Sergey Brin insisted his company would never tie the data gathered to any personally identifiable information. Experts say it hasn’t, and I believe them, because fuck if I know how to tell if they’re doing that. But over the summer, Google began tying users’ personal information with data gleaned from their online activity — including, oh no, what they write in their Gmail accounts — for the first time, asking existing users to opt into a new version of the company’s privacy agreement. (New Google users are opted into the new policy by default.) The language is as follows: If that sounds like all the super personal shit you say in Gchat, the porn you jerk off to, and the serial killer documentaries you watch out of purely academic interest will now be stored in a database tied to your name and info, that’s because they will be! From ProPublica: The practical result of the change is that the DoubleClick ads that follow people around on the web may now be customized to them based on the keywords they used in their Gmail. It also means that Google could now, if it wished to, build a complete portrait of a user by name, based on everything they write in email, every website they visit and the searches they conduct. … “The fact that DoubleClick data wasn’t being regularly connected to personally identifiable information was a really significant last stand,” said Paul Ohm, faculty director of the Center on Privacy and Technology at Georgetown Law.“It was a border wall between being watched everywhere and maintaining a tiny semblance of privacy,” he said. “That wall has just fallen.” In a statement to ProPublica, Google spokeswoman Andrea Faville contended that the increased surveillance will only be used to target ads better on your various devices, and anyway, it’s easy to opt out: Our advertising system was designed before the smartphone revolution. It offered user controls and determined ads’ relevance, but only on a per-device basis. This past June we updated our ads system, and the associated user controls, to match the way people use Google today: across many different devices. Before we launched this update, we tested it around the world with the goal of understanding how to provide users with clear choice and transparency. As a result, it is 100% optional–if users do not opt-in to these changes, their Google experience will remain unchanged. Equally important: we provided prominent user notifications about this change in easy-to understand language as well as simple tools that let users control or delete their data. Users can access all of their account controls by visiting My Account and we’re pleased that more than a billion have done so in its first year alone. Right, because people always pay such close attention to what they’re agreeing to when a little box pops up and interrupts their cat video binge. Even if you have faith that they’re only using this information to annoy you with the same ads across multiple devices, do you really trust Google to keep a lid on it? The company has already handed over quite a lot of goodies to the government, not to mention the havoc that could be wreaked by hackers. Can you even imagine the national gridlock that would ensue if Vladimir Putin posted everyone’s bitchiest Gchats? America would simply die. Luckily, concerned parties can opt out — for now — using these instructions from ProPublica: To opt-out of Google’s identified tracking, visit the Activity controls on Google’s My Account page, and uncheck the box next to “Include Chrome browsing history and activity from websites and apps that use Google services.” You can also delete past activity from your account.   Just because it’s an uphill battle doesn’t mean we shouldn’t try to resist molestation by Google’s grabby, ever-encroaching tentacles.

INTU, -1.23% today announced the start of a collaboration with Google to boost productivity for small businesses around the world. The companies are working together on product integrations for small businesses using G Suite, formerly called Google Apps for Work, and QuickBooks Online. The companies kicked off the collaboration by introducing two new releases: Google Calendar and QuickBooks Online – This new integration allows business owners to schedule client work and appointments with Google Calendar, and these billable appointments are available in QuickBooks for invoicing customers and managing finances. Prior to this integration, small businesses had to manually enter each activity from their Google calendar into QuickBooks, which took longer and increased the chance of human error.

SUBSCRIBE Is your location data being held hostage? Columnist Adam Dorfman makes the case for using the power of data amplifiers to ensure your business location data is correct and consistent across the web. Adam Dorfman on October 21, 2016 at 12:00 pm More Paying to have your location data directly managed on tier-two directories is like buying Twitter followers: you might think you’re buying more visibility, but ultimately you’ll waste your money and effort. The recent experience of a healthcare provider illustrates this point vividly. Not all directories deserve your attention A directory becomes “tier-two” when it lacks visibility in search engine results pages. Tier-two directories might have once been favored by Google’s search algorithm for local queries but aren’t anymore. They remain part of the local search conversation primarily because of their past reputations, not their current performance — which can make it more difficult for businesses to make informed choices about where to invest their location marketing spend. For example, a healthcare provider (a client of ours) contacted us after a location marketing vendor tried to convince one of the doctors in their network to pay for a listing on one such tier-two directory, Insider Pages. The vendor noted that the client was not listed on Insider Pages and suggested that the client could make the problem go away by paying a monthly premium to the vendor, which, in turn, would update the client’s physician data on Insider Pages. This approach is fraught with a number of problems. First of all, Insider Pages operates as a closed-loop advertising network through an exclusive relationship with the vendor that had contacted our client. Essentially, the vendor was relying on a racket: you have a problem with a site that is a partner of ours. Pay us, and we’ll make the problem disappear. How convenient! Had our client fallen for this scare tactic, they would have discovered that for a healthcare provider, Insider Pages is a marginal site and is not a relevant source for consumers looking for physicians. To-wit: According to SimilarWeb, Insider Pages is a website that received 203,000 unique visits in total last month for more than 1,000 categories of businesses (healthcare categories accounts for 82 of those). Whitespark has them ranked Number 27 as a general citation source, just behind Brownbook and Cyclex USA, and Insider Pages isn’t even on the list of important citation sources for doctors. By comparison, Healthgrades received 20,900,000 visits last month, and all of their traffic was healthcare-related. Unsurprisingly, they are ranked Number One on Whitespark’s list of important citations for doctors. It’s no wonder that in 2016, our healthcare clients received on average only one website referral from Insider Pages for every 600,000 visitors to their physician and location directories. Today’s mobile, omnichannel world requires a different approach — one that treats location data as an owned asset to create long-term business impact. Rather than waste money by following a paid inclusion model that focuses on tier-two directories, brands must now build location data assets that are usable across the search ecosystem as it exists today and as it will exist in the future. Doing so also means sharing that data with high-impact data amplifiers — or the most influential publishers and aggregators of location data — augmented by relationships with a few carefully curated niche vertical market publishers. The advantages of data amplifiers As my colleague Gib Olander has defined, data amplifiers consist of publishers (such as Apple and Google) and data aggregators (such as Infogroup), which together make sure an enterprise’s location data is made available to all the places where people conduct near me searches. Data amplifiers have become more important because near me searches have not only exploded in growth by number, but also in places that they occur. Someone looking for a doctor or a restaurant might rely on a Google app, Yelp, Foursquare, or Apple Spotlight Search, as well as well known vertical sites such as Healthgrades or TripAdvisor. Data amplifiers ensure that a brand’s location data is visible on all the places where moments of discovery happen. A location data management strategy that focuses on distributing location data assets via data amplifiers works. According to SIM Partners proprietary research, enterprises that improved the accuracy and reach of their location data by just 20 percent saw traffic to their location pages increase up to 450 percent and on-page action conversion rates increase by 216 percent. Auditing a client’s data To illustrate the point to our client, we conducted an audit for a few of the physicians that the vendor insisted needed to appear on Insider Pages. When we conducted searches for the physicians on Google, they appeared on high-value listings across the board. But the Insider Pages listing did not even appear on the first 10 pages of results. Moreover, the doctors ranked in the Google Snack Pack for a number of highly competitive non-branded queries related to the physician’s areas of specialty. This result is not surprising. A BrightLocal survey has shown that local SEOs suspect that the quantity of citations matters less these days, while the quality of citations matters more — not at all unlike the way link signals have evolved over the years in Google’s core ranking algorithm. In addition, citation-related metrics in Moz’s Local Search Ranking Factors survey have dropped in importance every year since 2013. Finally, LocalSEOGuide’s recent Local SEO Ranking Factors study has shown that citations can play a role in getting a business into a snack pack but have little importance in how well a business ranks once it is there. Citations are still important. Businesses should consider them to be table stakes for building visibility. But publishing perfectly accurate citations on marginal sites becomes less influential on how well your brand ranks. Rather than overpay to correct a listing that has nearly negligible value to our client’s business, we recommended that our client distribute their data to Infogroup, which, in turn, feeds data to Insider Pages (as well as a number of more relevant directories). As noted, this approach makes the most sense, as Insider Pages gets very little traffic and has almost no impact on our client’s Google performance. It’s also a shame that Insider Pages hasn’t updated their FAQ page to reflect the new reality of how business listings are managed on their site. The directory still states that businesses can claim and manage their listings for free by logging in — which has not been possible for some time. This inaccurate information causes additional confusion when local businesses receive email solicitations that their location data needs to be corrected on Insider Pages. When businesses check Insider Pages to review their faulty location data, the site suggests that their local search vendor should be able to resolve the problem immediately, which is just not true. Unleash your location data If your brand operates multiple locations, I urge you to: form relationships with data amplifiers to unleash your data as a valuable asset. Or work with a location marketing platform provider that can manage the relationships for you. beware of firms that try to entice you with the promise of increased visibility through a paid inclusion model — especially one that involves a closed-loop advertising platform. apply a critical eye when you evaluate individual citations. Ask yourself how likely it is that customers of your business will see this citation source. If you were a Google engineer, how important would you view this citation source when building ranking algorithms? Also, look at your Web analytics to see how frequently these citation sources are sending traffic to your site. Don’t let your listings be held hostage. Unleash your data through amplifiers.

By Nick Heath | October 21, 2016, 9:40 AM PST RSS Comments Facebook Linkedin Twitter More Email Print Reddit Delicious Digg Pinterest Stumbleupon Google Plus Image: LawrenLu/Getty Images/iStockphoto Like moving house, packing up your data and shifting it from one cloud to another can be a stressful experience. But not as fraught as you might think, says Jyrki Pulliainen, who as a software engineer at music streaming service Spotify has just overseen the move of about 1.5 billion files from Amazon Web Services (AWS) to Google Cloud Storage. While Spotify stumbled over a few gotchas when shifting the 3PB of data, the process was completed in the past couple of weeks and without major setbacks. Here's what Spotify learned from moving from AWS Simple Storage Service (S3) to Google Cloud Storage, as part of its wider migration to Google Cloud Platform. 1. Check if your infrastructure is tightly coupled to your old cloud Spotify baked the names of the AWS S3 storage buckets into the names of the keys for its data caches, in order to help with A/B testing. "It turns out this is a bad idea when you migrate the bucket," said Pulliainen, who added that Spotify had to pause the migration while it updated its cache keys. 2. Watch out for unexpected latency spikes As part of the move, Spotify shifted data from an AWS datacenter in Ireland to a facility in Google's US Central region, due to most of Spotify's customers now residing in North America. Following the switch, Spotify was surprised to see higher than expected latency when serving data to some US customers. "The lesson learned here is that our private capacity points had IP addresses registered to Stockholm, so we were ping-ponging to Europe and ping-ponging back to US Central to fetch the files," he said, speaking at the Google Cloud Platform Next conference in London. "So if you do these kind of moves, remember to check where your IP addresses are registered and change them accordingly." 3. Check how well your new cloud provider integrates with your CDN Spotify uses three major content delivery network (CDN) providers, Fastly, Akamai and Verizon, to cache music locally for users across the globe. Data Center Must-Reads Photos: A look inside Google's, Microsoft's and Facebook's datacenters Gartner's 10 big trends that will change how IT operates 10 DevOps experts to follow on Twitter Ebook: IT leader’s guide to making DevOps work While Spotify's CDN partners offer Google Cloud Storage (GCS) support 'out of the box', there were some roadblocks. A negative for Spotify is that its CDN providers "don't really support" OAuth, the token-based authentication system that allows third-party services to access online accounts without knowing the user's password. "We would have liked to have had OAuth support. We had to create artificial Google accounts for our CDN providers. It's a hassle for us, for our IT department, for our security and we get less fine-grained access control." 4. Check what you'll lose during the move Each cloud provider has strengths and weaknesses, so you should expect some gaps. Check which features from your existing cloud provider are missing or inferior to your previous choice. "Now that we've done the move, we are generally really happy but we have some wishes for the future. "We would love to see cross-continental replication, like the fact we now run in a US Central regional bucket, that causes a slight latency for our European users. "We ideally would like to have another bucket in Asia. At the moment, the GCS does not allow cross-continental replication. "We're also seeing slightly lower cold read latencies than with S3, the good news is that Google has improvements upcoming and we've worked with them to shear off 30ms. Pulliainen added that these latencies should be invisible to users, due to Spotify's technical architecture. Aspects of his specific complaints may have been addressed by Google with the introduction of the new Coldline and Multi-regional storage tiers this week, but his point of looking for gaps still stands. 5. Check how simple the transfer process will be One of the most obvious things for firms to check up front are which tools are available to copy data between their old and new cloud provider, and how good these tools are. Spotify moved some 1.5bn files — covering music, cover images and metadata — totalling about 3PB of data between S3 and Google Cloud Storage. While moving this much data understandably took a couple of weeks, the actual process was straightforward, said Pulliainen, who described moving the 1.5bn files as nothing more than a matter of "clicking around a UI for a moment" and called the overall experience "super simple". Out of the 1.5bn files, 144 had transfer failures, but Pulliainen said it took Google less than one day to track down those that were missing.

The New York pop-up shop will be open through the end of this year, and let people get their hands on new Google devices such as Pixel smartphones which began shipping Thursday in a direct challenge to Apple's latest iPhones. "This is not even a testing ground, just an extension of the launch," Google spokeswoman Chrissy Persico said at the showroom opening event. "We want people to come in and experience the products." Google early this month took on rivals Apple, Samsung and Amazon in a new push into hardware, launching the in-house designed Pixel smartphone and a slew of other devices showcasing artificial intelligence prowess. By producing both the phone hardware and its Android software, Google is making a more direct assault on Apple and its tightly controlled ecosystem. The pop-up shop also displayed Google's freshly unveiled Daydream View virtual reality headset, a modular wi-fi system, and a Home virtual assistant that will challenge the Amazon Echo device. Nothing is sold at the Google shop, but the staff directs potential customers to the company's online store or telephone operators who can take orders for products. A wall in the shop is decorated with an artful arrangement of blue, red, yellow and green blocks, arranged to display the internet company's trademark colors. Only 30 or so visitors ventured into the pop-up store for its opening morning, a lean showing in comparison to mobs typically drawn to new Apple stores.

The search giant once vowed to make privacy a priority, keeping identifiable information gathered from Gmail separate from the web-browsing data used by advertisers. But as of June 28, that distinction is no longer in place by default. According to the update, user activity “on other sites and apps may be associated with your personal information in order to improve Google’s services and the ads delivered by Google.” This change was widely glossed over when it first was made, but ProPublica recently took a closer look. If you were an existing user at the time of the move, you would have received an opt-in request titled something along the lines of “Some new features for your Google account.” Anyone who has signed up for an account since then would have been opted in by default. In the past, the customized DoubleClick ads that popped up around the web were only based on users' Google searches—but now they can reference keywords mined from Gmail as well. It’s easy to see how this might raise privacy concerns for some users, especially those who weren’t aware of the switch. To see if you’re affected, go to the Activity Controls section on Google’s My Account page. If the box that reads “Include Chrome browsing history and activity from websites and apps that use Google services” is unchecked, you’re in the clear. Unfortunately, Google is just one of the sites doing questionable things with your personal information. To see how much Facebook knows about you, you can download this Chrome plug-in.

Instead of using multiple applications for various needs, Facebook and Google are looking to layer these services to a single platform. From ordering food, to hailing a cab and booking car-cleaning services, you won’t have to download a bunch of applications. Soon, you will be able to do all of this on Facebook or Google. To start with, Google has launched a facility to book Ola and Uber cabs on its Map and via its search page. Other services are probably on the anvil. Facebook, on the other hand, has partnered with a number of online players in the US to offer a one-stop shop for services. It’s only a matter of time before Facebook starts rolling this out in other countries, too, including India. Staying relevant According to analysts, the move is an attempt by the internet giants to stay relevant at a time when online usage is shifting to niche applications. “Consumers now search for food, hotels and movie tickets in specific applications instead of on Google. By being an aggregator of services, Google is trying to evolve with the changing times,” said an analyst tracking the sector. Jayanth Kolla, founder of IT and digital research firm Convergence Catalyst, said: “They want users to make its mobile browser more engaging so that people use at least one of their properties at a given time.” For the service providers, being listed on Google or Facebook could lead to more business. According to an industry report, about 65 per cent of app downloads or installs are a result of internet search. Sanchit Gogia, founder of research firm Greyhound Group, said the aggregator model will work in a market like India, where a large number of users can’t download multiple applications due to poor data coverage and/or lack of smartphone penetration. Abinash Tripathy, founder of CRM (Customer Relationship Management)-software start-up Helpshift, said these initiatives by Google are “reactive strategies as they fear that the app economy will kill the web franchise one day; hence, they are trying to make people stay in the browser through all means.” (This article was published on October 21, 2016) Related NEWS Flipkart follows Google, Amazon into the world of secret servers Facebook, Twitter weigh bids for media rights to IPL TOPICS internet | social networking | Get more of your favourite news delivered to your inbox SEND MY NEWS Please enter your email.

While it's still committed to delivering updates to the previous pure Android devices, and while Android Nougat will have many similar features on the Pixel, there are a few differences. The Google Pixel launched with Android 7.1, the first smartphone to do so, bringing with it a whole range of new features that build on the top of the existing goodness that Google introduced with Android Nougat a few months earlier. Here are all the details you need to get to grips with Google's new phone, as we dig deep into those Pixel features and Android 7.1. Google Pixel general tips and tricks Android has long been known for its customisation capabilities, but with Nougat 7.1 on the Pixel, the options are even greater. You can change the way a number of features appear and how the system works. App action shortcuts: A lot like iOS with its Force Touch quick actions, many Android 7.1 stock apps have shortcuts. Just tap and hold any stock app icon like Calendar, Camera, Messenger or Dialler. This brings up a list of quick actions above the icon. Adjust icon/screen size: In Settings > Display there's a new option to adjust the size of onscreen content and icons. Simply select the Display size option and move the slider until the icons are the size you want them to be. Enable developer settings: To turn on the developer settings, head into Settings > About phone. Scroll to the bottom and repeatedly tap on the Build number. After a number of taps, you'll unlock the developer options. Unlock System UI Tuner: This is a clever hidden setting that offers a range of options you can't otherwise get to. Swipe down the Quick Settings and press and hold the settings cog at the top next to the battery. After a long press, the System UI Tuner will be unlocked, and a new option will appear in the settings menu. There's a more detailed step-by-step guide here if you need more help. Google Pixel vs Apple iPhone 7: Which should you choose? Apple iPhone to Google Pixel: How to transfer contacts, messages, calendars and media Transfer everything from your iPhone: As part of the set up process, you can transfer all your contacts, messages, emails, calendar appointments, attachments and media across to your new Pixel phone from your iPhone. The video below shows how to do it. Show the battery percentage: Once you've unlocked the System UI Tuner (as above), you have the option to show the battery percentage in the battery icon at all times. (Most third-party skins have this as a default option.) Charge another device: Using the USB Type-C to Type-A adapter that comes in the box, you can use your Pixel to charge another device. Just your other device's cable in to the adapter, and plug it in to your Pixel.  Turn on ambient display: A feature of Android Wear and Motorola devices, it's now on Android Nougat by default. Head into Settings > Display and you'll be able to glance at monochrome notifications. Turn on Night Light: When reading your phone in the evening, the last thing you want is harsh, blue light from your phone screen glaring in to your eyes. To turn on Night Light, giving it a more yellow/warm tone, go to Settings > Display and choose the Night Light. Schedule Night Light: While you can turn on the Night Light manually, it may be more beneficial and less of a chore to schedule it. Simply tap "turn on automatically" and choose the days and times you want, and it’ll come on automatically. Or, you can set it to change by sunrise and sunset times. Play Pixel Android Nougat easter egg: Nougat's Easter Egg is a little different to previous Flappy Bird style games. Instead, you've got to try and catch a cat by selecting a tasty treat. Head into Settings > About phone/tablet > Android version. Then tap the Android version repeatedly until it changes to the Android N screen. Once you have the full Android "N" logo visible, tap repeatedly, then press and hold, then you should see a little cat icon appear on the screen. Watch the video below to see an overview on how to play the game. Search settings: Rather than rooting through everything, you can search the settings. Just open up the Settings menu and hit the magnifying glass and type what you're looking for. Search Google for onscreen info: In other phones, this is called Now on Tap, in the Pixel, it has been integrated in to the Assistant. Press and hold the home button to launch Google Assistant on any screen that has objects/text on it, then swipe up on the card border that appears at the bottom of the chat. Assistant will then offer various services to search for that information, videos or locations with. Find the Google Settings: There was previously an app to handle Google settings, in Nougat this is now in the main Settings menu. This is where you'll find settings for accounts and services, backup, and transferring content to a nearby device. Use the native file explorer: There's a file explorer in Android. Head to Settings > Storage and scroll to the bottom of the list. Tap Explore and you can view folders, open files, delete and share. Google Pixel Moves tips Android has had a number of features launch-able by gesture for a few years now. With the Google Pixel, and Android 7.1 Nougat, those get their own "Moves" section within the main settings app. Just head to Settings > Moves, and check out the three options available. Swipe for notifications: With this option switched on, you can swipe downwards on your Pixel Imprint sensor and it'll drop down the notifications from the top of your screen. Swipe it again and you'll get quick settings. Jump to camera: This feature isn't entirely new, but when switched on, you can double-click the power/sleep button from any screen and launch the camera app. Flip camera: Another camera related one, and when activated you can switch in and out of selfie mode with a quick double-twist of the phone. In previous years, this gesture would launch the camera, so it's been tweaked a little. Google Pixel exclusive features explored: A cut above the rest of Android? Google Pixel apps tips and tricks Since phone screen sizes have been on the increase, it makes sense to make better use of that real estate. Along with a number of other additions, you can now have two apps running side-by-side on the same screen. You also get the same granular controls on apps that you got in Android Marshmallow. Split-screen multitasking: Android Nougat is the first version of the OS to feature built-in split-screen multitasking. You can activate it a number of ways (as detailed in the video below), but the easiest is just to press and hold the recent apps button. You can also reposition where the split appears onscreen. Switch quickly between recent apps: From any screen, you can quickly switch back and forth between the two most recent apps by double tapping the recent apps button. Stop adding new app icons to home screen: If you don't want newly installed apps cluttering up your home screen, head into Play Store > Settings and uncheck the "Add icon to Home screen" box. Enable fingerprint authentication: You can use the Pixel Imprint sensor to authenticate Google Play purchases with your fingerprint. Simply head to the Play Store > Settings, check the relevant box and confirm by typing in your password. Clear all apps from your recent memory: Tap the recent apps button to see all the apps running, scroll to the top of the screen and choose "clear all". Add Yahoo! Mail or Exchange to Gmail: You can add Yahoo!, Exchange or other mail services to Gmail. Tap the icon to open the sidebar, scroll all the way to the bottom and hit Settings > Add account. You have the option for Google, IMAP/POP3 services (like Yahoo, Outlook.com) and Exchange. Attach anything to Gmail: Tap the attachment button and you can attach local files, things in Drive, Photos, Dropbox files, OneDrive box and so on. It's really flexible. Customise Google Now: Go to your Google Now screen and access the sidebar menu. Find settings and use it to customise which cards appear, what language you use as well as privacy settings. Change the default app: Android lets you decide which is the default app, if you have more than one that will do the same thing. In Settings > Apps, hit the settings cog in the top corner. Here you'll see a list of defaults you can change. Control app permissions: Nougat, like Marshmallow did, lets you manage all the permissions for each app on an individual basis. Go to Apps and select the app and hit Permissions. This will let you toggle permissions on and off, so you can disable location access, for example. Android 7.0 Nougat review: Subtle but super-sweet OS update Google Pixel notifications and volume tips and tricks Notification fine-tuning has been ramped up a notch with Nougat. It's no longer a case of just having priority or non-priority, but you also get to choose which exact level of priority an application should have, as well as replying directly from a notification. Turn on the notifications light: The normal flashing notifications LED is turned off on the Pixel by default. To switch it on, head into Settings > Notifications and hit the cog in the top right. Here you'll find the option to "pulse notification light". Enable power notifications: Go to System UI Tuner in your settings (having enabled it using the method near the top of this article) and choose other > Power notification controls. On the next screen switch the toggle to the on position. Once enabled you can fine-tune the priority level of any app's notification. Direct reply: With Android Nougat, you can direct reply from any app that has this feature built in. Swipe down on any notification card and if there's a "reply" option, hit it and type away without leaving the screen. This works for loads of apps, including Hangouts, WhatsApp and Messenger. Quickly switch to vibrate alerts: If you want silence, but are after vibration alerts still, then push the volume button and tap the bell on the pop-up. This will switch to vibrate. Turn down media volume: Hit the volume up or down button, and the volume slider will appear. Tap the down arrow on the right-hand side, and you can change the ringer, media or alarm volumes. Engage Do not Disturb: Swipe down Quick Settings and tap the Do Not Disturb button. This gives you the option to have total silence, alarms only, or priority only. You can choose if this is for a time period, or until you turn it off. Schedule Do not Disturb: Swipe down Quick Settings then press and hold the Do Not Disturb button. Choose Automatic Rules and customise which times the Do not Disturb feature should activate automatically. To mark an app as a Priority app: Head into Settings > Apps. Tap on the app you want. In Notifications you get app controls, and you can set an app as a priority so you always get notifications from that app. To turn off notifications on an app: Go to Settings > Apps > Tap on the app you want. In Notifications you can block all notifications for any app on your device. To turn off peeking on an app: Go to Settings > Apps > Tap on the app you want. In Notifications you can turn off peeking, so you don't get a toast notification for that app. Instant access to lock screen notifications: Just tap a notification twice and it will open up the app. Want to dismiss it? Just swipe it away. Expand stacked notifications: Got a stack of notifications? You can drag down to expand them, both on the lock screen and in the notifications area. Hide sensitive information in lock screen notifications: You can have lock screen notifications without too much information being revealed. Head to Settings > Notifications and tap the cog in the top right. This will give you a menu option called "On the lock screen". You can then select the option you want. You're also given this option during setup.  Each individual app also has lock screen controls, so in Settings > Apps, tap the app you want. You'll find the option under "On the lock screen" again. This will enable you to turn off lock screen notifications for a specific app, but not others. Pocket-lint Google Pixel: Assistant tips One of Google's big plays with the Pixel is Google Assistant. This is an evolution of the voice-control options presented by the Ok Google hot word and the smart personal offering of Google Now. Here's some top tips to get you started with Google Assistant, but if you want more, we have a comprehensive breakdown of Google Assistant tips in a separate feature. Access Google Assistant: A long press on the home button will activate Google Assistant and take you through to the interface where you can talk to, or type to interact with Assistant. You will also be served results that you can tap to get more information, or to move through to over apps. Turn on the Ok Google hot word: If you want to use voice, you'll have to turn it on and register your Ok Google voice. The best way to do this is to open Google Assistant (as above) and tap the menu in the top right corner, open Settings. You'll see "Ok Google" detection in the next page, to get you started. Open an app with Google Assistant: Simply say "Ok Google, open Netflix" and it will open Netflix or any other app. It's smart too, as for some apps, Assistant can navigation content within them - like watching a specific show on Netflix, or playing a specific artist on Spotify. I'm feeling lucky: If you're looking for Google Assistant's Easter Egg, trying saying "I'm feeling lucky". This will take you to a crazy trivia quiz that's loads of fun. View photos of dogs, babies, cars: Google Assistant ties closely into other Google apps, especially Photos. If you have photos in your account of specific things, Google Assistant can find them. Try asking to see photos of your dog, and you'll get photos of your dog. Make sure, however, that your Google Assistant account is the same as the Photos account, for this cross-pollination to work. Android Assistant tips and tricks: Master your Android assistant Google Pixel Quick Settings tips Quick settings were good before, now they're even better. There are more options and there's far greater customisation. Manage Quick tiles: In Android 7.1 you can manage the order of the quick settings tiles by dropping down the usual shade from the top of the screen and hitting "edit". Now you can re-order, and even add new quick access toggles for things like Google Cast, Night Light, data saver and such. Enable Night Light: Using the method above, add the Night Light tile to your quick settings tiles. Once it's there, just tap to activate it or press and hold to access night mode settings to customise. Enable data saver: Just like above, you can add the data saver toggle to your quick tiles. In essence it helps you limit how much of your data the phone consumes by limiting how much data apps use in the background. Quickly select a Wi-Fi network: Swipe down for Quick Settings, then click the network name beneath the Wi-Fi icon. This takes you through to the Wi-Fi settings. Quickly manage Bluetooth: The same applies to Bluetooth. Click beneath the Bluetooth icon in Quick Settings and you'll head into settings to select your device. Turn on torch/flashlight: There's no need for a separate app, just tap the button in Quick Settings to turn on your flash as a torch. Or just say "Ok Google, turn on torch/flashlight" and it will turn on. Cast your screen: Want your Android device on your TV? Just swipe down and tap Cast screen and it will be sent to your Chromecast. If it's not there, add the Cast tile to your Quick Settings using the method mentioned above. Not all apps are supported though. Google Pixel battery tips and tricks Having brought Android Marshmallow's Doze mode across - and enhanced it - Nougat is already great at conserving energy, but now it's even easier to get a picture of what your battery is doing and how you can optimise its use further. See your battery percentage: Open Quick Settings with a two-finger swipe. Your battery percentage is displayed in the quick settings screen. Tap the icon to see a more detailed overview. Time till fully charged: Charge time is displayed when connected to a charger. Look at the bottom of the lock screen and in the battery status screen, but it takes a little while for Android to calculate how long charging will take. If you're fast charging, it will say "charging rapidly”. See what's eating battery: Swipe down Quick Settings, tap the battery icon and tap "more settings". You'll go to the battery status page and see how long you have left and what apps are eating your battery. Turn on battery saver: Drop down the Quick Settings, tap the battery icon and toggle Battery saver to the on position. If you want to set it up to switch on automatically when it hits 5 per cent or 15 per cent, hit "more settings" and tap the battery saver option at the top of the screen. Google Pixel multiple user tips Whether you want to add new user profiles or make it easier to get to your emergency information, Nougat has you covered. Add emergency information: Go to Settings > Users then select Emergency Information. Here you can add contact details, medical conditions and any medication you're currently taking. Guest profile: In the same area (Settings > Users) you can create a Guest profile. While it is setup, you'll get the option to access as a guest from the lock screen. See how much storage they're using: If you want to know how much space is being used up by another profile, head into Settings > Storage. At the bottom of the list it says how much other profile and the guest is using. Pocket-lint Google Pixel camera tips The camera app in Android 7.1 on the Pixel is far simpler and more intuitive to use than many other camera apps. There are a few things worth looking at, however, that aren't obvious from the very beginning. Switch on 4K video recording: By default, Google Pixel records video in 1080p resolution. In the camera app, access the side menu by tapping the three lines in the top corner, choose settings and scroll down to "Back camera video resolution". Slow motion video: Access the side menu again, and choose "Slow motion" from the list of familiar photo modes. These include panorama, lens blur and Photo Sphere. Manually change exposure: Although there's no full manual mode, you can manually adjust exposure in any scene. Simply tap the area you want to focus on, then you'll see a slider appear on the right side of the screen. Sliding up brightens the scene, down darkens it. Manually adjust white balance: Pixel sometimes has a tendency of getting white balance wrong. In the camera app, tap the thermometer icon at the top of the screen and choose the preset that best suits your lighting. Shoot burst photos: To shoot a really fast burst of photos, just press and hold the shutter button on the screen. Lock the focus and exposure: Called AF/AE lock, this feature will mean that things stay in the same focal point and exposure, even when the subject changes. It's idea for video consistency or more deliberate shots. Just tap as you would to focus and keep pressing. You'll see the circle around your finger fill and go solid, then you're AF/AE locked. Google Pixel Security tips Manage fingerprints: Head into Security > Pixel Imprint and you'll be able to add or remove fingerprints that will unlock your device. A pro tip is to register fingers on both hands so you can unlock your phone with whichever hand you have free. Bluetooth unlock: Again in Security > Smart Lock, you have the option to nominate trusted devices, so your Android will unlock when connected to something else. You can nominate Bluetooth devices (like your smartwatch or car Bluetooth) or select an NFC tag. Google Pixel keyboard and language tips Typing should always be easy and personally tuned to your needs, and with Nougat on the Pixel, that's even easier thanks to the ability to support multiple languages and customise the keyboard. Add multiple languages: Go to settings then languages & input, tap languages and then "add a language". There are dozens of languages available to use (including Welsh). Change themes: Head to Settings>Languages & input>Virtual keyboard, then select Google keyboard at the top of the page. Select theme and choose one of the available colours or just add your own image as a background. Toggle the key border if you want one. Enable one-handed mode: When the keyboard is onscreen, tap and hold the return key. Select the icon that looks like a hand holding a phone. Switch the keyboard to the left side of the screen by tapping the chevron on the left side. Change keyboard height: Once again in the virtual keyboard settings, select the Google keyboard and choose Preferences. Find Keyboard height in the list and adjust the slider until the keyboard is at your required height.

The Google car project is another, but it remains in the research and development (R&D) stage for now. The Pixel phones, rather, will be generating revenue, and it looks like they will be successful.

The comparison is natural, especially in the absence of another flagship device, the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, which leaves Google and Apple fighting for the premium segment. Google has been synonymous with innovation. This time, with a brand new Android OS Nougat and Google Assistant, Pixel devices are set to counter Apple's iOS 10 and intelligent assistant Siri. Let us see what the 5.5-inch Pixel XL (32GB, black colour) has for Indian consumers who are searching for a premium smartphone. The aluminum and glass-built device looks elegant and fits comfortably in the palm. Unlike Nexus 6P, which had a thin glass strip at the top, Pixel XL's back panel has almost one-third glass covering. Putting an end to Android users' long wait, the Google Assistant in Pixel XL definitely has an edge over Apple's Siri. See for yourself. When asked, :Are you a man or a woman?", Google Assistant responded with answers like "I'm all inclusive :D" and "Does it really matter?" while Siri staidly replied: "I was not assigned a gender." Caption: The newly launched Rs 67,000 Google Pixel XL has Google Assistant built in. The device runs on Android Nougat 7.1 OS. To "Who will win the US presidential election?" Google Assistant displayed poll results by the New York Times, The Telegraph and Independent while Siri returned Wikipedia and Quora with an iOS 10-powered iPhone. While searching restaurants near our office, Google Assistant displayed food joints as close as 300 metres while Siri said that the nearest restaurant is 600 metres away. To further test its intelligence, Google Assistant was asked, "Who is Siri?" It explained, "Siri is Apple's intelligent assistant. She is very witty." Siri, however, was more informative than Google Assistant when asked "Who is the Prime Minister of India?". While Siri threw up results like when Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister and how long has he been serving, Google Assistant came back only with his name. Google Assistant can tell jokes, remember your passwords and even set the alarm for you in a clear voice. The "Pixel Imprint" fingerprint scanner is located at the back and is extremely responsive. It not only unlocked the device in a split second but also accepted (authorised) half a fingerprint for unlocking. While lock and volume up/down buttons are on the right of the Corning Gorilla Glass 4 protected AMOLED display, a nano-SIM slot sits at the left bumper of the device. Google has retained Type-C charging port that charged the 3450 mAh battery in a flat 48 minutes. The device with Qualcomm's latest Snapdragon 821 Quad core processor and 4GB DDR4 RAM will get first updates and free unlimited cloud space is not to be missed. Google has put in a lot of accessories inside the box, including a two-way Type-C port cable ensuring OTG device (also included) support. With this cable, one can charge Pixel XL with another phone having a Type-C port. The smartphone runs like a charm on Android Nougat 7.1 - the only device till date to have it. The apps explorer icon is replaced by a pull-up App Drawer which is more convenient. Caption: Google Pixel XL has the best camera rating ever. The photos were taken in the night and are displayed without any editing. A swipe right on the screen brings the notable search results in line with browsing history. When we swiped right, information about the FC Barcelona vs Manchester City football match; updates about the Indian Soccer League tournament; and scores for the India vs New Zealand One-Day cricket match popped up. Pixel's 12.3MP rear camera with f/2.0 has been rated the highest ever 89 DxOMark Mobile score. It is very fast, responsive and has a video stabilising mode. As expected, the photos in broad daylight were stunning. Even in "very low light conditions", the camera did not disappoint. Under natural light at 7 pm, the photos clicked without flash had clarity and little grains while the photo taken with flash were sharper. As compared to shooting video in normal mode, we noticed a remarkable difference when we shot the same video with "Video Stabilisation" on. There were low or no jerks and no picture distortion. The 8MP camera works fine and while using it with Google's video calling app Duo, the receiver gets a sharper image (as compared to the Nexus 6P). One can even try new gestures, relish the audio output and save unlimited data online in original quality for free. What doesn't work? Pixel devices are not waterproof. At a time when Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (and the now discontinued Galaxy Note 7) and Apple are offering IP68 rating (waterproof ratings), Pixel smartphones fall behind in this category. The camera does not have an optical image stabilisation feature and the Type-C to Type-C charging is slow. Conclusion: If you think about shelling out Rs 72000 for the 32GB variant of iPhone 7 Plus, consider Google Pixel XL for Rs 67000 as your date with Google Assistant will floor you without any doubt.

Cabral/Dubai Filed on October 21, 2016 Share More > Vote Apple's iPhone has been a dominant force in the smartphone world for years, and Google is determined to challenge that with its new Pixel. Is the Mountain View team indeed ready to challenge the dominance of Cupertino? Google just declared war on everyone, and they just have the right amount of resources to do so. Veering away from its Nexus line, the Internet giant finally decided that it was time for them to start giving others a run for their money with its own smartphone, the Pixel. And with Samsung charred from the Galaxy Note 7 mess, it's a perfect opportunity for the rest of the Android mob to take their shots at Apple - and Google is just raring to go. Let's see how Apple's signature flagship and Google's new toy stack up against each other. At the end of each parameter, we'll have a scoreboard (in an iPhone 7-Pixel format) to see where we're clawing towards to. Front camera: The iPhone 7 has a wider aperture, but the Pixel has a higher resolution. The tie-breaker would then be the iPhone 7's Retina flash. 1-0. Audio: A dual-speaker stereo system on the iPhone 7 versus the Pixel's single downward-firing one? Easy. 2-0. Memory: While the Pixel edges out the iPhone 7 in RAM (4GB to 3GB), the latter has more storage options; the 32/128GB choices on both cancel each other out, leaving the iPhone 7's massive 256GB on top. But since you may not require that much space on your phone, let's give RAM some preference here. 2-1. Display: The Pixel has a larger five-inch screen compared to the iPhone 7's standard-issue 4.7 inches, and it also uses AMOLED, brighter than the latter's LCD. Google's device also has a higher resolution and pixel density, though Apple has its own 3D Touch for added functionality (if you actually use it). Make no mistake, the iPhone 7 has a great display, but the numbers point to the Pixel tying things up. 2-2. Platform: It's iOS versus Android. 10 against 7.1 Nougat. Each system has its own crowd and functionalities, so we'll leave it at that. Digital assistant: Siri, meet your new rival, Google Assistant. And it seems that you're about to get a run for your money if the latter's demonstration at the Pixel launch event was any indication, in which it flaunted some really interactive "dialogues". 2-3. Fingerprint scanner: The iPhone 7 retains this on its home button up front, while the Pixel has its own on the rear. Normally, most of us hold our phones with our thumb and index finger on those positions, respectively, so it's really a matter of what suits you better. So let's move on. Main camera: While both practically have 12MP shooters, the iPhone has a wider aperture and optical image stabilisation, while also outshining (pun intended) the Pixel's dual-LED flash with its quad-LED flash. And most importantly, the iPhone 7's snapper has proven that it is really better in low-light conditions compared to its predecessors. 3-3. Chipset: Let's see... the Apple A10 Fusion chip gives 40 per cent faster performance at one-fifth the power and 50 per cent better graphics thanks to an M10 motion coprocessor, while the Snapdragon 821 blurts out a 10 per cent faster performance than the 820. Oh well. 4-3. Build: Apple was wise to bring out the Jet Black colour. With design mostly another user-preference judgment, let's take this one to durability: the iPhone 7 is dust- and water-resistant - as we proved ourselves just to get a kick out of it - while the Pixel can, well, take just sprays of water. And it helps when Jony Ive is on your bench. 5-3. Battery: The Pixel's 2770mAh power pack clobbers the iPhone 7's 1960mAh. But note to both: seriously, can't you stick in larger batteries? (It should be noted, though, that the iPhone 7 lasts longer - up to two hours, Apple says - than the 6s.) 5-4. Connectivity: Not a few people were ticked off when Apple removed the 3.5mm audio jack, leaving the iPhone 7 with only one port for connecting an audio device or charger. Apple may have viewed it as some sort of future-proofing (obviously not everyone agreed), but Google did a better thing at it by slapping in a USB Type-C on the Pixel... and retaining good ol' jack on top. 5-5. Well, that was a close, tense one. We may have ended up tied in our mano-y-mano, but the real winner is for you to decide. (Why not get one of each to spare you the trouble?) If ever you disagree on something, feel free to let us know (no NSFW or swear words, please). - alvin@khaleejtimes.com Share More > Vote MORE FROM Technology Technology Massive web attack disrupts Twitter, Amazon among ...

Home Industry Tech Google Pixel XL: Real, direct competition to the Apple iPhone 7 Google Pixel XL: Real, direct competition to the Apple iPhone 7 When Google launched artificial intelligence (AI)-powered premium devices Pixel and Pixel XL earlier this month, the message was clear: The device with the personal Google Assistant built right in sounded the threat bugle for Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. By: IANS | New Delhi | Published: October 21, 2016 12:45 PM The comparison is natural, especially in the absence of another flagship device, the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, which leaves Google and Apple fighting for the premium segment. (Reuters) When Google launched artificial intelligence (AI)-powered premium devices Pixel and Pixel XL earlier this month, the message was clear: The device with the personal Google Assistant built right in sounded the threat bugle for Apple iPhone 7 and 7 Plus. The comparison is natural, especially in the absence of another flagship device, the Samsung Galaxy Note 7, which leaves Google and Apple fighting for the premium segment. Google has been synonymous with innovation. This time, with a brand new Android OS Nougat and Google Assistant, Pixel devices are set to counter Apple’s iOS 10 and intelligent assistant Siri. Let us see what the 5.5-inch Pixel XL (32GB, black colour) has for Indian consumers who are searching for a premium smartphone. The aluminum and glass-built device looks elegant and fits comfortably in the palm. Unlike Nexus 6P, which had a thin glass strip at the top, Pixel XL’s back panel has almost one-third glass covering. Putting an end to Android users’ long wait, the Google Assistant in Pixel XL definitely has an edge over Apple’s Siri. See for yourself. When asked, :Are you a man or a woman?”, Google Assistant responded with answers like “I’m all inclusive :D” and “Does it really matter?” while Siri staidly replied: “I was not assigned a gender.” To “Who will win the US presidential election?” Google Assistant displayed poll results by the New York Times, The Telegraph and Independent while Siri returned Wikipedia and Quora with an iOS 10-powered iPhone. While searching restaurants near our office, Google Assistant displayed food joints as close as 300 metres while Siri said that the nearest restaurant is 600 metres away. To further test its intelligence, Google Assistant was asked, “Who is Siri?” It explained, “Siri is Apple’s intelligent assistant. She is very witty.” Siri, however, was more informative than Google Assistant when asked “Who is the Prime Minister of India?”. While Siri threw up results like when Narendra Modi became the Prime Minister and how long has he been serving, Google Assistant came back only with his name. Google Assistant can tell jokes, remember your passwords and even set the alarm for you in a clear voice. The “Pixel Imprint” fingerprint scanner is located at the back and is extremely responsive. It not only unlocked the device in a split second but also accepted (authorised) half a fingerprint for unlocking. While lock and volume up/down buttons are on the right of the Corning Gorilla Glass 4 protected AMOLED display, a nano-SIM slot sits at the left bumper of the device. Google has retained Type-C charging port that charged the 3,450 mAh battery in a flat 48 minutes. The device with Qualcomm’s latest Snapdragon 821 Quad core processor and 4GB DDR4 RAM will get first updates and free unlimited cloud space is not to be missed. Google has put in a lot of accessories inside the box, including a two-way Type-C port cable ensuring OTG device (also included) support. With this cable, one can charge Pixel XL with another phone having a Type-C port. The smartphone runs like a charm on Android Nougat 7.1 — the only device till date to have it. The apps explorer icon is replaced by a pull-up App Drawer which is more convenient. A swipe right on the screen brings the notable search results in line with browsing history. When we swiped right, information about the FC Barcelona vs Manchester City football match; updates about the Indian Soccer League tournament; and scores for the India vs New Zealand One-Day cricket match popped up. Pixel’s 12.3MP rear camera with f/2.0 has been rated the highest ever 89 DxOMark Mobile score. It is very fast, responsive and has a video stabilising mode. As expected, the photos in broad daylight were stunning. Even in “very low light conditions”, the camera did not disappoint. Under natural light at 7 pm, the photos clicked without flash had clarity and little grains while the photo taken with flash were sharper. As compared to shooting video in normal mode, we noticed a remarkable difference when we shot the same video with “Video Stabilisation” on. There were low or no jerks and no picture distortion. The 8MP camera works fine and while using it with Google’s video calling app Duo, the receiver gets a sharper image (as compared to the Nexus 6P). One can even try new gestures, relish the audio output and save unlimited data online in original quality for free. What doesn’t work? Pixel devices are not waterproof. At a time when Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (and the now discontinued Galaxy Note 7) and Apple are offering IP68 rating (waterproof ratings), Pixel smartphones fall behind in this category. The camera does not have an optical image stabilisation feature and the Type-C to Type-C charging is slow. Conclusion: If you think about shelling out Rs 72,000 for the 32GB variant of iPhone 7 Plus, consider Google Pixel XL for Rs 67,000 as your date with Google Assistant will floor you without any doubt.

You’ll also find that, when it comes to content marketing, it’s much easier to repurpose old content than it is to create new content. One of the biggest problems faced by content marketers is coming up with new ideas. Although fresh content is certainly needed on a regular basis, recycled old content will often do wonders when you’re suffering from writer’s block and looking for ways to increase your reach. In fact, you should never forget about your old content. Every piece of content on your site is a representation of your brand. It can rank, get shared on social media, and convert. Editor Note: want to learn more about content marketing? Download our content marketing ebook. Here are a few ways you can repurpose some of your past content. 1. Convert it to Video (And Try Some of the New Formats) Your old content is probably a blog post containing mostly text. Use that text as narration or subject matter in a video. I do this all the time. Often, I will comb back through an old blog post and then create a video on the same topic. That video can then be used on that same page and add to the quality of the post. Creating the video is the hard part… Here are a few options. Cover main points in the blog and record your screen. This will allow you to show visuals online. Take the blog post and convert it into slides. Add photos to those slides and make a video in the webinar format. Turn the blog into a presentation and give the presentation on camera (you can use a whiteboard, projector or just wing it). Set up a camera and simply talk about the most important parts of the blog post. Do a Facebook Live recap of the post and save the recording (Periscope and Meerkat are also options). Once your video is complete and uploaded to YouTube (or another site such as Vimeo, Facebook, Tumblr, etc) you’re still not done. You are going to want to do the following. Embed the video on the original blog post (this will add to the quality of this post) Run ads for the video and the blog post on YouTube and Facebook Send the link to the blog or video out in your email newsletter Promote, promote, promote. 2. Make it an Infographic Everybody loves infographics. That’s because so many people are overworked and need to digest information as quickly as possible, preferably in visual format instead of lengthy, written text. Infographics win on both those points. They make it easy for readers to get a quick understanding of a subject while offering graphics that support and illustrate the main points. If you’ve got some great informational content that went viral in the past and you’re looking for a way to repurpose it, consider turning it into an infographic. It’s a good idea to review pages on your site that are ranking for large terms in Google, and review your top landing page reports in Google Analytics, and use that data to determine the largest opportunities. You might be concerned that you could have trouble creating an infographic because you’re not that good with graphics tools like Adobe Photoshop. If so, set your mind at ease. There are websites that will enable you to create a great infographic, even if you’re artistically challenged. For example, Piktochart makes it a snap to create high-quality infographics at an affordable monthly price. You can also try 99designs or hire someone on Upwork. There are also a number of free infographics tools that you can choose from. Keep in mind: with the prevalence of tools on the market, you’ll find it’s much easier to create infographics than videos. So, if time is of the essence in your situation, your best bet is probably to repurpose your content into infographic format as opposed to video format. Also, be sure to brand your infographic so that even when people copy just the image and post it on their own blogs, you’ll still be tooting your own horn. 3. Create a Listicle From Tags or Categories You’re probably using WordPress for your content marketing. You’ll find that it can be your very best friend when it comes to repurposing old content. That’s because WordPress allows you to tag and categorize blog posts (never use both, unless you want a duplicate content issue by the way). And, as a great digital marketer, you’ve been doing that with all of your posts for some time. Now, pick a tag or subject from your history of posts and take a go over the articles you’ve written. Look for a way to convert some of your old posts into listicle format. If you’re unfamiliar with the concept of a listicle: it’s an article in list format. It’s a concept popularized by sites like BuzzFeed. For example, if you have a blog about online marketing and one of your more popular tags is “social media,” you might find that you’ve written some very good articles about how to use social media for marketing over the past year. Make the topic of each one of those articles a point in your new listicle and include a synopsis of the original post. In this case, you might come up with a title like: “10 Social Media Strategies You Forgot to Use This Past Year (That Really Matter).” Each one of those 10 points is the subject of one of the articles you’ve already written. Bonus: when you repurpose your content with this method, you’ll also link back to the article that you originally wrote. That gives you a great excuse for some additional internal linkage. Google will jump back into those pages, crawl them again and give them a fresh boost. Even better, update the content on each of the posts you are linking to before you publish your listicle. That way you will see a big boost. 4. Convert it Into a SlideShare Presentation SlideShare might be one of the most under-utilized resources for digital marketers. That’s certainly not for lack of promotion – there are countless blog posts extolling the virtues of using SlideShare for brand promotion. And yet many people ignore it. If you’re looking for a great way to repurpose some old content into something that’s fresh and exciting, consider translating that old post into a SlideShare presentation. Slide presentations give you another great opportunity to educate people without requiring them to invest a lot of time reading a lengthy article. Great presentations offer only the most important points of a subject and back them up with stats, graphs, and images. You can also embed a SlideShare presentation just like you embed a YouTube video, image, or tweet. Just click the “Share” button at the bottom of the slideshow and copy the “Embed” code to your own blog. 5. Make it Into a Podcast If you’re looking for an astonishingly easy way to repurpose old content, consider using it in a podcast. Podcasts are popular with online marketers these days. That’s for a good reason: they give you an opportunity to boost your brand in a medium that people can use while occupied in some other way (like driving). One great way to get on the podcast map while simultaneously reusing old content is to record yourself reading a blog post and then use that recording in a podcast. That’s simple and inexpensive. Keep in mind, though, that if you don’t have a “radio voice,” you should consider getting somebody else to read your article for you. Sure, you’ll have to pay some cash for that, unless you have that talent in-house. You won’t have to pay much cash, though. There are people who do voice-overs on Fiverr for the unsurprising cost of $5. Hire them and you can outsource the whole thing. Neil Patel and Eric Siu have been doing this recently on Stitcher. Their new podcast is pretty good. 6. Use it in an Email Blast If you’re successful at email marketing, then you’re always signing up new people to your email list. Some of your more recent recruits might not be too familiar with the subjects covered in your older blog posts. That’s why it’s a great idea to repurpose old content and include it in an email that you send to all your followers. You’ll give the newbies a chance to get caught up on some of your older principles while reminding the veterans about what’s important. This is another easy way to repurpose. In many cases, it just involves copying and pasting old paragraphs and including a few relevant updates. Most smart marketers will create a drip campaign that sends out 5 to 20 of their best articles to new email subscribers over the course of a couple of months. This keeps the subscribers engaged and coming back to the site. 7. Aggregate Related Posts Into an E-Book Are you looking to establish yourself as an authority in your space with the publication of an e-book? If so, then you might find that task easier than you realize. Why? Because the book might already be written. In your own blog. Go through your past posts. Find related articles and aggregate them into one giant e-book. Make each post its own chapter in the book. See how easy that is? Of course, you’re not done once you’ve completed your copy-and-paste effort. You still want to invest some time and money into making your e-book look attractive. In the end, you can always upload your e-book to Amazon and either sell it or give it away. Best part, you get a link from Amazon and you can add your blogs RSS feed to the publisher area. I launched my first book on Amazon this year and it ended up being a great thing for our company. I was able to take most of my best work and merge it into one place. 8. Repost Evergreen Content on Social Media Do you have some fantastic evergreen content on your site that went viral a while ago? If so, there’s no reason why you can’t share it again. The best social media managers always tweet the best posts once every month or two. Why? They know it will always be a hit. You never let a good post die. You should always be refreshing and re-sharing. For example, if you invested $5,000 in writing the ultimate guide to content marketing and that article was a big hit with your audience, use your social media channels to re-post the link. Each time you share it, change the social media text a little and make sure to update the content on your guides quarterly at least. 9. Turn it Into a Webinar Another popular fad with modern digital strategists is the webinar. It’s also a great way to repurpose old content. If you’ve got a particularly popular and informative article on your blog, consider turning it into a webinar. Again: this is a great way to kill two birds with one stone. You’ll not only repurpose your old content, but you’ll also have great material for a successful webinar. The key to a successful webinar isn’t just the content, though. You’ll need to make sure that you promote it effectively. Otherwise, you’re going to be talking to yourself. Get Started Now You don’t have to struggle to find completely original content for every marketing channel. Instead, just repurpose some of your old content and share it in ways that you haven’t used before. Many of the really good marketers swear by this strategy. Personally, I am a big fan of it. Update your old content, repurpose your old content, and keep sharing it. Many times, this is a better option than simply creating something new.   Image Credits Featured Image: HappyCity/DepositPhotos.com In-post Photo #1: Image by John Lincoln In-post Photo #2: Image by John Lincoln All screenshots by John Lincoln.

By Sarmistha Acharya October 21, 2016 07:12 BST Google Assistant can be enabled on non-Pixel phonesXDA The Pixel and Pixel XL are the first phones to ship with built-in Google Assistant feature. For the uninitiated, Google Assistant is Google's intelligent personal assistant, which was unveiled at its annual I/O developer conference in May 2016. Considered to be a new version of Google Now, Google Assistant is available in English and German on Pixel phones and in Google Allo messaging app. The web search giant promises to bring more language support for the Assistant. Like any other virtual assistant, you can get answers and finish tasks using Google Assistant, like getting weather updates, finding local info, checking for flight timings and translations. Want Google Assistant on your phone? While Google has limited the use of Google Assistant, there is a workaround through which you can get Google Assistant working on your Android device. All you need is a device running on Android 7.0 or, higher, with latest the Google app version 6.5.35.21 or newer. If you meet these requirements, then you can get Google Assistant working on your phone. XDA forum member, brianelv, has shared methods detailing how to get Google Assistant: one via tweaking the build.prop and the other one by flashing the zip file through recovery. The member claims the feature is working on Nexus 6P, 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 5, Nexus 4, Pixel C, Moto G 2013 and 2015, OnePlus One, Lenovo VIBE K5 Plus and YU Yureka Plus. Check out the following guides to enable Google Assistant on your phone. But note that IBTimes UK cannot be held liable for any damage to the device. Method 1: Add or replace the following lines on your build.prop ro.product.model=Pixel XL ro.opa.eligible_device=true Method 2: This method is by installing the zip files via custom recovery, as you do to install custom ROM or modes. Download the three files from here Copy the downloaded files to your phone's storage Boot your phone in to custom recovery From recovery mode, first flash GoogleAssistantvelvet.zip Then flash GoogleAssistantBuildprop.zip GoogleAssistantVelvet.zip will install new Google Velvet app as a system app, whereas GoogleAssistantBuildProp.zip will search for the tweak.prop file. This contains the lines for build.prop. Troubleshoot: If you are still having Google Now, go to Google app info and wipe the data. If your camera app keeps crashing, restore your build.prop and use the new method for build. Prop. The Ok Google voice command might not work. It works only on Nexus devices running stock firmware.

Street Fight Daily: Brands Cash In on Snapchat API, Google to Launch Click-to-Message Ads October 18, 2016 by Joseph Zappa Leave a Comment Filed Under: Headlines, News A roundup of today’s big stories in hyperlocal publishing, marketing, commerce, and technology… Brands Cash In on Snapchat’s Long-Awaited API (AdWeek) Snapchat’s long-awaited API (application programming interface) is officially out in the wild with a handful of creative agencies and ad-tech companies selling ads on behalf of the mobile app. Brands are also finally getting a look under the hood at the data that powers their campaigns. As Voice Search Gains Importance, So Does Schema Mark-Up for SMB Sites (Street Fight) Eric Owen: Like it or not, SMBs have become far more educated and sophisticated with regard to digital media, and are in a much better position to hold their providers accountable. As a result, providers now must look for ways to more cost effectively provide higher quality products. Google To Launch Click-to-Message Ads on Google Search in Coming Weeks (Venture Beat) That Google is pushing mobile messaging as an extra channel through which customers can converse with companies isn’t entirely surprising. Indeed, it comes at a time when rival Facebook is ramping up its own Messenger app as a customer service platform and has previously revealed that it’s working on a similar click-to-message ad product Starbucks, Poster Child for Geotargeting, Nearly Loses Battle for Local Presence to Dunkin’ Donuts (Street Fight) Sponsored Content: Starbucks is well-known for its digital efforts in other areas: loyalty, check-out, mobile targeting, and push messaging within geofences. he potential for Starbucks to easily outperform its competition is there, but the brand’s attempts at connecting with local customers dragged its Brandscore down. Platform Publishing Creates Challenges for Publishers’ Mobile Design (Digiday) Many publishers wring their hands at the loss of control when it comes to publishing on platforms. But while that usually goes back to ad sales and data, there’s another big loss: Control over how people perceive a publishing brand. GoDaddy Beefs Up SMB Offerings With WordPress Websites (Street Fight) The new offering gives small business owners a more streamlined way to create WordPress websites, with professionally-built themes, industry-specific images, and a visual page editor for website customization. Facebook Is Now Testing Its Snapchat Stories Clone in Australia (TechCrunch) Facebook has expanded a test of a Snapchat Stories clone feature, called Messenger Day, to users of its app in Australia. The casual sharing feature lets people send illustrated, filter-enhanced photos and videos to friends which disappear in 24 hours — a la Snapchat. McDonald’s Turns to Social Media to Draw Millenials (Wall Street Journal) How many people does it take for a 61-year-old burger maker to tweet? At least a dozen. Inside a high-tech room at McDonald’s Corp.’s suburban Chicago headquarters, employees tap away at computers responding to tweets and crunching data on what’s trending on social media, long a standard practice at most consumer companies. Why AirBnB Thinks It’s Worth More Than $30 Billion (Quartz) AirBnB is currently asking for a valuation at $30 billion.

Today, range anxiety is far more ubiquitous due to our pocket supercomputers. Not only are we worried about our smartphone’s battery lasting the day, but also whether its memory will be sufficient to hold all those photos, videos, songs, apps and software updates. This problem is a moving target. As the resolution of mobile cameras improves, image sizes increase, particularly with 4K video. Apps and games are becoming more sophisticated, consuming more processing power. A lot has to do with users: the more time we spend staring at our screens, the faster the batteries drain. Makers have been slow to compensate for the increasing strain we put on our phones. The latest handsets from Apple and Google go some way to solving it, with more storage — on the device and in the cloud — and much-improved battery life. Longevity is relevant because both companies are pushing their phones into the most demanding territory yet, by trying to turn them into personal portable concierges. Lookalike hardware I have been testing the iPhone 7 Plus alongside the Google Pixel XL for about a week. (I prefer the more expensive larger phones, but most points in this review also apply to their small-screen siblings.) The Pixel is the latest in a long line of would-be “iPhone killers” from Google. I loved last year’s Nexus 6P but Google argues that the Pixel is different because it had greater involvement in shaping both hardware (which is built by HTC) and software. That approach of tying the two together has been Apple’s playbook for decades, so it is disappointing that the Pixel is not more distinctive. Its rounded black rectangle is different primarily because the fingerprint reader is on the back. It lacks the iPhone’s camera bump but as a result, the wedge-shaped handset is slightly thicker, though also lighter and shorter than its rival. I asked both phones to ‘show me photos of camping’. Siri heard me right first time but Assistant showed web search results for ‘my face has a campaign’ When it comes to software, inspiration seems to be travelling in the opposite direction. A new feature of iOS 10 apes Google Now: swipe sideways from the iPhone’s homescreen to see live widgets, such as the weather, calendar and suggested apps based on time, place and user habits. In many ways, the devices are evenly matched. Both excel on battery life. Whereas previous iPhones and Android devices often failed to last a full day (I admit to being a heavier user than most), I often went to bed without even hitting the “red zone” of low power on either device. Battery management software in both Android and iOS now kicks in to preserve the life of the phone by cutting background processes to essentials, such as calls and texts. Anyone who shares my daily frustration with battery life would benefit from upgrading. There is one crucial difference in endurance between the two devices, though: the iPhone 7 is waterproof while the Pixel is not. Clouds apart FT on WhatsApp Get the FT’s daily editor’s pick on WhatsApp Where the two devices begin to part ways is in their connected cloud services, which are key to alleviating the pressure on internal memory. Google’s neat solution to this kind of range anxiety is “Smart Storage”. If your device is running low on memory, flip a switch in the settings and it will delete older images that have been backed up to the cloud on Google Photos. It is also offering Pixel owners unlimited storage on Google Photos at full resolution — including hefty 4K videos. Even if you do not own a Pixel, Google is already slightly more generous with its free cloud storage than Apple. Where iCloud offers only 5GB free, Google allows 15GB — but that has to cover Gmail and Drive storage as well as photos. Pricing for extra storage evens out: Apple charges $1 a month for 50GB, Google charges $2 for 100GB. Apple has a 200GB tier for $3 and both offer 1TB for $10 a month. Digital butler All this cloud storage, however, is only useful if you have a good search tool to find your files once uploaded. Pixel is the first phone to feature Google Assistant, a digital butler that is accessed Siri-style by pressing and holding the home button or calling out “OK Google”. I found Assistant good but not significantly better than Siri. In one test, I asked both Siri and Assistant to “show me photos of camping” from the large library of images I had previously uploaded to both Apple and Google’s clouds. Siri heard me right first time and produced about a dozen pictures. Most were of the tent from my most recent camping trip and a few were random outdoorsy photos that were taken nowhere near a campsite. Not terrible but not particularly comprehensive, especially as I’ve been using iCloud to back up my pictures for years. Wearable technology Personal tech to improve running technique Measuring stride, paces per minute, bounce and foot strike to go faster and limit injuries Assistant first tried to show me web search results for “my face has a campaign”. A second attempt at machine-readable elocution was more successful but showed only web search results of camping pics, not my own pictures. After adding the possessive “Show me my photos of camping”, Google produced many happy camping memories I had uploaded to its Photos service, stretching back more than a decade. These included not just pictures of campsites but fireside suppers and beach walks from the same trips. Bafflingly, however, it did not find the most recent tent photo that Siri did. It is worth noting that Google Photos is also available as a standalone iOS app. It even comes with a “free-up space” option that clears all the original photos from your iPhone once they are backed up to Google. The files will be stored at a lower resolution than if you buy a Pixel, though. Verdict Both the iPhone 7 and Google’s Pixel provide long-overdue ways to mitigate range anxiety. But solving one problem may lead to another kind of nervousness, this time about privacy. Taking full advantage of the Pixel’s cloud back-up and Assistant means going all-in on Google, giving its smartphone constant access to your location, your photos and your most personal information. If that sounds too much to entrust to one company, then combining Apple’s hardware with some of Google’s software may provide a better balance.

As Google releases its Pixel devices, it doesnt want people tinkering too much with an Android Pay enabled device. So the rules are simple: If your device is rooted, no Android Pay, if your devices bootloader is unlocked, no Android Pay either, even if you havent modified the system at all. A Nexus 6P owner discovered that his Android Pay was no longer working because his bootloader was unlocked. Although the phone is not rooted, this is no longer enough for Android Pay to run, the device must have a locked bootloader, and cannot be rooted either. Well this is cool... Updated to the #android 7.1.1 Beta on my Nexus 6P & I can no longer use Android Pay with my unlocked bootloader. Proof pic.twitter.com/spGsqYNTxb ⚡Joey Riz⚡ (@jerflash) October 21, 2016 As Google devices are getting into the hands of not just Android enthusiasts, but also the general public, Google is more concerned about Android Pays security. Allowing Android Pay to work on a rooted device or a device with an unlocked bootloader would be a serious security flaw, as any tinkerer can figure out how the system ticks and potentially steal credit card info, if this happened, it would put a scar on the payment service's reputation. Disabling Android Pay for modified devices is the only way Google can ensure everyones sensitive credit card information is safe. Bummer for those who like to flash ROMs and use Android Pay, as the two can no longer occur in unison.

A good book, like James A. Michener’s novel “Hawaii,” of course. The Acorn’s Flying Squirrel has more. THOR CHALLGREN/Acorn Newspapers After traveling to Hawaii recently, I decided to learn more about the place I’d just visited. For me, the best place to start is in a book. I’m now halfway through James A. Michener’s 1959 epic novel, “Hawaii.” In episodic form, Michener takes you all the way from the island chain’s birth millions of years ago through its first settling by the Polynesians and missionaries and into modern Hawaii (for Michener, the 1950s). Having been to Lahaina in Maui, I have a whole new appreciation for the chapter set during the 1820s, when New England missionaries first came to the Valley Isle. I’m reading this book now, after my trip. But it’s possible the travel experience would have been even better if I’d read it before I went. How do you find books on your destination? Easy. First, if you like a good old-fashioned bookstore, stop by the reference desk and ask them to search their inventory by subject. Some books you’ll find in the travel section, of course, but other titles may appear elsewhere, such as in history, fiction, food or biography. Or try a Google search, using a phrase like “Books to read before traveling to . . . ” As an interesting side note, if you Google the phrase “Books to read before traveling to. . .” : Google auto-populates destinations in this order: Italy, London, Paris, Spain, Scotland. However, if you spell “traveling” with an extra “l” (alternate spelling), you get this list: India, Iceland, South America, Japan, France. Not sure what to make of this. In any case, once you find titles that interest you, order them online or check with your local bookstore, where you can peruse the opening chapters before purchasing the book. I suggest you consider different categories of books: history, food/ culture, fiction and classic literature. Perhaps choose one from each category to read before your trip. For example, let’s say you’re going to Italy and your trip includes stops in Rome, Florence and Venice, with possibly a quick stop in Naples. On the history side, you might consider a book such as “Brunelleschi’s Dome: How a Renaissance Genius Reinvented Architecture,” by Ross King. Having toured the Duomo in Florence and climbed its 463 dizzying steps, I later appreciated reading how Renaissance man Filippo Brunelleschi created what’s still the world’s largest dome. For food and culture, you might consider Fred Plotkin’s “Italy for the Gourmet Traveler,” or any book that helps you appreciate the love and passion Italians put into the food they serve. Knowing which dishes and ingredients are best in each region will elevate your dining experience, and items on a foreign menu become “friends” you’ve read about. Touring the fiction aisle, you have lots of options to choose from to prepare for an Italian trip. Maybe you’ve never read a Dan Brown thriller like “Angels & Demons.” By picking up this title from the library, you’ll be better prepared for your trip to Rome and a possible “Angels & Demons” walking tour that highlights settings in the novel. I’ll confess to having read Thomas Harris’ “Pompeii: A Novel,” an historical fiction account of life in this seaside Italian town circa A.D. 79 and its tragic end at the hands of a certain nearby volcano. Being able to walk through the ruins of the actual city while imagining the lives of the book’s fictional populace truly enhances the touring experience. The final category of reading you might consider would be any classic literature or well-recognized works. Books like Thomas Mann’s “Death in Venice,” Robert Graves’ “I, Claudius” and E.M. Forster’s “A Room With a View” will give you some historical and cultural background, while at the same time letting you feel a little smarter for tackling an English 301-worthy title. You can find books written about any destination you plan to visit, from the Caribbean to Alaska to Asia. With a little advance research and a consistent devotion to picking up what you’ve chosen, you’ll find your next trip infinitely more rewarding for starting your travels in a book.

The update to the suite brings in new features that include automatic allocation in Action Item as well as relevant suggestion options in Forms to help you do the routine jobs in less time. As per the search giant's official blog post, after the update, when you type sentences like "Ryan to follow up on the keynote script," or "Andrea to schedule a weekly check in" on the desktop version of the Docs app, it will use Natural Language Processing to suggest an Action Item to allocate to the respective person using. You can also manually assign an Action Item by mentioning someone's name and choosing it from checkbox in either mobile or desktop apps of Docs, Slides, and Sheets. The concerned person will then receive a notification regarding the same via email.The desktop version as well as mobile apps will now show a badge against the files that have an Action Item assigned to them or any unresolved suggestions made to the file by others, to make it easier for you to find files that need attention. In order to make Forms smarter and make you spend less time while building questions, the company has made use of neural networks. "With the help of neural networks, we can now predict the type of question you're asking and suggest potential responses for you to choose from, giving you back about 25 percent of the time you used to spend creating a Form," company said in its blog post. In Docs on the Web, the company has added support for voice-commands for changing text color, deleting words, inserting links and comments, plus a number of other ways to format. The company has further entered into partnership with messaging platform Slack that allows you to bring files from Google Drive to Slack by simply using the '+' button on the app. You can also create new Docs, Sheets, and Slides files right from inside Slack now.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Daydream View VR headset, Chromecast Ultra now available via Google Store By John Hoff - October 20, 2016 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Two of Google’s new hardware additions are now available for you to buy via the Google Store online – the Daydream View VR headset and the Chromecast Ultra. These two pieces of hardware were launched together with Google’s new Pixel smartphones to seemingly launch an era of new Google hardware, and here they are now. The Daydream View VR headset is now available for people to purchase at the announced price of USD$79.00. This VR headset seems to hype on side of comfort, as other VR headsets are pretty much uncomfortable after wearing it for a while. The Daydream View headset is powered by your device, initially the Google Pixel smartphones, but we hope more devices are supported soon. The headset is made with fabric and comfortable material, so you’ll at least be at ease when you use it. The Chromecast Ultra is the upgrade to the second generation Chromecast, and it has grown up more mature than the USD$35 HDMI dongle that it started with. With the Ultra, you now get 4K streaming, support for HDR, and you even get an Ethernet port on the dongle itself – which is perfect for streaming videos in 4K resolution. Of course, the pricing has been bumped up to USD$69 because you know, new features and all that. It’s still a solid buy for you, no matter how you see it. Check out the Google Store for the hardware you’re looking for. Most of the new announcements from Google’s October 4 event are already there, and you can even pre-order Pixel phones (if the pricing is not an issue for you).
