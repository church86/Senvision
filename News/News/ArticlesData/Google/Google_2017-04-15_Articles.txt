What once was broken now is fixed: call recording in Google Voice works again Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/15 5:56pm PDTApr 15, 2017 19 Plus 1 on G+ 60 Share on Facebook 49 Share on Twitter Total Shares128 Applications Google News Shortly after bringing it back from the dead, it would appear that Google may have inadvertently broken call recording for a short period. For the last two weeks there have been multiple different user reports of problems with recording calls in Google Voice. Thankfully, the issue appears to have been resolved and recording is now working as intended. While there is not yet any word about the status of recordings presumed lost during this period, all new recordings should behave as expected and appear in your Google Voice inbox. The precise cause of the original problem isn't known. We've reached out to Google for more information. In the meantime Google hasn't made any statements about the matter outside the responses on the forum, so in lieu of an official statement all we can provide is the response given to posts on the subject: Thank you for reporting the issue you had with call recordings. We believe that we have resolved the issue and new call recordings should work as expected. Our engineering team is continuing to investigate the recordings that took place during the time period affected. We will update this thread once we have an update to provide. Thanks for your patience! If you believe you may have been affected, you can check if any of your recordings made during that time are present. If you don't find them in your Google Voice inbox double check by opening the overflow menu on the left, open "Legacy Google Voice," hover over More and select Recorded calls. Recordings should appear there, and if any are missing from the last two weeks you may be among those who have experienced the issue. For those users that might have made recordings while things were broken, it looks like Google is still looking into things and plans on updating the relevant threads later. If we hear anything more on the subject or if we get a statement we'll be sure to update this post.

Techsoul It'd be better if they fixed the bug that doesn't allow you to get a new number at all. Mark Sentesy More important to me is that the new app usually claims the phone has no network connection, when it clearly does. This makes it unusable. So I use an old apk, which works perfectly fine. Latheryin With all the different laws around people need to be careful with call recording. Have to make sure you are aware of the laws for each and every state. Other wise might end up on the bad end of a court case. vwnut13 Google Voice announces to both parties that the call is being recorded. Latheryin Which doesn't mean anything in states where is not allowed at all. Never did understand it personally. If you can't remember what was said on a phone call then it is either not that important or your memory just sucks and you have bigger issues. MG Which doesn't mean anything since all states allow call recording, some just require that all parties involved be notified. Call recording has far more use cases than simply jotting down notes Latheryin Not all states do. The one I live in just made it illegal again to record personal calls. I'm sure for some it does. Can't think of any reason myself but for those with bad memories I can see where it would help. vwnut13 And which state would that be? Latheryin Alaska. IT was voted on last week along with a bunch of other privacy laws. You know things like where you can and cant fly a drone, recording people while they are out at events. You know things like that. Like I said I am sure many people find a use for it. Just not something I would ever use or have a use for. Android Developer Pretty sure normal calls are used more. Why can't they put call recording as a standard on Android?

Google app v7.0 beta includes new Assistant Notification settings, plans redesign of Assistant Services directory, and hints at new device called "Bisto" [APK Teardown + Download] Cody Toombs Follow View All Posts 2017/04/13 4:29am PDTApr 13, 2017 38 Plus 1 on G+ 146 Share on Facebook 65 Share on Twitter Total Shares249 APK Teardown Applications Downloads News Update 1: 2017/04/14 4:55am PDT Notification toggle was removed in a subsequent update Article Contents 1 What's New 1.1 Toggle Google Assistant Notifications 1.2 Prevent icons from being added with new app installs 1.3 Bug fix: No more crashing from swiping away cards 2 Teardown 2.1 Services are going to be easier to manage 2.2 code 2.3 A new device type called "Bisto" 2.4 code 2.5 code 3 Download The Google app went through a major version bump to 7.0 and began rolling out to the beta channel a couple of days ago. A bit of digging around turned up a few new settings, but nothing that explains why the version number went up on this release. Along with the new features, a teardown also raises some light on a few things we can look forward to in the future, including some vital improvements for Services accessed through Google Assistant and what may be a new type of device. If you're not part of the beta channel, you can grab the latest version of the Google app – now with fewer crashes – from APK Mirror. What's New Unofficial Changelog: (the stuff we found) Toggle Notifications for Google Assistant Toggle Auto-add app icons for new installs (Android O) Bug fix: No more crashing on card dismissals Toggle Google Assistant Notifications Update 1: 2017/04/14 4:55am PDT Notification toggle was removed in a subsequent update It looks like this toggle was revealed a bit prematurely. With the release of a minor update to v7.0.08, the Notification toggles have been removed. That probably explains why they didn't seem to do anything. At this point, this section might belong in the teardown because the setting will probably return in the future. – Thanks, Kfir Sadeh. End of Update Google is working hard to make Assistant more useful and appealing to users, and that often means it will have to behave a little differently from one user to the next. Not only that, but it probably has to behave a little differently from one device to another, especially when they come in different form factors. The latest Google app update brings a little more configurability with a new setting for Assistant that allows users to toggle notifications on or off for their phones and Google Home devices. Here's the description: Receive notifications like weather updates on this device. Even if notifications are off, you'll still hear alarms and important updates. By default, the setting will be enabled on phones and disabled on Google Home. If you would like to change the setting, just go into the Google app Settings screen and then tap into the Assistant settings. You can switch between the Phone settings and Google Home with the dropdown at the top of the page, and then switch between Home units with another selector further down the page. Notifications toggles for Google Home (left) and phones (right) It's safe to assume that this refers to those low-priority items that silently slip into the notification list with current weather conditions, due dates for bills, and occasionally some important local news. At least that's how they usually present themselves on a phone. Google Home might be a different story, and that might make this a little more interesting. So far, Assistant on Google Home has only been known to become active when an alarm goes off or somebody interacts with it directly through voice commands or casting. The rest of the time, it stays quiet. Enabling this setting would seem to suggest that it could now (or soon) wake up from time to time to let you know it started raining outside or that the mayor of a nearby town was arrested for some pretty nasty things. (True story.) I've had the setting enabled for several hours on my Google Home, but there haven't been any notifications read aloud to me yet. I don't know if there just haven't been any events or if this isn't really supposed to be doing anything (yet). Prevent icons from being added with new app installs A couple of weeks ago, a teardown turned up a new setting destined for Google's launcher. Its purpose was to simply turn off the behavior that created icons on the home screen for freshly installed apps. That toggle is now live in the v7.0 update, but with a weird catch: It only works on Android O, or API 26, to be specific. Only users running a developer preview will be able to see the toggle for now. Readers of the teardown rightly brought up the point that the Play Store offers a similar setting. However, that toggle only applies to apps installed through the Play Store, not to those from other sources like the Amazon Appstore. Perhaps this is related to–or inspired by–the change in the way unfamiliar app installers are handled in Android O. Bug fix: No more crashing from swiping away cards If you installed v7.0.4 of the Google app and ventured into your Now stream, there's a pretty good chance you also tried to swipe away a card and witnessed the scene above. Yes, there was a bug in that release and it had the undesirable effect of crashing the home screen. Version 7.0.6, which is linked below, fixes the issue. Teardown Disclaimer: Teardowns are based on evidence found inside of apks (Android's application package) and are necessarily speculative and usually based on incomplete information. It's possible that the guesses made here are totally and completely wrong. Even when predictions are correct, there is always a chance that plans could change or may be canceled entirely. Much like rumors, nothing is certain until it's officially announced and released. The features discussed below are probably not live yet, or may only be live for a small percentage of users. Unless stated otherwise, don't expect to see these features if you install the apk. Services are going to be easier to manage After Google opened the gates for developers to build services for Assistant, there was a predictable flood of submissions attempting to get the attention of users. We're now staring at an unwieldy, disorganized list that's pretty hard to keep up to date with. Naturally, Google is moving to solve this by adding a few tools to make all of these services a little easier to sift through and use. First, services (referred to as "agents" by Google's developers) will be sorted into categories so you won't have to stumble through a list containing everything from food delivery services to games. <string name="agent_directory_category">Category</string> <string name="agent_directory_category_list_header">Categories</string> If you're still having trouble finding the service you want, you'll also be able to ask Assistant to help out. <string name="agent_directory_ask_prompt">Ask your Assistant</string> Once you're using a service and find that it's really good (or bad), you'll be able to give your feelings about it with a rating, feedback, or even report it if something is really not right about it. Ratings will obviously also be reflected in the directory of services so everybody will be able to ignore the ones that didn't live up to other peoples' standards. code <string name="agent_directory_rate_service_prompt">Rating</string> <string name="agent_directory_a11y_rate_service_subtitle">Rate your experience with %1$s on Google Assistant</string> <string name="agent_directory_a11y_rate_service_title_after_rating">Your rating</string> <string name="agent_directory_a11y_rate_service_title_before_rating">Rate %1$s</string> <string name="agent_directory_a11y_rate_service_five_stars_button">Five stars</string> <string name="agent_directory_a11y_rate_service_four_stars_button">Four stars</string> <string name="agent_directory_a11y_rate_service_three_stars_button">Three stars</string> <string name="agent_directory_a11y_rate_service_two_stars_button">Two stars</string> <string name="agent_directory_a11y_rate_service_one_star_button">One star</string> <string name="agent_directory_a11y_agent_avg_rating">%1$s star rating</string> <string name="agent_directory_agent_rating_menu_delete">Delete</string> <string name="agent_directory_agent_rating_menu_edit">Edit</string> <plurals name="agent_directory_a11y_user_rating"> <item quantity="other">Your rating %d stars.</item> <item quantity="one">Your rating %d star.</item> </plurals> <string name="agent_feedback_from_header_text">From</string> <string name="agent_directory_feedback_send">Send</string> <string name="agent_directory_report">Report service</string> <string name="agent_directory_report_agent_text"><u>Report service</u></string> Once you've chosen a few services that you like, you'll be able to add them to a personalized list. The term 'shortcut' is also used a few times and might be a way for users to attach their own custom names to services, and maybe even fill in some of the information for regular requests. <string name="agent_directory_my_services_header">My Services</string> <string name="agent_directory_shortcuts_title">Your %1$s shortcuts</string> <string name="agent_directory_shortcuts_subtitle">Customize your shortcuts for %1$s</string> <string name="agent_directory_shortcuts_create">CREATE</string> Most of this is pretty predictable stuff and was bound to happen eventually, and perhaps it should have been done a bit earlier. Nevertheless, as the infrastructure improves, so does the ecosystem. A new device type called "Bisto" Every once in a while, something really unusual comes up in a teardown... This is one of those times. There's a new device type listed among the strings in this update, and they refer to something known internally as "Bisto." This obviously has nothing to do with the British brand of foods, but instead refers to a device that is somehow distinct from other current products. code <string name="assistant_settings_device_type_android_tv">Android TV</string> <string name="assistant_settings_device_type_bisto">Bisto</string> <string name="assistant_settings_device_type_google_home">Google Home</string> <string name="assistant_settings_device_type_nexus">Pixel</string> <string name="assistant_settings_device_type_phone">Phone</string> <string name="assistant_settings_device_type_wear">Android Wear</string> <string name="assistant_device_id_android_tv_preference_category">assistantDeviceIdAndroidTvCategory</string> <string name="assistant_device_id_bisto_preference_category">assistantDeviceIdBistoCategory</string> <string name="assistant_device_id_google_home_preference_category">assistantDeviceIdGoogleHomeCategory</string> <string name="assistant_device_id_nexus_preference_category">assistantDeviceIdNexusCategory</string> <string name="assistant_device_id_wear_preference_category">assistantDeviceIdWearCategory</string> The list of device types above shows that Bisto is going to be treated differently from Android TV, Google Home, Android Wear, a Google Pixel, and the general category of "phone." Of course, since this list already makes a distinction between the Pixel and a regular phone, we can't eliminate the possibility Bisto is another phone or a special release matching one of the other products. code <string name="bisto_device_notifications_pref_title">Spoken notifications</string> <string name="bisto_device_notifications_pref_summary">Notifications will be read aloud inside your headphones</string> from /res/xml/assistant_device_id_bisto_settings.xml <PreferenceScreen xmlns:android="http://schemas.android.com/apk/res/android"> <com.google.android.apps.gsa.assistant.settings.shared.PreferenceHolder android:key="@string/assistant_device_id_group_holder"> <com.google.android.apps.gsa.assistant.settings.shared.MainScreenPreferenceCategory android:title="@string/assistant_settings_device_id_category" android:key="@string/assistant_device_id_bisto_preference_category"> <com.google.android.apps.gsa.assistant.settings.shared.MainScreenDropDownPreference android:persistent="false" android:key="bistoDeviceId" /> <SwitchPreferenceCompat android:persistent="false" android:title="@string/bisto_device_notifications_pref_title" android:key="bistoNotifications" android:summary="@string/bisto_device_notifications_pref_summary" /> </com.google.android.apps.gsa.assistant.settings.shared.MainScreenPreferenceCategory> </com.google.android.apps.gsa.assistant.settings.shared.PreferenceHolder> </PreferenceScreen> The current manifestation involving Bisto is a single toggle that offers to read notifications aloud to the user through headphones. This means the product can at least support headphones, which only really eliminates Android Auto and other in-car products – many states and countries don't allow drivers to wear headphones. We can also surmise that Bisto includes a screen since this setting gives the option to read notifications through headphones, but likely shows them in some other way if the setting is disabled. In other words, it's probably not an audio-only device like Google Home. Since these are settings for Assistant, the final assertion we can make is that the device will obviously include Google Assistant. From that, we can also assume it will have a microphone and probably a speaker. Okay, those aren't strictly sure things, but the odds are in our favor. Unfortunately, that's about as far as the clues take us. It probably has more in common with a phone than it does with Google Home, and it's not going to be exclusive to a car... Bisto might be an entirely new category of hardware, a specially branded device from an existing category, or even just the name used internally for Android One devices with Google Assistant. It's too early to speculate much beyond that, but we'll definitely be on the lookout for more hints.

Cody Toombs It's certainly possible. There are a few variants of Glass roaming around, including a couple of models that are only available to partners and supposedly one that has no screen and operates a lot like Google Home. That last one can probably be ruled out because it lacks a screen, but I could see how some of the partners might want Google Assistant on their Glass units. I hope this isn't the case since it means we probably wouldn't get to confirm it for a long time. On the other hand, it's always possible (but unlikely, I think) that Google is thinking about taking another run at launching Glass. marcusmarcus2 Maybe it is for "Android Things" Isaac Fischer Guesses for Bisto: a Glass redux or a wall panel / standalone home control device. whispy_snippet Bisto = Bison? Guest You can change the notification setting for Google Home through the Google app the same way you can for the phone. When I go to settings through the Google app there's a toggle to select either my Pixel XL Assistant settings or Google Home Assistant https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cdb9430794930787147ba2eb5fe2032e0a4528b2dc567b1c549a034f441c1ef1.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9cec9c79b31aca40a0b7f0025450a895c74544e859fb60bae9c7d280e6ff1cce.png settings Cody Toombs Ahh, you're right. I don't know why I keep forgetting that, I even explained the layout in a teardown many months ago. Every time I see the dropdown indicator, I think it's used for collapsing the section below it, which makes no sense. DJ SPY We've been able to turn off and on the thing about a new app icon being added to the home screen, directly from the play store for ever. What's the point of that option being in the Google app now? F4LL0U7 Second paragraph of that section: "Readers of the teardown rightly brought up the point that the Play Store offers a similar setting. However, that toggle only applies to apps installed through the Play Store, not to those from other sources like the Amazon Appstore." mike shwilly How about song recognition? Or it will be classic Google waiting a whole year to present this "feature" with a new OS? Josh Flowers Seriously! I heard a song yesterday, pulled out the phone, "ok google -- what's this song?" --"I'm sorry, I can't do that yet." Instant thought: I've replaced a superior product with an inferior product. F4LL0U7 Why not just use the widget icon that you can add to your home screen? That still works. Josh Flowers Don't have a widget. I think I deleted 'Sound Search' when I had Google Now. Just re-installed, thanks...but bummed I have to do so. F4LL0U7 It's not the standalone Sound Search app that hasn't been updated in years. It's a widget that's part of the Google app itself. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b12d0cd106c2504e21827d19c9164f96401e390950988d2fa533f424eb61fa80.png nxtiak Don't need widget.

So if I said that in real life and then winked, I would expect one to think that I am not being serious or making a joke. Callum Saunders I'm thinking that bisto is this reiteration of google glass that is audio only. I'd say maybe a take on apple's airpods but that include google assistant? This would tie into the partnership with sony to bring the high quality bluetooth audio to Android O. I imagine these will be bundled with the pixels to compensate for removing the headphone jack and this would be a way for them to market it as BETTER than the headphone jack. LondonLeedsFan I'm on beta for the Google app and other than getting Assistant, nothing in regards to layout or appearance has changed on any update on about 6 months?

Alan Cramer Still no Google Assistant for GSuite users it appears. Kaden Gordon Bisto could be an app for all devices, and acts as an all-in-one notification manager Iamsecond Could Bisto refer to a new assistant based on Linda Bellingham? Let's hope so! Camerooni I'd like them to add an option to automatically 'ding' on the hour and say 'It's 2 o'clock pm' etc. My grandparents used to have a little clock like this when I was a kid and I thought it was amazing.. haven't found anything that did it since :/ Prasad Bhusari Sir i am using one plus x and i am unable to use Google assistance also root my phone still its happening i use all tricks plz help me JG With the "it probably won't be audio only" bit, I'm assuming my idea for Bisto is pretty much out... Not even sure if it'd be product worthy or not, but... Last year, Sony released the Xperia Ear. Basically a Bluetooth headset that could read notifications etc to you. The goal was to keep your head up and engaged with your surroundings, rather than always looking down at a phone screen. I'm kind of picturing the Assistant embedded into a headset, sort of a portable, personal Google Home. It could potentially work as an Android Wear alternative. Rather than having to pull your phone out of your pocket, or even glance at your wrist, it could just read your new Hangout message right in your ear. Might come in handy during the next -40 Snowpocolypse when you don't want to unbundle your layers to get either your watch or phone out. I'd imagine most headsets would probably already let you control the phone's Assistant. Google did buy a company to get tech to improve audio quality, maybe they could leverage that into this... I also wouldn't mind seeing Google produce a case that would both protect my new Pixel 2 and house the earpiece. I never use them because I don't want them in my ear all day and because they're smaller, I'm afraid I'll lose them if I shove them in a pocket or whatever so they just sit at home when I need them the most. If they lived in/on my phone case I'd have them 24/7 (the case could also allow both the headset and phone to be charged at the same time). Like Wear, it could use WiFi to extend it's useful range. WiFi Assistant could automatically log it into open networks and it could harvest passwords for protected networks when you pair it to your phone. Too bad it wouldn't have the battery life to support its own cellular connection.

Some owners are experiencing bad Nexus Android Nougat battery life. Or at least a drop when many expected improvements. With that in mind here we’ll be explaining what could be causing it, and how to improve Android 7.0 Nougat battery life for the Nexus 5x, Nexus 6P, Nexus 6, Nexus 9, Pixel C and more. Including Android 7.1.1 Nougat and the Google Pixel. There are a lot of things that could cause battery drain, so we’ll go through a few different potential fixes. Read: Nexus Android 7.1.1 Release: What to Know On August 22nd Android Nougat was officially released. During the holiday months of December 2016 they rolled out maintenance updates to Android 7.1.1 too. Sadly, the update isn’t perfect and we’re hearing some are experiencing minor problems, bugs or suffering from poor battery life. Here is some helpful advice. Abnormal battery drain is a common problem, especially after big software updates of this size. Often the first few days or week of an update users report problems. That’s typical because the update and changes are settling in, or you’re using the device more than before. Meaning, give it a few days before decided if battery life is “bad” or not. This is more present now that we have monthly security updates. Android Nougat has a new “Doze” feature which should make battery life better, but some reports claim the opposite. In fact, heading over to Reddit or even the official Google forum bug tracker, you’ll see lots of complaints about a wide array of problems. Most notably Nexus Android 7.0 battery life issues. For now Android 7.0 battery life problems are somewhat isolated, and I’m not experiencing any, but as the update hits more and more devices like the Nexus 5X or Nexus 6P, we expect the list of problems to grow. Here’s our initial Android 7.0 problems & fixes, and we’ll add more once they appear. How to Fix Nexus Android Nougat Battery Life Problems We’re here to try and help solve some of the bad Nexus Android 7.0 battery life problems users are experiencing, but may need to wait on Google to release a quick 7.0.1 bug fix. The developer previews ran pretty great, but had battery problems too, so Google should be well aware of this and working on a solution. Find Battery Draining Apps The first thing users should do if they notice extreme battery drops is check for rogue apps using more battery life than they should. This could be a malfunctioning app that may not be ready to run right with Nougat, an app keeping the system awake, or other things. Typically heading to settings > battery > and looking at the list of apps draining battery you’ll get a good idea of what’s going on. Android System or the Screen (Display) are usually at the top of the list, but we’ve been seeing a problem where “Android OS” is taking the most, followed by Android System. One should be there, the other should not. Android System is typically one of the higher drains, but not the OS aspect. The Google issue tracker has several reports of this problem dating back to the 3rd developer preview of Android N. While Google services or Android System often take up battery to perform important tasks in the operating system, “Android OS” shouldn’t be at the top of the list. Some users reported the OS taking more battery while the phone was off, than the screen does while the device is turned on. The screen should be the biggest drain, not the operating system. Google’s working hard on a fix, but we have some potential solutions as well. Oddly enough, one is to turn off Bluetooth if you don’t need it. Android Wear, Android Auto and other devices require Bluetooth, but many users have noticed substantially better battery life with Bluetooth turned off. Check the list of apps in the battery settings to see if anything else is causing drain. Apps like Facebook and Snapchat can often be the problem as well, so keep that in mind. Selecting an app and hitting “Force Stop” can kill the process and improve battery, but don’t kill anything unless you know what it does. Reinstalling an app is also another good idea. Widgets can be a big battery drain also, so consider checking on those apps. Lastly, try booting into Safe Mode. Safe Mode will disable third-party applications and that will allow you to narrow your search to find any potential problems. Those with the battery running out around 30% have another issue completely that we’re hearing Google is investigating. So hold tight. Check Account Sync Similar to apps draining your battery as mentioned above, apps being synced and backed up could be the culprit too. Multiple users on Reddit noticed that on the Nexus 6P the device wasn’t syncing right, causing huge drains in battery life. Imagine your phone trying to sync to the cloud and save all of your contacts, photos, Google drive documents or Google music over and over again. That will surely effect battery life. The user recommends heading into Settings > Accounts > and looking for any that have the sync icon or a (!) next to them, suggesting sync had failed. To make matters worse, manually refreshing accounts to sync didn’t fix the problem. One owner went into each Google account sync option and did it manually. For Google Drive, fit, photos, music, keep, and even 3rd party apps like Skype, and re-synced each one. Multiple users have noticed substantially improved Nexus battery life after doing this. To take this further, Skype sync was causing the problem for a few users, so be sure to check any and all apps and accounts to make sure sync is working. Then, continue on for the rest of our tips. Disable Unused Services If your apps are functioning properly try disabling unnecessary services on your Nexus phone or tablet. Disabling connections and other services when you aren’t using them could save you some battery life. We mentioned bluetooth above, and will say it again. Actually, we’re seeing a lot of complaints about Bluetooth problems, and some of those could be causing battery drain. Turn if off if you don’t need it. We highly recommend shutting off Wi-Fi connectivity, Bluetooth, NFC, GPS, and cellular data when you don’t need them turned on. You can turn those off from the Nexus’ quick settings menu or you can turn them off from regular Settings menu. It seems with each update a small group complain about Bluetooth issues. Another idea is to change location settings to “Battery Saver Mode” which uses WiFi and networks instead of GPS. As GPS drains battery with ease. If you’re in a poor service area, try flipping on Airplane Mode. Airplane Mode will kill all of your device’s settings but it could prevent drain. When you have no service the phone will constantly look for one, so turn on Airplane mode and save juice for later. Restart Your Nexus Occasionally apps will just start draining the battery, or even Android System and OS, when it shouldn’t. If I’ve removed my Nexus (or any Android) from the charger and it seems to be draining faster than expected, I do a quick reboot, which usually fixes the problem. Hold down the power button and turn it off, then back on, or hit reboot on select devices. This starts the entire system fresh, and can solve a lot of little bugs including bad Nexus battery life. It sounds silly, but I reboot my phone once every 2-3 days, for the best experience. Auto Brightness This is one everyone should know, and isn’t really a tip, but I constantly see users with a phone set around 90-100% brightness, or set to auto. Honestly, this isn’t needed and can really kill battery life. I keep all of my devices around 35-40% brightness, which is still plenty. Head into Settings > Display > and uncheck auto, then put the slider to a more manageable and realistic brightness setting. It may take a few hours to get used to the lower screen level, but your battery will thank you for it. Clear The Cache Partition If none of those work, you can take some more drastic steps towards fixing your bad Nexus Android Nougat battery life. One of those steps is clearing the cache partition. Clearing the cache has worked wonders in the past to fix poor Nexus battery life in general, and some stated it helped with the battery drain on the Nexus support forum. Here’s how to clear your cache partition: Press and hold Power and Volume Down buttons simultaneously until you see something other than Google on the screen. You should see a large arrow at the top of the screen. Tap Volume Down repeatedly until you see Recovery in the arrow.  Then tap the Power button. You should see an android on his back, chest open with a red triangle and exclamation mark. While holding Power button tap Volume Up once then release the Power button. You should now see a list of items at top of screen and will be in “Recovery mode”. Tap Volume Down until you reach the option to clear cache partition. Tap the Power button to select, confirm by hitting yes, and let it finish. Progress messages will appear at the bottom of the screen. This should take less than a minute, but could take upwards of 10 minutes in some cases. Restart your Nexus This has shown to fix multiple small problems after a software update. From battery life to WiFi and Bluetooth issues, GPS glitches, and multiple other small things. We’d recommend doing this after any big update, so your Nexus can start with a clean slate. Factory Reset Your Device This is a last resort, but like clearing the Cache it’s also a great idea to truly start with a clean slate and wipe out any unwanted leftover files. Doing a factory data reset will erase everything, so backup any important files first, and be prepared to set aside an hour or so to set up your phone back to how it was. Most should know how to do a reset, if not, Google has put together an extensive guide that outlines the proper way to factor reset Nexus smartphones and tablets. Take a look at that information, backup your device, and get started. Downgrade to Marshmallow If you absolutely need better battery life and can’t fix it with any of these suggestions, and can’t wait for Google to release an update to Android 7.1.2 Nougat, some owners can always revert back to Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. This guide explains how to manually install Android Nougat, but the same instructions (and factory images link) will allow users to download any version of Android 6.0 and install it within 10-15 minute. Use that to downgrade back to Marshmallow if you don’t need Nougat, and want better Nexus battery life. I wouldn’t recommend it, but to each their own. Other Ideas If none of this seems to work, try tracking down another fix. Google’s Nexus Help Forums are a great place to start. There are tons of helpful users on XDA-Developers not to mention custom 3rd party versions of Android you can install that may have better results. We’d also recommend getting a Portable Battery Pack that can recharge your device anywhere and everywhere, which isn’t ideal, but a great accessory to have anyways. We’ll be on the lookout for more complaints, details, possible fixes, and report back once we know more or hear of incoming updates. Are you experiencing bad Nexus Android Nougat battery life?

Tons of cases are available now, or will be coming soon. The Nexus 6P Folio Case comes in a beautiful refined leather design in brown or black color options. This is one of the few that is listed as coming soon, and arguable one of the best. It features cutouts for the front speakers, fingerprint scanner, all the ports, and has a magnet on the flip out cover to instantly wake the screen. It's an elegant case, but will be expensive.

Battery life mixed/heavy usage is at better than 24 hours! (Non restorative, meaning factory reset but deselect the option to restore app data then wipe system cache after the reset). Used to have the terrible battery, camera and system lag with overheating. But now it literally is like a brand new phone. And this nougat with doze is kicking! Peace. ✌️ 09/14/2016 Dennis Fluttershy Reply With the latest beta; the Nexus 6 instantly shuts down when it reaches 15% and requires charging before being able to start up. Today, it instantly shut down at 75% and required charging before starting up. I charged it for a minute, and has now been able to drain it below 75% without any issue. But this is really annoying when going out, and it shuts down at 75%!! Maybe I need to do a factory reset. But I would also like to have the full release of Nougat first; and then do a full reset. 09/21/2016 saj Reply This is definitely a problem. Today is my first day on Nougat and the battery drain is very clear. Not using the device any differently. When I check battery settings, there is Android System and Android OS right at the top. I don’t have blue tooth on. Screen is at 5 percent. Its just terrible. First, was complaining that I didn’t have Nougat…and now I wish I never got it. And calling Google Support is useless. Those reps don’t know what they’re talking about and can’t resolve any problems. 09/23/2016 Nexusnoenergy Reply Bump #nougatbrokemyphone 09/24/2016 JacobP Reply So much complexity. I am glad I delayed the nougat update on my nexus phone. I have gotten my Marshmallow devices to do what I want and they all have a perfect battery life. I’ll let others to be guinea pigs for the 7.0, and will upgrade maybe a year later as it seems like Google has release yet another half baked Android update. 10/10/2016 Charles G Torrez Reply Found this on another website: “I FOUND OUT HOW TO STOP NEXUS 6P NOUGAT BATTERY DRAIN. go into developer options, disable automatic system updates, and disable always allow wifi roam scans. Restart. Fixed.” 10/19/2016 Joey Reply dont update to 7.0!!! my SOT went from 5hrs consistently to barely 3!!! Please fix this google 10/19/2016 Charles GT Reply Joey, in developer options, disable automatic system updates. This did the trick for me. Went from 7 hrs back to all day battery. 10/30/2016 Valery Reply I’ve tried everything, even so-called “developer options”, but nothing helps reach the goal with 6.0.1 or 7.0. When i first got the phone (nexus 5x), it was able to be working for 5-8 days!!! Yes, i am not very active user. 5-10 calls 10-20 min of music, 1-2 card transactions (i’m far more 40 ;-). AT LEAST 5 DAYS! The only thing that helped in my case was the downgrade to the oldest available 6.0.0! But even first upgrade of 6.0.0 applications (as well as google services) got my phone back to where i was before. DO NOT UPGRADE GOOGLE SERVICES AFTER YOU HAVE DOWNGRADED TO 6.0.0!! IT IS THE ROOT OF ALL PROBLEMS!! as i think ;-) 20+ hours of working-as-expected!! yahoooo! If you get upgraded to the next version of google services, remember that you can safely return to the original version. You just have to Disable-Remove Upgrade Google Services, and then re-Enable GS, as well as another google apps which functionality depends on G-services too much (calendar, disk, contacts, camera, gmail and some others). And the next fly in the plate of soup is the fact that you will be unable to install some newer apps from google (such as “Google duo”). Your choose. 11/05/2016 Valery Reply Unfortunately, my next experiment failed. After a few days, everything was as it was before flashing. Looks like Big Brother in my phone never sleeps. 11/06/2016 Margie Reply I am a Nexus 9 user and have had no issues till recently, Now I have Many, Bad battery Life? Yes Chrome suddenly stops working, when using any app it will suddenly just close. This happens daily, I have uninstalled google chrome did all that, did the updates, everything works fine for oh Maybe a day then back to All the problems. All very frustrating, thinking I should do a factory reset, don’t really want to, I mean the is November now I would think there would be some fixes for all these issues. ??At a Loss 11/11/2016 David H Byrne Reply That was profoundly informative… Thanks 👍 11/29/2016 Hazman Reply Fix battery drain Android OS and Android System bug using this tutorial: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OPX74-htB0g 12/25/2016 Georg Hellerup Reply Well nougat 7.0 nearly killed the nexus 5x. The battery drained rapidly and the device refused to charge properly. I made a backup of the device as the first step. Then I used The Nexus Rootkit Tool ver 2.19 (latest). The device was rooted by following the given instructions in the tool. Then I waited for the device to come around and prepairing apps and the like. Then I flashed the build to ver 6.01 (last stable build stock ROM). Rebooted the device. The next step is very important. I configured the device as a new device.Wait for the device to fully prepare and install apks. DO NOT UPDATE before everything is updated an running in build 6.01 this includes all apks and wifi. The device might be stable at this point – however it may warn You of it being unable to check for corrupted software (unlocked bootloader) or even the device itself being corrupted at boot up. Just ignore it for the time being. With all the above done, then and only then I used the OTA update to ver 7.11. This worked for me. It takes some time. Patience is very impotant – don´t try to rush anything. I´ve tried a lot of different approaches. You should be able to relock the bootloader, however I went straight back into problems. Then again I can live with an unlocked bootloader which offers more possibilities/options including bricking again. I´ve not tested the method on other devices. In general You´ve got a fighting chance – if You can revert back to a stable release and get it running and proceed from there. The tools may vary a bit even for the same devices running the exact same builds. Some tools require the device to be only charging on USB – others MTP. Some tools may even use diffrent methods within the problemsolving – adb sideload, fastboot or download mode eg. You might even have to try different tools, one for fixing bootloader, another one for recovery eg. Trying different forums is a very good beginning when trying to figure out, what may work or not for Your specific model and/ROM/problems. Performing the above steps is at Your own risk. By performing the above steps You´ve readily accepted the risk of failiure and bricking the device. Failiure is always an option.. 12/25/2016 Georg Hellerup Reply 7.0 was one of the worst halfbacked upgrades I´ve ever seen. Even upgrading to 7.11 didn´t fix it. 7.11 is outperforming 6.0 any day. For the time being the only solution seems to be going back to 6.0 and upgrade directly to 7.11. – 7.0 is by all means a no go. Even upgrading to 7.11 can´t fix the mess left by 7.0 – The 7.11 is very impressive and improves battery life. I´ve seen the nexus 5 x go from less than 1 hr SOT to 4 hrs. 04/07/2017 Buizerd Reply Also in the new update 7.1.2 there is still he battery drain on my Nexus 6P when WIFI is on but not connected 04/15/2017 Mike Reply This article was useless. Doesn’t provide any solid ways to fix the actual issues. Just provides generic solutions applicable to any phone and any software. Please do not clutter the internet or waste our time with such useless articles. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AI Guest The sudden rise of the headless AI Jensen Harris, Textio@jensenharris April 15, 2017 10:14 PM Tags: ai, Alexa, Amazon, Assistant, bots, chatbots, Google Home, machine learning, voicebots Image Credit: Shutterstock.com/Zapp2Photo “Hey Siri, how’s the weather today?” “OK Google, remind me to pay the power bill.” “Alexa, tell me a joke!” Bots are eating the world. Whether you are an enterprising app developer building the essential software to bring a virtual Taylor Swift into your Slack chats, or just lonely and in need of a dumb, annoying virtual friend to message you on Facebook, we seem to be clear on one thing: many experiences, apps, sites, and products are breathlessly going to be replaced with bots. (Unless they are being replaced with VR. Or AR. Or a typewriter keyboard for your iPhone.) It’s official: “bot for X” is the new “Uber for X”. And sure, bots are cool. Ever since ELIZA struggled to pass the Turing Test and HAL 9000 murdered his crew (later reincarnated in a hardly-remembered Apple Super Bowl commercial) we’ve been infatuated with the idea of computers as our inevitable sidekicks. Bots center around one specific niche aspect of artificial intelligence: conversational understanding. Human factors experts have long been enthralled by the idea that a more natural way to communicate with computers would be through speech, and we’ve spent the better part of a century building to a point where natural conversations may soon be a reality. While this is indeed an important step forward in human-computer interaction, it is truly just one small part of what AI is about—and not the part that will matter the most for the enterprise companies who actually buy almost $4 trillion in software and services each year. Bots are the new command line Today, most bots just provide a wrapper around existing functionality. Much as in the early days of graphical user interface (GUI), the point-and-click interface provided different ways of achieving the same tasks you could do on the command line, most bots provide an additional channel with which to do tasks you likely often do another way. Instead of speaking a specific sentence, you can open the Weather app on your iPhone. You can open your task list and type “Pay the power bill.” You could search Google for a viola joke. Many of today’s bots are kind of a hipster façade around the same basic command line interfaces consumers abandoned in the 1980s. They require specific syntaxes and understand only a limited vocabulary—but they sure have personality! format /q /fs:fat /v:mydisk wasn’t nearly this funny back in the day. Yes, Taco Bell really did this. While the added convenience of language recognition is a benefit, until bots are capable of performing very complex and novel tasks that richly combine actions and context across the boundaries of apps and sites in unique ways the first time they are asked, we will be limited to trying to remember the 489 commands Siri recognizes. (Yes that link is a man page for Siri.) The rise of headless AI But I’m not down on bots. I’m just a lot more excited by the less-flashy flavor of AI that is changing the nature of work itself: headless AI. Headless AI is the application of artificial intelligence to vastly improve internal business processes. It is fully transforming the crucial machinery of business—processes like hiring, lead generation, financial modeling, and information security. Legacy software has become commodity in all of these areas, and purpose-built AI solutions will get a larger and larger wallet share of these huge enterprise cost centers. Headless AI combines machine intelligence and learning loops to constantly evolve. Because these solutions plug into the data lifeblood of a company, they become incredibly valuable as the algorithms adapt to the patterns that work. I call this form of AI “headless” because, unlike bots, the value is mostly not about the personality. Headless AI works with humans and augments their strengths; it doesn’t try to replace them. It gives people superpowers. While being able to talk to your CRM is cool, having a sales platform that accurately predicts the 100 opportunities you can close this quarter is worth breaking the bank for. Having a cute avatar answer your customer support chats seems nice enough, but predicting ahead of time what areas of your product will get support requests so that you can fix them before customers suffer is pure gold. It’s happening! (already) Though bots get all the glamour, headless AI is quietly happening everywhere already. These new platforms are generally purpose-built solutions optimized around specific domains and outcomes data. They learn not from people talking to them, but by voraciously chomping up all of the relevant proprietary data fed into them. The best systems employ learning loops and massive streams of incoming data to constantly improve. This creates a multiplier effect: the earlier and more pervasively an organization rolls out headless AI solutions, the more quickly the positive results compound. If you wait a year to deploy, you don’t just lose the year of improved productivity — you lose the year of learning and adaptation of the software to your company’s patterns. This puts you doubly behind. Companies like Apple, Expedia, and Johnson & Johnson use Textio’s augmented writing platform to chop weeks off the time it takes them to fill open jobs. DeepMind helped Google reduce power consumption in their data centers by 15%. A former NSA analyst created Area 1 Security to predict cyberattacks before they happen. These new headless AI companies, and dozens of others, are helping enterprises make radical productivity leaps today that they haven’t seen from software in decades. Headless AI is where the money is I’m not sure if there’s a revenue model that works for bots. I guess we will see. People are trying to figure that out. I’m thankful I don’t have to! What I do know is that there is a lot of money to be made in transforming the efficiency of core enterprise functions. This is what headless AI is all about. If you can improve a crucial business process in a decisive way by a clear and measurable amount, that is incredibly valuable. What is most game changing about this kind of software is that it is purely quantitative. Unlike a bot, where the potential return on investment is fairly qualitative (“customers liked interacting with the bot”), most headless AI is fully in the realm of predicting the future and then helping you change that future. Something where the return on investment is measurable and evident. Improving, in real life, the quantity, quality, and demographics of the people who walk through your front door with resumes in hand… how much is it worth to more quickly hire better people than your competition? If you can predict exactly who will buy what, when… how much could you improve your customer experience? Because this kind of software proves itself through the numbers, it is inherently valuable and easy to budget for. Headless is where the real AI money is. Headless AI everywhere In the near future, every core business function will have been transformed by AI—hiring, sales, security, marketing, finance, manufacturing… everything. Purpose-built headless AI platforms will provide the new infrastructure which will drive every business. The enterprises who are already on this train are getting an outsized advantage until everyone else catches up. Legacy software will get squeezed down into a smaller portion of the IT wallet as the most valuable services become the native AI platforms—just as form-based desktop software got squeezed out by the cloud in the last generation. Bots are here to stay. They’ll keep getting headlines. “OK Google, search for tacobot.” But the real enterprise revolution is happening in the companies who are using headless AI to transform their core businesses.

 There's a dark secret at the heart of artificial intelligence: no one really understands how it works Will Knight, MIT Technology Review Apr. 15, 2017, 12:46 PM 18,628 facebook linkedin twitter email print Keith Rankin Last year, a strange self-driving car was released onto the quiet roads of Monmouth County, New Jersey. The experimental vehicle, developed by researchers at the chip maker Nvidia, didn’t look different from other autonomous cars, but it was unlike anything demonstrated by Google, Tesla, or General Motors, and it showed the rising power of artificial intelligence. The car didn’t follow a single instruction provided by an engineer or programmer. Instead, it relied entirely on an algorithm that had taught itself to drive by watching a human do it. Getting a car to drive this way was an impressive feat. But it’s also a bit unsettling, since it isn’t completely clear how the car makes its decisions. Information from the vehicle’s sensors goes straight into a huge network of artificial neurons that process the data and then deliver the commands required to operate the steering wheel, the brakes, and other systems. The result seems to match the responses you’d expect from a human driver. But what if one day it did something unexpected—crashed into a tree, or sat at a green light? As things stand now, it might be difficult to find out why. The system is so complicated that even the engineers who designed it may struggle to isolate the reason for any single action. And you can’t ask it: there is no obvious way to design such a system so that it could always explain why it did what it did. The mysterious mind of this vehicle points to a looming issue with artificial intelligence. The car’s underlying AI technology, known as deep learning, has proved very powerful at solving problems in recent years, and it has been widely deployed for tasks like image captioning, voice recognition, and language translation. There is now hope that the same techniques will be able to diagnose deadly diseases, make million-dollar trading decisions, and do countless other things to transform whole industries. But this won’t happen—or shouldn’t happen—unless we find ways of making techniques like deep learning more understandable to their creators and accountable to their users. Otherwise it will be hard to predict when failures might occur—and it’s inevitable they will. That’s one reason Nvidia’s car is still experimental. Already, mathematical models are being used to help determine who makes parole, who’s approved for a loan, and who gets hired for a job. If you could get access to these mathematical models, it would be possible to understand their reasoning. But banks, the military, employers, and others are now turning their attention to more complex machine-learning approaches that could make automated decision-making altogether inscrutable. Deep learning, the most common of these approaches, represents a fundamentally different way to program computers. “It is a problem that is already relevant, and it’s going to be much more relevant in the future,” says Tommi Jaakkola, a professor at MIT who works on applications of machine learning. “Whether it’s an investment decision, a medical decision, or maybe a military decision, you don’t want to just rely on a ‘black box’ method.” There’s already an argument that being able to interrogate an AI system about how it reached its conclusions is a fundamental legal right. Starting in the summer of 2018, the European Union may require that companies be able to give users an explanation for decisions that automated systems reach. This might be impossible, even for systems that seem relatively simple on the surface, such as the apps and websites that use deep learning to serve ads or recommend songs. The computers that run those services have programmed themselves, and they have done it in ways we cannot understand. Even the engineers who build these apps cannot fully explain their behavior. This raises mind-boggling questions. As the technology advances, we might soon cross some threshold beyond which using AI requires a leap of faith. Sure, we humans can’t always truly explain our thought processes either—but we find ways to intuitively trust and gauge people. Will that also be possible with machines that think and make decisions differently from the way a human would? We’ve never before built machines that operate in ways their creators don’t understand. How well can we expect to communicate—and get along with—intelligent machines that could be unpredictable and inscrutable? These questions took me on a journey to the bleeding edge of research on AI algorithms, from Google to Apple and many places in between, including a meeting with one of the great philosophers of our time.  The artist Adam Ferriss created this image, and the one below, using Google Deep Dream, a program that adjusts an image to stimulate the pattern recognition capabilities of a deep neural network. The pictures were produced using a mid-level layer of the neural network. Adam Ferriss In 2015, a research group at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York was inspired to apply deep learning to the hospital’s vast database of patient records. This data set features hundreds of variables on patients, drawn from their test results, doctor visits, and so on. The resulting program, which the researchers named Deep Patient, was trained using data from about 700,000 individuals, and when tested on new records, it proved incredibly good at predicting disease. Without any expert instruction, Deep Patient had discovered patterns hidden in the hospital data that seemed to indicate when people were on the way to a wide range of ailments, including cancer of the liver. There are a lot of methods that are “pretty good” at predicting disease from a patient’s records, says Joel Dudley, who leads the Mount Sinai team. But, he adds, “this was just way better.” At the same time, Deep Patient is a bit puzzling. It appears to anticipate the onset of psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia surprisingly well. But since schizophrenia is notoriously difficult for physicians to predict, Dudley wondered how this was possible. He still doesn’t know. The new tool offers no clue as to how it does this. If something like Deep Patient is actually going to help doctors, it will ideally give them the rationale for its prediction, to reassure them that it is accurate and to justify, say, a change in the drugs someone is being prescribed. “We can build these models,” Dudley says ruefully, “but we don’t know how they work.” Artificial intelligence hasn’t always been this way. From the outset, there were two schools of thought regarding how understandable, or explainable, AI ought to be. Many thought it made the most sense to build machines that reasoned according to rules and logic, making their inner workings transparent to anyone who cared to examine some code. Others felt that intelligence would more easily emerge if machines took inspiration from biology, and learned by observing and experiencing. This meant turning computer programming on its head. Instead of a programmer writing the commands to solve a problem, the program generates its own algorithm based on example data and a desired output. The machine-learning techniques that would later evolve into today’s most powerful AI systems followed the latter path: the machine essentially programs itself. At first this approach was of limited practical use, and in the 1960s and ’70s it remained largely confined to the fringes of the field. Then the computerization of many industries and the emergence of large data sets renewed interest. That inspired the development of more powerful machine-learning techniques, especially new versions of one known as the artificial neural network. By the 1990s, neural networks could automatically digitize handwritten characters. But it was not until the start of this decade, after several clever tweaks and refinements, that very large—or “deep”—neural networks demonstrated dramatic improvements in automated perception. Deep learning is responsible for today’s explosion of AI. It has given computers extraordinary powers, like the ability to recognize spoken words almost as well as a person could, a skill too complex to code into the machine by hand. Deep learning has transformed computer vision and dramatically improved machine translation. It is now being used to guide all sorts of key decisions in medicine, finance, manufacturing—and beyond. Adam Ferriss The workings of any machine-learning technology are inherently more opaque, even to computer scientists, than a hand-coded system. This is not to say that all future AI techniques will be equally unknowable. But by its nature, deep learning is a particularly dark black box. You can’t just look inside a deep neural network to see how it works. A network’s reasoning is embedded in the behavior of thousands of simulated neurons, arranged into dozens or even hundreds of intricately interconnected layers. The neurons in the first layer each receive an input, like the intensity of a pixel in an image, and then perform a calculation before outputting a new signal. These outputs are fed, in a complex web, to the neurons in the next layer, and so on, until an overall output is produced. Plus, there is a process known as back-propagation that tweaks the calculations of individual neurons in a way that lets the network learn to produce a desired output. The many layers in a deep network enable it to recognize things at different levels of abstraction. In a system designed to recognize dogs, for instance, the lower layers recognize simple things like outlines or color; higher layers recognize more complex stuff like fur or eyes; and the topmost layer identifies it all as a dog. The same approach can be applied, roughly speaking, to other inputs that lead a machine to teach itself: the sounds that make up words in speech, the letters and words that create sentences in text, or the steering-wheel movements required for driving. Ingenious strategies have been used to try to capture and thus explain in more detail what’s happening in such systems. In 2015, researchers at Google modified a deep-learning-based image recognition algorithm so that instead of spotting objects in photos, it would generate or modify them. By effectively running the algorithm in reverse, they could discover the features the program uses to recognize, say, a bird or building. The resulting images, produced by a project known as Deep Dream, showed grotesque, alien-like animals emerging from clouds and plants, and hallucinatory pagodas blooming across forests and mountain ranges. The images proved that deep learning need not be entirely inscrutable; they revealed that the algorithms home in on familiar visual features like a bird’s beak or feathers. But the images also hinted at how different deep learning is from human perception, in that it might make something out of an artifact that we would know to ignore. Google researchers noted that when its algorithm generated images of a dumbbell, it also generated a human arm holding it. The machine had concluded that an arm was part of the thing. Further progress has been made using ideas borrowed from neuroscience and cognitive science. A team led by Jeff Clune, an assistant professor at the University of Wyoming, has employed the AI equivalent of optical illusions to test deep neural networks. In 2015, Clune’s group showed how certain images could fool such a network into perceiving things that aren’t there, because the images exploit the low-level patterns the system searches for. One of Clune’s collaborators, Jason Yosinski, also built a tool that acts like a probe stuck into a brain. His tool targets any neuron in the middle of the network and searches for the image that activates it the most. The images that turn up are abstract (imagine an impressionistic take on a flamingo or a school bus), highlighting the mysterious nature of the machine’s perceptual abilities. We need more than a glimpse of AI’s thinking, however, and there is no easy solution. It is the interplay of calculations inside a deep neural network that is crucial to higher-level pattern recognition and complex decision-making, but those calculations are a quagmire of mathematical functions and variables. “If you had a very small neural network, you might be able to understand it,” Jaakkola says. “But once it becomes very large, and it has thousands of units per layer and maybe hundreds of layers, then it becomes quite un-understandable.” In the office next to Jaakkola is Regina Barzilay, an MIT professor who is determined to apply machine learning to medicine. She was diagnosed with breast cancer a couple of years ago, at age 43. The diagnosis was shocking in itself, but Barzilay was also dismayed that cutting-edge statistical and machine-learning methods were not being used to help with oncological research or to guide patient treatment. She says AI has huge potential to revolutionize medicine, but realizing that potential will mean going beyond just medical records. She envisions using more of the raw data that she says is currently underutilized: “imaging data, pathology data, all this information.” After she finished cancer treatment last year, Barzilay and her students began working with doctors at Massachusetts General Hospital to develop a system capable of mining pathology reports to identify patients with specific clinical characteristics that researchers might want to study. However, Barzilay understood that the system would need to explain its reasoning. So, together with Jaakkola and a student, she added a step: the system extracts and highlights snippets of text that are representative of a pattern it has discovered. Barzilay and her students are also developing a deep-learning algorithm capable of finding early signs of breast cancer in mammogram images, and they aim to give this system some ability to explain its reasoning, too. “You really need to have a loop where the machine and the human collaborate,” Barzilay says. How well can we get along with machines that are unpredictable and inscrutable? The U.S. military is pouring billions into projects that will use machine learning to pilot vehicles and aircraft, identify targets, and help analysts sift through huge piles of intelligence data. Here more than anywhere else, even more than in medicine, there is little room for algorithmic mystery, and the Department of Defense has identified explainability as a key stumbling block. David Gunning, a program manager at the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency, is overseeing the aptly named Explainable Artificial Intelligence program. A silver-haired veteran of the agency who previously oversaw the DARPA project that eventually led to the creation of Siri, Gunning says automation is creeping into countless areas of the military. Intelligence analysts are testing machine learning as a way of identifying patterns in vast amounts of surveillance data. Many autonomous ground vehicles and aircraft are being developed and tested. But soldiers probably won’t feel comfortable in a robotic tank that doesn’t explain itself to them, and analysts will be reluctant to act on information without some reasoning. “It’s often the nature of these machine-learning systems that they produce a lot of false alarms, so an intel analyst really needs extra help to understand why a recommendation was made,” Gunning says. This March, DARPA chose 13 projects from academia and industry for funding under Gunning’s program. Some of them could build on work led by Carlos Guestrin, a professor at the University of Washington. He and his colleagues have developed a way for machine-learning systems to provide a rationale for their outputs. Essentially, under this method a computer automatically finds a few examples from a data set and serves them up in a short explanation. A system designed to classify an e-mail message as coming from a terrorist, for example, might use many millions of messages in its training and decision-making. But using the Washington team’s approach, it could highlight certain keywords found in a message. Guestrin’s group has also devised ways for image recognition systems to hint at their reasoning by highlighting the parts of an image that were most significant. One drawback to this approach and others like it, such as Barzilay’s, is that the explanations provided will always be simplified, meaning some vital information may be lost along the way. “We haven’t achieved the whole dream, which is where AI has a conversation with you, and it is able to explain,” says Guestrin. “We’re a long way from having truly interpretable AI.” It doesn’t have to be a high-stakes situation like cancer diagnosis or military maneuvers for this to become an issue. Knowing AI’s reasoning is also going to be crucial if the technology is to become a common and useful part of our daily lives. Tom Gruber, who leads the Siri team at Apple, says explainability is a key consideration for his team as it tries to make Siri a smarter and more capable virtual assistant. Gruber wouldn’t discuss specific plans for Siri’s future, but it’s easy to imagine that if you receive a restaurant recommendation from Siri, you’ll want to know what the reasoning was. Ruslan Salakhutdinov, director of AI research at Apple and an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University, sees explainability as the core of the evolving relationship between humans and intelligent machines. “It’s going to introduce trust,” he says. Just as many aspects of human behavior are impossible to explain in detail, perhaps it won’t be possible for AI to explain everything it does. “Even if somebody can give you a reasonable-sounding explanation [for his or her actions], it probably is incomplete, and the same could very well be true for AI,” says Clune, of the University of Wyoming. “It might just be part of the nature of intelligence that only part of it is exposed to rational explanation. Some of it is just instinctual, or subconscious, or inscrutable.” If that’s so, then at some stage we may have to simply trust AI’s judgment or do without using it. Likewise, that judgment will have to incorporate social intelligence. Just as society is built upon a contract of expected behavior, we will need to design AI systems to respect and fit with our social norms. If we are to create robot tanks and other killing machines, it is important that their decision-making be consistent with our ethical judgments. To probe these metaphysical concepts, I went to Tufts University to meet with Daniel Dennett, a renowned philosopher and cognitive scientist who studies consciousness and the mind. A chapter of Dennett’s latest book, From Bacteria to Bach and Back, an encyclopedic treatise on consciousness, suggests that a natural part of the evolution of intelligence itself is the creation of systems capable of performing tasks their creators do not know how to do. “The question is, what accommodations do we have to make to do this wisely—what standards do we demand of them, and of ourselves?” he tells me in his cluttered office on the university’s idyllic campus. He also has a word of warning about the quest for explainability. “I think by all means if we’re going to use these things and rely on them, then let’s get as firm a grip on how and why they’re giving us the answers as possible,” he says. But since there may be no perfect answer, we should be as cautious of AI explanations as we are of each other’s—no matter how clever a machine seems. “If it can’t do better than us at explaining what it’s doing,” he says, “then don’t trust it.” Read the original article on MIT Technology Review.

AFP 16 April 2017 - 06:57 print comments A recent survey found that 20% of American consumers are dissatisfied with their pay TV service, leaving the market ripe for change © (AFP) For years, US cable operators got rich by offering fat "bundles" of hundreds of channels and raising prices regularly for television consumers. Now the "skinny bundle" is disrupting that model with internet-delivered packages offering live and on-demand programs. Google's YouTube TV is the latest to enter this market with its bundle of around 40 channels for $35 monthly, challenging slim packages from Sony's PlayStation Vue, Dish Network's Sling TV and AT&T's DirecTV Now. More entrants are expected including one from streaming service Hulu. These services offer easy interfaces like those of on-demand services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, let viewers digitally store programs in the internet "cloud," and toss in a limited selection of live channels to sate news and sports or other interests. Skinny offerings are aimed at young viewers and "cord cutters" loath to pay $100 or more to be force-fed hundreds of channels in hefty bundles and accustomed to streaming shows they want, when they desire. A Parks Associates survey last month found 20 percent of American consumers dissatisfied with their pay TV service, leaving the market ripe for change. Analyst Glenn Hower at Parks said the market is in flux, with some consumers taking advantage of the easy sign-up for skinny packages, even though some cancel just as quickly. In addition to lower prices, he said, "you don't have to worry about sending out a technician, you don't have to worry about getting the equipment back." BTIG Research analyst Richard Greenfield, in a research note titled "the big bundle is doomed," says he expects skinny bundles to eat away at the established pay-TV providers. Established media companies are focusing too hard on "protecting their legacy business model" instead of giving consumers the flexibility they want, Greenfield wrote this month. Leichtman Research Group found that the top US cable companies lost 277,000 subscribers in 2016, while internet-delivered services like Sling TV and DirecTV Now added about 845,000. These shifts could lead to a huge upheaval in the television ecosystem, allowing more choices and lower costs for consumers in many cases, while leaving smaller, independent cable channels out in the cold. The skinny bundles "have made inroads in the past year," said Leichtman Research president Bruce Leichtman. Digital platforms rise Forrester Research analyst James McQuivey said Google's entry into the business is significant because "for the first time, the broadcasters are letting a powerful digital platform have the keys to its treasure room: live, first-run TV shows." He noted that major tech firms like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft "have tried to cozy up to TV for many years now, and all of them have been rebuffed" until now. "The digital platforms are indeed taking over the world, this time with permission from their former adversaries," he said in a blog post. While many consumers use on-demand options like Amazon and Netflix, they often keep cable or satellite subscriptions for live sports and local news. But live channels will make streaming options more attractive. At the same time, popular channels such as HBO and sports programmer ESPN have been offering standalone subscriptions to allow consumers to watch without a bundle from cable or satellite. But independent television analyst Alan Wolk argues that the major pay TV firms remain in good shape despite these challenges. Some like AT&T already have a "skinny" offering, and others such as Comcast and Verizon are expected to enter the market to give consumers a choice. Wolk said consumers don't appear to be flocking to skinny bundles because "they pay 30 percent less dollars but get 70 percent less content." He added that "a lot of people think they want to cut back but when you ask them which channels they want to eliminate they have trouble cutting back to the bare minimum." Striking back Wolk noted that the large pay TV operators have an advantage because they offer broadband internet, and in some cases are the dominant provider in a region. This allows them to offer incentives which bundle internet and television. The large operators can also squeeze out rivals by using data caps or other means to favor their own streaming service, and will not likely face regulatory impediments from doing so in the current political environment, he said. Operators are also keeping customers with "TV everywhere" which allows subscribers to watch the same content on mobile devices or while traveling, he noted. One impact from the shift to streaming is that providers will know more about customer habits, to be able to deliver advertising targeted to each user. That's positive for marketing, but could be a privacy worry as tech firms build up detailed profiles on consumers. Google in particular can refine its ad model by using data on viewing habits, analysts note. With streaming, Wolk said, Google and others "get a ton of data about users and what they are up to, and they can cross-reference that with your browsing habits."

April 14th 2017 2 days ago /video/video.news.com.au/News/ Despite marketing like this, Calvin Klein is uncool (according to teens). Picture: Calvin Klein/Facebook Jason Murphynews.com.au@jasemurphy Share Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share on Google+ Share on Reddit Email a friend TEENAGERS are so hard to understand. A huge new survey of what teens think is cool is only adding to the confusion. Apparently, teens think Red Bull is less cool than Costco? That Sony is less cool than Microsoft? That Levis’ are less cool than HP? It’s like they’re deliberately trying to troll their parents’ generation. The survey — run by Google — is full of weird comparisons like this. The following chart shows all the brands, from dorky on the left to cool on the right. The vertical axis shows how well known the brands are. It’s hard to see, but the coolest and most well known brands are Youtube, Netflix and Google, while among the least cool are TMZ, The Wall Street Journal and Yahoo.Source:Supplied If you look closely, you will notice a few things that are seriously suspicious. Do today’s youth really worship Google so much? The survey asks the kids (aged 13-17) to rank 122 brands by how cool they are. And Google-owned brands come out with curiously high rankings. The coolest thing in the whole world, according to Google’s survey, is YouTube: owned by Google. Third coolest is Google itself, while Google Android, the phone operating system, and Nest, Google’s smart thermostat company, both take home decent scores. Something is screwy there. We should probably ignore the Google effect, and when we do, we see patterns that actually make sense. I HATE YOU MUM AND DAD! The worst thing a brand can be is something your parents are into. Case in point: Facebook. Teens pretty much hate Facebook. It shows up in the survey, where, sure, Facebook is something they’ve heard of, but it scores awfully. The problem for 13-to-17 year olds is their parents are on Facebook, and it is cramping their style. Facebook messenger scores even worse with the kids, and I imagine that’s because they associate it mainly with messages that look something like this: Mum: Reminder: come straight home from school today because you have to do your homework. Luv u, x. Teens’ playgrounds are Snapchat and Instagram instead of Facebook, but the complaints are beginning as parents converge on Instagram too. Both of my parents follow me on Instagram. I've now lost two platforms. Twitter is my last bastion of free speech. Dicks— Brennen Spangler (@BrennenSpanglr) April 10, 2017 Both of my parents are on Instagram now so I guess it's time I just throw my phone in a lake.— Hunter (@hunter3124) April 1, 2017 (This could actually be a good explanation for the seemingly crazy popularity of YouTube and Netflix — they are something teens can engage with away from prying eyes.) The daggiest brand in the whole survey is the Wall Street Journal. I personally love the Wall Street Journal, but I understand it is not cool (and also that I am not cool) so its low score gives the whole thing credibility. What’s less expected is that the media brand Vice does so badly. You may have noticed the new SBS channel called Viceland. That’s the same Vice that the teens say is dorky in the survey. It’s a weird result given how much effort Vice is putting in to be edgy. It’s a bit of a mystery and there is definitely some skew in the results where well-known brands also seem to be scoring as cooler than less well-known ones. WHY SHOULD WE CARE WHAT THESE PIMPLY INFANTS THINK ANYWAY? I personally hate the idea that we need to find out what pathetic ideas are swimming round in the jelly brains of these fat and spoiled American children, but the reality is the little morons matter. American teenagers are one of the driving forces of the world economy. If you want to know what brands and companies are going to be big you need to tune your antenna to what they like. Soft drink brands and blue jeans, rock music and skateboarding — so much of what we call popular culture got its start with teens before crossing over to the mainstream. So if you’re trying to invest, or make choices about what to study or where to work, you’ll do better if you keep an eye on the things American teens think are cool. What teens think is cool. Blue for boys, pink for girls.Source:Supplied Jason Murphy is an economist. He publishes the blog Thomas The Thinkengine.

Now that Pixel 2 is under works, we think it’s safe to say that Google is looking to part ways with the Nexus brand. However, this shouldn’t come as a surprise to anyone since Google has showed interested to pursue its own path in the smartphone industry for a while now. As everyone knows, Nexus smartphones have been created in collaboration with other companies and they don’t exactly represent “pure” Google devices. Nokia Smartphones On the bright side though, it looks like Nokia’s smartphones are just the right candidates to replace the Nexus lineup. The Finnish manufacturer decided to make a comeback into the smartphone world this year under the stewardship of HMD Global. Fortunately, Nokia’s comeback has been well received by tech fans. In fact, retailers have been having problems keeping up the supply of Nokia smartphones since they sell so well. Android OS The reason why Nokia smartphones are the perfect candidates to replace Google’s older Nexus smartphones is because all of them run on stock Android OS. In addition, Per Ekman who is HMD Global’s Vice President has announced that Nokia smartphones are always going to be kept up to date with all of Google’s updates. In fact, Per Ekman stated the following “We and Google will jointly enhance the Nokia brand to put the right kind of inputs into the phone, including Google Assistant”. At the moment, customers can purchase Nokia 3, 5 and 6, but we can be sure that Nokia’s smartphone range is going to increase along the way. Considering that Nokia’s brand name is worldwide recognizable and that Google benefits from the same global recognition as well, we can be sure that all of Nokia’s upcoming smartphones are going to be successful. Premium Hardware Last but not least, the Finnish manufacturer has also equipped its smartphones with the latest hardware parts and not just software updates. For example, Nokia 6 and Nokia 5 are powered by the same Qualcomm octa-core Snapdragon processor that’s been clocked at 1.4GHz and an Adreno 505 graphics processing unit.

The new update came along with several bug fixes and improvements. A new report suggests that the company plans on bringing a desktop client to the app soon. Several weeks back, Google’s VP of Communications Products, Nick Fox released a teaser, suggesting the arrival of web client for Allo. According to 9to5Google, just like WhatsApp, Allo’s latest version has options for pairing the smartphone with the web client by simply scanning the QR code. Moreover, users can also use the text code method to pair the device. Unfortunately, there are a few limitations to the new addition. For instance, the device requires to be in vicinity when users are setting it up with the desktop. Plus, data connection should be present on both devices in order to connect.

What once was broken now is fixed: call recording in Google Voice works again Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/15 5:56pm PDTApr 15, 2017 19 Plus 1 on G+ 60 Share on Facebook 49 Share on Twitter Total Shares128 Applications Google News Shortly after bringing it back from the dead, it would appear that Google may have inadvertently broken call recording for a short period. For the last two weeks there have been multiple different user reports of problems with recording calls in Google Voice. Thankfully, the issue appears to have been resolved and recording is now working as intended. While there is not yet any word about the status of recordings presumed lost during this period, all new recordings should behave as expected and appear in your Google Voice inbox. The precise cause of the original problem isn't known. We've reached out to Google for more information. In the meantime Google hasn't made any statements about the matter outside the responses on the forum, so in lieu of an official statement all we can provide is the response given to posts on the subject: Thank you for reporting the issue you had with call recordings. We believe that we have resolved the issue and new call recordings should work as expected. Our engineering team is continuing to investigate the recordings that took place during the time period affected. We will update this thread once we have an update to provide. Thanks for your patience! If you believe you may have been affected, you can check if any of your recordings made during that time are present. If you don't find them in your Google Voice inbox double check by opening the overflow menu on the left, open "Legacy Google Voice," hover over More and select Recorded calls. Recordings should appear there, and if any are missing from the last two weeks you may be among those who have experienced the issue. For those users that might have made recordings while things were broken, it looks like Google is still looking into things and plans on updating the relevant threads later. If we hear anything more on the subject or if we get a statement we'll be sure to update this post.

Kevin Davis Hell yes, awesome picture. Vivek Rameses Screw the article, that's a great picture. I like the new guy. Doby Gillis Most retards do. Techsoul It'd be better if they fixed the bug that doesn't allow you to get a new number at all. Mark Sentesy More important to me is that the new app usually claims the phone has no network connection, when it clearly does. This makes it unusable. So I use an old apk, which works perfectly fine. Latheryin With all the different laws around people need to be careful with call recording. Have to make sure you are aware of the laws for each and every state. Other wise might end up on the bad end of a court case. vwnut13 Google Voice announces to both parties that the call is being recorded. Latheryin Which doesn't mean anything in states where is not allowed at all. Never did understand it personally. If you can't remember what was said on a phone call then it is either not that important or your memory just sucks and you have bigger issues. MG Which doesn't mean anything since all states allow call recording, some just require that all parties involved be notified. Call recording has far more use cases than simply jotting down notes Latheryin Not all states do. The one I live in just made it illegal again to record personal calls. I'm sure for some it does. Can't think of any reason myself but for those with bad memories I can see where it would help. vwnut13 And which state would that be? Latheryin Alaska. IT was voted on last week along with a bunch of other privacy laws. You know things like where you can and cant fly a drone, recording people while they are out at events. You know things like that.

Some Pixel and Nexus fingerprint sensors not working after Android 7.1.2 update Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 12:17pm PDTApr 14, 2017 65 Plus 1 on G+ 79 Share on Facebook 73 Share on Twitter Total Shares217 Bug Watch Device Updates News Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel XL A number of Google Pixel and Nexus users are reporting that their fingerprint sensor is no longer working after the latest Android OS update. Several members of the Pixel and Nexus communities on Google's product forums have encountered the issue since installing the Android Nougat 7.1.2 OTA. The issue appears to be affecting both the Pixel and Pixel XL, as well as the LG-made Nexus 5X and Huawei Nexus 6P. Reports suggest that while the Pixel and Nexus Imprint sensors are no longer granting access to the devices, the swipe down for notifications Moves gesture is still functional. Attempts to solve the problem by deleting pre-existing fingerprints and starting from scratch haven't worked, as error messages are preventing new prints from being added to the devices. As usual, we'll update if we hear any official word from Google about the issue, hopefully regarding a fix.

Good_Ole_Pinocchio 6p has never given me those issues either... But it is slower than most newer scanners. Nick Which is to be expected. It's still fine. Jeff Neston By stating no problems, expect to get boot loop on your nexus 6. See the CNET article on nexus 5 and 6. Provided Google does not get the article defeated. If you do get it expect to lose all unsaved data. Then if want refund you will need to go to court. Sean Please GO AWAY....you have said this TWICE.......Its NOT the Nexus 5 and 6 Mr Brainiac....its the 5X and 6P......which are TOTALLY different than the Nexus 5 and Nexus 6. Max Same here with my XL. elav Me too. No issues on my XL.. Nicholas Matranga My Nexus 5x works just fine after the update. kalehv Sometimes my Pixel XL asks for pattern even after it recognizes my fingerprint (no, I am not talking about the first time after reboot). Rebooting the device works but why does this happen? Nathan Bryant I've also experienced this. It's random. Not so often it's a bother for me. kalehv Yup not so often with me either but being a mobile developer what bothers me is this happening, not the inconvenience it causes. Nathan Bryant That totally makes sense. I assume it's some kind of error even though it's not stating that it is. I don't see the pattern or constant of what causes it when it happens. mattcoz It does that after more than 48 hours have passed since you've last used your pattern. kalehv Nop its not that either. It does that after 4 hours I think. And it should do that only once after 4 hours but not keep doing that until you reboot. mattcoz It's definitely 48 hours, that comes straight from Google. But if it continues to do so, then that's something else. Mgamerz I've had it happen on my Nexus, it just occasionally requires a PIN. Says it's 4 hours of non usage but that doesn't seem true, sometimes I wake up and no pin and sometimes I'll be on and off the phone and it'll require a pin. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Typical. Google needs to fire some of their geniuses and hire some diligent coders, and also diligent testers for their QA department (assuming they even have one -- I sincerely doubt it). Alex Cruz Where did Google touch you? Middlefinger Oh really. Nexus/Pixel/Google error 4.453.563 this year alone. Im shocked (not really). Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Best hot steaming pile of dog s**t 2016. DragoCubed Google has been going downhill lately - at least with mobile excluding iOS. It's such a shame. They haven't exactly gone downhill haven't they? They've stayed the same SpeakethTheTruth I think you might be on to something with that last paragraph. Cause for real, quality control is out of control right now. sebastianer If fixed my 6P bad battery life and early shutdown only replacing the stock Huawei battery with other battery with different brand (no need to wipe the phone in the process...) Several people did the same and is enjoying the battery life they were having when they bought the phone more than a year ago: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3534410 You could even try a Huawei battery replacement...but they say they aren't original. I just went for another brand because of the bad experience I had with the stock battery durability I don't know in the Pixel. But in the 6P in 90% of the cases...this is just a problem of the Huawei stock battery. Kendall Gustafson “Pixel”, the word sounds like the color pink. “Pixel” sounds like a little girl’s toy. Most men would never put a phone in their pocket named “Pixel” unless they were a cross/dresser. The word “Pixel” equates to a 50% loss of market share from the male market. “Nexus”, the word does not sound female or male. “Nexus”, the word sounds like science, desirable to any man, woman, or child. “Nexus”, the word sound like domination of market share. kalehv Hahaha that made me laugh. No I do not agree. I am a Pixel owner man and I am not whatever you said they'd be if they owned one but I laughed for some reason. Christian Trevor Clauss I must be a cross dresser then :D mattcoz Real men aren't insecure about what their phones are named. Middlefinger Except that the Nexus sold poorly and was generally complete junk Van_Hammersly Most of us have exited adolescence. bonelesscheese https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9bd2ce0665c300ab872edc5e5fa1ef348b87f551cc01532d17bf41264dd126c1.jpg DragoCubed I'm so glad that you can block on disqus Bruce Wayne Google is really dropping the ball.

Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google: "It compiled with warnings but no errors. Must be ready to go." Bruce Wayne Nothing about Google or Android came up. What are you getting at? Middlefinger This isnt device specific, its a fault in Android itself. Google has become really bad lately with poor quality control. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Even Chrome is going to the dogs.

No need to test or anything. Too much trouble for the geniuses at Google. They're so smart that if it compiles with just warnings, there couldn't possibly be any problems. John Doe I am sure that they do test it but there are things that go wrong...obviously those bugs will be in the spotlight on an Android blog meaning in real life they are probably affecting a small number of users.

It blows my mind been on 7.1.2 sense the factory imgs dropped Sean Same for me.....my Pixel XL hasnt had a single reported issue so far.........

I thought it was the massive amount of Utah dust in my fingers all of a sudden, but I guess not Defenestratus There's that vaunted Google QA again. This is how you get more Samsung. New_Guy Yep Mark Curtis What do you mean "this is how you get more Samsung"? 4Ui812 Why is Google having app many issues with the Fixel ? Sruly J Except since it's also affecting Nexus devices, this is more of a software issue in 7.1.2 than a hardware issue for Pixel devices. Defenestratus Because IIRC they use Agile software development. Agile is how you get shitty software. Lawstorant I've never thought I would say such thing, but I'm getting fed up with all the "issues" Google is facing with every update. On the Nexus 6, they went as far as to roll it back to 7.0. They should really step up their game especially if, they are fully responsible for every aspect of the device from now on. EvilHowl No issues on my 5X wade_county I thought these Pixels weren't supposed to be beta products? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They aren't. They're outrageously expensive alpha products. And they even have one defect (halo-cam) that can't be fixed in software. Still the best steaming pile of dog s**t of 2016, though. Everyone should buy one. Everyone who likes dog s**t anyway. Apparently people do, since HTC has shipped 2 million since launch. Kougeru I bad a Pixel for a week and took dozens of photos with no halo Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good for you. Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of 22 Pixel pictures had halos. None of the 22 G6 pictures had halos. They were all pictures of the same things, obviously with the same lighting. Google admits it's a design defect. If Google admits it, it's kind of hard to pretend it doesn't exist. whispy_snippet No one denies it's an issue. But what you seem incapable of accepting is it's a very minor issue that only very rarely rears its head. If you actively try to shoot an image with a strong light source angled towards the sensor (something you generally don't do because it often results in a poor shot on any camera) you might experience a halo effect. Might. But I've got literally hundreds of photos taken with my Pixel with no halos. You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want to fuel your juvenile rage fits. But people who actually use a Pixel every day don't seem to have a problem worth caring about. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It has nothing to do with a strong light source angled toward the sensor. That's normal lens flare. The Pixel halos are NOT normal lens flare. Like I said 4 out of 22 pictures. That's 18% of the pictures they took, and they didn't have strong light sources angled toward the sensor. 18% is not a rare problem, especially when the G6 NEVER had halos with the same exact pictures. Google admitted it's a flaw. Get over yourself and stop trying to justify it. whispy_snippet And like I said, I've taken hundreds of pictures and have seen a halo perhaps a couple of times. And I take a lot of photos given video and photography is my day job - indeed one of the reasons I chose the Pixel is because I wanted the best phone camera available for the times I don't have my proper gear with me. I've seen countless comparisons between the Pixel, iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 edge and while they're all great, in most situations the Pixel takes what I consider the better shot. You're making mountains out of molehills and carrying on like a right twat in the process. P. Sherman ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE DOESN'T MEAN JACKS--- if in scientific tests under controlled environments and the same conditions, the Pixel produced the halo effect, which Google has acknowledged to be a design deficiency standard on LITERALLY EVERY PIXEL MADE, but other cameras feature no such halo effect. FFS whispy_snippet I'm not denying there's an issue! I'm saying it's being blown out of proportion by people who want to blow it out of proportion. P. Sherman Referencing a scientific, controlled test and camera comparison is NOT blowing this out of proportion. Blowing out of proportion would be something how the Wall Street Journal set out to destroy PewDiePie for boneheadedly saying "Death to all Jews" as a joke. But referencing a camera comparison in exactly the same conditions and one phone had a halo effect but the other didn't is science, fact, nothing to blow out of proportion there. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good luck arguing with a Google fanboy in deep denial. thereasoner He's actually making solid points, the Pixels do have the best cameras overall​ and all smartphone cameras have some issues. whispy_snippet No, no. I'm a fanboy! Get it right! Cecil Hardwood Are you sure the Pixel has the best camera ? The reason I ask is because the DxOMark site that claims this refuses to release the iPhone 7 Plus (Not iPhone 7) scores and many believe it is because it scored higher than the Pixel. The theory goes on to say that Google is using their score in their advertising and DxO doesn't want to piss off Google. Something weird is going on for sure. DxO claimed long ago the review was coming soon and should have been out by now with the iPhone 7 Plus having been on the market as long as it has. thereasoner If I'm to make a judgment personally then I would say that probably the top 3-4 cameras on flagships are very close and what's best as far as the user is concerned is subjective. Do you prefer low light performance(I do) or digital zoom? Do your favour widespread angle lens or fast launch/focus etc. Those are personal preferences that make "the best " phone different for different people. That said, as far as reviews are concerned the Pixel is generally considered the best over all. As far as your conspiracy theories go, who knows? Anyone can create those about anything but I guess but I'm thinking that other than digital zoom and an artsy photo effect the 7+ cameras are very similar to the 7. whispy_snippet The iPhone 7 Plus is the same as the iPhone 7 apart from an additional, slower lens. In terms of raw image quality the iPhone 7 Plus achieves its best results with the lens it shares with its smaller sibling. So basically, it'll score no better than the 7. It's effectively already been tested. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All smartphone cameras have some issues? What issues does the G6 camera have in the comparison I linked? 23% of the Pixel photos have halo issues. Find a serious issue with 23% of the G6 photos and get back to us. thereasoner Keep in mind that if you take wide-angle shots, angles will be distorted and elongated from the side, especially when it comes to selfies with the front-facing camera. I also found that the front-facing camera takes relatively muddy shots in low-light. Compared to the Pixel XL, OnePlus 3T and (for the time being since we don't have the S8) the Galaxy S7, the G6 is on par with its rivals. The Pixel XL takes superior low-light images than all the phones though, and I prefer the richer contrast and saturation of the S7 by just a tad. -CNET There are a ton of reviews from various sources just like this and while the G6 cameras are considered very nice they do have their shortcomings and generally rank below the Pixel cameras overall. whispy_snippet Purple flaring and chromatic aberation. It's extremely noticeable in at least four images you shared with the Pixel comparison. Here you are: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration And just Google search purple flaring. Sorry to burst your bubble. whispy_snippet Show me the link to the test. I would like to see it. Even if their results suggest there's an issue (which there is as we all agree), the significance of the results can still be blown out of proportion which is what we're seeing occur in this ridiculous discussion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Here you go again. phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ Now that I've viewed the pics again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. Two involve a bright light. The other 3 do not. So that's 23% of 22 pictures. I wouldn't say that's blowing things out of proportion. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. Yeah, you paid a lot for your Pixel, so you have a hard time admitting it's a steaming pile of dog s**t. I understand. whispy_snippet Yep, so as we've agreed, halos sometimes appear in shots with strong light sources pointing at or angled towards the edge of the sensor. But let's just ignore the purple flaring and chromatic aberation in at least four of the images from the LG, right? You're demonstrating selective criticism. Every camera has strengths and weaknesses but on balance, the Pixel offers better images than competing phones more often than not. My position is unchanged. You're both making mountains out of molehills, and in no way does this "scientific" test guarantee that 23% of photos taken with a Pixel will exhibit a halo. It simply shows 23% of photos taken in this example demonstrated halos. You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. No one ever said the Pixel is perfect. But only you two are using ridiculous, extreme labels like "steaming pile of dog shit" and "HARDWARE DEFICIENCY" as though using capital letters makes your odd ball assertions more valid. Most reputable tech reviewers agree the Pixel has the best overall smartphone camera. You're entitled to disagree. P. Sherman 4/22. 4/22 photos from the Pixel have a halo effect. That's from Phandroid. That's 18% of photos the Pixel. That alone is damning. Google themselves have acknowledged that it is a HARDWARE DEFICIENCY and software fixes have done little to address this. They admitted it was there, that's all we need. If you knew that 4/22 Burritos Chipotle made would give you the Runs, but ZERO/22 Burritos Taco Bell made would, would YOU still choose to eat at Chipotle? whispy_snippet Show me the test! I've asked twice now. P. Sherman Lena Flare was removed from the photos, but not the video. http://highonandroid.com/android-smartphone-news/the-truth-about-google-pixel-camera-halolens-flare-effect/ Also, someone in the official Google forums shot with their Pixel and Nexus 6P in the same Time, conditions, everything. Guess what? https://support.google.com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsrROqMaXHqHg/?hl=by Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ 3 halos are obvious, 1 is subtle. The subtle one is where the picture is looking up at a building's windows. Now that I've viewed them again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. tigerstown I paid $380 for my new pixel XL so it's not a lot and I have no Halo in my pics I have proven this on Twitter already. abc More fanboy logic. I took pictures so everything is fine. Anyone who says its not fine is crazy. whispy_snippet How ridiculous. So a blogger takes 22 photos in various conditions and his experience is valid, but my experience of owning the phone and taking hundreds of photos in various conditions is not valid. You guys are weirdos. Andy But do you see problems with low light pics. I do on my wife's pixel. IPhone Looks so much better. I'm so disappointed abc I saw a rainbow once. Oh, are we not just conveying pointless ancedotes? mr.fozzo On my Nex6P, I have noticed that the Fingerprint reader has been less reliable lately. It requires more presses than the usual 1 press. Besnik Rrustemi My Nexus 6P working excellent so far, no battery problems, no fingerprint problems (better standby times on 7.1.2 to be honest). But yes,i can agree that fingerprint was much faster when i first got the device on 6.0 Marshmallow (for unlocking the device with the fingerprint) now it takes like 2 full seconds for that :( jimv1983 No issues on my Nexus 5X and the swipe on the sensor to bring down the notification panel is great. Alex Harrison Flashed the OTA myself on my 5X. No issues with it. Jeff Neston At least it is just the sensor. My nexus 5 was bricked by a Google update.. it got the boot loop. Google support lied to me claiming I broke the power button. False it was not broken. I ended up going small claims case against Google. They settled, but wanted me to sign gag order. Sorry, no way. I sent it back and got complete refund. Sneaky company. What probably causes boot loop update to occur is phone on long time. Some apps get memory leak over time. System then unpredictably unstable. Then the system does auto uplate from Google without asking user NOR even rebooting or turning off prior to the update. Then during update, Os gets corrupted. Then after failed update phone reboots thinking the. Update completed. Now phones dead. And Google not bother to address the issue. Pdiddy187 My 5x fingerprint sensor was great until it bootlooped yesterday morning. LG is going to repair it under warranty even though it's well out of warranty. La Kiesha Rodriguez Barrientes I have the ZTE axon 7 and over a month now google hasn't addressed a fix for the play store not loading apps over data or Wi-Fi.. Without uninstalling updates to play store and then maybe will not say "waiting for network" so frustrating and then maybe download once and have to do that everytime.. Dumb.. P. Sherman That's been like that since KitKat. F------ KITKAT. ahnafm Is google reacommodating their customers now? Brett Delia I thought some positive feedback was worth being added. My Nexus 6P is working perfectly after the update. I've had generally a great experience with all my Android phones. I've had an iPhone as well as a Windows mobile phone as well in my past. None have been as feature packed as my Android devices. New_Guy This and all the other ridiculous issues with the Pixel is a big reason I stick with Samsung... flyonthewall Lol Fernando S Mine is working ok in my Nexus 5x running 7.1.2. It just failed once while I was on 7.1.1 and with a soft reset it came back to life Hank Is that a real screenshot in the story? Enrollment spelled wrong twice. SMH. ThisGuyFUX This is now icing on top of the cake, for anyone whom has enjoyed watching this crash and burn. If I paid $850+ for a Pixel, I'd be pursuing class action litigation by now. Slow clap. Sean Except its only affecting about 1% of the Pixels sold.........so......slow clap for you....... 2kool4skool It's gonna be sucks when you're in the 1%. And I doubt it's 1% anyway, this is probably the 20th article I've read about pixel's problems. That's alot. Probably more like 5%. abc Fortunately, not many Pixels have been sold so not many people are affected. Brian White Nexus 5x, running fine here ddevito If it wasn't for my OnePlus 3 I'd be on an iPhone. thereasoner One plus has their own issues/lousy support and the iPhone? They're the worst of them all when it comes to buggy software and hardware issues bricking devices ! ddevito Not sure I'd agree with you. My iPhone 6s hums along swimmingly without any issues. The more I use it the more I am leaning towards going back to an iPhone full-time. Apple, love them or hate them, knows how to deliver products, and support them. Period. thereasoner I'm glad that your iPhone 6s isn't affected by the many flawed updates and hardware issues​ that have plagued various iPhones over the years but the fact remains that Apple has faced class action lawsuits filed by their own customers for serious issues like Touch Disease and error 53 and for good reason. They have the worst track record of them all and to make things worse they're known for both ignoring iPhone issues until said class action lawsuits are launched and/or blaming their customers for the iPhone hardware/software problems. BTW, my Pixel "hums along swimmingly" as well, that doesn't mean issues with the Pixel don't exist much less those far more serious issues found on iPhones ! MisterKraky I'm not having the fingerprint sensor issue myself, but after updating to 7.1.2, I can no longer install or update any apps! On a Verizon-issued Pixel here. Đức Thành What happened to all the testing, Google? It seems they have become too reliant on using Nexus users for beta-testing and now can't seem to do a proper job on their own. Get your grips together, Android team. Rob H. Nougat is such a half baked disaster of an OS. It's ruined my N6. Marshmallow was soon much more stable.

I've called Google Fi for support and they were NO help other than trying to sell me an "upgrade" to the Pixel and FULL price?!? They also said that they haven't had harly any other complaints with this issue. Thanks for nothing Google! I've did a soft rest then a complete reset with no luck.

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 125 Plus 1 on G+ 278 Share on Facebook 78 Share on Twitter Total Shares481 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 141k 106k Latest Deals 14 [Deal Alert] Get a 75" Sony LED UHD Android TV from Best Buy for $2150 today ($650 off) 2017/04/15 4:13pm PDTApr 15, 2017 19 [Deal Alert] Huawei Watch in Black Stainless Steel w/metal band $250 ($100 off) 2017/04/14 6:36pm PDTApr 14, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] 55 temporarily free and on-sale apps to round out your week 2017/04/14 12:50pm PDTApr 14, 2017 13 [Deal Alert] 2-Pack 6' Anker USB 3.0 A to C cables $12 w/ promo ($8 off) 2017/04/13 4:16pm PDTApr 13, 2017 32 [Deal Alert] NVIDIA is having a SHIELD gaming spring sale 2017/04/13 2:17pm PDTApr 13, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?

Setting my Google Play Music library aside, I suffered through using Amazon’s attempt at a music service devoid of most of my own library. I connected my Google Calendar to Alexa and it offered a glimpse into my future relationship with Google’s assistant. Finally, in early November, I could get my hands on a new Google Home. I had pre-ordered from Google and then discovered I could pick one up at my local Best Buy. The very morning it hit the shelves, I immediately bought one. I brought it home, set it up in the family room and eagerly asked – “OK Google, play my morning hits playlist.” Without skipping a beat, she announced the list and the room filled with my music. The key point here – it was music from MY library. I didn’t cancel that Google pre-order. It was on its way. I figured I could listen to music in my bedroom as well. But – what about the other rooms in my house? What about the smart lights, smart switches, clever irrigation controller, and intelligent thermostat scattered throughout? I need a Google Home in every room to live the dream of a voice controlled home! I bought four more. My home is outfitted with six Google Home devices. There’s one in every room. I can control my smart home with my voice from anywhere I stand. I can spread music into any room. I can turn on, dim, and turn off lights in various rooms with just my voice. It’s as close as I can get to living on the Enterprise. Google's vision of the future with Google Home. Well, one Home. That’s the dream. Unfortunately, it isn’t a reality (yet). Google has failed at a key feature that it so proudly spoke of that morning in May. The nice lady living inside each Home is often unable to tell if you are talking to her or her sister in the neighboring room. It can result in some frustrating, sometimes comical, exchanges. It is amazing how well the little air freshener shaped unit can hear you from several rooms away. With multiple Homes, you’ll find yourself making requests and getting responses from two of them. It usually involves one of them, not necessarily the one closest to you, executing the request and the other apologizing to you that it can’t. From my bedroom in the morning, I might ask how long it will take to get to work and hear the detailed response in the distance from the kitchen. There will be times when the Home in front of me fulfills my request and another will rattle off from down the hall. You also have the ghosts. I never thought my home might be haunted - until now. There will be times when I turn off the TV, hang up on a call, or just walk out of the bathroom and hear something in another room. I’ll find a Google Home playing music or a podcast that I don’t listen to in a randomly selected room. Who asked to listen to opera at low volume in the guest room? Ghosts. There isn’t a constant circus of home assistants chiming in from all over the house. The closest Home does respond properly more than half of the time. However, I have found myself at times leaning over and almost whispering to a Google Home when I want to be sure the others don’t hear. There is talk of multiuser support coming soon, but it remains to be seen if this will improve its ability to identify which Home I am talking to. For now, I must look like a fool. I am whispering to an air freshener because I don’t want the others to hear. Creepy? Maybe. Tags editorial google home google home app google home fail video subscribe ...

Carson Saldanha Hi David Sean Thomas Hey Paul next time you're buying expensive accessories for every room in your house can you just throw me a hundo instead? Thanks! Sean Thomas Seems like something I would say. Paul Quinn I asked my office Home to get on that. The one in the kitchen responded. She can't do it but she's learning. Christopher Young I can completely sympathize with you. I have two Google Homes in my small apartment (living room/bedroom), and they frequently get confused where I'm at. I want to play music in the bedroom? Nope, the cozy jazz station starts blaring in the living room. There is one awesome benefit of having two Google Homes: I can fill my entire apartment with music with only a few words. dcdttu I hope Google Home gets a lot of support from Google itself and doesn't turn out to be a Hangouts. Or a Wave. Or a Nexus Player. Or a Nexus Q. Or a Google Reader. Or a tablet of any kind. Oh and hi Paul! Paul Quinn HI! Yeah, I'm worried that they will jump ship because they can't figure out a way to monetize it. No ads. If it starts playing ads, Home is moving out. The Echo doesn't really have a monetization angle except that you can shop on Amazon. Google added Google Express to the Home. But really? I'm not shopping on one of these things (yet). Lateef Alabi-Oki I thought the monetization was making money off selling the hardware. Paul Quinn They also need to keep expanding the ecosystem and product functionality which takes work that costs money. I don't know if that one time purchase price covers all that in the long run. Lord Argyris I think what Google is banking on is that if a user has one or more Homes, it makes them that much more likely to stick with the Android ecosystem in general, which means all Google's already existing means of getting money are a bit more secure from such a user switching over to the big "A". Of course it remains to be seen whether or not this is effective. Dk Schlösser The monetization is in the services offered by Google Paul Quinn I don't know what service I access through the Home makes Google any money, short of using it to buy things on Google Express. It does produce a little more profiling information but I doubt that it's enough to pay for the ongoing development. Ryan I think its all about search and locking you into their services, just like the chromecast. Because of chromecast (and now google home) I am more locked into Google Music. I am more locked into Youtube, Play Movies, searching on Google, etc. Just like Android. The specific device/service doesnt have to make money, its a "loss leader" to drive you to their other, profitable services. A very common thing in almost any consumer industry. Lars Jeppesen Precisely. I'm ditching Sonos in favor of Chromecast Audio, only because of my GH fluffthebunny The monetization is off selling all the data gleaned by your six devices listening to your every word. You have become one with the Home. You have been assimilated. Joshed The horror of ordering an item in the kitchen only to find the bedroom and office made duplicate orders. skitchbeatz I've got an open concept, one in the kitchen and one in the living room. They fight over responding and sometimes both respond. It's frustrating. I've thought about moving one of them up or down a floor. It's half implemented. It doesn't make sense because the assistant on the phone will sometimes read "answering on another device. Artem Russakovskii I have 4 Google Homes (2 in nearby areas where they can both hear me at the same time - kitchen and living room), 2 Alexas (though both Alexas can't hear me at the same time), and I can confirm - combined with multiple phones on family members, it's a mess. Let alone Home kicks in and starts talking once a day or so when not asked (doesn't happen nearly as often with Alexa). LithiumFox Never had that happen with ours... givitumibeybi 4 google homes and 2 alexas?? Artem, I think you might have some issues. Artem Russakovskii No, I just have more than one room. Dk Schlösser Change the trigger word for your Alexas Nick After my experiences with Amazon Echo, I have felt that these type of products are not ready for prime time. It's a cool concept, but these little, quirky issues that pop up with these "Home Assistants" suggest otherwise. Perhaps I'm more security minded than other people, but these sort of IoT products are ripe for security issues as well and the combination of these things has me totally turned off to the current market. Tony T. If you have multiple Homes, can you ask Google to play music and have all of them play the same music in sync? Defenestratus yes. Ed G You can have all of them play music like a Sonos. Also will link with Chromecast Audio. trickytree1984 Will it link to chrome cast proper? Joshua Pritt no, you can't group Chromecast video devices, only audio. Joshed This sucks. I don't see why they cant give older chromecast devices this feature. Paul Quinn Yes, you can create groups. For example, I have a group named "Front of the house" that connects three of them. You're best bet is to name them things that roll of the tongue like, "Hey Google, play my 90's hits playlist on the front of the house." Defenestratus I've got three homes, and I don't have this issue at all. Of course they're all on different floors and I live in a rather open-floor plan home so there's that. I've never had it come on as a ghost... ever. Chris You spent over 800 on google homes?!?! Omg man what kinda bank you making. That is insanity. Or no savings? I mean a financially responsible person cannot spend that much unless their income is huge haha. Defenestratus Yesterday I spent $1000 on a shower fixture (Moen U) David Ruddock OMG YOU ACTUALLY BOUGHT ONE OF THOSE? Defenestratus My wife saw it on "I want that" on DIY network and, well, yeah. We're about to start a master suite renovation so it was the perfect opportunity. For her, the hardest part of the day is getting up out of bed and waiting for the shower to heat up, getting cold in the process (she could get cold in the middle of equatorial guinea and we live in the North East US) so when she saw that she could turn the shower on from bed and it would alert her when it was ready for her, it was a done deal. I'm actually thinking of making a google assistant handler for it when it shows up. Chris Damn dude! How much do you make?? I see all these cool things and want them but I decide my money is better sitting in my savings account or the stock market. Defenestratus I specialize in software that is used for pharmaceutical research and clinical trials. I make a good living. Oh and my wife's a doctor. Chris Ah definitely. That's awesome dude. I work at a vaccine start up so hopefully we'll get a product past the FDA then I can buy 1k showers ;) Defenestratus Very cool. My company does a lot of work on vaccine studies. Best of luck. You have a long 12-14 years of approval process ahead of you! goodnightmare "Ok Moen...." Doesn't have quite the same ring to it. Paul Quinn The timing was right. I got three of them for $100 apiece using Visa Checkout and some helpful friends. Chris That's good dude. I haven't been able to convince myself to get one yet. I don't listen to music at home and not really sure what else I'd use it for. I did get a nest recently but still I don't mind pulling out my phone to change the temp. Paul Quinn I have an Ecobee now. My Nest kept thinking I was away because I didn't walk down that hallway enough. The Ecobee has remote sensors. Unfortunately, the Home currently does not have a direct integration with Home. I'm using IFTTT. Lawstorant Is it that hard to check which Home is the closest, based on the loudness of one's speech? Paul Quinn It might be that Google focused on their ability to hear your voice based on having one Home. If you have one, you want it to be able to hear you from a distance. That will backfire when you introduce more of them. They are all listening too well. Mace Moneta It could probably be resolved easily, by having the Google Homes reduce sensitivity of the mic, based upon the number of Google Home's on the network. Paul Quinn I had two Echos when they announced improved far-field functionality. I tested it at the time and it was working better. I didn't do any long term testing because I switched to the Home. With that in mind, Amazon was able to improve the situation with a software update so I agree that Google should have fixed this by now. Lawstorant Well, it's still Google. They have the money and the manpower to overcome such "hurdles". Why is it that more often than not, they seem like a small start-up composed of fresh out-of -college programmers. Nigel Antonio lol I thought I was the only one with that problem... Jesse Corbett So I have 2, one that covers the bedroom/bathroom half of my apartment and on that covers the kitchen/dining/living room section. I have never had an issue with both responding, if I may share my anecdote. However, I frequently am sitting 10 feet from the living room Home and hear my bedroom Home respond, despite being further away, in another room, down a hallway, with the first between me and it. I don't understand. Michael Stiffler Haha, I've had to whisper to my phone if I don't want her (Home) to hear! Aleem Kanji I think it's time to admit that Google is really screwing the pooch here. Nexus hardware failures, Pixel issues, Google Homes not living up to the hype, constant beta-feel to their products... I have a Nexus 6P, two Google Homes, and I'm all-in on Google services, but... for fuck's sake, I'm thinking of jumping ship entirely. Even Android news sites are seeming to be whole-heartedly disappointed with Google and the growing lack of positivity is disheartening. Google either needs to put up and get their shit together with product polish and following through on promises (or not promising the moon to begin with) or they shut the hell up and we all buy iPhones and call it a day. Paul Quinn My thoughts are not really heading down that road. The Home does a lot of things right. It's core features, music and access to Google's massive database of information, are working. Light control works well. There are some very useful IFTTT integrations. The Echo had its issues when it came out and it has grown up. I'm not ready to give up on the Home. I see it slowly improving. I don't miss any Echo features. My 6P was a good experience overall but ultimately, yeah, it failed me in terms of the camera. My new Mate 9 has an absolutely amazing camera. I have no experience with the Pixel though. The general consensus is that the Pixel is amazing. I'm looking forward to the next one. Leoniv Same here. I'm all in with Google tech and have been with them since 2.3, but lately they've been a hot mess. They broke the dialer on multiple phones, hosed bluetooth so it disconnected randomly, and that doesn't even include the issues with the nexus and pixel phones. I hate to admit it, but the iPhones are looking more attractive. Jack Smith Really? Google home is not even 6 months old. GH is easily the most humanist technology that you can buy It is incredible what can do but not perfect and yet it is over? Little dramatic? Where are you going to get anything close? I have had the Echo since the very first day. It is NOT like the GH. Comparisons are ridiculous. Echo has commands and the GH you talk We are so.early with this and obviously the relatively minor issues in the scheme of things will get resolved. I have one echo and counting GHs that I gave away I have purchased 7. Not to say I dislike my Echo but it is not the future, IMO, like the GH. Aleem Kanji I'm TOTALLY being dramatic, actually. I love my Google Home. I love my Nexus. I also tried an iPhone for the first time late last year (iOS 10 got my attention) and I love it too. My tenure with my iPhone was about 4 months, and, like clockwork, I'd always put my SIM back in my N6P every Wednesday night until Saturday, then switch back to my iPhone (which is a bitch with iMessage, BTDub). The iPhone IS more polished, has better power and battery management, but isn't exciting to me the way Android is. I could never give it up. It's like a drug. But, like a drug, I'm hopelessly addicted to something that promises the highest of highs, then always leaves me chasing the dragon. Google promises the world, then has a tendency to either fall short or simple pulls the rug out. In a world where the Pixel exists and it commands iPhone and Galaxy level money, in a world where Google is trying it's hand at a software AND hardware ecosystem, I expect more. I expect polish, I expect promises to be kept - or at least reasonable expectations to be given. Now, people can come back and say that Google is new at hardware and I understand and forgive that. But they aren't a hardware company in the way that they take responsibility for their products 100%, in that they quality test, in that they have any sort of retail presence that goes beyond simply "trying" something out. They have time to build that, so I'll admit that I need to give them time to sort it out. I'm just worried that they'll get complacent or lose interest and one morning wake up and say "Oh yeah, that Android thing and all that hardware and stuff - I'm over it." If Google is going to change direction and add hardware to their list of products, I expect that they keep in mind that it also means that we - not our data - become customers too. Jack Smith So much silliness in this post. First, what right now angers me the most is Apple completely abandoning the entire AirPort line without any warning. Last November just reassigning all the employes. So I replaced our two AirPort Extremes with Google Wifi. That is REAL life not some weird perception things. "Apple reportedly stops developing AirPort WiFi router products, moving employees to other projects" Who does that? Not Google. Instead with Google we have yesterday. "New Google ‘Dual Band WiFi Router’ Shows Up At The FCC" https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/04/new-google-dual-band-wifi-router-shows-up-at-the-fcc.html This entire narrative Google is horrible at hardware or abandons hardware products is rather ridiculous. Heck it would have been so easy for Google to not support the NON Google WiFI hardware but instead Google decided to spend the money and bring all their new WiFi software to the ONHUB. This is REAL life not fantasy. We have been an Apple house for over a decade. We still have tons of Apple products. But been more and more replacing with Google. With Google we have 4K, HDR, VR, Smart speaker, Mesh and the list keeps growing. I can NOT get any of this from Apple! That is simply the facts. Aleem Kanji Right. 2×4 alexa does this same thing compuguy1088 That's not true. A software update allows for multiple amazon echo devices with the same hotword to work. They've had this since around the end of last year. 2×4 that's my point - it doesnt work well Midnitte "You also have the ghosts. I never thought my home might be haunted - until now. There will be times when I turn off the TV, hang up on a call, or just walk out of the bathroom and hear something in another room. I’ll find a Google Home playing music or a podcast that I don’t listen to in a randomly selected room. Who asked to listen to opera at low volume in the guest room? Ghosts." I have two and I've grouped them in a "home unit" and I've never experienced this. Typically I'll play music on one but sometimes I'll tell it to play music on both and I've never experienced it playing music on a rogue Home goodnightmare Nor have I. Igen Then I am pretty sure that Paul's home is haunted and he should call an Sam & Dean asap. kalehv This is a constant struggle. I have two Google Homes and a bunch of phones / tablets that also respond to "Ok Google" I usually use "Hey Google" to avoid waking up phones and tablets but there is no other way round like when I want to be reminded of something, there is no command that only capable devices (phones and tablets) would listen and not the Home. Home wins over taking control and apologizes for not being able to set reminders and actual capable devices say "Answering on other device" :( thacounty I have mine in opposite corners of the house to prevent this. The real issue is that I'll talk quietly to my phone and it will still hear me. Then my Pixel says answering on another device, which is Home telling me she can't do that yet, while my Pixel could have handled it just fine. Gets frustrating, but my 2 year old son yelling at it to play Batman Play-Doh Eggs makes it worth double what I paid. JG Glad I'm not the only one with this problem. Right now I only have two Google Homes set up, one in my bedroom and the other in the living room. If I'm in the living room, even my normal speaking voice will almost certainly trigger both Home units to talk to me. Like Paul, I have to turn to the one in the living room and whisper in order to get only one. And that can be hard if the TV is blasting away to. Though for some reason when I'm in my bedroom, I usually only trigger the bedroom unit. It gets very annoying when the one I want to talk to tells me she can't help while the other rattles off some long winded multi-paragraph answer (especially when I just asked "what time is it"). Being in another room (and sharing the same voice as the one talking next to you) its often hard to understand what she's saying - and of course there's no "Hey Google, what did you just say?" command... I wanted to set up a third in the other bedroom. But until I'm sure I won't be getting three different responses to each query.... Amazon claims to have an algorithm to determine which of multiple Echo units should respond. I don't have multiple Echo units so I can't test the validity myself, but if they can figure it out... I'm sure Google, with their expertise in machine learning shouldn't have too much bother with it. goodnightmare Acoustics. :) illregal I've got 3 in pretty close proximity, and a 4th whenever lg decides to send those out. Only about 1 out of 10 requests gets answered by the one i wasn't intentionally talking to. 4Ui812 Hi Paul ? Paul Quinn Hi! Rasovan Mircea Google have to upgrade the sound waves and not allow them to travel more than one room.... Tired_Guy I have a Home, a Nexus 9, a Nexus 7 and a Pixel XL, so assistant works on all of them. If all are in my den charging, saying OK Google is like he described only a bit weirder, as I can say it specifically to my Pixel XL in my hand and the Nexus 9 answers, through it's cover. Multiple device synchronization is vital Packer Backer Another reason to allow users to set the hot word. "Hey Bub! Hey Betty! Hey Fumbduck!" would would activate three different devices. Dk Schlösser The solution is to be able to change the trigger word for each device. You can do this on Alexa. Paul Quinn Currently, only my Home responds to "Hey Google" so I use that to talk to the Home. my phones and tablets don't respond. That cuts down on the problem a bit as long as I don't want to use voice with my phone. If I say "OK Google" to my phone, the Home may also respond. A quick fix for now would be to have the option to set the Home NOT to respond to "OK Google" and only "Hey Google." Bill Riess Yeah I just recently discovered this issue when I moved from an echo and echo dot to 4 Google homes. For the most part they work pretty good but it's annoying when they pick up in the wrong room. Multiuser and Sonos integration would be great additions as well. goodnightmare I've had four of these in my home since day one. Yes, occasionally we'll get some random response from a distant device, but it doesn't affect performance. The requested task is completed properly 95% of the time and any hiccups have never been due to multiple devices trying to provide feedback. Our Google Home experience has been quite pleasant and loads of fun. DomBrady Same. I've got three. I have had one interference related issue. Charles222 Same with four here as well. I've had an interference problem with my kitchen & living room ones, but taking a few steps towards one or the other solves it. nerdshowandtell.com I also have 6 Google Homes and the issues described here I only had a month or so ago and they went away. Id also make sure you have solid wifi with no interference to eliminate any delay in the homes seeing each other. As for the random asking/talking, maybe have seen that 3 times since it came out. Definitely not in awhile. Brett Koger I also have several Google Home devices, I am not experiencing the issues you state. I even have two of them with in 20 feet (they are in different rooms) I will see both activate but only one will respond. I have only experienced what you are see a few times. It is not the norm. Paul Quinn I have noticed that situation where more than one activate but only two of them can actually be visualized at one time. To me, that's a good sign. It means they are hearing you but identifying which one should respond. Maxr1998 Hi Paul! Very entertaining and interesting article. I don't have a Google Home myself yet (not available in Germany, functionality in German is likely pretty limited (as seen in Assistant on phones), my Home Assistant setup isn't supported by Google Home/Google Assistant, and IFTTT is too slow (10 seconds+) atm), but the idea of having one is very intriguing for me :) Paul Quinn Hi Max! I guess one plus side of living in another country is that Google works out bugs in the United States before it expands across the globe. Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get it functional:P But it's still sometimes a little annoying for power users wanting the latest and the greatest regardless of bugs ;) Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get it functional. 😜 But it's still sometimes a little annoying to not get the latest and greatest stuff being a poweruser ;) Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get them functional. 😜 But it's still sometimes a little annoying to not get the latest and greatest stuff being a poweruser ;) JD So it's not just me. Alexa is just that much better with its spatial recognition. It has a 100% hit rate on responding on the right unit. Sandeep Raghuraman One solution to your problem - setup mic + speakers in each room, and use one Google Home. That way, only one Google Home device will respond. Although, the next problem would be, how does Google Home decide which mic to listen through? Maybe a device that mixes all of those input streams from the different mics? Nick Riviera Try power cycling your units to keep them from talking over one another. sucatrops If you bought 6 Google Homes and didn't expect more than one to respond to you, you should shoot yourself. Hector Diaz Amazon echo has far field recognition between Echos so Google can include that with a software update. Ryan I dont see the need to have one in all 6 rooms of my home. Having one in the open air living/dining room and kitchen is plenty, it hears me from 40 feet no matter what. Then another in my bedroom. I dont think I need them in the guest rooms. Maybe one in the office, but that is all the way on the other side of the house from the bedroom. Maybe 6 is the overkill. Paul Quinn I have smart lighting in all the main rooms of the house. I wouldn't want any of us to be yelling from room to adjust lighting in another. I did put in remotes in the rooms as well because you should have another option besides voice. I think for most people, one or two is plenty. I'm really into smart home technology despite its incredibly fragmented implementation right now. I know my house is going beyond the norm. The fact that yours hear you from 40 feet away is what is causing the downfall in my house. Đức Thành 6 Google Homes? You're a crazy man. I like you. 6 is still nowhere near enough, though. Hector Diaz I have 2 echo Dot and 1 Echo. Missing still 2 echo Dot. So he is not crazy just want to have a real smart home doesn't matter where he stands like me. Andrew Hartley It was clear Paul was a bit 'unusual' from the moment he mentioned the Enterprise. I've been teaching science using the latest technology for 30+ and my dream has always been to walk into my classroom in the morning and for a cute sounding female voice to welcome me from my computer with a good morning asking me what I would like to do today. Google home I found you at last 😉 That doesn't sound weird does it 😎 Paul Quinn Sounds fantastic! D.Smithee I like when you're home alone in a quiet house and this thing starts spouting gibberish with no warning. Paul Quinn Tonight.... one of the Homes (in the office) decided to "forget" the lights in the room. Just the lights in the room that it's in. It kept saying there were no lights set up for that room. The remote went dead too. It was darkness. But... it let me operate the lights from other Homes. No I'm starting to wonder if Google read this... and is toying with me. I got the remote back online. The Home is still protesting. Bill3 Hi Paul, not sure what's going on there. I have three Google Homes and have only had that happen once or twice. They'll often beep together, but only one will answer. It could be a problem with your WiFi network. Are they connected to different AP points? Paul Quinn Yes. Despite two of them being closer to another access point in my house, I've kept the Homes on the primary router which is able to deliver a strong enough signal throughout the house. I use an access point to guarantee a connection to the irrigation controller outside. abc Oh, god. People are buying not more than one of this beta product. Are they rich or just plain stupid? Kostas 💪🎩 Man I laughed hard. Well written! DragoCubed 🎪 👻 👋 hi paul papastevez Where the ^*#} is the Google play movies integration??? Seriously, Netflix, a third party has been working for months and months. Lars Jeppesen I have 3 GH, and I've never had the problems described in the article. /edit And Hi to Paul, of course :) twighahn I think back to the smart homes of yesteryear.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Mobile Image Source: YouTube Google’s new Chrome update has the one new feature you’ve been waiting for Chris Smith @chris_writes April 12th, 2017 at 7:18 PM Share Tweet Ever found yourself scrolling through a web page only to discover it would jump back to the top once it actually finished loading a slow element? Well, Google thinks that’s an annoying problem that needs fixing, and now the Chrome browser will finally fix it for you. Don't Miss: It looks like Samsung’s Galaxy S8 design might be even more impressive than the iPhone 8 Google explained in a blog post that a new feature called scroll anchoring will prevent such behavior in the future, especially on mobile devices. “These annoying page jumps typically happen when the website inserts an image or other content above the visible area, pushing down what’s on the screen,” Google said. “With the newest Chrome update, we’re introducing something called scroll anchoring, which locks the content you’re currently looking at to the screen, keeping you in the same spot so you can keep reading.” The best part here is that Google will also fix an unwanted side effect of page jumping. Page jumps can cause accidental clicks on certain links on a page. You may want to click a specific link only to find that you’re heading in a different direction thanks to a page jump that forced you to tap or click the wrong link. That may even have some serious security implications when loading shady pages with links to even more suspicious places — hey, it can happen. In a nutshell, the new scroll anchoring feature will let you continue to read the article you were scrolling and click on the links you wanted to access in the first place without having to deal with any page jumping. Here’s the feature in action on Android: Tags: Android, chrome, google View Comments Trending 1 Tech The OnePlus 5 looks like the real deal 2 Tech The Nokia 9 may look even better than the Galaxy S8 3 Deals 5 accessories every Google Pixel or Pixel XL owner needs 4 Tech It looks like the iPhone 8 will be even sleeker than we thought 5 Deals You can’t go wrong with any of these Alexa-enabled smart thermostats Picked For You How to find and activate YouTube’s secret Dark Mode By Jacob Siegal April 14th at 9:54 AM The Nokia 9 may look even better than the Galaxy S8 By Chris Smith April 14th at 8:00 PM Galaxy S8 sales are already explosive By Zach Epstein April 13th at 7:45 AM Advertise About Contact Copyright 2017 BGR Media, LLC Powered by WordPress.com VIP | Privacy Policy | Your Privacy Rights | Terms Of Use ad

What once was broken now is fixed: call recording in Google Voice works again Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/15 5:56pm PDTApr 15, 2017 19 Plus 1 on G+ 60 Share on Facebook 49 Share on Twitter Total Shares128 Applications Google News Shortly after bringing it back from the dead, it would appear that Google may have inadvertently broken call recording for a short period. For the last two weeks there have been multiple different user reports of problems with recording calls in Google Voice. Thankfully, the issue appears to have been resolved and recording is now working as intended. While there is not yet any word about the status of recordings presumed lost during this period, all new recordings should behave as expected and appear in your Google Voice inbox. The precise cause of the original problem isn't known. We've reached out to Google for more information. In the meantime Google hasn't made any statements about the matter outside the responses on the forum, so in lieu of an official statement all we can provide is the response given to posts on the subject: Thank you for reporting the issue you had with call recordings. We believe that we have resolved the issue and new call recordings should work as expected. Our engineering team is continuing to investigate the recordings that took place during the time period affected. We will update this thread once we have an update to provide. Thanks for your patience! If you believe you may have been affected, you can check if any of your recordings made during that time are present. If you don't find them in your Google Voice inbox double check by opening the overflow menu on the left, open "Legacy Google Voice," hover over More and select Recorded calls. Recordings should appear there, and if any are missing from the last two weeks you may be among those who have experienced the issue. For those users that might have made recordings while things were broken, it looks like Google is still looking into things and plans on updating the relevant threads later. If we hear anything more on the subject or if we get a statement we'll be sure to update this post.

Carson Saldanha Plz Google, let me use the Assistant to send Google Voice messages. Brad Stewart this is huge for Android Auto users as well. SpeakethTheTruth Hey new guy, nice touch on the thumbnail. Now go fetch me some coffee. Marty Tricky Dick says, "Right on!". keithzg And meanwhile SMS support is being removed from Hangouts (despite Google's assurances that Hangouts wasn't going anywhere, I guess they're just gonna rip out features until folks don't use it anymore and then go "oh, well we were gonna support it forever, but nobody's using it, so..."). And Google Voice still isn't available in Canada after all these years. Dammit, Google. ethd Aroo Morenicano I recommended the article because of the thumbnail. More eyes need to see this lol Erick Wright It would be nice if you could check your recording from the new updated less future Rich app... Or hell use Google Assistant to send messages via Google Voice or make Google Voice your default SMS app... One day Google will get it right or someone else will come alone and do it. Kevin Davis Hell yes, awesome picture. Vivek Rameses Screw the article, that's a great picture. I like the new guy. Doby Gillis Most retards do. Techsoul It'd be better if they fixed the bug that doesn't allow you to get a new number at all. Mark Sentesy More important to me is that the new app usually claims the phone has no network connection, when it clearly does. This makes it unusable. So I use an old apk, which works perfectly fine. Latheryin With all the different laws around people need to be careful with call recording. Have to make sure you are aware of the laws for each and every state. Other wise might end up on the bad end of a court case. vwnut13 Google Voice announces to both parties that the call is being recorded. Latheryin Which doesn't mean anything in states where is not allowed at all. Never did understand it personally. If you can't remember what was said on a phone call then it is either not that important or your memory just sucks and you have bigger issues. MG Which doesn't mean anything since all states allow call recording, some just require that all parties involved be notified. Call recording has far more use cases than simply jotting down notes Latheryin Not all states do. The one I live in just made it illegal again to record personal calls. I'm sure for some it does. Can't think of any reason myself but for those with bad memories I can see where it would help. vwnut13 And which state would that be? Latheryin Alaska. IT was voted on last week along with a bunch of other privacy laws. You know things like where you can and cant fly a drone, recording people while they are out at events. You know things like that. Like I said I am sure many people find a use for it. Just not something I would ever use or have a use for. Android Developer Pretty sure normal calls are used more. Why can't they put call recording as a standard on Android?

Share on Facebook Are you an influencer? ﻿ Advertisements 4 Princeton State Police have arrested a man after #DNA tests match DNA found on the slain Google employee Vanessa Marcotte. On August 7, 2016, while on a visit to her family home, 27-year-old Marcotte was reported missing by her mother after not returning from an early morning run. Her body was later found in a wooded area a half-mile away from the home. Authorities claimed that evidence found shows that there were signs of a struggle which would have left scratches and bruises on the killer. Advertisements Arrested man's DNA found on victim Angelo Colon-Ortiz (31), a local resident, was arrested at his home Friday without incident after investigators determined that his DNA sample matched DNA found on the victim's hands. At a press conference today, Worcester District Attorney Joseph D. Early Jr. stated that last week a state trooper spotted Colon-Ortiz and noted that his appearance and vehicle matched the description that investigators were searching for. The trooper wrote down the license plate of the dark SUV that Colon-Ortiz was driving and the next day went to his home requesting a saliva sample for testing. Colon-Ortiz provided the DNA sample without resistance. Colon-Ortiz has now been charged with battery and assault with intent to rape, aggravated assault, and aggravated assault and battery. District Attorney Early said that it is anticipated that murder charges will follow. Vanessa Marcotte helped solve her own murder At Saturday's press conference, District Attorney Early thanked investigators and the public for helping with the case. He gave the most credit to the victim herself for fighting the killer which resulted in his DNA being found on her hands and at the crime scene, ultimately leading to his arrest. Ortiz's DNA sequence occurs only once in 1.1 quintillion sequences, Early said at the conference, which is why they are confident that he is the killer. “It was through her determined fight and her efforts that we determined the DNA of her killer,” District Attorney Early said at Saturday's press conference. Worcester Man Charged in Marcotte Slaying https://t.co/w5vGP3vpXL— Joseph D. Early Jr. (@worcesterda) April 15, 2017 Police officials stated that the attack on Marcotte occurred during the early afternoon of August 7. ABC News reported that police said evidence suggests that Marcotte had been sexually assaulted and confirmed burn marks on her body. District Attorney Early said that Marcotte worked as a Google manager in New York City and often visited her family in Massachusetts. Her family said that she was going to return to New York City on the day she died.

The tech accessories would seem the most natural progression in the build out of Zoe’s brand and draw inspiration from her fall ready-to-wear collection with a large dose of sequins. The collaboration with the tech firm includes a dozen different case designs that can be used on the Pixel, Pixel XL, Nexus 5x and Nexus 6p. Google’s Pixel was the technology company’s first phone and launched this past fall. The Rachel Zoe Live Case collection — Live Cases being Google’s customizable phone covers — retail for $40 and are available through the Google Store. The cases are equipped with near-field communication technology, allowing it to sync up with the phone once snapped. Once the sync occurs, the device’s wallpaper also then matches the customized case’s artwork. The designer is expected to celebrate the collaboration Saturday during her Zoeasis party running alongside the annual Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in Indio, Calif. Zoe joins a growing roster of artists and designers who have partnered with Google on Live Case artwork including Jen Stark, Skrillex, Jeff Koons, Opening Ceremony and Gray Malin, among others.

By: Abhinaya Prabhu Published: Saturday, April 15, 2017, 13:19 [IST] Last month, we came across a few possible codenames for the 2017 Google Pixel phones. Some of the codenames revealed on the internet include Muskie and Walleye. These codenames are given after fishes similar to what Google did in the last year. It gave codenames after fishes to the already existing Pixel and Pixel XL smartphones in 2016. We already know that Google is working on an upcoming device. The recent APK teardown of the Google app's beta version shows that Bisto could be the codename of one of the smartphones that could be launched in the coming weeks or months. Also Read: Google Photos comes with new image stabilization system The teardown shows several references made to Bisto. We cannot confirm what Bisto is as yet, but it is likely to be a portable audio device. It is believed so as there is a string in the code in which the notifications can be read aloud inside the headphones. Another string references a preference setting that will enable spoken notifications. The device is also speculated to arrive with a screen. In a report by Android Police, the Bisto codename was found among the categories such as Google Home, Android TV, Google Pixel, general Phone category and Android Wear.  Also Read: Google Hire job search website launched to take on LinkedIn While it is not certain about what exactly the Bisto could be, the rumors in the past state that a Google Glass successor is in the making along with an audio-based wearable. The Google I/O 2017 conference is all set to take place in May. We can expect the company to unveil this device codenamed Bisto and others at the conference.

Recently, Google has rollout its latest Android Nougat update, 7.1.1, for Nexus as well as Pixel devices. Nexus and Pixel Affected The update seems to have caused issues regarding the fingerprint scanner. It is quite common to find such problems soon after an update is rolled out. Some users of Pixel and Nexus devices found the issue after the aforementioned update. The issue affects both the Pixel and the Pixel XL smartphones and also the Nexus 5X and the Nexus 6P made by LG. DIY Attempts Fail The fingerprint sensors were not allowing access to the smartphones, but they were able to swipe down and get notifications and Moves gesture was also functional. Some users tried to fix the problem themselves, such as removing the current fingerprints and beginning all over again, but such DIY efforts have not been successful. An error message shows up and it prevents the user from adding new fingerprints to their devices. Some users tried rebooting and also clearing the cache, but with no effect. Users considered that if they completely deleted their fingerprints and then added them again, it could help. But they just got an error message while attempting to add the fingerprint again, with messages like the enrollment was not completed, the fingerprint enrollment did not work or they were asked to use another finger or just try again, or stated that the fingerprint hardware was not available and so on. Even a factory reset did not solve the problem in many cases. Fixing the Issue Google has not yet acknowledged the problem, but once it notices the issue, it will probably offer a fix soon. The fix will be in the form of another update. Many users belonging to communities and forums of the Google Pixel and Nexus smartphones have discussed the problem after the Nougat 7.1.2 OTA update. Other Issues Recently, owners of the Google Pixel and the Pixel XL also had to deal with another problem related to the Bluetooth on their devices. After Google rolled out the security patch update for February, the said devices faced problems with Bluetooth connectivity. Many users found that the Bluetooth connection did not work in their cars, where it used to disconnect randomly, whereas in other cases, it just switched off, apparently without any reason. Google had worked on this issue for around a month and then at last rolled out an update from the server in order to solve the issue. There have also been several other issues related to the Google Pixel and the Pixel XL, such as the distortion of the audio and the double tapping feature for waking the device. The fingerprint sensor feature is considered to be one of the top features of the Pixel phones and users are hoping that there will be a quick fix for the issue.

Gadgets Mobiles Apps Gaming Internet Social Media More OS Companies Connect with us HiTechGazette Gadgets Mobiles Apps Gaming Internet Social Media More OS Companies YouTube has a new dark mode and you can activate it Share Tweet Internet YouTube has a new dark mode and you can activate it By Liam Davis Published on April 15, 2017 Share Tweet Comment YouTube is one of the most widely used Google platforms on the planet. Even so, not too long ago, the design of the web platform left a lot to be desired if compared to some of its rivals. Luckily, after the arrival of Material Design to the video platform, Google has not ceased its intention to incorporate new features which can improve the user interface of YouTube, and thus, the experience of users when it is used. The latest news that we have known today thanks to Android Central, is a dark mode incorporated into the YouTube website that, although it is somewhat hidden, it is possible to activate it in a simple way following a few steps. Turn on dark YouTube mode More and more applications and platforms offer the possibility to activate a dark mode or night mode, which makes the background colors dark to avoid discomfort in the eyes when consuming content in low light situations. The last to sign up for this fashion has been YouTube, although at the moment it is only accessible from the web. To turn on dark YouTube mode, you only need to access the YouTube website from your computer using Chrome – or any other browser – and follow the steps below. Access the YouTube website. Access the command console using the browser developer panel. To do so, in Chrome for Windows, you must perform the key combination Ctrl + Shift + I, and in MacOS, Option + Command + I. Once inside, you will have access to the Console tab, which will appear at the top. Inside the console, typing the following text, copy and paste can give error, and press enter document.cookie = ”VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE=fPQ4jCL6EiE” Finally, exit the console and refresh the Chrome tab. Once refreshed, click on our YouTube profile at the top right of the screen to activate the dark mode from the drop down menu, as you can see in the image above. As you can see, it is very easy to activate the new YouTube night mode. Now that Google has decided to incorporate this newness into the platform, we hope that it will soon be possible to enjoy a similar tool in the application for Android. As always, we will keep you informed of any new developments. Continue Reading Click to comment Leave a Reply Cancel reply Your email address will not be published.

What once was broken now is fixed: call recording in Google Voice works again Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/15 5:56pm PDTApr 15, 2017 19 Plus 1 on G+ 60 Share on Facebook 49 Share on Twitter Total Shares128 Applications Google News Shortly after bringing it back from the dead, it would appear that Google may have inadvertently broken call recording for a short period. For the last two weeks there have been multiple different user reports of problems with recording calls in Google Voice. Thankfully, the issue appears to have been resolved and recording is now working as intended. While there is not yet any word about the status of recordings presumed lost during this period, all new recordings should behave as expected and appear in your Google Voice inbox. The precise cause of the original problem isn't known. We've reached out to Google for more information. In the meantime Google hasn't made any statements about the matter outside the responses on the forum, so in lieu of an official statement all we can provide is the response given to posts on the subject: Thank you for reporting the issue you had with call recordings. We believe that we have resolved the issue and new call recordings should work as expected. Our engineering team is continuing to investigate the recordings that took place during the time period affected. We will update this thread once we have an update to provide. Thanks for your patience! If you believe you may have been affected, you can check if any of your recordings made during that time are present. If you don't find them in your Google Voice inbox double check by opening the overflow menu on the left, open "Legacy Google Voice," hover over More and select Recorded calls. Recordings should appear there, and if any are missing from the last two weeks you may be among those who have experienced the issue. For those users that might have made recordings while things were broken, it looks like Google is still looking into things and plans on updating the relevant threads later. If we hear anything more on the subject or if we get a statement we'll be sure to update this post.

Marty Tricky Dick says, "Right on!". keithzg And meanwhile SMS support is being removed from Hangouts (despite Google's assurances that Hangouts wasn't going anywhere, I guess they're just gonna rip out features until folks don't use it anymore and then go "oh, well we were gonna support it forever, but nobody's using it, so...").

Techsoul It'd be better if they fixed the bug that doesn't allow you to get a new number at all. Mark Sentesy More important to me is that the new app usually claims the phone has no network connection, when it clearly does. This makes it unusable. So I use an old apk, which works perfectly fine. Latheryin With all the different laws around people need to be careful with call recording. Have to make sure you are aware of the laws for each and every state. Other wise might end up on the bad end of a court case. vwnut13 Google Voice announces to both parties that the call is being recorded. Latheryin Which doesn't mean anything in states where is not allowed at all. Never did understand it personally. If you can't remember what was said on a phone call then it is either not that important or your memory just sucks and you have bigger issues. MG Which doesn't mean anything since all states allow call recording, some just require that all parties involved be notified. Call recording has far more use cases than simply jotting down notes Latheryin Not all states do. The one I live in just made it illegal again to record personal calls. I'm sure for some it does. Can't think of any reason myself but for those with bad memories I can see where it would help. vwnut13 And which state would that be? Latheryin Alaska. IT was voted on last week along with a bunch of other privacy laws. You know things like where you can and cant fly a drone, recording people while they are out at events. You know things like that. Like I said I am sure many people find a use for it. Just not something I would ever use or have a use for. Android Developer Pretty sure normal calls are used more. Why can't they put call recording as a standard on Android?

By: Shilpa Published: Sunday, April 16, 2017, 8:00 [IST] After the release of Android 7.1.2, all were anticipating this build to appear on their smartphone sometime soon. Finally, Google' s Android smartphones started receiving this update and users were happy to use all the new features bundled in this package. But now there arises a new set of problem among Google's Pixel and Nexus users. They started reporting the bugs which have caused fingerprint sensors to break. Fingerprint sensors are one among many key features of a smartphone. Especially after this feature got introduced in the phone segment, everyone started ignoring other commonly used security features. Also Read: Google Pixel series smartphones get Wi-Fi calling on Reliance Jio Networks Similar kind of problems has been reported on Google's support forum by many users. Some even stated that they noticed the problem in fingerprint scanner after upgrading their Android Operating system to latest version 7.1.2. They even said that safe mode or factory reset could not solve this issue. Some even reported that after upgrading to this version, they were not able to see an option for fingerprint unlocking in device's setting menu. Even the users of Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P handset faced the similar problem and joined this bug reporting thread by stating the issue faced by them. Also Read: Verizon Pixel devices receive their own Android 7.1.2 builds: overall performance improved This turned out as the biggest problem for Google. They kept asking in Pixel User Community forum if anyone faced the similar problem with their smartphone. Android 7.1.2 was the underlying issue in every report they received. Still, it is not clear what exactly caused this problem but everyone is expecting this issue to be solved as soon as possible. Google may come up with the fix in next week or so.

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 125 Plus 1 on G+ 278 Share on Facebook 78 Share on Twitter Total Shares481 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 141k 106k Latest Deals 14 [Deal Alert] Get a 75" Sony LED UHD Android TV from Best Buy for $2150 today ($650 off) 2017/04/15 4:13pm PDTApr 15, 2017 19 [Deal Alert] Huawei Watch in Black Stainless Steel w/metal band $250 ($100 off) 2017/04/14 6:36pm PDTApr 14, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] 55 temporarily free and on-sale apps to round out your week 2017/04/14 12:50pm PDTApr 14, 2017 13 [Deal Alert] 2-Pack 6' Anker USB 3.0 A to C cables $12 w/ promo ($8 off) 2017/04/13 4:16pm PDTApr 13, 2017 32 [Deal Alert] NVIDIA is having a SHIELD gaming spring sale 2017/04/13 2:17pm PDTApr 13, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?

Google Voice gets its first feature update since being revived Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/03/16 2:17pm PDTMar 16, 2017 44 Plus 1 on G+ 84 Share on Facebook 66 Share on Twitter Total Shares194 Applications Google News Google Voice was waning a few weeks ago, then Google suddenly brought it back and gave it a fresh coat of paint. That was just the first step, though. Google promised it would continue updating Google Voice, and indeed it is. There's a new update rolling out today with more conversation management options, GIFs, and more. Here's the full list of new features (Android and web) Google posted on the product forums. Delete Conversations - You can now delete entire conversations on Android and Web. To delete an entire conversation, click the conversation > click More > Delete. Note that there is no trash and deletes cannot be undone.  Individual messages in a conversation can still be deleted by long pressing on a message in the mobile apps or right clicking on Web. Conversation delete will be coming to iOS in the near future. Calling on Web - You can now "make a call" from the updated version of the web interface to any number/contact. Do Not disturb - We’ve added the ability to toggle Do Not Disturb on/off on Android. When Do Not Disturb is enabled, call and text message forwarding will be paused and there will be a banner to indicate that it is turned on. To set a timer on Do Not Disturb, you will still need to visit the Legacy Google Voice on Web. Disable app notifications for text messages (Android Only) - Avoid duplicate notifications if you have message forwarding enabled. Conversation archive shortcut (Android Only)- Long-press on a conversation in the messages list to bring up the archive option. Gif image search - You can now search for Gifs if you use Gboard on Android. The ability to delete conversations is long overdue. There's no trashcan, so deleted conversations are gone forever. Conversations can also be archived via a long-press if you think you might need them again. Do Not Disturb mode can be toggled from the app as well. For Gboard users, the built-in GIF search feature works in Google Voice now. If you were hoping for Project Fi support, sorry. It's still not available. The updated app is rolling out, but you can grab it right now on APK Mirror if you're impatient.

All calls you make from the stock dialer should route through your Google voice number after this. The only reason I use the Hangouts dialer is so I have the option of making voice calls on my Pixel C tablet. ProductFRED No, I want VOIP. Not calling over the carrier network. Josh Woodby If you make a call using the regular dialer, the option will immediately switch to using your Google Voice instead. This IS actually VOIP. So, I don't see your issue. What I want is the ability to receive calls directly within the App without the need to forward calls to the carrier. That.... That is what is missing. Outgoing has always been achievable using the aforementioned method. Ryan Cavitt Actually it is not VoIP. You can tell by enabling airplane mode, reenabling Wi-Fi, then disabling Wi-Fi calling if you have it enabled. You will notice the call fails which indicates it is not VoIP. If it was the very fact that your phone is not connected to your cellular provider in anyway should not matter as it should be able to use any connection as long as it is a connection to the internet. You know like using Hangouts Dialer currently does. Ryan Its not VOIP, its a forward. Bruce Why do you want to use VOIP? Are you paying for carrier voice calls? Didn't think this was an issue in the US. Railwayman I want to use VoIP since I use data plans only without any carrier talk and text. Don't forget that GV over VoIP also work over non US SIM cards, which is the beauty of it. So yes, Google should integrate Hangouts Dialer into the refreshed GV app. ProductFRED Because then I can use my Google number over Wifi or anywhere in the world. Additionally, it makes sense since even native calls are becoming VoLTE (which is VoIP). Robb B. Screenshot of settings for phone apk on pixel XL. Setup SIP account and make primary. Then you'll be able to use GV with VoIP. Currently and always, GV never did stand alone VoIP on Android. Only Apple. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5dd6cf43950d187c0d8498d02da5436a87d23097d32844f6e8fe5202663c1281.png Gfame103 GV was a stand alone VoIP service back between 2010-2012 (Android only). I used to use it to receive and make free unlimited calls before the feature was taken away. Robb B. It was never stand alone. You always had to use IPKall or some other SIP service. Look at the early days of my app installs. They were all apps to provide sip functions with GV. You had to have another solution. Apple app was the only actual VoIP but was never ported to Android. Show me proof that you used GV without a fake sip number from any other provider or I call BS. BlazeKing I only used Groove IP to use GV as VoIP before GV stopped using the SIP ptotocol (rendering Groove IP's main attraction useless the time). What are you talking about, exactly? Picaso86 How can I setup a SIP Account to use GV through the Phone Dialer? Bryan Wagoner You can make voip calls using your gvoice phone number through hangouts at least. Carson Saldanha I'd like to be able to receive calls in the Google Phone app. They allow you to dial from it, but you can't receive any. Kerry Webb You can if you register for a Google voice phone number. Picaso86 Wait... you can use Google Voice through the native dial app? is that what you saying? Kerry Webb Yes you can. I do it almost every day Picaso86 Do you mind sharing on how you did it? Kerry Webb I did this almost 5 years ago. As memory serves, I went to the web interface after getting my Google number. Forwarded all Google voice calls to my cell number. For outgoing, I set voice to ask me if I want to use voice every time I make a call. I also changed my default voicemail to be Google voice as well. There's other tweaks you can do like waiting so many rings before forwarding calls etc. Carson Saldanha I have a Google Voice number already. DaveH I'm with you. Just waiting for VoIP dialing so I can leave Hangouts. b00sted i use GV for work and would always have to login to it on desktop mode to forward the vm as a email to m boss (pain but at least I could do it) now with the refresh unless I am missing something they took that away. Moshe Brevda Still waiting for the international calling rates to be brought into the current decade EnerJi Just curious, where are you calling that the rates are not competitive? I freely admit I haven't kept up with VoIP price comparisons since GV first introduced international calling, but I just checked the prices to some of the countries I occasionally call, and they don't seem too bad. tim242 It's sad that deleting a conversation wasn't there from the start, and is an added feature. Now I'm wondering if heads up is an unwanted feature. It is ridiculous that heads up can now only be disabled in messaging apps if you silence notifications altogether. I also hate how this app just picks random bubble colors. If only bubble colors could be customized. They are driving me to iOS. Jay I don't know anyone who's "accidentally" deleted an entire conversation instead of deleting a single message or messages. To say this was long overdue is a total understatement. Joshua Mize If I downloaded an APK in the past, does my app still automatically update through Google Play for future updates? Zachary Haddenham Yes. Dima Ivaȵov GV also supports mms messaging from the app now ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ You're a little late to the party on that one Brad Stewart Needs ability to be set as default SMS app. Google Assistant texting is useless without it. tim242 It doesn't do SMS. So there is no way it can be a default SMS app. It is basically an instant messenger with a phone number attached. Kyle Salewski It could be if they wanted to. Hangouts is set to my default SMS app for my GV #, not my carrier number. So if I hit the send SMS button from the Contacts app, or another app, it starts a new SMS from my GV # (which you label instant messenger) inside of Hangouts. We should be able to do the same thing from the Voice app... tim242 Incorrect. Hangouts is only abke to be set as the default SMS client, because it is able to handle carrier SMS. Before they had carrier SMS in Hangouts, it could not be set as default. The fact that you use GV in Hangouts is irrelevant to the SMS side of Hangouts. Bruce I'm afraid you are wrong. I have been using GV since at least 2008. That's the only number I give out and I had been using it as my default SMS app for years. About 2-3 years ago, they stopped the GV app to be made the default SMS app. So now I can't tap on a direct contact widget and send an SMS through my GV app (and number) which is the only (mobile) number that people have of mine. So annoyingly I have to open the GV app to send an SMS to people. Alternatively, it would be nice if they would have allowed me to use my GV number as my mobile number in their SMS app (Messenger). That also used to work in earlier versions of Android. I used to use my GV number as my mobile number in Handcent. tim242 You are confusing GV messages with SMS. SMS messages are sent over the carrier network used for calls, and are limited to 160 characters. Google Voice messages are sent over the data network and have no character limit. When you send a message from Google Voice to someone's SMS, Google is rerouting it for you. What you are referring to is choosing Google Voice as your preferred way to send messages. That is not the same as a default SMS app that handles all messages. Thisismyusername1982 It does not need to be able to do SMS to send messages from Assistant. I don't use SMS in hangouts I use my Google Voice account and Hangouts its self and sending messages works just fine. So i don't see why it would not work for the Google Voice app. tim242 A default SMS app and using Assistant to send messages are two different things. Hangouts is an instant messenger, Google Voice is an intant messenger. Hangouts also has a separate SMS for carrier component. That is the only reason Hangouts can be set as the default SMS client. Google is going to cut that out, though. They are pushing SMS users to Android Messages, formerly Google Messenger. So when they remove that functionality, Hangouts will no longer be able to be set as a default SMS client. Allo has no SMS support, and the new GV app can't do VOIP GV calls. I wouldn't hold my breath for GV integration with Assistant. Google has fucked up the Android messaging world, and they don't seem to care johnforamerica Well holy shit... Didn't see that one coming twaddington Too little too late, I already ported my number out. pfmiller Are they finally going to fix the bug where I can't use my GV voicemail with my mobile number without either having to put up with my phone ringing twice, or blocking calls to my GV number? It's only been about 7 years since it worked right. Justin W I've had no issue with seeing my GV as my voicemail as a T-Mobile, Straight talk, or Cricket user. Ismael Rodriguez I think he may be referring to how if you set Hangouts to receive calls/msgs from Voice, when your phone transfers to voicemail, it will go to Hangouts and ring there first. I've always had the same issue. pfmiller Right. It worked for me when I first got my Nexus One, but then they made some big change to Google Voice and it's been broken ever since. Computator If you are describing what I think you are, it's the same situation I have and easy to fix. All you need to do is either turn off forwarding to your mobile number, or turn off receiving google voice calls in hangouts on your phone. Just choose which is enabled based on whether you want to receive calls over the cellular network or in hangouts instead of both. pfmiller The problem is I don't want to choose one or the other. Computator That's the entire point of gv, is it forwards to all of your phones (even if multiple of those "phones" happen to be the same phone), and you can answer from any of them. If you don't answer on one of them, the others will keep ringing until it goes to voicemail. That's by design, but even if they wanted to, they can't make it stop ringing on all phones if you dismiss it on one of your phones. When you dismiss a call, the other end does not receive any information saying you dismissed the call, it just knows you didn't answer. As such, GV has no way to know that you dismissed a call vs your phone was turned off, out of range of a cell tower, you just didn't answer, etc... That said, that capability would be nice if it were possible... pfmiller It used to work right, and now it doesn't. That's all I can say. John Repetti Not switching back until there's a migration tool to move my Google Voice messages out of Hangouts and back into Google Voice. JW I am with you. I wanted to get rid of Hangout with one less app on my phone but I don't want to lose all the messages from last years. One of Google's problem is they have too many teams doing different products for the same function (e.g. messages, navigation) and worse part is those teams are not talking to each other and sharing technology. zach v Don't cry okay? DaveH They are, at the very least, in Gmail. I agree with you but wouldn't hold my breath for that migration tool. Alex Wiesen We are working migrating that data, actually. But there's a lot, so it'll take some time. DaveH http://i.imgur.com/gff5bDf.gif How about VOIP so I don't have to use hangouts? Junt Thank fuck they fixed the double notifications Allen Cross ..Amen to that, But as so often happens with GVoice, it's one step forward and a half-step (at least) back. The update borked my 'Always Ask' setting on a Nexus 5. I want the option of not using Voice for some calls. Until the update, this worked just fine, Now, my Google dialer always tries (and fails) to use Voice before finally giving me the option to use the carrier number. . ASYOUTHIA✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Deleting each text to get rid of the conversation was just plain stupid. I am glad they're letting you delete the whole thing. tim242 But not by long pressing the thread. SMH Bruce This! Right now I have disabled all updates to GV from Titanium Backup. I'm still using the older version. The inability to delete messages was a major reason. Until I get at least deletes on long press and ideally bulk deletes from the list like deleting emails, I'm sticking with the older version. Couldn't care less about MMS and any other UI enhancements they have added at the expense of functionality. tintin.92 What do you guys mean by project fi support? Isn't fi basically the same thing? bozzykid Fi uses Google Voice as the backend but you can't use the GV app for texting. There is lots of speculation that Google is going to be adding Fi support to this app since Hangouts seems to be moving to an enterprise tool. tintin.92 What is the advantage to using the GV app for texting? Texting through your computer? Bruce Yes. Plus, at least for me, that's the only number I give to people. This allows me to be totally independent of carriers, phones, mobile plans etc. I can change providers whenever I want and I simply change the number to forward the call to from my GV setting. Since this is the only number that people have, it's essential that text messages show up as coming from my GV number which people think is my mobile number. I never used that absolute rubbish Hangouts, but free texting (back in the say when carriers used to charge for SMS) and a single number made GV a killer app and one of the many reasons to use Android for me. The Seventh Son They still haven't brought the widget back :( I use GV for voicemail on my main phone and really need the widget to keep track of voicemails hopefully it's in the next update. Chris Skaryd Still missing the widget. :( XgudwilX Why would i want Project Fi support? Hangouts is way better. Hangouts makes calls, texts(sms/mms), video chat, hip and cool GIF's..even some sweet ass stickers. Am I supposed to need another app for my phone number. I even have Allo and Duo for when I'm really bored. Zack Where's Data Calling? And removing the damn SMS Spam Detection system that bans me for 24 hours often? Rod Moore "Calling on Web" What is new here? I don't recall when I couldn't call on my laptop with GV. This is like people saying "You can now send money through Gmail." That is not new either. I done that for years. Sending money through the Gmail Android App is new. Adam Margeson The website for updated with the app refresh and, in typical Google fashion, one of the features that didn't make it into the refreshed interface was the call-a-number feature. That has now been added back in. skeeterfood This version also works with it set to make all calls through Google Voice on my Honor 8. The prior version required me to set it to ask every time or all calls would fail. EarlyMon That was caused by Phone Manager and its services btw. mcdonsco I've been thinking of porting my number to Google voice, but concerned that calls may not be reliable/clear??? I use my phone for my business and thus it had to be reliable and clear. Does GV just forward calls to the cell # that your carrier gave you or is it primarily voip.? Computator It was originally intended to be just call forwarding, and the voip option was added later. I mostly use it with forwarding, and have had no issues with clarity or reliability. I use voip every once in awhile, and it is usually pretty clear as well. mcdonsco And you're using it as your primary number? As in, doesn't matter what your carrier associated number is because you don't use that? Computator Yes, that's correct. I've been doing that for more than five years, and with multiple carrier phone numbers. No one has my carrier number(s) Dee Mann Does your carrier still charge you for minutes used for calls and SMS sent? Or is it all free through GV Computator I use hangouts or the Google voice app to send SMS messages using my Google voice number, so that uses the data network and not carrier sms. For calls, I usually answer from my cellular number which does use carrier minutes of course. However, you can also answer calls in hangouts using VoIP, which uses the data network (or wifi), and hence does not use any carrier minutes. That is what I do with my tablet and my laptop. Picaso86 I want to use the Phone Dialer as my GV. I have a data only plan and its very annoying to use Hangouts Dialer. The UI is horrible in order to dial a contact.... I heard people creating SIP accounts to do this. Any ideas? Computator You used to be able to use GV with SIP accounts, but they removed that functionality several years ago. There are not really any other options for using the native dialer with Google voice. If you want to use the native dialer it pretty much has to go over cellular. You can however use the Google voice app or website interface to call someone. It will ask which phone you want to call them with, and then GV will call you at the number you select. Once you answer, it will connect you to the other person. Hangouts is one of the options to have it call you with, at least on the web version (you can answer that on any of your devices with hangouts of course​). They might have the option to call you on Hangouts in the app as well, but I don't have the version of the app that lets you "make a call" yet. Victor Fantus Will Sprint start allowing there #s on Google Voice again? Miles Reiter Do they not do that anymore? I must be grandfathered in. Charley Birkner Seems they removed the ability to forward/email messages with this update. Searching for instructions on how to do this results in going to the hamburger menu and selecting the legacy/classic version, *sigh* darrsil Still no fix for Google Voice voicemail not working in the Dialer app. Adam Margeson What are you talking about? Just set Google Voice to always be used and the dialer will use it. Or, if you don't want it all the time, set it to ask. darrsil I'm talking about Google Voice VOICEMAIL, not Google Voice calling. It's been broken in the Google Phone app since they redesigned the Google Voice app. Adam Margeson Sorry about that. I had read that "Google Voice" wasn't working. Didn't see the "voicemail" there. My mistake. Rann Xeroxx Deleting (anything) out of Google products is purposely onerous and time consuming. There is not a "delete all" messages, only the ones on the screen. And when you delete, they go into the trash where they live forever. You then have to do into there to delete them forever. Note that even performing this delete is performed in the Legacy GVoice, the new GUI has very piss poor options. Adam Margeson Then keep up on your messages better? It's only if you let them really build up that it becomes an issue. I say that as someone who does let them build up. LG71 I'm getting error with updated client. Anybody else? Milan Hollie How to add contacts Adam Margeson With the contacts app, not GV. Phillip Mitchell I got a new pixel XL a few weeks ago and I can't fucking get Google Voice to act as my voicemail. I'm back to regular caveman voicemail and I can't for the life of me figure out how to fix it and I'm fucking losing my mind. please help.

What once was broken now is fixed: call recording in Google Voice works again Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/15 5:56pm PDTApr 15, 2017 19 Plus 1 on G+ 60 Share on Facebook 49 Share on Twitter Total Shares128 Applications Google News Shortly after bringing it back from the dead, it would appear that Google may have inadvertently broken call recording for a short period. For the last two weeks there have been multiple different user reports of problems with recording calls in Google Voice. Thankfully, the issue appears to have been resolved and recording is now working as intended. While there is not yet any word about the status of recordings presumed lost during this period, all new recordings should behave as expected and appear in your Google Voice inbox. The precise cause of the original problem isn't known. We've reached out to Google for more information. In the meantime Google hasn't made any statements about the matter outside the responses on the forum, so in lieu of an official statement all we can provide is the response given to posts on the subject: Thank you for reporting the issue you had with call recordings. We believe that we have resolved the issue and new call recordings should work as expected. Our engineering team is continuing to investigate the recordings that took place during the time period affected. We will update this thread once we have an update to provide. Thanks for your patience! If you believe you may have been affected, you can check if any of your recordings made during that time are present. If you don't find them in your Google Voice inbox double check by opening the overflow menu on the left, open "Legacy Google Voice," hover over More and select Recorded calls. Recordings should appear there, and if any are missing from the last two weeks you may be among those who have experienced the issue. For those users that might have made recordings while things were broken, it looks like Google is still looking into things and plans on updating the relevant threads later.

What once was broken now is fixed: call recording in Google Voice works again Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/15 5:56pm PDTApr 15, 2017 19 Plus 1 on G+ 60 Share on Facebook 49 Share on Twitter Total Shares128 Applications Google News Shortly after bringing it back from the dead, it would appear that Google may have inadvertently broken call recording for a short period. For the last two weeks there have been multiple different user reports of problems with recording calls in Google Voice. Thankfully, the issue appears to have been resolved and recording is now working as intended. While there is not yet any word about the status of recordings presumed lost during this period, all new recordings should behave as expected and appear in your Google Voice inbox. The precise cause of the original problem isn't known. We've reached out to Google for more information. In the meantime Google hasn't made any statements about the matter outside the responses on the forum, so in lieu of an official statement all we can provide is the response given to posts on the subject: Thank you for reporting the issue you had with call recordings. We believe that we have resolved the issue and new call recordings should work as expected. Our engineering team is continuing to investigate the recordings that took place during the time period affected. We will update this thread once we have an update to provide. Thanks for your patience! If you believe you may have been affected, you can check if any of your recordings made during that time are present. If you don't find them in your Google Voice inbox double check by opening the overflow menu on the left, open "Legacy Google Voice," hover over More and select Recorded calls. Recordings should appear there, and if any are missing from the last two weeks you may be among those who have experienced the issue. For those users that might have made recordings while things were broken, it looks like Google is still looking into things and plans on updating the relevant threads later. If we hear anything more on the subject or if we get a statement we'll be sure to update this post.

What once was broken now is fixed: call recording in Google Voice works again Ryne Hager Follow View All Posts 2017/04/15 5:56pm PDTApr 15, 2017 19 Plus 1 on G+ 60 Share on Facebook 49 Share on Twitter Total Shares128 Applications Google News Shortly after bringing it back from the dead, it would appear that Google may have inadvertently broken call recording for a short period. For the last two weeks there have been multiple different user reports of problems with recording calls in Google Voice. Thankfully, the issue appears to have been resolved and recording is now working as intended. While there is not yet any word about the status of recordings presumed lost during this period, all new recordings should behave as expected and appear in your Google Voice inbox. The precise cause of the original problem isn't known. We've reached out to Google for more information. In the meantime Google hasn't made any statements about the matter outside the responses on the forum, so in lieu of an official statement all we can provide is the response given to posts on the subject: Thank you for reporting the issue you had with call recordings. We believe that we have resolved the issue and new call recordings should work as expected. Our engineering team is continuing to investigate the recordings that took place during the time period affected. We will update this thread once we have an update to provide. Thanks for your patience! If you believe you may have been affected, you can check if any of your recordings made during that time are present. If you don't find them in your Google Voice inbox double check by opening the overflow menu on the left, open "Legacy Google Voice," hover over More and select Recorded calls. Recordings should appear there, and if any are missing from the last two weeks you may be among those who have experienced the issue. For those users that might have made recordings while things were broken, it looks like Google is still looking into things and plans on updating the relevant threads later. If we hear anything more on the subject or if we get a statement we'll be sure to update this post.

Lord Argyris Seeing it pretty much has to be the highlight of my day. And since I'm looking at it at 2:20 AM where I am, I've got nearly 22 more hours to go in which anything could happen, but not likely anything better than this. Godspoken I didn't even read the article, just came to comment about that pic. Gotmilo Shoot wish I can give you reddit gold for that picture Ryne Hager I love my job.

Even everyone not used to this, can make $89/per h easily and the earnings can go even higher over time...

Carson Saldanha Plz Google, let me use the Assistant to send Google Voice messages. Brad Stewart this is huge for Android Auto users as well. SpeakethTheTruth Hey new guy, nice touch on the thumbnail. Now go fetch me some coffee. Marty Tricky Dick says, "Right on!". keithzg And meanwhile SMS support is being removed from Hangouts (despite Google's assurances that Hangouts wasn't going anywhere, I guess they're just gonna rip out features until folks don't use it anymore and then go "oh, well we were gonna support it forever, but nobody's using it, so..."). And Google Voice still isn't available in Canada after all these years. Dammit, Google. ethd Aroo Morenicano I recommended the article because of the thumbnail. More eyes need to see this lol Erick Wright It would be nice if you could check your recording from the new updated less future Rich app... Or hell use Google Assistant to send messages via Google Voice or make Google Voice your default SMS app... One day Google will get it right or someone else will come alone and do it. Kevin Davis Hell yes, awesome picture. Vivek Rameses Screw the article, that's a great picture. I like the new guy. Doby Gillis Most retards do. Techsoul It'd be better if they fixed the bug that doesn't allow you to get a new number at all. Mark Sentesy More important to me is that the new app usually claims the phone has no network connection, when it clearly does. This makes it unusable. So I use an old apk, which works perfectly fine. Latheryin With all the different laws around people need to be careful with call recording. Have to make sure you are aware of the laws for each and every state. Other wise might end up on the bad end of a court case. vwnut13 Google Voice announces to both parties that the call is being recorded. Latheryin Which doesn't mean anything in states where is not allowed at all. Never did understand it personally. If you can't remember what was said on a phone call then it is either not that important or your memory just sucks and you have bigger issues. MG Which doesn't mean anything since all states allow call recording, some just require that all parties involved be notified. Call recording has far more use cases than simply jotting down notes Latheryin Not all states do. The one I live in just made it illegal again to record personal calls. I'm sure for some it does. Can't think of any reason myself but for those with bad memories I can see where it would help. vwnut13 And which state would that be? Latheryin Alaska. IT was voted on last week along with a bunch of other privacy laws. You know things like where you can and cant fly a drone, recording people while they are out at events. You know things like that. Like I said I am sure many people find a use for it. Just not something I would ever use or have a use for. Android Developer Pretty sure normal calls are used more. Why can't they put call recording as a standard on Android?

[Update: Google resolves endless OTA loop] Google is updating Nexus 6P beta testers to the final 7.1.2 build [OTA Download] Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/12 6:00pm PDTApr 12, 2017 64 Plus 1 on G+ 125 Share on Facebook 96 Share on Twitter Total Shares285 Device Updates Downloads Google News Nexus 6P Nexus Devices Nougat 7.0/7.1 Update 1: 2017/04/12 6:04pm PDT Issues with beta OTAs Google's Android beta program allows the more intrepid among you to take a first crack at new updates, but it can be a little irksome to then move to the final build. For example, the 7.1.2 testers are still running the beta while the final version has rolled out to non-testers. Now, it looks like Google has started updating the beta build to final, but only for the Nexus 6P so far. The update clocks in at a mere 25.4MB, which isn't surprising. You're only going from 7.1.2 to a slightly different 7.1.2. The build number when all's said and done will be N2G47H. That's the same build that rolled out to non-testers. There should not be any feature differences between the two versions, but being on the right build means you'll be able to get OTA updates going forward. We don't yet know if this is rolling out to everyone, but check your update menu to be safe. If it's not there, we've got the URL of the OTA on Google's servers. Feel free to sideload it if you can't wait, but remember this is only for the 6P. Hopefully other devices on the beta get updates soon. Update 1: 2017/04/12 6:04pm PDT Issues with beta OTAs We got numerous reports earlier than phones were being offered another update to the beta build after installing the final one. Google neglected to flip some switch on its end to prevent phones from getting the beta OTA again, but that should be fixed now.

JD 1313 Deadend Drive? Manard After taking this update I immediately get offered a new beta-N2G47I. Xious That's the same beta build that is on my Pixel. wjrandon Beta for life. x8123999 Pixel C just got it, too. Build N2G47D. Brian Langlois I got this update. then promptly got the notification that the system update NPG47I was available. Installed that. Then promptly got the notification that This update (N2G47H) was available. It just keeps prompting to update inthenickoftime4 Same MichaelFranz same, but i didnt install the NPG47I. victor sanchez same here. Серёжа Дураков same Jean-Pierre Tavan Same... VAL Same here, weird Brianna D Green Mine did this as well but once your on the (N2G47H), just reset the phone and then go into the update screen in settings and the (NPG47I) update notification disappears. At least it did for me. Lol. James Brown What do you mean by "reset the phone." I have rebooted and gone into settings/system updates but I still get the prompt to download the previous version. Brianna D Green I rebooted after the new update and then once back in the phone, went to the update screen and notification disappeared after hitting check for update. James Brown Didn't work for me. Minty Yeah I think it's happening to everyone. I just let it put me back on to stable again and then unenrolled from the beta program so I would stop getting them. T4rd It's times like this when I'm glad I'm just on Pure Nexus ROM. =p Vedang Jadhav This is new loop man, If you are not getting bootloop, Google is ensuring you atleast get this loop!! danthepotato Thank god I'm not the only one... I tried using the chat help on the settings. The guy basically told me I should opt out of beta, but I don't want to wipe my phone... JamesBennett360 If you update then opt out it will not wipe your device. I did it myself Carolacoffman Google is paying 97$ per hour! Work for few hours & have longer with friends and family! !sw301c: On tuesday I got a great new Land Rover Range Rover from having earned $8752 this last four weeks..

Good to go VAL just unenrrolled the beta program and won´t show up F4LL0U7 Same. I'll just deal with the update icon for now until they fix it. Not interested in unenrolling and wiping my phone. rasty++ no wipe if you have n2g... Ronald Yup same issue, did the update got the notification downloaded the NPG47I but have not installed it yet Josh Hamer Yup, same thing happening to me Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google employs only the best and brightest. André Pudiesi Same here. Final, then prompted me the Beta again. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/b59969b13e033f7b043512da60a6f94086726e1588fc48382fcdd40bcad52140.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0da4868bacccbb1d7ce49e3c804e23e92904bd5251a4eebb9a7de486b9d3aa17.png Curt Same. LondonLeedsFan Right.... So i got the stable build (25mb), and the beta build 1313.6mb straight after... I'm confused?! Midnitte Want the next update? Now, always have an update available! Chisel I'm also getting the NPG47I «--» N2G47H loop. Weird. phineasjw Yep. Same thing. Took the opportunity to leave the Beta program. Just make sure you leave when running N2G47H. tonyc That's the same thing that keeps happening to me. Garry I just cleared the app data for Google Play Services and so far that has alleviated the problem. Artem Russakovskii Google fixed the endless loop, guys. https://www.reddit.com/r/Nexus6P/comments/6504su/anyone_else_get_a_stable_712_update_then/dg6oj2l/. Djakdekiel ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Same update for Nexus 5x alexus after I pulled this update, I got another one right after (build NPG471) Mitch G yeah, it keeps pushing old build on top of new build TxReplay Got it on Nexus 5X too ! clay hope this fixes the shutdowns when there is clearly battery left. my phone shuts down when it hits 15% left and wont turn back on until i charge K9 A bit off topic i haven't recieved assistant yet and i was thinking it was cause i was in beta. I just got the stable 7.1.2 but still no assistant. Services apps is up to date but nothing still. Wht shd i do? Carson Saldanha Is your Google app on English (US)? K9 Yes it is Carson Saldanha rip idk lol rasty++ stop ota please ..8 ota in 2 hours.. -.- Kyle Smith Got this on Nexus Player also, I like the new update animation and loading bar Ernie If you update to N2G47H and you are on the beta program. You will have to unenroll from the beta. rmagruder Just spotted this and unenrolled from the beta and annoying update message went away. Guess I'll stay out of the beta until they actually push out the next beta. 2 Men-E ...sooooo...after the comments, and selecting "Download", but before selecting "Install"...I shouldn't complete the update to this "final" 7.1.2 build [being that my 6P will just do OTA loops] 🤔 rmagruder Good LORD, Google. I just got this on my 6P. It updated the phone, and after rebooting with the final 7.1.2, it promptly gave me a new System update available message wanting to install a beta version of 7.1.2 (HPG47I) at a hefty cost of 1313.6Mb. What the heck? That was what I was JUST ON before getting the FINAL OTA. George Hadjidakis Just opt out from the beta program then back in and then out again and it will go.. Bruno Montini To everyone getting the update prompt again and again, clear cache partition, it fixed it for me I also left the beta before clearing cache Lateef Alabi-Oki If you "Check For Update" on the Nexus 5x you might get it too. I got it that way. Tim Meader Once you have the official update (installed) and have booted back up... just IGNORE the prompt to update back to the beta version. Go into the Beta Program settings and leave the program. Problem solved. F4LL0U7 I'm not looking to factory reset OR leave the beta program though... I'd imagine they have to fix this if so many people are getting it, right? Tim Meader There's no need to be in the beta program right now since there's no actual beta. You can easily go back to it at any time via the same method, that's not an issue. It takes 5 seconds to sign back up. As I said, if you've already installed the release update and rebooted, leaving the beta won't factory reset anything. F4LL0U7 Oh cool, I didn't realize you could opt out without wiping once you were on stable. Thanks! Razed Does this address the 6P battery issues? F4LL0U7 I just got updated to the final 7.1.2 build on my Nexus 5X (N2G47F). Same thing, around 25MB. And then a funny thing happened. I immediately was prompted to download and install the beta 2 (NPG47I). I am ignoring it for now, because I would imagine that installing that will knock me back to the pre-release version of 7.1.2, which I don't want. Anyone else getting this? TBBT+HIMYM The same thing with me. I should try to get out of beta probably. TBBT+HIMYM Yes. It works. F4LL0U7 But you probably had to wipe your phone when exiting the beta, right? TBBT+HIMYM No. Ignore the beta version message. Exit the beta and the message just disappears by itself. Wipe is not necessary. F4LL0U7 Awesome, thanks! danthepotato Opting out once you are on N2G47H solves the problem, without a pesky notification or need to wipe your phone Jacob Mcalister Tattoos I'm still on the beta on pixel xl.. anyone else like this? Anthony Castanza Small Pixel, still on beta, no OTA in sight. el_smurfo How do you have a 6P with the battery so low to update, yet it hasn't long since shut off prematurely at 30-40%? noneofthem Thanks, everybody. I was afraid to be the only one with that issue. I hope Google will find a solution to this fast. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google phone users are always bragging that they're the first to get updates. Now Google has taken it to the next level. Google phone users are the first to get into a continuous, never-ending update loop. Callanish Pure hyperbolic bullshit. There never was a never-ending update loop. All anyone had to do was pay attention to what was going on with the updates and have an incline of knowledge about what it means to be enrolled in the beta program. They'd have seen that the patch was upgrading them to the stable 7.1.2 release. They would have then seen, after rebooting, that there was a glitch with a beta installation trying to get them to install itself over a stable version. Beta 101 enrollment and research would have told them that if they were on a stable version, unenrolling from the beta program would not delete their data and any notification asking them to revert back to a beta version would be gone once unenrolled. That would have eliminated something easily solveable and have avoided giving someone like you a smug 'sky is falling' response making it seem like all this was a big deal. If you're going to be a guinea pig, by running a beta version on a phone, you've got to take some responsibility when things go pear shape and at least use common sense and learn the basics of being part of the beta program beforehand so you can at least recognize when, in this case, the user is causing the loop themselves by continuously downloading whatever the Google Notification is telling them to download and not paying attention to the fact that they are installing a beta version over a stable version creating this self inflicted problem. Charlie I have the same issue. I was confused a bit too. But I think what is going on is the final build date is after the beta 2 build date. So to the system it looks like your not on the latest build. That is why we could not side load the OTA without opting out of beta program because if your on beta 2 it looks like your on the latest build. I don't know why they do that but this is not the first time it has happened. Usually they fix the issue before the OTA is sent out so we don't get the notification for the beta build though. Lucas Cannon 5X as well, received an update stating it would be build N2G47H, then after reboot says build N2G47F. Andre Laurence I just got the final version update. It was a flawless install. FCEEVIPER I installed the OTA NPG47I, then I turned away from my phone and saw the phone was asking for a restartinstall but I did not notice that the restart would be installing NPG471. Maybe I should be paying more attention. : Should I opt out of beta to get the stable build? I'm confused. Erroneus When you have the final version installed (N2G47H), opt out of the beta program. That solves it. KosmoCrisis Me too. Nexus 6p on Project Fi, no different. This type of loop is not fun. onekage Thought it was strange to receive a beta update after receiving the​ final version I had been waiting for, for over a week. Let's hope battery life is a little better... But with a 25mb update I don't have much hope. Hopefully they do something cool with O. BBpost As someone mentioned below, I cleared out the cache for Google Play Services while on N2G47H and rebooted. This fixed the constant update cycle bug. Alvin persaud Install the "h" update first then "I" update (large)when it prompts u back to update to "h" just restart the phone and it should be good to go. Dan Zunko Nexus 5x just got the update. No loop so far. M.R. Betz 5X is up too. N2G47F for my 5X. jdawg0024 Google is also updating the Nexus 5x beta to final as well. I got the update just an hour ago TheDrunkenClam I have tried three times to install this OTA using Flashfire and cannot for the life of me get it to work. Flashfire detects it just fine, but once it fails, I don't know where the OTA resides after it is downloaded so I cannot find where it is to get it to try again (Flashfire doesn't automatically see it on the second attempt after that initial attempt for some reason). So I have been opting out of beta and then back in for it to re download the OTA and thus have Flashfire recognize. 1. Where does the OTA resides after it's downloaded? 2. Any settings in Flashfire that I should look for? idna As far as I can remember, the OTA resides in /data/ota_package (N5X, but it should be the same). And FlashFire can detect it if it's there. But in the past I noticed another location (complicated path, don't remember it now) had been used and indeed, it was not visible for FlashFire - and when I pointed the program to this location it didn't detect anything. What I would recommend is to simply grab the 7.1.2 factory image, opt out of the beta program and simply write this (factory) image with FlashFire, of course without overwriting the userdata partition. That's what I did when the images where released some weeks ago, I couldn't wait for Google to push this special OTA for those of us using the beta program. lomsha The notification finally went away on O. Margaritas Ante Porcos Nexus 6p owners, don't rush to update. My 6p's battery dies within few moments after I've updated from 7.1.1. to 7.1.2. You know how Google reacts to this. Google ignores anything. Morenicano In celebration of fixing the update loop, Google has decided to make another message app F4LL0U7 This one will have a built-in shopping list, but users will only be able to access it via Google Glass. Morenicano ...and the Nexus Q 2 Men-E For some reason my 6P is no longer receiving this final OTA. I downloaded it early today, but did not install it. Since then, I rebooted my 6P, and the install notification went away, and now when I check for updates, nothing is there. AnthonyRyan89 I got the final build update today and updated it then an hour later I got another update for the beta again. Curt Left the beta now. Leeroy Jenkins Feels good to be a pixel user ;) oneyedmonkey Feels good to be a P̶i̶x̶e̶l̶ Nexus user ;) iboalali I got this update got my Nexus 5x yesterday sebastianer This is good. With the 5X after the previous beta, they took more than a month to release the OTA from Beta to Stable. Now only just a week. But from M to N...they released the stable OTA asap, maybe even before the official OTA. and that was even better. Rob Paek I hope this fixes the app crashing I've had lately Keith Boykin I'm stuck on NP47I and it keeps saying it is up to date. Guess I'll have to remove from beta and then re-enroll Marty Wait...Isn't "I" after "H"? Mine shows NPG47I. Why would an "update" be named in a retroactive manner? mrjayviper Goggle with all the feels on its payroll can't solve/perfect OTA updates Wy Elkins Happened on my Nexus 5X yesterday. Finally settled down. Got the April Security update this morning. PP Well... Battery life is better... Less laggy, but cashes more app, now freeze instead of lagging, system UI crashes all the time . Heat problem is not solved. It's not heat as much as my G3 but you see it's taking a great toll on fluidity and stability. If I put it on a ice pack, it's almost instantaneous the gain of speed and fluidity witch lead me to find out that body temperature is bit too hot but room temperature is blazing fast.... I think I found the 801 and 810 heat problem.... They messed up with the temperature target for best operation at the semiconductor plant... It should be body temperature and bit up not room.....

Now the "skinny bundle" is disrupting that model with internet-delivered packages offering live and on-demand programs. Google's YouTube TV is the latest to enter this market with its bundle of around 40 channels for $35 monthly, challenging slim packages from Sony's PlayStation Vue, Dish Network's Sling TV and AT&T's DirecTV Now. More entrants are expected including one from streaming service Hulu. These services offer easy interfaces like those of on-demand services such as Netflix and Amazon Prime, let viewers digitally store programs in the internet "cloud," and toss in a limited selection of live channels to sate news and sports or other interests. Skinny offerings are aimed at young viewers and "cord cutters" loath to pay $100 or more to be force-fed hundreds of channels in hefty bundles and accustomed to streaming shows they want, when they desire. A Parks Associates survey last month found 20 percent of American consumers dissatisfied with their pay TV service, leaving the market ripe for change. Analyst Glenn Hower at Parks said the market is in flux, with some consumers taking advantage of the easy sign-up for skinny packages, even though some cancel just as quickly. In addition to lower prices, he said, "you don't have to worry about sending out a technician, you don't have to worry about getting the equipment back." BTIG Research analyst Richard Greenfield, in a research note titled "the big bundle is doomed," says he expects skinny bundles to eat away at the established pay-TV providers. Established media companies are focusing too hard on "protecting their legacy business model" instead of giving consumers the flexibility they want, Greenfield wrote this month. Leichtman Research Group found that the top US cable companies lost 277,000 subscribers in 2016, while internet-delivered services like Sling TV and DirecTV Now added about 845,000. These shifts could lead to a huge upheaval in the television ecosystem, allowing more choices and lower costs for consumers in many cases, while leaving smaller, independent cable channels out in the cold. The skinny bundles "have made inroads in the past year," said Leichtman Research president Bruce Leichtman. - Digital platforms rise - Forrester Research analyst James McQuivey said Google's entry into the business is significant because "for the first time, the broadcasters are letting a powerful digital platform have the keys to its treasure room: live, first-run TV shows." He noted that major tech firms like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft "have tried to cozy up to TV for many years now, and all of them have been rebuffed" until now. "The digital platforms are indeed taking over the world, this time with permission from their former adversaries," he said in a blog post. While many consumers use on-demand options like Amazon and Netflix, they often keep cable or satellite subscriptions for live sports and local news. But live channels will make streaming options more attractive. At the same time, popular channels such as HBO and sports programmer ESPN have been offering standalone subscriptions to allow consumers to watch without a bundle from cable or satellite. But independent television analyst Alan Wolk argues that the major pay TV firms remain in good shape despite these challenges. Some like AT&T already have a "skinny" offering, and others such as Comcast and Verizon are expected to enter the market to give consumers a choice. Wolk said consumers don't appear to be flocking to skinny bundles because "they pay 30 percent less dollars but get 70 percent less content." He added that "a lot of people think they want to cut back but when you ask them which channels they want to eliminate they have trouble cutting back to the bare minimum." - Striking back - Wolk noted that the large pay TV operators have an advantage because they offer broadband internet, and in some cases are the dominant provider in a region. This allows them to offer incentives which bundle internet and television. The large operators can also squeeze out rivals by using data caps or other means to favor their own streaming service, and will not likely face regulatory impediments from doing so in the current political environment, he said. Operators are also keeping customers with "TV everywhere" which allows subscribers to watch the same content on mobile devices or while traveling, he noted. One impact from the shift to streaming is that providers will know more about customer habits, to be able to deliver advertising targeted to each user. That's positive for marketing, but could be a privacy worry as tech firms build up detailed profiles on consumers. Google in particular can refine its ad model by using data on viewing habits, analysts note. With streaming, Wolk said, Google and others "get a ton of data about users and what they are up to, and they can cross-reference that with your browsing habits."

A Parks Associates survey last month found 20 per cent of American consumers dissatisfied with their pay TV service, leaving the market ripe for change. Analyst Glenn Hower at Parks said the market is in flux, with some consumers taking advantage of the easy sign-up for skinny packages, even though some cancel just as quickly. In addition to lower prices, he said, “you don’t have to worry about sending out a technician, you don’t have to worry about getting the equipment back.” BTIG Research analyst Richard Greenfield, in a research note titled “the big bundle is doomed,” says he expects skinny bundles to eat away at the established pay-TV providers. Established media companies are focusing too hard on “protecting their legacy business model” instead of giving consumers the flexibility they want, Greenfield wrote this month. Leichtman Research Group found that the top US cable companies lost 277,000 subscribers in 2016, while internet-delivered services like Sling TV and DirecTV Now added about 845,000. These shifts could lead to a huge upheaval in the television ecosystem, allowing more choices and lower costs for consumers in many cases, while leaving smaller, independent cable channels out in the cold.  The skinny bundles “have made inroads in the past year,” said Leichtman Research president Bruce Leichtman. Digital platforms rise Forrester Research analyst James McQuivey said Google’s entry into the business is significant because “for the first time, the broadcasters are letting a powerful digital platform have the keys to its treasure room: live, first-run TV shows.” He noted that major tech firms like Amazon, Apple, Facebook, Google, and Microsoft “have tried to cosy up to TV for many years now, and all of them have been rebuffed” until now. “The digital platforms are indeed taking over the world, this time with permission from their former adversaries,” he said in a blog post. While many consumers use on-demand options like Amazon and Netflix, they often keep cable or satellite subscriptions for live sports and local news. But live channels will make streaming options more attractive. At the same time, popular channels such as HBO and sports programmer ESPN have been offering standalone subscriptions to allow consumers to watch without a bundle from cable or satellite. But independent television analyst Alan Wolk argues that the major pay TV firms remain in good shape despite these challenges. Some like AT&T already have a “skinny” offering, and others such as Comcast and Verizon are expected to enter the market to give consumers a choice. Wolk said consumers don’t appear to be flocking to skinny bundles because “they pay 30 per cent less dollars but get 70 per cent less content.” He added that “a lot of people think they want to cut back but when you ask them which channels they want to eliminate they have trouble cutting back to the bare minimum.” Striking back Wolk noted that the large pay TV operators have an advantage because they offer broadband internet, and in some cases are the dominant provider in a region. This allows them to offer incentives which bundle internet and television. The large operators can also squeeze out rivals by using data caps or other means to favour their own streaming service, and will not likely face regulatory impediments from doing so in the current political environment, he said. Operators are also keeping customers with “TV everywhere” which allows subscribers to watch the same content on mobile devices or while travelling, he noted. One impact from the shift to streaming is that providers will know more about customer habits, to be able to deliver advertising targeted to each user. That’s positive for marketing, but could be a privacy worry as tech firms build up detailed profiles on consumers. Google in particular can refine its ad model by using data on viewing habits, analysts note. With streaming, Wolk said, Google and others “get a ton of data about users and what they are up to, and they can cross-reference that with your browsing habits.” — AFP                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week X-rated snaps of Miley Cyrus, Rosario Dawson, Suki Waterhouse allegedly leaked online ‘Skinny bundles’ streaming services step up challenge to US Big Cable Sheila Majid takes a swipe at hit radio Streaming keeps Drake’s ‘More Life’ atop Billboard 200 chart Drake unshakeable on Billboard 200 with 'More Life' Drake unshakeable on Billboard 200 with 'More Life' X-rated snaps of Miley Cyrus, Rosario Dawson, Suki Waterhouse allegedly leaked online Streaming keeps Drake’s ‘More Life’ atop Billboard 200 chart Sheila Majid takes a swipe at hit radio Mariah Carey reportedly dumps toy boy Bryan Tanaka Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Greek Orthodox Patriarch leads Holy Fire ceremony in Jerusalem Reuters Video: Beating climate-change odds, a wolverine is born in Belgium Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Jimmy Kimmel roasts United Airlines NYT Video: Food of the gods — ambrosia cake Related Articles A new horror series in the pipeline for Netflix Bogdanovich: My promise to finish Orson’s last movie Gritty war action in Netflix’s ‘War Machine’ (VIDEO) Barry Jenkins, Nicolas Winding Refn, David O.

For the last two weeks there have been multiple different user reports of problems with recording calls in Google Voice. Thankfully, the issue appears to have been resolved and recording is now working as intended. While there is not yet any word about the status of recordings presumed lost during this period, all new recordings should behave as expected and appear in your Google Voice inbox. The precise cause of the original problem isn't known. We've reached out to Google for more information. In the meantime Google hasn't made any statements about the matter outside the responses on the forum, so in lieu of an official statement all we can provide is the response given to posts on the subject: Thank you for reporting the issue you had with call recordings. We believe that we have resolved the issue and new call recordings should work as expected. Our engineering team is continuing to investigate the recordings that took place during the time period affected. We will update this thread once we have an update to provide. Thanks for your patience! If you believe you may have been affected, you can check if any of your recordings made during that time are present. If you don't find them in your Google Voice inbox double check by opening the overflow menu on the left, open "Legacy Google Voice," hover over More and select Recorded calls. Recordings should appear there, and if any are missing from the last two weeks you may be among those who have experienced the issue. For those users that might have made recordings while things were broken, it looks like Google is still looking into things and plans on updating the relevant threads later. If we hear anything more on the subject or if we get a statement we'll be sure to update this post.

While SEO started out as a marketers game, it has become a developer’s game in 2017. With machine learning and algorithms becoming more complex, SEO is definitely more technical in nature than any of us could’ve imagined. As a former web developer of many years, I welcome this change to the more technical realm, but the downside is that it excludes others who are not so tech-oriented. That being said, there are practical things you can do to boost your SEO without becoming a developer: Deliver a Great User Interface (UI) For a long time user interfaces have been given a back seat when it comes to SEO. Since Google’s now famous “Mobile-geddon,” UI is happily riding shotgun in any progressive SEO strategy. Testing your UI is as easy as looking at your mobile site. For example, nobody likes popups that block your site on a mobile device, or any site that is difficult to use. Anything that makes the user experience better helps your Google ranking and boosts your SEO. “I Feel the Need, the Need for Speed” Tom Cruise may have had a “need for speed” in 1986’s Top Gun, but your website needs it even more in 2017. Programs such as Google AMP highlight that the quicker a site loads, the better it will be treated search results. Whether it’s simply making your site run more quickly, or even implementing AMP itself (which can easily be done using a WordPress plugin), there’s no excuse for not pursuing your own need for speed. If you’re no longer using Hubspot or that cool new analytics package, get rid of it. Everything we ask the browser to render leaves users hanging and waiting. The more we ask our users to wait, the less they will. Comprehensive Analytics Understandable and straightforward analytics are key to understanding how your site is performing. Data makes the world go round, so make sure to have analytics on hand to track down site problems, or ways you can be doing things better.   A great way to keep key stakeholders happy is to give them access to the right digestible and easy to use data. There is a marketplace for aesthetically pleasing and highly functional dashboards and other custom reports that are prebuilt and can be easily customizable with a few tweaks. A good analytics program can be like a dog: a person’s best friend but one that doesn’t need to be taken for walk. The main issue I see organizations deal with is analysis paralysis. We have all this data, but what do we do with it? Pick only three or four key metrics and measure the same ones over time, such as time on site, conversions, or overall organic traffic to the site. If you’re looking to keyword optimize a certain page for a certain thing, then monitor the specific page’s organic traffic over time. Social Media Tuning There’s no point in having a website if no one knows where to find it. This is where social media tuning is important. As social platforms like Facebook, Snapchat, Twitter, and others become more vital to people, it is equally important to have a vital social media presence.  Keep your social medial fine-tuned to include regular updates and customer engagement so that your customers not only know you exist, but what you are up to and where to find you as well.   Unless you’re in the cannabis industry, don’t let the grass grow under your feet.  Spread out your social media amongst the platforms, and keep an eye on any new or emerging platform.  This way, if, for example, Facebook makes a change that cramps your style, you don’t want to start from scratch with the next platform and lose revenue in the interim.  Constant tuning is constant innovation.   Be More Secure With the current White House recently signing a law allowing ISP’s to collect and sell your browsing data, internet privacy and security should be at the top of your mind more than ever. What has that got to do with SEO? Well the best offense is a good defense. Google now warns people that sites the they’re visiting are not secure. While Google has not come out and promised to punish site’s search results for not being secure, it’s conceivable that day may be on the horizon. Google doesn’t want to return results that cannot be trusted, and SSL is the easiest way to build that trust. If you don’t use it already, move to using an SSL certificate now to make sure your site is not sitting in the penalty box. All of these strategies and much more can be found in my newly released book The SEO Battlefield: Winning Strategies for Search Marketing Programs, available at Amazon.com, Barnes & Noble and OReilly.com.

Earlier this year, Google confirmed an Android 7.1.2 update for its Pixel and Nexus-branded devices. The company then put the Android 7.1.2 Nougat update into beta ahead of an unannounced release for the Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, and others. In early April, Google pulled the Nexus 5X Android 7.1.2 Nougat update from beta and began rolling it out to owners around the world. Android 7.1.2 Nougat isn’t as big as Android 7.1.1 or Android 7.0 but it’s an important update for the Nexus 5X and that’s precisely why we’re taking a close look at it today. The Nexus 5X Android 7.1.2 update is a maintenance release which means its focused on improving performance. That said, it also comes with some brand new features including a useful fingerprint scanner gesture. It’s a substantial release for the Nexus 5X. Today we want to go over the most important things you know to know, right now, about the Nexus 5X Android 7.1.2 update, its roll out, its problems, and its performance. We also include some tips that might help you get through the update unscathed. Quick Nexus 5X Android 7.1.2 Nougat Review   1 / 9 We recently received the Nexus 5X Android 7.1.2 update Over-the-Air (OTA), a sign that Google's roll out is making progress.  If you're still waiting for the Nexus 5X Android 7.1.2 Nougat OTA, or if it's there and you're simply feeling hesitant, here are a few things to know about the download/installation process.  The device's Android 7.1.2 update is several hundred MB. It took us a couple of minutes to download over a high-speed Wi-Fi network. The installation process took much longer, around 10 minutes or so. (Note: If you've skipped any of the monthly security updates, you'll need to download those before you can download the Android 7.1.2 OTA.) We recommend putting aside 15-20 minutes to monitor the Android 7.1.2 download and installation. We didn't run into any problems but you might.  We've been using the update for a little over a week now and Android 7.1.2 is still performing well on our Nexus 5X.  Battery life is excellent. We haven't noticed any weird drain during our time with the new software. Connectivity is also strong and we haven't noticed any issues with Wi-Fi, Bluetooth or cellular data. At least not yet.  The phone's UI is still fast. That's important for a device that was first released all the way back in 2015. Hard to believe its been that long since launch.  We haven't run into any bugs or serious problems but again we've only been using the Android 7.1.2 update for a week and bugs can popup at anytime. Another note: We've been hearing and seeing complaints about the fingerprint sensor but ours is working properly. Given what's on board (security patches, new features, bug fixes) and given its steady performance, you'll definitely want to consider installing it on your Nexus 5X.  If you're having a pleasant experience on Android 7.1.1 Nougat or below, be sure to take your time. Dig into additional feedback if you start feeling leery. We've put together a list of reasons to, and not to, install Android 7.1.2. It could help.    1 / 9 11 Responses 04/05/2017 Joe Reply I encountered some serious problems with 7.1.2 on my Nexus 6P, so much so that I had to roll back to 7.1.1. Furthermore, when I rolled back, I repeatedly saw dialog boxes telling me that a system app (I think something with the word “core” in the name) had crashed; every time I’d dismiss one, another would pop up. I had to do a factory reset to eliminate the problem. Anyway, the problems I experienced with 7.1.2 were: no notification (status) bar; no ability to access Quick Settings or notifications except from the home screen; the background, text, and icons in Quick Settings were all white, making them nearly unreadable (fortunately, the text/icons and background were a slightly different shade of white from each other!); USB audio was broken, resulting in my USB audio interface crashing my USB audio applications. 04/06/2017 sohil shriyan Reply since the update my phone has continued crashing and rebooting automatically every 5 mins or so and it doesnt even restart its just the whole thing wherein the colorful circles go round and round this is post the google sign and before the android sign. Reset my phone to factory settings but the issue still persists. kindly advise on a solution to this. 04/07/2017 MrAndroid Reply You will need to re-flash the device. Check out the wugfresh Nexus Root Toolkit. It can help you re-flash your device to factory fresh images. 04/07/2017 Ajay Goel Reply I need some help !! Since the time my phone updated to 7.1.1, I have been facing a problem. While everything else is working fine, internet works only on a Wi-Fi network but not on my mobile data network. I have shown it everywhere possible but am still facing this problem. Ajay Goel India 04/07/2017 Eli Reply My 5x has a decreased Bluetooth performance since the update. I have a Garmin Fenix 3 watch that would always reconnect when it came back into range with the phone. After the update, the connection reattempts are much less frequent and sometimes it will not reconnect until the phone is rebooted. The was no update to the Fenix. Additionally, using Bluetooth in my car results in studdering audio until I turn the WiFi off. 04/07/2017 Ian Fuller Reply My Nexus 5x was recently updated, and immediately after the initial boot it went into a boot loop. Luckily I did a hard restart and it booted just fine. Otherwise the update has been great. Good battery life, no studders, and no connectivity problems. 04/07/2017 Kuruvilla Eapen Reply Yes, it’s just working fine, love the Nexus 5x like always. Seems to be a bit more smoother with the update. 04/07/2017 Swap Reply Poor article. No substantial information provided. 04/08/2017 Gauruv Grover Reply My Nexus 5x got stuck in Bootloop 4 days after updating to 7.1.2. Please be careful while updating yours. 04/09/2017 A Got Reply The update rendered my phone useless, causing it to go into a restart loop. LG is not taking care of me, and google is doing nothing either. This is why people buy apple. I’ve never owned an apple product. I will never buy another google product. 04/15/2017 lakawak Reply IT is causing a severe battery drain on mine. Like 3% every hour with the phone simply on and not being used at all. Not even the screen on. I have a very bare bones set up..cell daa turned off. No Bluetooth, NO push notifications..nothing. Before the update, with my usual light use (still more than not where it is draining 2-3% an hour) it would drain about 20% a day. Now it is up to 60-70% a day with NO use. They want me to do a factory reset. Not sure what good it will do since it will immediately want to update. So I would be stuck with either the very old one, or the new one that is causing the problem entirely. It isn’t as if it will let me only install the last one that worked fine. And since I don’t sync my phone, it would be a huge pain in the ass Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published. Comment Name* Email* Website

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 125 Plus 1 on G+ 278 Share on Facebook 78 Share on Twitter Total Shares481 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 141k 106k Latest Deals 14 [Deal Alert] Get a 75" Sony LED UHD Android TV from Best Buy for $2150 today ($650 off) 2017/04/15 4:13pm PDTApr 15, 2017 19 [Deal Alert] Huawei Watch in Black Stainless Steel w/metal band $250 ($100 off) 2017/04/14 6:36pm PDTApr 14, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] 55 temporarily free and on-sale apps to round out your week 2017/04/14 12:50pm PDTApr 14, 2017 13 [Deal Alert] 2-Pack 6' Anker USB 3.0 A to C cables $12 w/ promo ($8 off) 2017/04/13 4:16pm PDTApr 13, 2017 32 [Deal Alert] NVIDIA is having a SHIELD gaming spring sale 2017/04/13 2:17pm PDTApr 13, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?

Claims aside, the US tech giant's partnership with Indian Railways to provide free Wi-Fi services to railway stations across the country is commendable, to say the least. By: Kunal Doley | Published: April 16, 2017 3:31 AM For one, the project touches the nerve centre of India—the railways—which is still the primary mode of transportation for a majority of Indians. Google has termed it “the biggest and fastest public Wi-Fi” project in the world. Claims aside, the US tech giant’s partnership with Indian Railways to provide free Wi-Fi services to railway stations across the country is commendable, to say the least. For one, the project touches the nerve centre of India—the railways—which is still the primary mode of transportation for a majority of Indians. Every year, over 8.1 billion passengers travel on trains. That roughly translates to over 22 million passengers a day. As per Google, over five million people in the country are latching on to its free Internet service every month (about 1.7 lakh people everyday). Of this, 15,000 people are accessing the Internet for the first time in their lives everyday, the company said. That’s a whole lot of users. The free Wi-Fi is finding more takers in smaller cities than in larger ones, given the poor connectivity of high-speed broadband outside of the major metropolitan centres. Also, the free Internet is much faster than 3G Internet that is most widely used in India. On an average, users of the free railway-station Internet—despite being in transit, and being limited to one hour of usage per person per day—are utilising 15 times more data than they would consume on 3G in a day, Google said. The ambitious railway Wi-Fi project has come a long way since September 12, 2015, when Indian Railways announced its partnership with Google. After starting with Mumbai Central—which, in January last year, became the first railway station in the country to offer free Wi-Fi facility—the railways continued connecting other busy stations such as Bhubaneswar, Bengaluru, Howrah, Kanpur, Mathura, Aligarh, Bareilly and Varanasi with the free Internet service. At last count, 115 stations across the country have been covered under this scheme. The target is to reach 400 stations by the end of this year, sources say. As per reports, the project employs Google’s Fiber technology, through which the company provides Internet services with a speed of 1 Gbps. Google Fiber was launched in 2010 and the service is available only in the US at the moment. Meanwhile, aiming to provide connectivity in remote areas, Indian Railways has announced that it will set up Wi-Fi hotspot kiosks at about 500 stations and help people access an array of online services, including various government schemes. Christened ‘Railwire Saathi’, the Wi-Fi kiosks will function like a PCO for ‘Digital India’ and enable people to use services like e-commerce, online banking, besides offering them access to insurance schemes, e-ticketing for train and bus services, etc. Automated form-filling, and mobile and DTH recharge are other services that Railwire Saathi is expected to provide in areas with limited connectivity.

But today, Android updates are sucking for a completely different reason. Don't Miss: Court forces PornHub to reveal names and viewing histories of some users Users on Google’s product forums are complaining that the latest version of Android Nougat, v7.1.2, is bricking the fingerprint sensors on their phones. Affected devices reportedly include the Google-made Pixel and Pixel XL, as well as the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P. Those are all devices either made by Google, or by a third-party manufacturer in cooperation with Google. They also all run stock Android, which is why they’re able to be updated before any other device. According to users, the fingerprint sensor itself doesn’t work, but it’s clearly not a hardware problem: the sensor only stops working after the update, and the gesture control functions of the sensor (which let you swipe over the fingerprint reader to trigger an action) are still working fine. Even deleting fingerprints and trying to add new ones doesn’t work, which rules out some kind of issue with the stock launcher software. There’s no known fix or public comment from Google at this time, so if you’re on one of these devices and thinking about updating, it’s probably a good idea to hold off. It’s also a handy reminder to keep a good backup of your device up-to-date, especially if you’re the kind of person who installs the latest updates the second they become available.

There is, it turns out, no limit to the number of times a child will find it hilarious to say ‘Play the Power Rangers theme tune!’ and have a talking plant pot politely oblige.  In the future, personal assistant gadgets like Google Home are likely to be as ubiquitous as smartphones are now – and asking something that looks like an IKEA vase whether you have any meetings scheduled will seem normal, rather than completely deranged.  While Home is fairly cheap at £129, it can quickly become an expensive habit as you buy stuff to plug into it – to watch TV via Netflix or YouTube, you need Google’s Chromecast gizmo, for example A week on, I still feel like I’m one of those eccentrics who talks to his plants when I say ‘Set an alarm for 3pm’ or yell ‘OK Google, stop!’ whenever I hear the first bars of the Power Rangers theme. Google’s Home is a rival to Amazon’s Echo – allowing you to play music, control your TV, listen to weather forecasts and search for answers via voice (from up to 20ft).  Home displays its voice-controlled prowess by having no buttons on the front (although there’s one on the back to turn off the microphone, in a chilling reminder that the thing is actually listening to you all the time unless you press it).  When you say the magic ‘wake word’ ‘OK Google’ four rainbow lights swirl around, and a polite computer voice that sounds as if it would probably murder you in a sci-fi film answers.  IT'S A FACT  If you ask Google Home ‘Do you speak in Morse Code?’, it will actually reply in Morse Code, with a series of dots and dashes meaning ‘Yes’. While Home is fairly cheap at £129, it can quickly become an expensive habit as you buy stuff to plug into it – to watch TV via Netflix or YouTube, you need Google’s Chromecast gizmo, for example.  Alpha nerds will immediately want to connect lighting systems such as Philips Hue – and I’m enough of a geek to admit that it’s a real hairs-on-the-back-of-the-neck moment to say ‘Lights’ and have a room light up. I should probably get out more.  Home has better voice recognition than Amazon’s Echo, and an impressive range of powers. At the moment, though, these things aren’t really essential – they’re aimed at people (like me) who want to pretend they’re in Star Trek, rather than sitting in a suburban spare room turning the lights on and off.   Share or comment on this article e-mail Comments 0 Share what you think No comments have so far been submitted.

Published on April 15, 2017. 0 Google has just started to roll out the stable version of the Android 7.1.2 update for the Nexus 6P smartphone. More precisely, if you are enrolled in the Beta program, then you should receive it soon. The latest update wears the build number N2G47H and it weighs almost 26 MB. Rolling It Out According to Android Police, the new update targets the Nexus 6P users that are already enrolled in the special beta program and who had installed the beta build. Finally, now they can enjoy the stable final build. You can find the OTA file (over-the-air) on the Google servers, if you are too anxious to wait until the update officially reaches you. For now there is no other information whether Google will release the update for other devices that are included in the beta program. You also have to know that the latest update for the Android 7.1.2 includes the April security patch for the operating system. What Does the Update Bring New? The Android update was released previously this month for the Pixel and Nexus phones. Pixel users were really happy, since the tech giant solved the issue with the early shutdown, together with the pink banding that appeared on camera. Moreover, they also fixed the audio popping issue which caused some users to hear at high volume. Needless to say, it brought lots of bug fixes and other updates. Some of the new features that everybody loved until now at the Android 7.1.2 Nougat are the improved fingerprint swipe gesture, the battery usage alerts (which are really useful) and some improvements in the Bluetooth connectivity. For the Nexus devices though, the update brings more stable notifications, a new fingerprint swipe on Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P, plus the same new battery usage alerts and improvements in the general connectivity.

Donklephant Primary Navigation Please select a menu in this location Home Software The Third Developer Preview of Android Things Comes with New Leaks By Elena Anderson. Published on April 15, 2017. 0 Initially, Brillo was set to be the Google IoT platform, and it indeed received lots of attention upon its announcement. However, it didn’t turn out to be as successful and popular as people had hoped. As such, with the purpose of a more unified project, Google took the decision of rebranding Brillo to Android Things in December 2016. Now the software can be accessed as an early preview on various devices: NXP Pico, Intel Edison or Raspberry Pi 3. Moreover, it uses the own Weave communication layer they have. More Things Included Together with the rebranding, we saw that the company released the first developer preview for this platform. In February we got an update in the Developer Preview 2, and a couple of days ago Google released the third version of the preview for Android Things. Leaving aside all the changes that were previously performed, the third developer, the third developer preview brings 2 major additions: USB Host support and Bluetooth API support on Android. As such, Google has added USB Host support for the Android 3.1 version, and it now lets regular user space apps to communicate with the USB devices. You could also do this before, but you needed required root privileges. Plus, you even have an extra USB Enumerator, which helps you iterate over and print any interfaces and endpoints for the USB devices you own. Regarding the Android Bluetooth APIs, you are now able to write code that has the possibility of interacting both with Bluetooth classic and with LE (low energy) devices. It is in fact the same process that you see with a normal Android device, which is only good news for Android developers. Besides, Google also brought new samples: Bluetooth audio sink and Bluetooth LE GATT server.

In today’s technology and data-driven age, consumers are eager to validate their purchase decisions, and seek to do so by using social media and real-time feedback from other consumers as their key resources. But how exactly are consumers using local search services and online review sites to find and assess businesses? What kind of impact do reviews and ratings have on their path to purchase? After examining in greater detail the research and decision-making process of today’s consumers, customer feedback software company ReviewTrackers recently released the results of its first-ever Local Search and Online Reviews Survey. Here are some key findings: 67.7% consumers say that at least half of their searches result in a visit to a local business These visits then eventually translate into sales, with at least half of local searches eventually leading to a purchase for 57.7% of consumers. Analysis One of the most interesting aspects of local search is how it affects visitor traffic and revenue. Based on ReviewTrackers’ research, local searches conducted by consumers often carry high purchase intent. Want to drive conversions? Work on improving local search rankings on Google. Also, develop a strategy for securing more (and better) reviews, optimizing your information on business listings across the web, and creating user experiences which inspire in-store visits and sales. Over 50% of consumers often or always check out online reviews, while only 34% seek out information on discounts and pricing Analysis As one might expect, consumers - equipped with, and empowered by, an expanding range of Internet devices - are fairly active in searching for specific types of information when assessing local businesses. In fact, only a small percentage of survey respondents admitted to never looking for local business information like online reviews, location, hours, directions, and discounts. Based on the results, it seems that convenience plays a significant role in consumers’ research and decision-making process, with location and hours ranking as the top two types of business information they look for. Interestingly, consumers are more active in trying to find online reviews than in hunting for discounts, with over 50% of consumers 'often or always' checking out online reviews, compared to the 34% that seek out information on discounts and pricing. This suggests that having an effective reviews and reputation management strategy may be more beneficial to local businesses than launching special promotions or offering discounted prices. (Previous studies have already suggested that better reviews and higher ratings can lead to greater demand and pricing flexibility.) 62.7% of consumers believe that online reviews are “important” or “very important” when choosing a local business Only 3% don't consider reviews when making a purchase decision with a local business. Analysis Online reviews rank highly in terms of importance for consumers looking to make a purchase decision on a local business. These findings echo the results of previous studies, which found that 4 out of 5 consumers reverse their purchase decisions based on negative reviews This reflects the vital shift in today’s marketing landscape, where consumers, instead of marketers, are responsible for shaping the way a brand or business is perceived. Ultimately, what customers say about your business in their online reviews - and how you respond to these reviews - can sway purchase decisions more so than can brand-driven marketing messages, paid advertising, and traditional customer acquisition efforts. 69.9% of consumers read reviews in the beginning of, and during, the research phase By comparison, only 4.1% read reviews at the stage where they've already made an initial choice and are looking to double-check it. Analysis Reviews serve as useful resources for consumers at every stage of their journey, but they're particularly impactful in the early stages. These numbers reflect similar findings made by Social Media Link, which found that 83% of consumers discover businesses every month through peer-to-peer reviews. Indeed, along with local search results, reviews are an important peer-to-peer contribution to trust, helping shape the first impressions that consumers have of a business. As a foremost source of information, reviews are particularly useful at helping consumers discover new products and services through local search.   63.3% of consumers trust businesses with overall ratings of 4.0 or 4.5 stars out of 5 Only 2.5% trust businesses with overall ratings of 2.0 stars or less. Star ratings matter, and according to survey results, the ideal rating for purchase probability is 4.0 stars out of 5, followed by 4.5 stars out of 5. It’s worth noting that today’s consumers often perceive ratings closer to a perfect 5.0 as too good to be true, and they appreciate less-than-perfect reviews and ratings as an important element in their research and decision-making process. While your business should continue to shoot for perfection, you must also recognize that consumers specifically seek trustworthy, authentic - and therefore often imperfect - reviews and ratings. It’s critical that you’re able to resist the temptation to delete, ignore, or censor negative feedback, critical reviews, and low ratings. Conclusion The continued growth of online reviews has led to a shift in consumers’ purchase behavior, from the way they search for local businesses to the way to make purchase decisions. In particular, the impact of reviews on local search performance, online reputation, and ultimately revenue is undeniable. By embracing and leveraging reviews, your business can drive customers to your door and build your reputation and search visibility in ways that will make a positive impact on your bottom line.

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 125 Plus 1 on G+ 278 Share on Facebook 78 Share on Twitter Total Shares481 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 141k 106k Latest Deals 14 [Deal Alert] Get a 75" Sony LED UHD Android TV from Best Buy for $2150 today ($650 off) 2017/04/15 4:13pm PDTApr 15, 2017 19 [Deal Alert] Huawei Watch in Black Stainless Steel w/metal band $250 ($100 off) 2017/04/14 6:36pm PDTApr 14, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] 55 temporarily free and on-sale apps to round out your week 2017/04/14 12:50pm PDTApr 14, 2017 13 [Deal Alert] 2-Pack 6' Anker USB 3.0 A to C cables $12 w/ promo ($8 off) 2017/04/13 4:16pm PDTApr 13, 2017 32 [Deal Alert] NVIDIA is having a SHIELD gaming spring sale 2017/04/13 2:17pm PDTApr 13, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?

Some Pixel and Nexus fingerprint sensors not working after Android 7.1.2 update Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 12:17pm PDTApr 14, 2017 65 Plus 1 on G+ 79 Share on Facebook 73 Share on Twitter Total Shares217 Bug Watch Device Updates News Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel XL A number of Google Pixel and Nexus users are reporting that their fingerprint sensor is no longer working after the latest Android OS update. Several members of the Pixel and Nexus communities on Google's product forums have encountered the issue since installing the Android Nougat 7.1.2 OTA. The issue appears to be affecting both the Pixel and Pixel XL, as well as the LG-made Nexus 5X and Huawei Nexus 6P. Reports suggest that while the Pixel and Nexus Imprint sensors are no longer granting access to the devices, the swipe down for notifications Moves gesture is still functional. Attempts to solve the problem by deleting pre-existing fingerprints and starting from scratch haven't worked, as error messages are preventing new prints from being added to the devices. As usual, we'll update if we hear any official word from Google about the issue, hopefully regarding a fix.

Provided Google does not get the article Removed VAVAMk_2 Same thereasoner Same here with my Pixel. Suicide_Note No issues on my XL or 6P. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 6p has never given me those issues either... But it is slower than most newer scanners. Nick Which is to be expected. It's still fine. Jeff Neston By stating no problems, expect to get boot loop on your nexus 6. See the CNET article on nexus 5 and 6. Provided Google does not get the article defeated. If you do get it expect to lose all unsaved data. Then if want refund you will need to go to court. Sean Please GO AWAY....you have said this TWICE.......Its NOT the Nexus 5 and 6 Mr Brainiac....its the 5X and 6P......which are TOTALLY different than the Nexus 5 and Nexus 6. Max Same here with my XL. elav Me too. No issues on my XL.. Nicholas Matranga My Nexus 5x works just fine after the update. kalehv Sometimes my Pixel XL asks for pattern even after it recognizes my fingerprint (no, I am not talking about the first time after reboot). Rebooting the device works but why does this happen? Nathan Bryant I've also experienced this. It's random. Not so often it's a bother for me. kalehv Yup not so often with me either but being a mobile developer what bothers me is this happening, not the inconvenience it causes. Nathan Bryant That totally makes sense. I assume it's some kind of error even though it's not stating that it is. I don't see the pattern or constant of what causes it when it happens. mattcoz It does that after more than 48 hours have passed since you've last used your pattern. kalehv Nop its not that either. It does that after 4 hours I think. And it should do that only once after 4 hours but not keep doing that until you reboot. mattcoz It's definitely 48 hours, that comes straight from Google. But if it continues to do so, then that's something else. Mgamerz I've had it happen on my Nexus, it just occasionally requires a PIN. Says it's 4 hours of non usage but that doesn't seem true, sometimes I wake up and no pin and sometimes I'll be on and off the phone and it'll require a pin. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Typical. Google needs to fire some of their geniuses and hire some diligent coders, and also diligent testers for their QA department (assuming they even have one -- I sincerely doubt it). Alex Cruz Where did Google touch you? Middlefinger Oh really. Nexus/Pixel/Google error 4.453.563 this year alone. Im shocked (not really). Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Best hot steaming pile of dog s**t 2016. DragoCubed Google has been going downhill lately - at least with mobile excluding iOS. It's such a shame. They haven't exactly gone downhill haven't they? They've stayed the same SpeakethTheTruth I think you might be on to something with that last paragraph. Cause for real, quality control is out of control right now. sebastianer If fixed my 6P bad battery life and early shutdown only replacing the stock Huawei battery with other battery with different brand (no need to wipe the phone in the process...) Several people did the same and is enjoying the battery life they were having when they bought the phone more than a year ago: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3534410 You could even try a Huawei battery replacement...but they say they aren't original. I just went for another brand because of the bad experience I had with the stock battery durability I don't know in the Pixel. But in the 6P in 90% of the cases...this is just a problem of the Huawei stock battery. Kendall Gustafson “Pixel”, the word sounds like the color pink. “Pixel” sounds like a little girl’s toy. Most men would never put a phone in their pocket named “Pixel” unless they were a cross/dresser. The word “Pixel” equates to a 50% loss of market share from the male market. “Nexus”, the word does not sound female or male. “Nexus”, the word sounds like science, desirable to any man, woman, or child. “Nexus”, the word sound like domination of market share. kalehv Hahaha that made me laugh. No I do not agree. I am a Pixel owner man and I am not whatever you said they'd be if they owned one but I laughed for some reason. Christian Trevor Clauss I must be a cross dresser then :D mattcoz Real men aren't insecure about what their phones are named. Middlefinger Except that the Nexus sold poorly and was generally complete junk Van_Hammersly Most of us have exited adolescence. bonelesscheese https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9bd2ce0665c300ab872edc5e5fa1ef348b87f551cc01532d17bf41264dd126c1.jpg DragoCubed I'm so glad that you can block on disqus Bruce Wayne Google is really dropping the ball. We just can't have a stable, functioning phone that works. I just had to send my phone in for repair because it went into boot-loop after the recent update. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google: "It compiled with warnings but no errors. Must be ready to go." Bruce Wayne Nothing about Google or Android came up. What are you getting at? Middlefinger This isnt device specific, its a fault in Android itself. Google has become really bad lately with poor quality control. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Even Chrome is going to the dogs. Seriously, Google is staffed by a bunch of incompetent high-paid prima donnas. paxmos At least, Google is not charging an arm and a leg for their phones ;-) 2kool4skool Lol, $869 for a phone that doesn't have waterproofing, wireless charging, expandable storage, and ois is not charging an arm and leg? paxmos Didn't you see the wink? 2kool4skool Apologies, I just woke up and haven't fully recovered when I read your comment, my sarcasm detector didn't work really well that time. paxmos LOL, we're good Lindacbrewer Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

No need to test or anything. Too much trouble for the geniuses at Google. They're so smart that if it compiles with just warnings, there couldn't possibly be any problems. John Doe I am sure that they do test it but there are things that go wrong...obviously those bugs will be in the spotlight on an Android blog meaning in real life they are probably affecting a small number of users. This is why you do a roll out of the OTA not just dump it all out there. Bruce Wayne Ohhh...Lol. I just re-read his statement now. neates Pixel and Nexus - rich beta testers...

It blows my mind been on 7.1.2 sense the factory imgs dropped Sean Same for me.....my Pixel XL hasnt had a single reported issue so far......... Donovan Goodwin Using mine actually causes phone to restart. Updating to 7.1.2 caused this and it even happens on ROMs. JG W00t! For once I don't suffer from Atrem's Luck... My 5X still lets me in with my fingerprint :) Doomberg I updated just last night. Glad I didn't get hit with this issue. nickarli 6P - had 4 fingers registered, right index stopped working after the update but other 3 still fully functional. I thought it was the massive amount of Utah dust in my fingers all of a sudden, but I guess not Defenestratus There's that vaunted Google QA again. This is how you get more Samsung. New_Guy Yep Mark Curtis What do you mean "this is how you get more Samsung"? 4Ui812 Why is Google having app many issues with the Fixel ? Sruly J Except since it's also affecting Nexus devices, this is more of a software issue in 7.1.2 than a hardware issue for Pixel devices. Defenestratus Because IIRC they use Agile software development. Agile is how you get shitty software. Lawstorant I've never thought I would say such thing, but I'm getting fed up with all the "issues" Google is facing with every update. On the Nexus 6, they went as far as to roll it back to 7.0. They should really step up their game especially if, they are fully responsible for every aspect of the device from now on. EvilHowl No issues on my 5X wade_county I thought these Pixels weren't supposed to be beta products? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They aren't. They're outrageously expensive alpha products. And they even have one defect (halo-cam) that can't be fixed in software. Still the best steaming pile of dog s**t of 2016, though. Everyone should buy one. Everyone who likes dog s**t anyway. Apparently people do, since HTC has shipped 2 million since launch. Kougeru I bad a Pixel for a week and took dozens of photos with no halo Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good for you. Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of 22 Pixel pictures had halos. None of the 22 G6 pictures had halos. They were all pictures of the same things, obviously with the same lighting. Google admits it's a design defect. If Google admits it, it's kind of hard to pretend it doesn't exist. whispy_snippet No one denies it's an issue. But what you seem incapable of accepting is it's a very minor issue that only very rarely rears its head. If you actively try to shoot an image with a strong light source angled towards the sensor (something you generally don't do because it often results in a poor shot on any camera) you might experience a halo effect. Might. But I've got literally hundreds of photos taken with my Pixel with no halos. You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want to fuel your juvenile rage fits. But people who actually use a Pixel every day don't seem to have a problem worth caring about. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It has nothing to do with a strong light source angled toward the sensor. That's normal lens flare. The Pixel halos are NOT normal lens flare. Like I said 4 out of 22 pictures. That's 18% of the pictures they took, and they didn't have strong light sources angled toward the sensor. 18% is not a rare problem, especially when the G6 NEVER had halos with the same exact pictures. Google admitted it's a flaw. Get over yourself and stop trying to justify it. whispy_snippet And like I said, I've taken hundreds of pictures and have seen a halo perhaps a couple of times. And I take a lot of photos given video and photography is my day job - indeed one of the reasons I chose the Pixel is because I wanted the best phone camera available for the times I don't have my proper gear with me. I've seen countless comparisons between the Pixel, iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 edge and while they're all great, in most situations the Pixel takes what I consider the better shot. You're making mountains out of molehills and carrying on like a right twat in the process. P. Sherman ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE DOESN'T MEAN JACKS--- if in scientific tests under controlled environments and the same conditions, the Pixel produced the halo effect, which Google has acknowledged to be a design deficiency standard on LITERALLY EVERY PIXEL MADE, but other cameras feature no such halo effect. FFS whispy_snippet I'm not denying there's an issue! I'm saying it's being blown out of proportion by people who want to blow it out of proportion. P. Sherman Referencing a scientific, controlled test and camera comparison is NOT blowing this out of proportion. Blowing out of proportion would be something how the Wall Street Journal set out to destroy PewDiePie for boneheadedly saying "Death to all Jews" as a joke. But referencing a camera comparison in exactly the same conditions and one phone had a halo effect but the other didn't is science, fact, nothing to blow out of proportion there. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good luck arguing with a Google fanboy in deep denial. thereasoner He's actually making solid points, the Pixels do have the best cameras overall​ and all smartphone cameras have some issues. whispy_snippet No, no. I'm a fanboy! Get it right! Cecil Hardwood Are you sure the Pixel has the best camera ? The reason I ask is because the DxOMark site that claims this refuses to release the iPhone 7 Plus (Not iPhone 7) scores and many believe it is because it scored higher than the Pixel. The theory goes on to say that Google is using their score in their advertising and DxO doesn't want to piss off Google. Something weird is going on for sure. DxO claimed long ago the review was coming soon and should have been out by now with the iPhone 7 Plus having been on the market as long as it has. thereasoner If I'm to make a judgment personally then I would say that probably the top 3-4 cameras on flagships are very close and what's best as far as the user is concerned is subjective. Do you prefer low light performance(I do) or digital zoom? Do your favour widespread angle lens or fast launch/focus etc. Those are personal preferences that make "the best " phone different for different people. That said, as far as reviews are concerned the Pixel is generally considered the best over all. As far as your conspiracy theories go, who knows? Anyone can create those about anything but I guess but I'm thinking that other than digital zoom and an artsy photo effect the 7+ cameras are very similar to the 7. whispy_snippet The iPhone 7 Plus is the same as the iPhone 7 apart from an additional, slower lens. In terms of raw image quality the iPhone 7 Plus achieves its best results with the lens it shares with its smaller sibling. So basically, it'll score no better than the 7. It's effectively already been tested. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All smartphone cameras have some issues? What issues does the G6 camera have in the comparison I linked? 23% of the Pixel photos have halo issues. Find a serious issue with 23% of the G6 photos and get back to us. thereasoner Keep in mind that if you take wide-angle shots, angles will be distorted and elongated from the side, especially when it comes to selfies with the front-facing camera. I also found that the front-facing camera takes relatively muddy shots in low-light. Compared to the Pixel XL, OnePlus 3T and (for the time being since we don't have the S8) the Galaxy S7, the G6 is on par with its rivals. The Pixel XL takes superior low-light images than all the phones though, and I prefer the richer contrast and saturation of the S7 by just a tad. -CNET There are a ton of reviews from various sources just like this and while the G6 cameras are considered very nice they do have their shortcomings and generally rank below the Pixel cameras overall. whispy_snippet Purple flaring and chromatic aberation. It's extremely noticeable in at least four images you shared with the Pixel comparison. Here you are: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration And just Google search purple flaring. Sorry to burst your bubble. whispy_snippet Show me the link to the test. I would like to see it. Even if their results suggest there's an issue (which there is as we all agree), the significance of the results can still be blown out of proportion which is what we're seeing occur in this ridiculous discussion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Here you go again. phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ Now that I've viewed the pics again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. Two involve a bright light. The other 3 do not. So that's 23% of 22 pictures. I wouldn't say that's blowing things out of proportion. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. Yeah, you paid a lot for your Pixel, so you have a hard time admitting it's a steaming pile of dog s**t. I understand. whispy_snippet Yep, so as we've agreed, halos sometimes appear in shots with strong light sources pointing at or angled towards the edge of the sensor. But let's just ignore the purple flaring and chromatic aberation in at least four of the images from the LG, right? You're demonstrating selective criticism. Every camera has strengths and weaknesses but on balance, the Pixel offers better images than competing phones more often than not. My position is unchanged. You're both making mountains out of molehills, and in no way does this "scientific" test guarantee that 23% of photos taken with a Pixel will exhibit a halo. It simply shows 23% of photos taken in this example demonstrated halos. You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. No one ever said the Pixel is perfect. But only you two are using ridiculous, extreme labels like "steaming pile of dog shit" and "HARDWARE DEFICIENCY" as though using capital letters makes your odd ball assertions more valid. Most reputable tech reviewers agree the Pixel has the best overall smartphone camera. You're entitled to disagree. P. Sherman 4/22. 4/22 photos from the Pixel have a halo effect. That's from Phandroid. That's 18% of photos the Pixel. That alone is damning. Google themselves have acknowledged that it is a HARDWARE DEFICIENCY and software fixes have done little to address this. They admitted it was there, that's all we need. If you knew that 4/22 Burritos Chipotle made would give you the Runs, but ZERO/22 Burritos Taco Bell made would, would YOU still choose to eat at Chipotle? whispy_snippet Show me the test! I've asked twice now. P. Sherman Lena Flare was removed from the photos, but not the video. http://highonandroid.com/android-smartphone-news/the-truth-about-google-pixel-camera-halolens-flare-effect/ Also, someone in the official Google forums shot with their Pixel and Nexus 6P in the same Time, conditions, everything. Guess what? https://support.google.com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsrROqMaXHqHg/?hl=by Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ 3 halos are obvious, 1 is subtle. The subtle one is where the picture is looking up at a building's windows. Now that I've viewed them again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. tigerstown I paid $380 for my new pixel XL so it's not a lot and I have no Halo in my pics I have proven this on Twitter already. abc More fanboy logic. I took pictures so everything is fine. Anyone who says its not fine is crazy. whispy_snippet How ridiculous. So a blogger takes 22 photos in various conditions and his experience is valid, but my experience of owning the phone and taking hundreds of photos in various conditions is not valid. You guys are weirdos. Andy But do you see problems with low light pics. I do on my wife's pixel. IPhone Looks so much better. I'm so disappointed abc I saw a rainbow once. Oh, are we not just conveying pointless ancedotes? mr.fozzo On my Nex6P, I have noticed that the Fingerprint reader has been less reliable lately. It requires more presses than the usual 1 press. Besnik Rrustemi My Nexus 6P working excellent so far, no battery problems, no fingerprint problems (better standby times on 7.1.2 to be honest). But yes,i can agree that fingerprint was much faster when i first got the device on 6.0 Marshmallow (for unlocking the device with the fingerprint) now it takes like 2 full seconds for that :( jimv1983 No issues on my Nexus 5X and the swipe on the sensor to bring down the notification panel is great. Alex Harrison Flashed the OTA myself on my 5X. No issues with it. Jeff Neston At least it is just the sensor. My nexus 5 was bricked by a Google update.. it got the boot loop. Google support lied to me claiming I broke the power button. False it was not broken. I ended up going small claims case against Google. They settled, but wanted me to sign gag order. Sorry, no way. I sent it back and got complete refund. Sneaky company. What probably causes boot loop update to occur is phone on long time. Some apps get memory leak over time. System then unpredictably unstable. Then the system does auto uplate from Google without asking user NOR even rebooting or turning off prior to the update. Then during update, Os gets corrupted. Then after failed update phone reboots thinking the. Update completed. Now phones dead. And Google not bother to address the issue. Pdiddy187 My 5x fingerprint sensor was great until it bootlooped yesterday morning. LG is going to repair it under warranty even though it's well out of warranty. La Kiesha Rodriguez Barrientes I have the ZTE axon 7 and over a month now google hasn't addressed a fix for the play store not loading apps over data or Wi-Fi.. Without uninstalling updates to play store and then maybe will not say "waiting for network" so frustrating and then maybe download once and have to do that everytime.. Dumb.. P. Sherman That's been like that since KitKat. F------ KITKAT. ahnafm Is google reacommodating their customers now? Brett Delia I thought some positive feedback was worth being added. My Nexus 6P is working perfectly after the update. I've had generally a great experience with all my Android phones. I've had an iPhone as well as a Windows mobile phone as well in my past. None have been as feature packed as my Android devices. New_Guy This and all the other ridiculous issues with the Pixel is a big reason I stick with Samsung... flyonthewall Lol Fernando S Mine is working ok in my Nexus 5x running 7.1.2. It just failed once while I was on 7.1.1 and with a soft reset it came back to life Hank Is that a real screenshot in the story? Enrollment spelled wrong twice. SMH. ThisGuyFUX This is now icing on top of the cake, for anyone whom has enjoyed watching this crash and burn. If I paid $850+ for a Pixel, I'd be pursuing class action litigation by now. Slow clap. Sean Except its only affecting about 1% of the Pixels sold.........so......slow clap for you....... 2kool4skool It's gonna be sucks when you're in the 1%. And I doubt it's 1% anyway, this is probably the 20th article I've read about pixel's problems. That's alot.

Brian White Nexus 5x, running fine here ddevito If it wasn't for my OnePlus 3 I'd be on an iPhone. thereasoner One plus has their own issues/lousy support and the iPhone? They're the worst of them all when it comes to buggy software and hardware issues bricking devices ! ddevito Not sure I'd agree with you. My iPhone 6s hums along swimmingly without any issues. The more I use it the more I am leaning towards going back to an iPhone full-time. Apple, love them or hate them, knows how to deliver products, and support them. Period. thereasoner I'm glad that your iPhone 6s isn't affected by the many flawed updates and hardware issues​ that have plagued various iPhones over the years but the fact remains that Apple has faced class action lawsuits filed by their own customers for serious issues like Touch Disease and error 53 and for good reason. They have the worst track record of them all and to make things worse they're known for both ignoring iPhone issues until said class action lawsuits are launched and/or blaming their customers for the iPhone hardware/software problems. BTW, my Pixel "hums along swimmingly" as well, that doesn't mean issues with the Pixel don't exist much less those far more serious issues found on iPhones ! MisterKraky I'm not having the fingerprint sensor issue myself, but after updating to 7.1.2, I can no longer install or update any apps! On a Verizon-issued Pixel here. Đức Thành What happened to all the testing, Google? It seems they have become too reliant on using Nexus users for beta-testing and now can't seem to do a proper job on their own. Get your grips together, Android team. Rob H. Nougat is such a half baked disaster of an OS. It's ruined my N6. Marshmallow was soon much more stable.

Tech Entertainment Business Deals Science Politics About Apps & Software Image Source: Eric Risberg/AP/REX/Shutterstock The new Android update is breaking fingerprint sensors Chris Mills @chrisfmills April 14th, 2017 at 5:32 PM Share Tweet We normally make fun of Android updates because they don’t actually happen — it takes months for changes to roll from Google to consumers, which makes keeping up with security bugs and new features painfully difficult. But today, Android updates are sucking for a completely different reason. Don't Miss: Court forces PornHub to reveal names and viewing histories of some users Users on Google’s product forums are complaining that the latest version of Android Nougat, v7.1.2, is bricking the fingerprint sensors on their phones. Affected devices reportedly include the Google-made Pixel and Pixel XL, as well as the Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P. Those are all devices either made by Google, or by a third-party manufacturer in cooperation with Google. They also all run stock Android, which is why they’re able to be updated before any other device. According to users, the fingerprint sensor itself doesn’t work, but it’s clearly not a hardware problem: the sensor only stops working after the update, and the gesture control functions of the sensor (which let you swipe over the fingerprint reader to trigger an action) are still working fine. Even deleting fingerprints and trying to add new ones doesn’t work, which rules out some kind of issue with the stock launcher software. There’s no known fix or public comment from Google at this time, so if you’re on one of these devices and thinking about updating, it’s probably a good idea to hold off. It’s also a handy reminder to keep a good backup of your device up-to-date, especially if you’re the kind of person who installs the latest updates the second they become available.

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 125 Plus 1 on G+ 278 Share on Facebook 78 Share on Twitter Total Shares481 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 141k 106k Latest Deals 14 [Deal Alert] Get a 75" Sony LED UHD Android TV from Best Buy for $2150 today ($650 off) 2017/04/15 4:13pm PDTApr 15, 2017 19 [Deal Alert] Huawei Watch in Black Stainless Steel w/metal band $250 ($100 off) 2017/04/14 6:36pm PDTApr 14, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] 55 temporarily free and on-sale apps to round out your week 2017/04/14 12:50pm PDTApr 14, 2017 13 [Deal Alert] 2-Pack 6' Anker USB 3.0 A to C cables $12 w/ promo ($8 off) 2017/04/13 4:16pm PDTApr 13, 2017 32 [Deal Alert] NVIDIA is having a SHIELD gaming spring sale 2017/04/13 2:17pm PDTApr 13, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?

What happens when you have more than one Google Home? Chaos. Paul Quinn Follow View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:22am PDTApr 14, 2017 28 Plus 1 on G+ 95 Share on Facebook 62 Share on Twitter Total Shares185 Editorials Google Home The Amazon Echo was my pacifier as I waited for Google’s entry into the home assistant space. Setting my Google Play Music library aside, I suffered through using Amazon’s attempt at a music service devoid of most of my own library. I connected my Google Calendar to Alexa and it offered a glimpse into my future relationship with Google’s assistant. Finally, in early November, I could get my hands on a new Google Home. I had pre-ordered from Google and then discovered I could pick one up at my local Best Buy. The very morning it hit the shelves, I immediately bought one. I brought it home, set it up in the family room and eagerly asked – “OK Google, play my morning hits playlist.” Without skipping a beat, she announced the list and the room filled with my music. The key point here – it was music from MY library. I didn’t cancel that Google pre-order. It was on its way. I figured I could listen to music in my bedroom as well. But – what about the other rooms in my house? What about the smart lights, smart switches, clever irrigation controller, and intelligent thermostat scattered throughout? I need a Google Home in every room to live the dream of a voice controlled home! I bought four more. My home is outfitted with six Google Home devices. There’s one in every room. I can control my smart home with my voice from anywhere I stand. I can spread music into any room. I can turn on, dim, and turn off lights in various rooms with just my voice. It’s as close as I can get to living on the Enterprise. Google's vision of the future with Google Home. Well, one Home. That’s the dream. Unfortunately, it isn’t a reality (yet). Google has failed at a key feature that it so proudly spoke of that morning in May. The nice lady living inside each Home is often unable to tell if you are talking to her or her sister in the neighboring room. It can result in some frustrating, sometimes comical, exchanges. It is amazing how well the little air freshener shaped unit can hear you from several rooms away. With multiple Homes, you’ll find yourself making requests and getting responses from two of them. It usually involves one of them, not necessarily the one closest to you, executing the request and the other apologizing to you that it can’t. From my bedroom in the morning, I might ask how long it will take to get to work and hear the detailed response in the distance from the kitchen. There will be times when the Home in front of me fulfills my request and another will rattle off from down the hall. You also have the ghosts. I never thought my home might be haunted - until now. There will be times when I turn off the TV, hang up on a call, or just walk out of the bathroom and hear something in another room. I’ll find a Google Home playing music or a podcast that I don’t listen to in a randomly selected room. Who asked to listen to opera at low volume in the guest room? Ghosts. There isn’t a constant circus of home assistants chiming in from all over the house. The closest Home does respond properly more than half of the time. However, I have found myself at times leaning over and almost whispering to a Google Home when I want to be sure the others don’t hear. There is talk of multiuser support coming soon, but it remains to be seen if this will improve its ability to identify which Home I am talking to. For now, I must look like a fool. I am whispering to an air freshener because I don’t want the others to hear. Creepy? Maybe. Tags editorial google home google home app google home fail video subscribe ...

Carson Saldanha Hi David Sean Thomas Hey Paul next time you're buying expensive accessories for every room in your house can you just throw me a hundo instead? Thanks! Sean Thomas Seems like something I would say. Paul Quinn I asked my office Home to get on that. The one in the kitchen responded. She can't do it but she's learning. Christopher Young I can completely sympathize with you. I have two Google Homes in my small apartment (living room/bedroom), and they frequently get confused where I'm at. I want to play music in the bedroom? Nope, the cozy jazz station starts blaring in the living room. There is one awesome benefit of having two Google Homes: I can fill my entire apartment with music with only a few words. dcdttu I hope Google Home gets a lot of support from Google itself and doesn't turn out to be a Hangouts. Or a Wave. Or a Nexus Player. Or a Nexus Q. Or a Google Reader. Or a tablet of any kind. Oh and hi Paul! Paul Quinn HI! Yeah, I'm worried that they will jump ship because they can't figure out a way to monetize it. No ads. If it starts playing ads, Home is moving out. The Echo doesn't really have a monetization angle except that you can shop on Amazon. Google added Google Express to the Home. But really? I'm not shopping on one of these things (yet). Lateef Alabi-Oki I thought the monetization was making money off selling the hardware. Paul Quinn They also need to keep expanding the ecosystem and product functionality which takes work that costs money. I don't know if that one time purchase price covers all that in the long run. Lord Argyris I think what Google is banking on is that if a user has one or more Homes, it makes them that much more likely to stick with the Android ecosystem in general, which means all Google's already existing means of getting money are a bit more secure from such a user switching over to the big "A". Of course it remains to be seen whether or not this is effective. Dk Schlösser The monetization is in the services offered by Google Paul Quinn I don't know what service I access through the Home makes Google any money, short of using it to buy things on Google Express. It does produce a little more profiling information but I doubt that it's enough to pay for the ongoing development. Ryan I think its all about search and locking you into their services, just like the chromecast. Because of chromecast (and now google home) I am more locked into Google Music. I am more locked into Youtube, Play Movies, searching on Google, etc. Just like Android. The specific device/service doesnt have to make money, its a "loss leader" to drive you to their other, profitable services. A very common thing in almost any consumer industry. Lars Jeppesen Precisely. I'm ditching Sonos in favor of Chromecast Audio, only because of my GH fluffthebunny The monetization is off selling all the data gleaned by your six devices listening to your every word. You have become one with the Home. You have been assimilated. Joshed The horror of ordering an item in the kitchen only to find the bedroom and office made duplicate orders. skitchbeatz I've got an open concept, one in the kitchen and one in the living room. They fight over responding and sometimes both respond. It's frustrating. I've thought about moving one of them up or down a floor. It's half implemented. It doesn't make sense because the assistant on the phone will sometimes read "answering on another device. Artem Russakovskii I have 4 Google Homes (2 in nearby areas where they can both hear me at the same time - kitchen and living room), 2 Alexas (though both Alexas can't hear me at the same time), and I can confirm - combined with multiple phones on family members, it's a mess. Let alone Home kicks in and starts talking once a day or so when not asked (doesn't happen nearly as often with Alexa). LithiumFox Never had that happen with ours... givitumibeybi 4 google homes and 2 alexas?? Artem, I think you might have some issues. Artem Russakovskii No, I just have more than one room. Dk Schlösser Change the trigger word for your Alexas Nick After my experiences with Amazon Echo, I have felt that these type of products are not ready for prime time. It's a cool concept, but these little, quirky issues that pop up with these "Home Assistants" suggest otherwise. Perhaps I'm more security minded than other people, but these sort of IoT products are ripe for security issues as well and the combination of these things has me totally turned off to the current market. Tony T. If you have multiple Homes, can you ask Google to play music and have all of them play the same music in sync? Defenestratus yes. Ed G You can have all of them play music like a Sonos. Also will link with Chromecast Audio. trickytree1984 Will it link to chrome cast proper? Joshua Pritt no, you can't group Chromecast video devices, only audio. Joshed This sucks. I don't see why they cant give older chromecast devices this feature. Paul Quinn Yes, you can create groups. For example, I have a group named "Front of the house" that connects three of them. You're best bet is to name them things that roll of the tongue like, "Hey Google, play my 90's hits playlist on the front of the house." Defenestratus I've got three homes, and I don't have this issue at all. Of course they're all on different floors and I live in a rather open-floor plan home so there's that. I've never had it come on as a ghost... ever. Chris You spent over 800 on google homes?!?! Omg man what kinda bank you making. That is insanity. Or no savings? I mean a financially responsible person cannot spend that much unless their income is huge haha. Defenestratus Yesterday I spent $1000 on a shower fixture (Moen U) David Ruddock OMG YOU ACTUALLY BOUGHT ONE OF THOSE? Defenestratus My wife saw it on "I want that" on DIY network and, well, yeah. We're about to start a master suite renovation so it was the perfect opportunity. For her, the hardest part of the day is getting up out of bed and waiting for the shower to heat up, getting cold in the process (she could get cold in the middle of equatorial guinea and we live in the North East US) so when she saw that she could turn the shower on from bed and it would alert her when it was ready for her, it was a done deal. I'm actually thinking of making a google assistant handler for it when it shows up. Chris Damn dude! How much do you make?? I see all these cool things and want them but I decide my money is better sitting in my savings account or the stock market. Defenestratus I specialize in software that is used for pharmaceutical research and clinical trials. I make a good living. Oh and my wife's a doctor. Chris Ah definitely. That's awesome dude. I work at a vaccine start up so hopefully we'll get a product past the FDA then I can buy 1k showers ;) Defenestratus Very cool. My company does a lot of work on vaccine studies. Best of luck. You have a long 12-14 years of approval process ahead of you! goodnightmare "Ok Moen...." Doesn't have quite the same ring to it. Paul Quinn The timing was right. I got three of them for $100 apiece using Visa Checkout and some helpful friends. Chris That's good dude. I haven't been able to convince myself to get one yet. I don't listen to music at home and not really sure what else I'd use it for. I did get a nest recently but still I don't mind pulling out my phone to change the temp. Paul Quinn I have an Ecobee now. My Nest kept thinking I was away because I didn't walk down that hallway enough. The Ecobee has remote sensors. Unfortunately, the Home currently does not have a direct integration with Home. I'm using IFTTT. Lawstorant Is it that hard to check which Home is the closest, based on the loudness of one's speech? Paul Quinn It might be that Google focused on their ability to hear your voice based on having one Home. If you have one, you want it to be able to hear you from a distance. That will backfire when you introduce more of them. They are all listening too well. Mace Moneta It could probably be resolved easily, by having the Google Homes reduce sensitivity of the mic, based upon the number of Google Home's on the network. Paul Quinn I had two Echos when they announced improved far-field functionality. I tested it at the time and it was working better. I didn't do any long term testing because I switched to the Home. With that in mind, Amazon was able to improve the situation with a software update so I agree that Google should have fixed this by now. Lawstorant Well, it's still Google. They have the money and the manpower to overcome such "hurdles". Why is it that more often than not, they seem like a small start-up composed of fresh out-of -college programmers. Nigel Antonio lol I thought I was the only one with that problem... Jesse Corbett So I have 2, one that covers the bedroom/bathroom half of my apartment and on that covers the kitchen/dining/living room section. I have never had an issue with both responding, if I may share my anecdote. However, I frequently am sitting 10 feet from the living room Home and hear my bedroom Home respond, despite being further away, in another room, down a hallway, with the first between me and it. I don't understand. Michael Stiffler Haha, I've had to whisper to my phone if I don't want her (Home) to hear! Aleem Kanji I think it's time to admit that Google is really screwing the pooch here. Nexus hardware failures, Pixel issues, Google Homes not living up to the hype, constant beta-feel to their products... I have a Nexus 6P, two Google Homes, and I'm all-in on Google services, but... for fuck's sake, I'm thinking of jumping ship entirely. Even Android news sites are seeming to be whole-heartedly disappointed with Google and the growing lack of positivity is disheartening. Google either needs to put up and get their shit together with product polish and following through on promises (or not promising the moon to begin with) or they shut the hell up and we all buy iPhones and call it a day. Paul Quinn My thoughts are not really heading down that road. The Home does a lot of things right. It's core features, music and access to Google's massive database of information, are working. Light control works well. There are some very useful IFTTT integrations. The Echo had its issues when it came out and it has grown up. I'm not ready to give up on the Home. I see it slowly improving. I don't miss any Echo features. My 6P was a good experience overall but ultimately, yeah, it failed me in terms of the camera. My new Mate 9 has an absolutely amazing camera. I have no experience with the Pixel though. The general consensus is that the Pixel is amazing. I'm looking forward to the next one. Leoniv Same here. I'm all in with Google tech and have been with them since 2.3, but lately they've been a hot mess. They broke the dialer on multiple phones, hosed bluetooth so it disconnected randomly, and that doesn't even include the issues with the nexus and pixel phones. I hate to admit it, but the iPhones are looking more attractive. Jack Smith Really? Google home is not even 6 months old. GH is easily the most humanist technology that you can buy It is incredible what can do but not perfect and yet it is over? Little dramatic? Where are you going to get anything close? I have had the Echo since the very first day. It is NOT like the GH. Comparisons are ridiculous. Echo has commands and the GH you talk We are so.early with this and obviously the relatively minor issues in the scheme of things will get resolved. I have one echo and counting GHs that I gave away I have purchased 7. Not to say I dislike my Echo but it is not the future, IMO, like the GH. Aleem Kanji I'm TOTALLY being dramatic, actually. I love my Google Home. I love my Nexus. I also tried an iPhone for the first time late last year (iOS 10 got my attention) and I love it too. My tenure with my iPhone was about 4 months, and, like clockwork, I'd always put my SIM back in my N6P every Wednesday night until Saturday, then switch back to my iPhone (which is a bitch with iMessage, BTDub). The iPhone IS more polished, has better power and battery management, but isn't exciting to me the way Android is. I could never give it up. It's like a drug. But, like a drug, I'm hopelessly addicted to something that promises the highest of highs, then always leaves me chasing the dragon. Google promises the world, then has a tendency to either fall short or simple pulls the rug out. In a world where the Pixel exists and it commands iPhone and Galaxy level money, in a world where Google is trying it's hand at a software AND hardware ecosystem, I expect more. I expect polish, I expect promises to be kept - or at least reasonable expectations to be given. Now, people can come back and say that Google is new at hardware and I understand and forgive that. But they aren't a hardware company in the way that they take responsibility for their products 100%, in that they quality test, in that they have any sort of retail presence that goes beyond simply "trying" something out. They have time to build that, so I'll admit that I need to give them time to sort it out. I'm just worried that they'll get complacent or lose interest and one morning wake up and say "Oh yeah, that Android thing and all that hardware and stuff - I'm over it." If Google is going to change direction and add hardware to their list of products, I expect that they keep in mind that it also means that we - not our data - become customers too. Jack Smith So much silliness in this post. First, what right now angers me the most is Apple completely abandoning the entire AirPort line without any warning. Last November just reassigning all the employes. So I replaced our two AirPort Extremes with Google Wifi. That is REAL life not some weird perception things. "Apple reportedly stops developing AirPort WiFi router products, moving employees to other projects" Who does that? Not Google. Instead with Google we have yesterday. "New Google ‘Dual Band WiFi Router’ Shows Up At The FCC" https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/04/new-google-dual-band-wifi-router-shows-up-at-the-fcc.html This entire narrative Google is horrible at hardware or abandons hardware products is rather ridiculous. Heck it would have been so easy for Google to not support the NON Google WiFI hardware but instead Google decided to spend the money and bring all their new WiFi software to the ONHUB. This is REAL life not fantasy. We have been an Apple house for over a decade. We still have tons of Apple products. But been more and more replacing with Google. With Google we have 4K, HDR, VR, Smart speaker, Mesh and the list keeps growing. I can NOT get any of this from Apple! That is simply the facts. Aleem Kanji Right. 2×4 alexa does this same thing compuguy1088 That's not true. A software update allows for multiple amazon echo devices with the same hotword to work. They've had this since around the end of last year. 2×4 that's my point - it doesnt work well Midnitte "You also have the ghosts. I never thought my home might be haunted - until now. There will be times when I turn off the TV, hang up on a call, or just walk out of the bathroom and hear something in another room. I’ll find a Google Home playing music or a podcast that I don’t listen to in a randomly selected room. Who asked to listen to opera at low volume in the guest room? Ghosts." I have two and I've grouped them in a "home unit" and I've never experienced this. Typically I'll play music on one but sometimes I'll tell it to play music on both and I've never experienced it playing music on a rogue Home goodnightmare Nor have I. Igen Then I am pretty sure that Paul's home is haunted and he should call an Sam & Dean asap. kalehv This is a constant struggle. I have two Google Homes and a bunch of phones / tablets that also respond to "Ok Google" I usually use "Hey Google" to avoid waking up phones and tablets but there is no other way round like when I want to be reminded of something, there is no command that only capable devices (phones and tablets) would listen and not the Home. Home wins over taking control and apologizes for not being able to set reminders and actual capable devices say "Answering on other device" :( thacounty I have mine in opposite corners of the house to prevent this. The real issue is that I'll talk quietly to my phone and it will still hear me. Then my Pixel says answering on another device, which is Home telling me she can't do that yet, while my Pixel could have handled it just fine. Gets frustrating, but my 2 year old son yelling at it to play Batman Play-Doh Eggs makes it worth double what I paid. JG Glad I'm not the only one with this problem. Right now I only have two Google Homes set up, one in my bedroom and the other in the living room. If I'm in the living room, even my normal speaking voice will almost certainly trigger both Home units to talk to me. Like Paul, I have to turn to the one in the living room and whisper in order to get only one. And that can be hard if the TV is blasting away to. Though for some reason when I'm in my bedroom, I usually only trigger the bedroom unit. It gets very annoying when the one I want to talk to tells me she can't help while the other rattles off some long winded multi-paragraph answer (especially when I just asked "what time is it"). Being in another room (and sharing the same voice as the one talking next to you) its often hard to understand what she's saying - and of course there's no "Hey Google, what did you just say?" command... I wanted to set up a third in the other bedroom. But until I'm sure I won't be getting three different responses to each query.... Amazon claims to have an algorithm to determine which of multiple Echo units should respond. I don't have multiple Echo units so I can't test the validity myself, but if they can figure it out... I'm sure Google, with their expertise in machine learning shouldn't have too much bother with it. goodnightmare Acoustics. :) illregal I've got 3 in pretty close proximity, and a 4th whenever lg decides to send those out. Only about 1 out of 10 requests gets answered by the one i wasn't intentionally talking to. 4Ui812 Hi Paul ? Paul Quinn Hi! Rasovan Mircea Google have to upgrade the sound waves and not allow them to travel more than one room.... Tired_Guy I have a Home, a Nexus 9, a Nexus 7 and a Pixel XL, so assistant works on all of them. If all are in my den charging, saying OK Google is like he described only a bit weirder, as I can say it specifically to my Pixel XL in my hand and the Nexus 9 answers, through it's cover. Multiple device synchronization is vital Packer Backer Another reason to allow users to set the hot word. "Hey Bub! Hey Betty! Hey Fumbduck!" would would activate three different devices. Dk Schlösser The solution is to be able to change the trigger word for each device. You can do this on Alexa. Paul Quinn Currently, only my Home responds to "Hey Google" so I use that to talk to the Home. my phones and tablets don't respond. That cuts down on the problem a bit as long as I don't want to use voice with my phone. If I say "OK Google" to my phone, the Home may also respond. A quick fix for now would be to have the option to set the Home NOT to respond to "OK Google" and only "Hey Google." Bill Riess Yeah I just recently discovered this issue when I moved from an echo and echo dot to 4 Google homes. For the most part they work pretty good but it's annoying when they pick up in the wrong room. Multiuser and Sonos integration would be great additions as well. goodnightmare I've had four of these in my home since day one. Yes, occasionally we'll get some random response from a distant device, but it doesn't affect performance. The requested task is completed properly 95% of the time and any hiccups have never been due to multiple devices trying to provide feedback. Our Google Home experience has been quite pleasant and loads of fun. DomBrady Same. I've got three. I have had one interference related issue. Charles222 Same with four here as well. I've had an interference problem with my kitchen & living room ones, but taking a few steps towards one or the other solves it. nerdshowandtell.com I also have 6 Google Homes and the issues described here I only had a month or so ago and they went away. Id also make sure you have solid wifi with no interference to eliminate any delay in the homes seeing each other. As for the random asking/talking, maybe have seen that 3 times since it came out. Definitely not in awhile. Brett Koger I also have several Google Home devices, I am not experiencing the issues you state. I even have two of them with in 20 feet (they are in different rooms) I will see both activate but only one will respond. I have only experienced what you are see a few times. It is not the norm. Paul Quinn I have noticed that situation where more than one activate but only two of them can actually be visualized at one time. To me, that's a good sign. It means they are hearing you but identifying which one should respond. Maxr1998 Hi Paul! Very entertaining and interesting article. I don't have a Google Home myself yet (not available in Germany, functionality in German is likely pretty limited (as seen in Assistant on phones), my Home Assistant setup isn't supported by Google Home/Google Assistant, and IFTTT is too slow (10 seconds+) atm), but the idea of having one is very intriguing for me :) Paul Quinn Hi Max! I guess one plus side of living in another country is that Google works out bugs in the United States before it expands across the globe. Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get it functional:P But it's still sometimes a little annoying for power users wanting the latest and the greatest regardless of bugs ;) Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get it functional. 😜 But it's still sometimes a little annoying to not get the latest and greatest stuff being a poweruser ;) Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get them functional. 😜 But it's still sometimes a little annoying to not get the latest and greatest stuff being a poweruser ;) JD So it's not just me. Alexa is just that much better with its spatial recognition. It has a 100% hit rate on responding on the right unit. Sandeep Raghuraman One solution to your problem - setup mic + speakers in each room, and use one Google Home. That way, only one Google Home device will respond. Although, the next problem would be, how does Google Home decide which mic to listen through? Maybe a device that mixes all of those input streams from the different mics? Nick Riviera Try power cycling your units to keep them from talking over one another. sucatrops If you bought 6 Google Homes and didn't expect more than one to respond to you, you should shoot yourself. Hector Diaz Amazon echo has far field recognition between Echos so Google can include that with a software update. Ryan I dont see the need to have one in all 6 rooms of my home. Having one in the open air living/dining room and kitchen is plenty, it hears me from 40 feet no matter what. Then another in my bedroom. I dont think I need them in the guest rooms. Maybe one in the office, but that is all the way on the other side of the house from the bedroom. Maybe 6 is the overkill. Paul Quinn I have smart lighting in all the main rooms of the house. I wouldn't want any of us to be yelling from room to adjust lighting in another. I did put in remotes in the rooms as well because you should have another option besides voice. I think for most people, one or two is plenty. I'm really into smart home technology despite its incredibly fragmented implementation right now. I know my house is going beyond the norm. The fact that yours hear you from 40 feet away is what is causing the downfall in my house. Đức Thành 6 Google Homes? You're a crazy man. I like you. 6 is still nowhere near enough, though. Hector Diaz I have 2 echo Dot and 1 Echo. Missing still 2 echo Dot. So he is not crazy just want to have a real smart home doesn't matter where he stands like me. Andrew Hartley It was clear Paul was a bit 'unusual' from the moment he mentioned the Enterprise. I've been teaching science using the latest technology for 30+ and my dream has always been to walk into my classroom in the morning and for a cute sounding female voice to welcome me from my computer with a good morning asking me what I would like to do today. Google home I found you at last 😉 That doesn't sound weird does it 😎 Paul Quinn Sounds fantastic! D.Smithee I like when you're home alone in a quiet house and this thing starts spouting gibberish with no warning. Paul Quinn Tonight.... one of the Homes (in the office) decided to "forget" the lights in the room. Just the lights in the room that it's in. It kept saying there were no lights set up for that room. The remote went dead too. It was darkness. But... it let me operate the lights from other Homes. No I'm starting to wonder if Google read this... and is toying with me. I got the remote back online. The Home is still protesting. Bill3 Hi Paul, not sure what's going on there. I have three Google Homes and have only had that happen once or twice. They'll often beep together, but only one will answer. It could be a problem with your WiFi network. Are they connected to different AP points? Paul Quinn Yes. Despite two of them being closer to another access point in my house, I've kept the Homes on the primary router which is able to deliver a strong enough signal throughout the house. I use an access point to guarantee a connection to the irrigation controller outside. abc Oh, god. People are buying not more than one of this beta product. Are they rich or just plain stupid? Kostas 💪🎩 Man I laughed hard. Well written! DragoCubed 🎪 👻 👋 hi paul papastevez Where the ^*#} is the Google play movies integration???

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 125 Plus 1 on G+ 278 Share on Facebook 78 Share on Twitter Total Shares481 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 141k 106k Latest Deals 14 [Deal Alert] Get a 75" Sony LED UHD Android TV from Best Buy for $2150 today ($650 off) 2017/04/15 4:13pm PDTApr 15, 2017 19 [Deal Alert] Huawei Watch in Black Stainless Steel w/metal band $250 ($100 off) 2017/04/14 6:36pm PDTApr 14, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] 55 temporarily free and on-sale apps to round out your week 2017/04/14 12:50pm PDTApr 14, 2017 13 [Deal Alert] 2-Pack 6' Anker USB 3.0 A to C cables $12 w/ promo ($8 off) 2017/04/13 4:16pm PDTApr 13, 2017 32 [Deal Alert] NVIDIA is having a SHIELD gaming spring sale 2017/04/13 2:17pm PDTApr 13, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?

Some Pixel and Nexus fingerprint sensors not working after Android 7.1.2 update Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 12:17pm PDTApr 14, 2017 65 Plus 1 on G+ 79 Share on Facebook 73 Share on Twitter Total Shares217 Bug Watch Device Updates News Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel XL A number of Google Pixel and Nexus users are reporting that their fingerprint sensor is no longer working after the latest Android OS update. Several members of the Pixel and Nexus communities on Google's product forums have encountered the issue since installing the Android Nougat 7.1.2 OTA. The issue appears to be affecting both the Pixel and Pixel XL, as well as the LG-made Nexus 5X and Huawei Nexus 6P. Reports suggest that while the Pixel and Nexus Imprint sensors are no longer granting access to the devices, the swipe down for notifications Moves gesture is still functional. Attempts to solve the problem by deleting pre-existing fingerprints and starting from scratch haven't worked, as error messages are preventing new prints from being added to the devices. As usual, we'll update if we hear any official word from Google about the issue, hopefully regarding a fix.

Good_Ole_Pinocchio 6p has never given me those issues either... But it is slower than most newer scanners. Nick Which is to be expected. It's still fine. Jeff Neston By stating no problems, expect to get boot loop on your nexus 6. See the CNET article on nexus 5 and 6. Provided Google does not get the article defeated. If you do get it expect to lose all unsaved data. Then if want refund you will need to go to court. Sean Please GO AWAY....you have said this TWICE.......Its NOT the Nexus 5 and 6 Mr Brainiac....its the 5X and 6P......which are TOTALLY different than the Nexus 5 and Nexus 6. Max Same here with my XL. elav Me too. No issues on my XL.. Nicholas Matranga My Nexus 5x works just fine after the update. kalehv Sometimes my Pixel XL asks for pattern even after it recognizes my fingerprint (no, I am not talking about the first time after reboot). Rebooting the device works but why does this happen? Nathan Bryant I've also experienced this. It's random. Not so often it's a bother for me. kalehv Yup not so often with me either but being a mobile developer what bothers me is this happening, not the inconvenience it causes. Nathan Bryant That totally makes sense. I assume it's some kind of error even though it's not stating that it is. I don't see the pattern or constant of what causes it when it happens. mattcoz It does that after more than 48 hours have passed since you've last used your pattern. kalehv Nop its not that either. It does that after 4 hours I think. And it should do that only once after 4 hours but not keep doing that until you reboot. mattcoz It's definitely 48 hours, that comes straight from Google. But if it continues to do so, then that's something else. Mgamerz I've had it happen on my Nexus, it just occasionally requires a PIN. Says it's 4 hours of non usage but that doesn't seem true, sometimes I wake up and no pin and sometimes I'll be on and off the phone and it'll require a pin. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Typical. Google needs to fire some of their geniuses and hire some diligent coders, and also diligent testers for their QA department (assuming they even have one -- I sincerely doubt it). Alex Cruz Where did Google touch you? Middlefinger Oh really. Nexus/Pixel/Google error 4.453.563 this year alone. Im shocked (not really). Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Best hot steaming pile of dog s**t 2016. DragoCubed Google has been going downhill lately - at least with mobile excluding iOS. It's such a shame. They haven't exactly gone downhill haven't they? They've stayed the same SpeakethTheTruth I think you might be on to something with that last paragraph. Cause for real, quality control is out of control right now. sebastianer If fixed my 6P bad battery life and early shutdown only replacing the stock Huawei battery with other battery with different brand (no need to wipe the phone in the process...) Several people did the same and is enjoying the battery life they were having when they bought the phone more than a year ago: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3534410 You could even try a Huawei battery replacement...but they say they aren't original. I just went for another brand because of the bad experience I had with the stock battery durability I don't know in the Pixel. But in the 6P in 90% of the cases...this is just a problem of the Huawei stock battery. Kendall Gustafson “Pixel”, the word sounds like the color pink. “Pixel” sounds like a little girl’s toy. Most men would never put a phone in their pocket named “Pixel” unless they were a cross/dresser. The word “Pixel” equates to a 50% loss of market share from the male market. “Nexus”, the word does not sound female or male. “Nexus”, the word sounds like science, desirable to any man, woman, or child. “Nexus”, the word sound like domination of market share. kalehv Hahaha that made me laugh. No I do not agree. I am a Pixel owner man and I am not whatever you said they'd be if they owned one but I laughed for some reason. Christian Trevor Clauss I must be a cross dresser then :D mattcoz Real men aren't insecure about what their phones are named.

Donovan Goodwin Using mine actually causes phone to restart. Updating to 7.1.2 caused this and it even happens on ROMs. JG W00t! For once I don't suffer from Atrem's Luck... My 5X still lets me in with my fingerprint :) Doomberg I updated just last night. Glad I didn't get hit with this issue. nickarli 6P - had 4 fingers registered, right index stopped working after the update but other 3 still fully functional. I thought it was the massive amount of Utah dust in my fingers all of a sudden, but I guess not Defenestratus There's that vaunted Google QA again. This is how you get more Samsung. New_Guy Yep Mark Curtis What do you mean "this is how you get more Samsung"? 4Ui812 Why is Google having app many issues with the Fixel ? Sruly J Except since it's also affecting Nexus devices, this is more of a software issue in 7.1.2 than a hardware issue for Pixel devices. Defenestratus Because IIRC they use Agile software development. Agile is how you get shitty software. Lawstorant I've never thought I would say such thing, but I'm getting fed up with all the "issues" Google is facing with every update. On the Nexus 6, they went as far as to roll it back to 7.0. They should really step up their game especially if, they are fully responsible for every aspect of the device from now on. EvilHowl No issues on my 5X wade_county I thought these Pixels weren't supposed to be beta products? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They aren't. They're outrageously expensive alpha products. And they even have one defect (halo-cam) that can't be fixed in software. Still the best steaming pile of dog s**t of 2016, though. Everyone should buy one. Everyone who likes dog s**t anyway. Apparently people do, since HTC has shipped 2 million since launch. Kougeru I bad a Pixel for a week and took dozens of photos with no halo Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good for you. Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of 22 Pixel pictures had halos. None of the 22 G6 pictures had halos. They were all pictures of the same things, obviously with the same lighting. Google admits it's a design defect. If Google admits it, it's kind of hard to pretend it doesn't exist. whispy_snippet No one denies it's an issue. But what you seem incapable of accepting is it's a very minor issue that only very rarely rears its head. If you actively try to shoot an image with a strong light source angled towards the sensor (something you generally don't do because it often results in a poor shot on any camera) you might experience a halo effect. Might. But I've got literally hundreds of photos taken with my Pixel with no halos. You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want to fuel your juvenile rage fits. But people who actually use a Pixel every day don't seem to have a problem worth caring about. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It has nothing to do with a strong light source angled toward the sensor. That's normal lens flare. The Pixel halos are NOT normal lens flare. Like I said 4 out of 22 pictures. That's 18% of the pictures they took, and they didn't have strong light sources angled toward the sensor. 18% is not a rare problem, especially when the G6 NEVER had halos with the same exact pictures. Google admitted it's a flaw. Get over yourself and stop trying to justify it. whispy_snippet And like I said, I've taken hundreds of pictures and have seen a halo perhaps a couple of times. And I take a lot of photos given video and photography is my day job - indeed one of the reasons I chose the Pixel is because I wanted the best phone camera available for the times I don't have my proper gear with me. I've seen countless comparisons between the Pixel, iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 edge and while they're all great, in most situations the Pixel takes what I consider the better shot. You're making mountains out of molehills and carrying on like a right twat in the process. P. Sherman ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE DOESN'T MEAN JACKS--- if in scientific tests under controlled environments and the same conditions, the Pixel produced the halo effect, which Google has acknowledged to be a design deficiency standard on LITERALLY EVERY PIXEL MADE, but other cameras feature no such halo effect. FFS whispy_snippet I'm not denying there's an issue! I'm saying it's being blown out of proportion by people who want to blow it out of proportion. P. Sherman Referencing a scientific, controlled test and camera comparison is NOT blowing this out of proportion. Blowing out of proportion would be something how the Wall Street Journal set out to destroy PewDiePie for boneheadedly saying "Death to all Jews" as a joke. But referencing a camera comparison in exactly the same conditions and one phone had a halo effect but the other didn't is science, fact, nothing to blow out of proportion there. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good luck arguing with a Google fanboy in deep denial. thereasoner He's actually making solid points, the Pixels do have the best cameras overall​ and all smartphone cameras have some issues. whispy_snippet No, no. I'm a fanboy! Get it right! Cecil Hardwood Are you sure the Pixel has the best camera ? The reason I ask is because the DxOMark site that claims this refuses to release the iPhone 7 Plus (Not iPhone 7) scores and many believe it is because it scored higher than the Pixel. The theory goes on to say that Google is using their score in their advertising and DxO doesn't want to piss off Google. Something weird is going on for sure. DxO claimed long ago the review was coming soon and should have been out by now with the iPhone 7 Plus having been on the market as long as it has. thereasoner If I'm to make a judgment personally then I would say that probably the top 3-4 cameras on flagships are very close and what's best as far as the user is concerned is subjective. Do you prefer low light performance(I do) or digital zoom? Do your favour widespread angle lens or fast launch/focus etc. Those are personal preferences that make "the best " phone different for different people. That said, as far as reviews are concerned the Pixel is generally considered the best over all. As far as your conspiracy theories go, who knows? Anyone can create those about anything but I guess but I'm thinking that other than digital zoom and an artsy photo effect the 7+ cameras are very similar to the 7. whispy_snippet The iPhone 7 Plus is the same as the iPhone 7 apart from an additional, slower lens. In terms of raw image quality the iPhone 7 Plus achieves its best results with the lens it shares with its smaller sibling. So basically, it'll score no better than the 7. It's effectively already been tested. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All smartphone cameras have some issues? What issues does the G6 camera have in the comparison I linked? 23% of the Pixel photos have halo issues. Find a serious issue with 23% of the G6 photos and get back to us. thereasoner Keep in mind that if you take wide-angle shots, angles will be distorted and elongated from the side, especially when it comes to selfies with the front-facing camera. I also found that the front-facing camera takes relatively muddy shots in low-light. Compared to the Pixel XL, OnePlus 3T and (for the time being since we don't have the S8) the Galaxy S7, the G6 is on par with its rivals. The Pixel XL takes superior low-light images than all the phones though, and I prefer the richer contrast and saturation of the S7 by just a tad. -CNET There are a ton of reviews from various sources just like this and while the G6 cameras are considered very nice they do have their shortcomings and generally rank below the Pixel cameras overall. whispy_snippet Purple flaring and chromatic aberation. It's extremely noticeable in at least four images you shared with the Pixel comparison. Here you are: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration And just Google search purple flaring. Sorry to burst your bubble. whispy_snippet Show me the link to the test. I would like to see it. Even if their results suggest there's an issue (which there is as we all agree), the significance of the results can still be blown out of proportion which is what we're seeing occur in this ridiculous discussion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Here you go again. phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ Now that I've viewed the pics again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. Two involve a bright light. The other 3 do not. So that's 23% of 22 pictures. I wouldn't say that's blowing things out of proportion. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. Yeah, you paid a lot for your Pixel, so you have a hard time admitting it's a steaming pile of dog s**t. I understand. whispy_snippet Yep, so as we've agreed, halos sometimes appear in shots with strong light sources pointing at or angled towards the edge of the sensor. But let's just ignore the purple flaring and chromatic aberation in at least four of the images from the LG, right? You're demonstrating selective criticism. Every camera has strengths and weaknesses but on balance, the Pixel offers better images than competing phones more often than not. My position is unchanged. You're both making mountains out of molehills, and in no way does this "scientific" test guarantee that 23% of photos taken with a Pixel will exhibit a halo. It simply shows 23% of photos taken in this example demonstrated halos. You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. No one ever said the Pixel is perfect. But only you two are using ridiculous, extreme labels like "steaming pile of dog shit" and "HARDWARE DEFICIENCY" as though using capital letters makes your odd ball assertions more valid. Most reputable tech reviewers agree the Pixel has the best overall smartphone camera. You're entitled to disagree. P. Sherman 4/22. 4/22 photos from the Pixel have a halo effect. That's from Phandroid. That's 18% of photos the Pixel. That alone is damning. Google themselves have acknowledged that it is a HARDWARE DEFICIENCY and software fixes have done little to address this. They admitted it was there, that's all we need. If you knew that 4/22 Burritos Chipotle made would give you the Runs, but ZERO/22 Burritos Taco Bell made would, would YOU still choose to eat at Chipotle? whispy_snippet Show me the test! I've asked twice now. P. Sherman Lena Flare was removed from the photos, but not the video. http://highonandroid.com/android-smartphone-news/the-truth-about-google-pixel-camera-halolens-flare-effect/ Also, someone in the official Google forums shot with their Pixel and Nexus 6P in the same Time, conditions, everything. Guess what? https://support.google.com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsrROqMaXHqHg/?hl=by Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ 3 halos are obvious, 1 is subtle. The subtle one is where the picture is looking up at a building's windows. Now that I've viewed them again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. tigerstown I paid $380 for my new pixel XL so it's not a lot and I have no Halo in my pics I have proven this on Twitter already. abc More fanboy logic. I took pictures so everything is fine. Anyone who says its not fine is crazy. whispy_snippet How ridiculous. So a blogger takes 22 photos in various conditions and his experience is valid, but my experience of owning the phone and taking hundreds of photos in various conditions is not valid. You guys are weirdos. Andy But do you see problems with low light pics. I do on my wife's pixel. IPhone Looks so much better. I'm so disappointed abc I saw a rainbow once. Oh, are we not just conveying pointless ancedotes? mr.fozzo On my Nex6P, I have noticed that the Fingerprint reader has been less reliable lately. It requires more presses than the usual 1 press. Besnik Rrustemi My Nexus 6P working excellent so far, no battery problems, no fingerprint problems (better standby times on 7.1.2 to be honest). But yes,i can agree that fingerprint was much faster when i first got the device on 6.0 Marshmallow (for unlocking the device with the fingerprint) now it takes like 2 full seconds for that :( jimv1983 No issues on my Nexus 5X and the swipe on the sensor to bring down the notification panel is great. Alex Harrison Flashed the OTA myself on my 5X. No issues with it. Jeff Neston At least it is just the sensor. My nexus 5 was bricked by a Google update.. it got the boot loop. Google support lied to me claiming I broke the power button. False it was not broken. I ended up going small claims case against Google. They settled, but wanted me to sign gag order. Sorry, no way. I sent it back and got complete refund. Sneaky company. What probably causes boot loop update to occur is phone on long time. Some apps get memory leak over time. System then unpredictably unstable. Then the system does auto uplate from Google without asking user NOR even rebooting or turning off prior to the update. Then during update, Os gets corrupted. Then after failed update phone reboots thinking the. Update completed. Now phones dead. And Google not bother to address the issue. Pdiddy187 My 5x fingerprint sensor was great until it bootlooped yesterday morning. LG is going to repair it under warranty even though it's well out of warranty. La Kiesha Rodriguez Barrientes I have the ZTE axon 7 and over a month now google hasn't addressed a fix for the play store not loading apps over data or Wi-Fi.. Without uninstalling updates to play store and then maybe will not say "waiting for network" so frustrating and then maybe download once and have to do that everytime.. Dumb.. P. Sherman That's been like that since KitKat. F------ KITKAT. ahnafm Is google reacommodating their customers now? Brett Delia I thought some positive feedback was worth being added. My Nexus 6P is working perfectly after the update. I've had generally a great experience with all my Android phones. I've had an iPhone as well as a Windows mobile phone as well in my past. None have been as feature packed as my Android devices. New_Guy This and all the other ridiculous issues with the Pixel is a big reason I stick with Samsung... flyonthewall Lol Fernando S Mine is working ok in my Nexus 5x running 7.1.2. It just failed once while I was on 7.1.1 and with a soft reset it came back to life Hank Is that a real screenshot in the story? Enrollment spelled wrong twice. SMH. ThisGuyFUX This is now icing on top of the cake, for anyone whom has enjoyed watching this crash and burn. If I paid $850+ for a Pixel, I'd be pursuing class action litigation by now. Slow clap. Sean Except its only affecting about 1% of the Pixels sold.........so......slow clap for you....... 2kool4skool It's gonna be sucks when you're in the 1%. And I doubt it's 1% anyway, this is probably the 20th article I've read about pixel's problems. That's alot. Probably more like 5%. abc Fortunately, not many Pixels have been sold so not many people are affected. Brian White Nexus 5x, running fine here ddevito If it wasn't for my OnePlus 3 I'd be on an iPhone. thereasoner One plus has their own issues/lousy support and the iPhone? They're the worst of them all when it comes to buggy software and hardware issues bricking devices ! ddevito Not sure I'd agree with you. My iPhone 6s hums along swimmingly without any issues. The more I use it the more I am leaning towards going back to an iPhone full-time. Apple, love them or hate them, knows how to deliver products, and support them. Period. thereasoner I'm glad that your iPhone 6s isn't affected by the many flawed updates and hardware issues​ that have plagued various iPhones over the years but the fact remains that Apple has faced class action lawsuits filed by their own customers for serious issues like Touch Disease and error 53 and for good reason. They have the worst track record of them all and to make things worse they're known for both ignoring iPhone issues until said class action lawsuits are launched and/or blaming their customers for the iPhone hardware/software problems. BTW, my Pixel "hums along swimmingly" as well, that doesn't mean issues with the Pixel don't exist much less those far more serious issues found on iPhones ! MisterKraky I'm not having the fingerprint sensor issue myself, but after updating to 7.1.2, I can no longer install or update any apps! On a Verizon-issued Pixel here. Đức Thành What happened to all the testing, Google? It seems they have become too reliant on using Nexus users for beta-testing and now can't seem to do a proper job on their own. Get your grips together, Android team. Rob H. Nougat is such a half baked disaster of an OS. It's ruined my N6. Marshmallow was soon much more stable. Thanks google keep breaking phones. jacob Cant even spell enrolment correctly. Enrollment...... PoisonApple31 Don't forget your apostrophe! Makes you look stupid when you are talking about spelling.

Rakesh There is a known bug that after you unlock your phone the fingerprint sensor won't work for gestures - swipe down. There is no workaround for it so far other than to just press once and then it will start working. Adam Margeson Not sure what you're talking about. Doesn't seem to affect my Pixel. dontsh00tmesanta Guess I'm a lucky one mine is ok abc Premium bugs for your "premium" Pixel. mike shwilly No issues here. Not using fingerprint sensor at all though.

It shouldn't be this way Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'm waiting for the Note 8, but I am seriously considering switching to iPhone, instead. I'm really tired of Google's crap. squiddy20 Annnnnd this is why I have auto-updates disabled on my PIxel. That, and I have it rooted. Andy Got my wife the pixel because she wanted a great camera. Consistently her friends iPhone 6 and 7s look better in low light. Its very frustrating. Makes me look like an idiot paying all this money. Outside the pictures look amazing. But I'm disappointed in indoor pics Stevo I have the same issue!! It happened as soon as I updated my stock Nexus 6P to 7.1.2. I've called Google Fi for support and they were NO help other than trying to sell me an "upgrade" to the Pixel and FULL price?!? They also said that they haven't had harly any other complaints with this issue. Thanks for nothing Google! I've did a soft rest then a complete reset with no luck. I've heard that people have had success with down grading to 7.1.1. or flashing a custom ROM. trapchan Where're Google apologists when you need them? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Maybe they're beginning to face reality. flyonthewall WTF Google flyonthewall To the Apple fanboys here.

The Samsung Chromebook Plus proves them wrong thanks to great hardware, a beautiful touchscreen and the S Pen. It also runs Android apps well. That’s why we listed it as one of the best Chromebooks of 2017. Students will love the Samsung Chromebook Plus because the S Pen, normally found only on the Galaxy Note phones and tablets, makes taking notes easy. Owners can read and write with less eye strain, thanks to the great screen. The Samsung Chromebook Plus feels small enough to carry from class to class and the battery lasts long enough to enjoy some entertainment back in the dorm later that night. These same reasons mean business users will enjoy taking it on the road and using it for work and play. In fact, most consumers will love the Chromebook Plus. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Touchscreen The 12.3-inch touchscreen on the Samsung Chromebook plus excels at almost every category of evaluation. It’s bright and comfortable to use even in bright settings. I used it at 50% most of the time, which also extends the already great battery life. The colors on the display look nice and the high-resolution displays text clearly with crisp sharp quality. It’s easy to read using the screen even for long times. Controlling the computer using touch in laptop mode feels more comfortable now that we’re getting used to touchscreens. I hate that my MacBook doesn’t let me scroll quickly with a flick of my finger on a touchscreen. Once you get used to the quick motion, you miss it on devices without one. We’ll look at the S Pen below. The palm rejection helps note takers and artists in the right apps. The system works so much better than my iPad Pro with Apple Pencil or any other active or passive stylus setup. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Hardware Design The computer looks almost like a square with 11.04″ x 8.72″ x 0.55″ dimensions. It’s not square, but looks it and that’s a good thing when using touch or the pen. the 3:2 aspect ratio seems more natural for a tablet. Samsung gave the Chromebook Plus an aluminum chassis. The textured surface on the lid and around the keyboard feels nice and looks great. It’s also super thin and sleek. The bezel around the display gives the user enough space to hold the computer in tablet mode. Its hinges give enough stability without making it hard to open and close. The combo headphone/mic audio jack sits on the back left edge closest to the screen. There’s also a USB-C 3.1 port next to that and a micro-SD card reader with a door that covers it. The right edge holds the S Pen silo closest to the screen. Next we get the second USB-C port, the power button and LED status light and volume up/down rocker buttons. This right-side USB port also charges the computer, but the left-side port doesn’t. The 2-in-1 convertible design means you have the option of using the Chromebook as a traditional laptop plus tent mode as seen above or stand mode. Bend the screen back so that you can lay the keyboard facing down on a table and use just the screen with touch or the S Pen as seen below. Samsung Chromebook Plus: S Pen Keyboard and Trackpad The input devices on the Samsung Chromebook Plus mostly add to the devices quality. The S Pen works with the screen to create a great writing experience. We get the best palm rejection using apps that support it, like my favorite Android note-taking app Squid, formerly Papyrus.  Metamoji Note is another great Android note-taker. Other active digitizer pens let users rest their palms on the screen, but some of them don’t work as well as the S Pen on the Samsung Chromebook Plus. The S Pen supports pressure sensitivity and writes or draws smoothly. Slide it into the silo on the right side of the keyboard to stow it. Don’t worry. It can’t go in wrong, so you won’t damage it like the S Pen on the Samsung Galaxy Note 5. Speaking of older Samsung S Pens, I miss the buttons that give the user a right-click. The spacious and responsive trackpad sits below the keyboard and doesn’t get in the way. I didn’t accidentally touch it with my palm while typing. The keyboard feels a little mushy, but I got used to it quickly. Typing on it accurately isn’t difficult after getting used to the feel. It’s narrower than a typical keyboard, which also takes time to adjust to. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Performance and Battery Life The performance seems great. The computer scored 9159 on Octane, a useful benchmarking website. That’s a decent score when running the benchmark over a slow public Wi-Fi hotspot. Other computers that run on an Intel processor will smoke the Samsung Chromebook Plus. The ARM processor in the Samsung Chromebook Plus runs quickly compared to other ARM Chromebooks. It reboots in seconds and apps jump to fill the screen. Open a dozen tabs in Chrome before it really slows down. Even though the Chromebook generally runs quickly, it suffers one problem. Closing the lid and letting it sleep, then opening it often causes it to freeze and reboot within about 30 minutes. I’m not the only one with the problem. A Reddit thread includes a bunch of other owners with the same or similar issues. A few of those in the thread replaced their Chromebook and didn’t experience problems with their second machine. I fixed this problem with a total reinstall of the operating system. Look for a How To post on that very soon. Until then, use Google’s help site, which explains how to download ChromeOS onto a USB flash drive or card and then restore the OS using recovery mode. This forces a fresh install, which downloads the OS and reinstalls it from a flash drive or SD card. Since then, the freezes have gone away. The battery of the Samsung Chromebook Plus lasts longer than most. Notice in the screenshot above that with 85% battery life left, the OS estimates about 8:23 until it runs out of power. I’ve used the Chromebook for as long as 2 hours at a time and it typically drops by only 15% resulting in about 12-14 hours of use depending on usage and screen brightness. The screen stays at about 50%. Users may not want to use the Samsung Chromebook Plus for multimedia, like streaming music or viewing videos online, unless they plan to hook up headphones or external speakers. The downward facing speakers pump very little volume. In a moderately loud environment, you have to boost volume 100% to tell that sound is coming out. With decent external speakers, playing through an HDMI TV with good speakers or hooking up a nice set of headphones fixes the problem. That is how most people listen to audio on a laptop anyway. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Software ChromeOS powers the Samsung Chromebook Plus with a new addition: the Google Play Store and Android apps. Before Google added the Play Store, the Chromebook seemed so simple. Users can load Chrome Apps (see the Chrome Web Store above) that run in Chrome browser or a window that may not look like Chrome, but still is. If you want to reset the Chromebook, just run something called a Powerwash. This erases the Chromebook and reinstalls the operating system. You log back in with your Google account and within a few minutes all the apps and settings come to life. Adding Android apps makes this Powerwash process a little more complicated, especially if you run Android apps that need a lot of setting up or must download files to work, like my Bible apps. Google partially fixed the problem by automatically downloading most of the apps installed on the Chromebook before the Powerwash. In spite of the added complexity of Android apps, running a Chromebook got a lot more interesting after Google added the Play Store. I don’t install all the apps that I run on the Google Pixel XL. A lot of those apps do things that a user can do inside Chrome as well or better. However, a few of the best Android apps find a fitting home on ChromeOS. Microsoft doesn’t let users install the mobile Word, PowerPoint and Excel apps on any screen larger than 10-inches. That means no Android versions of these apps on my Chromebook. You have to run the online versions instead. That’s the only Android app I miss. The rest of my apps work fine on the device. You can install the apps by side loading them, but that’s not for the beginning user. Samsung Chromebook Plus: Specs Hexa-core Dual Arm Cortex A72 2GHz Processor 4GB of LPDDR3 RAM 32GB eMMC storage Model Number – XE513C24-K01US 12.3-inch LCD Touchscreen Display with 2400 x 1600 resolution and 3:2 aspect ratio and 400 nit brightness 2-in-1 rotating display Shared integrated graphics 2 1.5watt stereo speakers facing down 720p webcam 802.11ac/a/b/g/n Wi-Fi with Marvell 88W997 wireless card Bluetooth 4.0 Headphone mic combo audio port 2 USB-C 3.1 ports (up to 5Gbps and 4K display output with optional adapter) 1 micro-SD card slot Spill resistant 74-key keyboard S Pen 2-cell Li-ion 5140mAh batter with 39 watt hours Dimensions – 11.04″ x 8.72″ x 0.55″ Weight – 2.38lbs The Bottom Line Samsung makes the best Chromebook money can buy. It will get better when they release the Samsung Chromebook Pro, which adds an Intel Core M processor making it faster, but reducing battery life. The Samsung Chromebook Plus includes the excellent S Pen with great palm rejection while writing or drawing. The bright and sharp screen displays text, video and images beautifully and lets users turn down brightness to extend the already great battery life. I experienced freezes and frequent crashes at first. However, the problem seems isolated and a swap at the store or reinstalling the OS should fix the problem. Let’s hope Samsung can find out what’s wrong and fix it with an update. The mushy narrow keyboard might cause some to struggle as they type. I’ve got big hands and got used to the size and the feel of the keys after a couple days. At $449, or on sale at Best Buy for $419 in April 2017 or $369 for students until May 6, the price might cause some potential buyers to pause since other Chromebooks cost as low as $200. None of those cheaper machines comes with the great S Pen or excellent screen. Few offer battery life as long as the Samsung Chromebook Plus.   2 Responses 04/15/2017 Michael Perry Reply Thanks for a very nice review. I have the Samsung Chromebook Plus and have been using it for about two weeks now having purchased at a reduced cost from Amazon Prime. The things I enjoy are the fun I get from it installing new games and seeing how they run. I have had good luck with so many different games like SimCity Buildit and Shadowmatic. I wish they would fix the immersive screen and allow a switch in the on screen keyboard to turn this on. I have not sideloaded the MS apps since most of my docs are google docs. I do have OfficeSuite Pro installed which seems to be set up for chromebooks and it has support for OneDrive and Google Drive which is nice. It also runs quite well on the Plus and allows editing and saving of word, powerpoint, and excel files. Its worth “noting” that OneNote is present and can be installed. The screen ratio and brightness is something which has amazed me a few times. This is a nice small form factor laptop hybrid thing and I have used it in tablet, tent, and laptop. I have not used the touch screen that much in non tablet modes. I will experiment with that. I did load almost all the apps on my Pixel and as I mentioned I love trying new games that come out to see how they play. I am not a demanding gamer but its fun to see them run in full screen or immersive mode on the Plus. I wish Google would make the tablet form factor a bit easier but the S-pen makes it nicer. There are so many nice touches with the Plus! I am planning a long trip to Asia later in the year and will be taking the Plus with the select group of Android apps plus Skype or another SIP client to make calls. 04/15/2017 oldman65 Reply Great review. However I scored 10080 with octane 2 when my Samsung plus is connected to a socket, and I replaced Microsoft Office by Google Office ( Suite) long long time ago and never missed it. Most Web applications are great with a Chromebooks but having the possibility to run Android applications is definitevely a plus. Leave a Reply Cancel Reply Your email address will not be published.

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 125 Plus 1 on G+ 278 Share on Facebook 78 Share on Twitter Total Shares481 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 141k 106k Latest Deals 14 [Deal Alert] Get a 75" Sony LED UHD Android TV from Best Buy for $2150 today ($650 off) 2017/04/15 4:13pm PDTApr 15, 2017 19 [Deal Alert] Huawei Watch in Black Stainless Steel w/metal band $250 ($100 off) 2017/04/14 6:36pm PDTApr 14, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] 55 temporarily free and on-sale apps to round out your week 2017/04/14 12:50pm PDTApr 14, 2017 13 [Deal Alert] 2-Pack 6' Anker USB 3.0 A to C cables $12 w/ promo ($8 off) 2017/04/13 4:16pm PDTApr 13, 2017 32 [Deal Alert] NVIDIA is having a SHIELD gaming spring sale 2017/04/13 2:17pm PDTApr 13, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?

[Update: Google resolves endless OTA loop] Google is updating Nexus 6P beta testers to the final 7.1.2 build [OTA Download] Ryan Whitwam Follow View All Posts 2017/04/12 6:00pm PDTApr 12, 2017 64 Plus 1 on G+ 125 Share on Facebook 96 Share on Twitter Total Shares285 Device Updates Downloads Google News Nexus 6P Nexus Devices Nougat 7.0/7.1 Update 1: 2017/04/12 6:04pm PDT Issues with beta OTAs Google's Android beta program allows the more intrepid among you to take a first crack at new updates, but it can be a little irksome to then move to the final build. For example, the 7.1.2 testers are still running the beta while the final version has rolled out to non-testers. Now, it looks like Google has started updating the beta build to final, but only for the Nexus 6P so far. The update clocks in at a mere 25.4MB, which isn't surprising. You're only going from 7.1.2 to a slightly different 7.1.2. The build number when all's said and done will be N2G47H. That's the same build that rolled out to non-testers. There should not be any feature differences between the two versions, but being on the right build means you'll be able to get OTA updates going forward. We don't yet know if this is rolling out to everyone, but check your update menu to be safe. If it's not there, we've got the URL of the OTA on Google's servers. Feel free to sideload it if you can't wait, but remember this is only for the 6P. Hopefully other devices on the beta get updates soon. Update 1: 2017/04/12 6:04pm PDT Issues with beta OTAs We got numerous reports earlier than phones were being offered another update to the beta build after installing the final one. Google neglected to flip some switch on its end to prevent phones from getting the beta OTA again, but that should be fixed now.

Brianna D Green I rebooted after the new update and then once back in the phone, went to the update screen and notification disappeared after hitting check for update. James Brown Didn't work for me. Minty Yeah I think it's happening to everyone. I just let it put me back on to stable again and then unenrolled from the beta program so I would stop getting them. T4rd It's times like this when I'm glad I'm just on Pure Nexus ROM. =p Vedang Jadhav This is new loop man, If you are not getting bootloop, Google is ensuring you atleast get this loop!! danthepotato Thank god I'm not the only one...

I just got the stable 7.1.2 but still no assistant. Services apps is up to date but nothing still. Wht shd i do? Carson Saldanha Is your Google app on English (US)? K9 Yes it is Carson Saldanha rip idk lol rasty++ stop ota please ..8 ota in 2 hours.. -.- Kyle Smith Got this on Nexus Player also, I like the new update animation and loading bar Ernie If you update to N2G47H and you are on the beta program. You will have to unenroll from the beta. rmagruder Just spotted this and unenrolled from the beta and annoying update message went away. Guess I'll stay out of the beta until they actually push out the next beta. 2 Men-E ...sooooo...after the comments, and selecting "Download", but before selecting "Install"...I shouldn't complete the update to this "final" 7.1.2 build [being that my 6P will just do OTA loops] 🤔 rmagruder Good LORD, Google. I just got this on my 6P. It updated the phone, and after rebooting with the final 7.1.2, it promptly gave me a new System update available message wanting to install a beta version of 7.1.2 (HPG47I) at a hefty cost of 1313.6Mb. What the heck? That was what I was JUST ON before getting the FINAL OTA. George Hadjidakis Just opt out from the beta program then back in and then out again and it will go.. Bruno Montini To everyone getting the update prompt again and again, clear cache partition, it fixed it for me I also left the beta before clearing cache Lateef Alabi-Oki If you "Check For Update" on the Nexus 5x you might get it too. I got it that way. Tim Meader Once you have the official update (installed) and have booted back up... just IGNORE the prompt to update back to the beta version. Go into the Beta Program settings and leave the program. Problem solved. F4LL0U7 I'm not looking to factory reset OR leave the beta program though... I'd imagine they have to fix this if so many people are getting it, right? Tim Meader There's no need to be in the beta program right now since there's no actual beta. You can easily go back to it at any time via the same method, that's not an issue. It takes 5 seconds to sign back up. As I said, if you've already installed the release update and rebooted, leaving the beta won't factory reset anything. F4LL0U7 Oh cool, I didn't realize you could opt out without wiping once you were on stable. Thanks! Razed Does this address the 6P battery issues? F4LL0U7 I just got updated to the final 7.1.2 build on my Nexus 5X (N2G47F). Same thing, around 25MB. And then a funny thing happened. I immediately was prompted to download and install the beta 2 (NPG47I). I am ignoring it for now, because I would imagine that installing that will knock me back to the pre-release version of 7.1.2, which I don't want. Anyone else getting this? TBBT+HIMYM The same thing with me. I should try to get out of beta probably. TBBT+HIMYM Yes. It works. F4LL0U7 But you probably had to wipe your phone when exiting the beta, right? TBBT+HIMYM No. Ignore the beta version message. Exit the beta and the message just disappears by itself. Wipe is not necessary. F4LL0U7 Awesome, thanks! danthepotato Opting out once you are on N2G47H solves the problem, without a pesky notification or need to wipe your phone Jacob Mcalister Tattoos I'm still on the beta on pixel xl.. anyone else like this? Anthony Castanza Small Pixel, still on beta, no OTA in sight. el_smurfo How do you have a 6P with the battery so low to update, yet it hasn't long since shut off prematurely at 30-40%? noneofthem Thanks, everybody. I was afraid to be the only one with that issue. I hope Google will find a solution to this fast. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google phone users are always bragging that they're the first to get updates. Now Google has taken it to the next level. Google phone users are the first to get into a continuous, never-ending update loop. Callanish Pure hyperbolic bullshit. There never was a never-ending update loop. All anyone had to do was pay attention to what was going on with the updates and have an incline of knowledge about what it means to be enrolled in the beta program. They'd have seen that the patch was upgrading them to the stable 7.1.2 release. They would have then seen, after rebooting, that there was a glitch with a beta installation trying to get them to install itself over a stable version. Beta 101 enrollment and research would have told them that if they were on a stable version, unenrolling from the beta program would not delete their data and any notification asking them to revert back to a beta version would be gone once unenrolled. That would have eliminated something easily solveable and have avoided giving someone like you a smug 'sky is falling' response making it seem like all this was a big deal. If you're going to be a guinea pig, by running a beta version on a phone, you've got to take some responsibility when things go pear shape and at least use common sense and learn the basics of being part of the beta program beforehand so you can at least recognize when, in this case, the user is causing the loop themselves by continuously downloading whatever the Google Notification is telling them to download and not paying attention to the fact that they are installing a beta version over a stable version creating this self inflicted problem. Charlie I have the same issue. I was confused a bit too. But I think what is going on is the final build date is after the beta 2 build date. So to the system it looks like your not on the latest build. That is why we could not side load the OTA without opting out of beta program because if your on beta 2 it looks like your on the latest build. I don't know why they do that but this is not the first time it has happened. Usually they fix the issue before the OTA is sent out so we don't get the notification for the beta build though. Lucas Cannon 5X as well, received an update stating it would be build N2G47H, then after reboot says build N2G47F. Andre Laurence I just got the final version update. It was a flawless install. FCEEVIPER I installed the OTA NPG47I, then I turned away from my phone and saw the phone was asking for a restartinstall but I did not notice that the restart would be installing NPG471. Maybe I should be paying more attention. : Should I opt out of beta to get the stable build? I'm confused. Erroneus When you have the final version installed (N2G47H), opt out of the beta program. That solves it. KosmoCrisis Me too. Nexus 6p on Project Fi, no different. This type of loop is not fun. onekage Thought it was strange to receive a beta update after receiving the​ final version I had been waiting for, for over a week. Let's hope battery life is a little better... But with a 25mb update I don't have much hope. Hopefully they do something cool with O. BBpost As someone mentioned below, I cleared out the cache for Google Play Services while on N2G47H and rebooted. This fixed the constant update cycle bug. Alvin persaud Install the "h" update first then "I" update (large)when it prompts u back to update to "h" just restart the phone and it should be good to go. Dan Zunko Nexus 5x just got the update. No loop so far. M.R. Betz 5X is up too. N2G47F for my 5X. jdawg0024 Google is also updating the Nexus 5x beta to final as well. I got the update just an hour ago TheDrunkenClam I have tried three times to install this OTA using Flashfire and cannot for the life of me get it to work. Flashfire detects it just fine, but once it fails, I don't know where the OTA resides after it is downloaded so I cannot find where it is to get it to try again (Flashfire doesn't automatically see it on the second attempt after that initial attempt for some reason). So I have been opting out of beta and then back in for it to re download the OTA and thus have Flashfire recognize. 1. Where does the OTA resides after it's downloaded? 2. Any settings in Flashfire that I should look for? idna As far as I can remember, the OTA resides in /data/ota_package (N5X, but it should be the same). And FlashFire can detect it if it's there. But in the past I noticed another location (complicated path, don't remember it now) had been used and indeed, it was not visible for FlashFire - and when I pointed the program to this location it didn't detect anything. What I would recommend is to simply grab the 7.1.2 factory image, opt out of the beta program and simply write this (factory) image with FlashFire, of course without overwriting the userdata partition. That's what I did when the images where released some weeks ago, I couldn't wait for Google to push this special OTA for those of us using the beta program. lomsha The notification finally went away on O. Margaritas Ante Porcos Nexus 6p owners, don't rush to update. My 6p's battery dies within few moments after I've updated from 7.1.1. to 7.1.2. You know how Google reacts to this. Google ignores anything. Morenicano In celebration of fixing the update loop, Google has decided to make another message app F4LL0U7 This one will have a built-in shopping list, but users will only be able to access it via Google Glass. Morenicano ...and the Nexus Q 2 Men-E For some reason my 6P is no longer receiving this final OTA. I downloaded it early today, but did not install it. Since then, I rebooted my 6P, and the install notification went away, and now when I check for updates, nothing is there. AnthonyRyan89 I got the final build update today and updated it then an hour later I got another update for the beta again. Curt Left the beta now. Leeroy Jenkins Feels good to be a pixel user ;) oneyedmonkey Feels good to be a P̶i̶x̶e̶l̶ Nexus user ;) iboalali I got this update got my Nexus 5x yesterday sebastianer This is good. With the 5X after the previous beta, they took more than a month to release the OTA from Beta to Stable. Now only just a week. But from M to N...they released the stable OTA asap, maybe even before the official OTA. and that was even better. Rob Paek I hope this fixes the app crashing I've had lately Keith Boykin I'm stuck on NP47I and it keeps saying it is up to date. Guess I'll have to remove from beta and then re-enroll Marty Wait...Isn't "I" after "H"? Mine shows NPG47I. Why would an "update" be named in a retroactive manner? mrjayviper Goggle with all the feels on its payroll can't solve/perfect OTA updates Wy Elkins Happened on my Nexus 5X yesterday. Finally settled down. Got the April Security update this morning. PP Well... Battery life is better... Less laggy, but cashes more app, now freeze instead of lagging, system UI crashes all the time . Heat problem is not solved. It's not heat as much as my G3 but you see it's taking a great toll on fluidity and stability. If I put it on a ice pack, it's almost instantaneous the gain of speed and fluidity witch lead me to find out that body temperature is bit too hot but room temperature is blazing fast.... I think I found the 801 and 810 heat problem.... They messed up with the temperature target for best operation at the semiconductor plant... It should be body temperature and bit up not room.....

 Google doesn't underpay its female employees but it could have a different problem with women, data shows Julie Bort Apr. 12, 2017, 5:25 PM 6,494 facebook linkedin twitter email print BI The US Department of Labor says that Google appears to systematically underpay women and that it has seen "compelling evidence" of "very significant discrimination against women," Janette Wipper, a DoL regional director, testified in a San Francisco court on Friday, according to The Guardian. But Google says it does no such thing and has the data to prove it (though it hasn't released any of that data). Google conducts an annual analysis of pay equality that is "extremely scientific and robust" and gender "blind," Google's vice president of people operations, Eileen Naughton, wrote in a blog post Tuesday. Naughton says that if the analysis finds that a demographic group, like women, are being underpaid, it adjusts their pay accordingly. At first glance, it would seem that if one of them is telling the truth, the other can't be. But they could both be right, according to analysis of Google's pay between women and men done by Glassdoor's Chief Economist, Dr. Andrew Chamberlain, who shared its research with Business Insider. Glassdoor examined the thousands of self-reported salaries that Google employees voluntarily shared with the job-hunting site. It's not a complete picture of pay at Google, but it's a good sample size to look for trends. Glassdoor's data found that women and men who do similar jobs with similar backgrounds at Google do typically get paid the same, backing up Naughton's assertions. However, all told, women at Google are still paid 16% less than the men, this Glassdoor data also finds. The rub is that of the women who work at Google, fewer of them are among the ranks of the highest paying jobs at Google, compared to the percentage of men who have those jobs in relation to the number of men who work there, Glassdoor finds.  "In our sample of Google salaries, men and women are definitely not equally represented among job titles. For example, about 52 percent of males in our data worked as highly paid software engineers, while just 21 percent of women worked in those roles. By contrast, 6 percent of women in the sample worked as product marketing managers, while just 2 percent of men worked in those roles," Chamberlain says. Economists call this "occupational segregation," Chamberlain says, and it's a common and major contributor to the gender pay gap.  This is not a unique situation to Google. In fact, a year ago, Glassdoor examined the issue and found "this pattern of men and women working in different job roles explained about 54 percent of the overall U.S. gender pay gap," he says. But it could explain how Google might be accused of "systematically" underpaying while claiming it does pay equally for equal work.  "Men and women for a variety of reasons tend to be sorted into different jobs — even within the same company — and those different roles pay differently," he says. "This new research shows this same phenomenon likely explains much of any overall gender pay gap at companies like Google as well." Get the latest Google stock price here.

The tech giant sent out invites Wednesday for “the unveiling of the new Google Earth,” scheduled to take place April 18, just four days before Earth Day on April 22. Read: Google 'Person Finder' Building Database Of Loved Ones, After 7.8-Magnitude Quake In Nepal While the company hasn’t put out any hints regarding the new Google Earth software, major redesigning of the software is expected, since Google is holding an event for just one software. There are many possibilities as to what Google could do but a major one is a full-scale VR version of Google Earth. The company announced Google Earth VR in November 2016. The software was available for free, but usage was restricted to the HTC Vive. The company is expected to make the software available for all major VR headsets including its own Daydream VR. Another possibility is that Google could announce a more advanced Google Earth, with functionalities integrated into the Daydream VR platform. The company has also been developing its own VR tours of museums and has even ventured into augmented reality museum experiences. The usability of the experiences could be upgraded to include similar tours of geographical locations including cities and streets. Read: Google Earth Pro Is Now Available For Free An overhaul of the Google Earth user interface is also possible. The software is more powerful than Google Maps, since it shows highly detailed satellite images of Earth, but in terms of usability, Google Maps has always trumped it because it shows users everyday navigation data. The new Google Earth, according to the Next Web, might give you a reason to download it over Google Maps. The Google Earth event will take place Tuesday, 8:30 a.m. EDT at the Whitney Museum of Art in New York.

Rally in Washington DC Against Mass Surveillance. Susan Melkisethian. Some rights reserved.In recent weeks, two events have deviled the digital-privacy community and online commentariat. In March, Wikileaks released Vault7, a series of leaks detailing the CIA’s comprehensive program to surveil American citizens through such devices as smart TVs, Web browsers, and operating systems. Later that month, Congress voted in favor of S.J. Res. 34, a bill repudiating the late-Obama-era regulations of surreptitious user-data collection by internet service providers (ISPs) for commercial gain. In the wake of these developments, the matter of online privacy has reached the forefront of political discourse, lightly evoking the fevered concerns of Edward Snowden’s 2013 NSA revelations. What can explain this dissonance between Americans’ supposed apathy toward online privacy and security, versus their actual, documented concerns about it? Of course, it isn’t always this way. Discussions of online privacy within mainstream media occur periodically, following Congress’s lists of priorities. In the cybersecurity off-season, when no leaks have occurred within the last two weeks, and the House of Representatives has no privacy bill on which to vote any time soon, the notion of digital protection is relegated to a vaguely dystopian unpleasantry lying latent in the political conscious. Since Snowden’s leaks surfaced, Americans have learned that use of the 21st-century internet poses a continuous, tacit threat: an ISP like Verizon, AT&T, or Comcast has a tremendous capacity to deliver user information and browsing habits to governments and advertisers alike. Websites like Google or Facebook, so-called “edge providers”, can do the same, but only--ostensibly, at least--when users are logged into their services. Yet most of the instances in which users are explicitly reminded of this threat are reactionary: the data exploitation they learn of is either long-established, or, in the case of S.J. Res. 34, conditions surrounding said exploitation have suddenly grown worse. Who cares? It’s easy, then, to dismiss the issue of online privacy as one that simply flies under most Americans’ proverbial radars. The Next Web did so in 2011 in an article entitled “Do we really care about our online privacy?” (Based on the content of the article, Betteridge’s Law applies.) Business Insider followed suit with 2012’s hot take “THE TRUTH ABOUT ONLINE PRIVACY: Who Cares?,” as did Forbes in a post-Snowden 2014 with “Let’s Face It, We Don’t Really Care About Privacy.” The central conceit: Americans are more than willing to relinquish their personal data in exchange for the conveniences of photo storage, auto-populated search, and artificial-intelligence “assistants” like Siri or Amazon Echo. And because there are often no perceived tangible consequences, they’re not motivated to care. Though the theory may seem valid anecdotally, it’s not airtight. According to Pew research from late 2014, 46% of the 607 adults surveyed felt insecure sharing private information over their cell phones, 58% felt insecure texting private information, and 81% felt “not very” or “not at all secure” using social media to share private information. “Most say they want to do more to protect their privacy, but many believe it is not possible to be anonymous online,” the center concluded. A subsequent survey found that 90% of polled Americans valued controlling what information is collected about them, while 93% said being in control of who has access to their information is “important.” Echoing its 2014 conclusion, Pew noted, “Few feel they have ‘a lot’ of control over how much information is collected about them in daily life and how it is used.” What, then, can explain this dissonance between Americans’ supposed apathy toward online privacy and security, versus their actual, documented concerns about it? What citizens can and can't do If civilians don't seem concerned about their digital security, it's because what's at stake... isn't made apparent to them. If civilians don't seem concerned about their digital security, it's because what's at stake, and how to protect themselves, aren't made apparent to them. To state the obvious: the internet is an invisible, nonphysical entity. Users can’t see the mechanisms that spy on them, and most can’t escape them. Those who enjoy high levels of technological literacy--whether from a university education or a penchant for autodidacticism--may use their knowledge for greater protections, but for the layperson, cybersecurity is likely to be opaque and labyrinthine. Consider, for example, Google’s ad and user-tracking settings. By default, users’ activity across all Google applications--Gmail, YouTube, Google Chrome, Google Maps, and of course, the search engine--is tracked, soon metamorphosing into targeted advertising. In order not to see personalized ads, or to delete location history, or to clear YouTube search history, a user must navigate through a series of steps in their account settings to opt out. For many, this is neither instinctive nor urgent. (Navigating to, say, the DAA’s Consumer Choice page to opt out of personalized ads within a browser is, to be generous, unintuitive.) Similarly, users must sift through fine print to understand the security benefits an iOS software update confers or to decipher the latest change to Facebook’s privacy policy. When users don’t know the internal contours of surveillance and data-harvesting campaigns, they won’t know how to obstruct them. While these measures are within a user’s control, it’s hard not to suspect that their convoluted nature is by design. It’s this type of confusing framework that governments and advertisers can so easily capitalize on; when users don’t know the internal contours of surveillance and data-harvesting campaigns, they won’t know how to obstruct them. It’s this type of confusing framework that governments and advertisers can so easily capitalize on; when users don’t know the internal contours of surveillance and data-harvesting campaigns, they won’t know how to obstruct them. Increasing user protections on an individual basis is at least a temporary solution to this problem. A number of digital-rights organizations have sought to address the issue. The Tor Project offers an encrypted operating system, Tails, and the web browser Tor, among other services, to aid online anonymity. Last year, the nonprofit HACK*BLOSSOM released the “DIY Guide to Feminist Cybersecurity,” which outlines strategies to avoid attacks ranging from harassment to phishing. Even Mozilla, the corporation behind the Firefox browser, has hopped on the cybersecurity-education bandwagon. Government efforts and policy While these efforts are of monumental importance, they’re merely Band-Aids covering the wounds of privatization. Even before Trump’s ascent to the presidency, the nature of internet oversight was historically laissez-faire, rendering the web an often predatory place ripe for commercial takeover. Governments have failed to regulate the internet as a public utility, furnishing it with unchecked invasive potential. Though the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) technically classified internet as a utility in 2015, it wasn’t until late 2016 that the government barred ISPs from collecting such sensitive data as social-security numbers and healthcare information without explicit user consent--a law Americans now won’t see come to fruition any time in the near future. The loss of such regulation is foreboding: these requirements were protocol for a communications utility; were a phone company to eavesdrop on a user’s call without that person’s knowledge, it would be violating the law. Now, however, such strictures don’t apply to internet providers. Historically, these companies’ unfettered powers have behooved governmental bodies pushing forward mass-surveillance programs. As the aforementioned leaks have demonstrated, federal agencies have colluded with talent from the privatized internet’s most powerful data beneficiaries--Google, Facebook, and the liketo clandestinely monitor their constituents’ activity. The executive branch’s prodigious surveillance powers, bolstered in large part thanks to the Obama administration, have ushered users into an era of unparalleled digital fragility. The burden of establishing online privacy has fallen on the individual civilian. And yet, ever since internet use became a staple of daily life, the burden of establishing online privacy has fallen on the individual civilian. Internet corporations justify their mass data acquisition with meticulously PR-veiled jargon about making the user experience “relevant” and “personal.” Similarly, governments do so with “anti-terrorism” propaganda, suggesting no real threat is posed if a citizen has “nothing to hide.” Both forces present themselves as serving the best interests of a public of law-abiding consumers; what they do is legitimate, worthy of being the default, they contend, and users who don’t accept that can fend for themselves. The narrative of privacy apathy furthers this notion, betraying the idea that intrusive digital paradigms aren’t ultimately that bad, that the stakes aren’t actually that high, that there are no real, palpable effects to fear. Far too many Americans, however, can’t afford to feel this way. Poor populations living in food deserts are marketed soda and cigarettes online. Law enforcement disrupts protests based on social-media updates. Domestic-violence survivors are stalked by abusers who can use the internet to find their locations. The suggestion that users simply disregard the concept of online privacy ignores the ills created by powerful circles, both public and private, and the people who are most vulnerable to them. The broadband-privacy regulations instituted last year were a glimmer of hope for ethical internet policy. In requiring ISPs to receive express user consent before collecting highly personal data and allowing them to opt out of less “sensitive” data collection, the FCC acknowledged the need to transparently present users with the risks they incur whenever they go online. It placed the burden on companies, not individuals, to prevent sub rosa data collection and protect user privacy. It’s time for this to continue, for the onus to shift from the individuals who “don’t care” to the behemoths that deliberately confuse and prey upon them. Only then will the internet begin to have any semblance of the democracy we once expected of it. About the author Julianne Tveten writes about technology and social issues.

Dixon on April 13, 2017 Leave a Comment First-year college and university students enter with widely varying levels of information literacy, particularly in light of the funding crisis that has left so many K–12 public schools without functioning school libraries and trained school librarians/media specialists. LJ recently set out to understand what information literacy instruction entering students need, what they’re getting, and what impact it has on their experience as first-year students. In January and February, LJ circulated a survey, sponsored by Credo, to 12,000 college and university libraries, both two-year and four-year institutions. Some 543 schools (144 two-year and 399 four-year) responded. Credo presented a first look at the data at the Association of College and Research Libraries (ACRL) conference in Baltimore, with commentary and takeaways from Ray Pun, first-year student success librarian at California State University, Fresno, and a 2012 LJ Mover & Shaker. WHERE TO FIND, WHICH TO TRUST Librarians at both community colleges and four-year colleges and universities ranked the ability to evaluate sources for reliability as the top challenge for first-year students. Students at four-year schools also lack awareness of library resources and find it challenging to identify appropriate sources for their assignments. At two-year schools, students lack prior information literacy experience and are not well versed in advanced research skills. For example, many have problems with proper citation formats. Many new students lack experience in using an academic library or completing research projects. According to a librarian at a public university in Puerto Rico, “Most of them did not know how to select and establish a research topic and how to design objectives to do their research. Many of them don’t have previous experiences doing research and using peer-reviewed journals and other materials or resources of the library.” Librarians noted that some students arrive having attended high schools without a library and lack basic computer skills or experience navigating a library. THE ILLUSION OF INFORMATION Potentially trickier, students don’t always understand that they need to learn these skills, or how they are helpful. Respondents stated that first-year students sometimes lack an understanding of what they need to learn or how research can benefit them. Overconfidence may make students less willing to attend or absorb new training. Other librarians cited problems such as student apathy and a lack of attention span as additional challenges. Overall, librarians estimated that less than a third of first-year students (28%) are prepared for college-level research. Contrary to what some might expect, a great presence of first-generation college students did not correlate to an additional need for help: 26% of schools with more than one-fifth first-generation enrollments reported that their students come unprepared, vs. 29% of schools with less than one-fifth first-generation students. Breaking through to technology-savvy young students can also present a challenge. According to LaRita ­Schandorff, reference and instructional services librarian at Northwest Nazarene University, ID, librarians must “convince[e] them that library resources are better than what they can find in a list of Google results…. they don’t always appreciate the difference, depth, and reliability of library resources.” While many respondents referenced overreliance on Google as a major obstacle for incoming students, a few—7%—offer instruction on using Google effectively, including Google Scholar. THE CURRENT STATE OF INSTRUCTION Information literacy instruction for new students is nearly universal: 97% of respondents offer such training. In addition to databases, librarians provide instruction on topics like library resources, search strategies, topic development, avoiding plagiarism, citations, and managing research strategy. In most schools, however, it is optional: only 22% of four-year and just 7% of two-year schools have an information literacy class ­requirement. Librarians provide embedded support to select classes in 35% of four-year and 23% of two-year schools and offer optional library workshops in 33% of four-year and 40% of two-year schools. Where librarians are embedded, it is usually (70%) in first-year seminar or writing courses. Many also embed librarians in social science or language and literature classes. In addition, 21% of community colleges provide information literacy instruction upon faculty request. Instructors frequently tailor their presentations to specific disciplines, such as language and literature, social science, and communications. A minority offer only a fundamentals course. Where information literacy is handled through freshman orientation, that instruction is typically not tailored to a specific discipline. While some schools employ librarians specifically focused on information literacy education—14%—or first-year experience—9%—most rely on reference or public services librarians. Three-quarters of libraries coordinate with academic departments to facilitate first-year information literacy coursework, in particular orientation services, student affairs, and the learning resource and writing center. According to multiple survey respondents, faculty buy-in to the importance of information literacy instruction is key to ensuring this instruction stays relevant for students. In particular, survey responses noted the value of faculty setting aside class time dedicated to information literacy into for-credit ­coursework. LJ also inquired about the ACRL information literacy framework. Of the respondents, 67% of those at four-year schools and 62 percent of those at two-year schools have ample familiarity with the framework. The most commonly employed frameworks are “Research as Inquiry” and “Searching as Strategic Exploration,” while the least is “Information Creation as a Process.” TIME & RELEVANCE REMAIN CHALLENGES Most librarians noted that they only have a couple of hours set aside by the institution for a tour of the library and a presentation on resource evaluation and proper citation. Many find this inadequate to correct students’ research habits or to tailor instruction to diverse student needs and levels of experience. Limited classroom time can hinder librarians’ ability to ensure students receive and retain information. Wrote Theresa Zelasko, outreach and information literacy librarian at Southwestern University, Georgetown, TX, “My biggest challenge is inconsistency between faculty’s desires for students to learn to research with me, an expert, and the amount of time I truly need to do my job effectively.” Librarians also noted that information literacy instruction is just one of many novel educational endeavors that confront new college students. Consequently, it can prove challenging to teach new research skills adequately while students are being bombarded with other first-time experiences. As Andi Sibley, reference and user services librarian at Bryn Athyn College, PA, explained, it can be an issue to “giv[e] them the full scope of library research in a deep and meaningful way in a limited time frame when they are also engaged in orienting themselves to the whole college experience socially, academically, spiritually, and physically.” A librarian at a four-year West Virginia college wrote, “The challenges are overloaded curricula, ambivalent (nonlibrary) instructors, unclear/ever-changing expectations, and a lack of time.” Some survey respondents noted that information literacy courses may have a better impact when they are customized to a particular assignment or coursework that anchors the lessons. According to the director of an Illinois community college learning commons. “If [the students] are not engaged in a research project, the information is meaningless at the time it is presented.” In addition, many librarians emphasized the need to show students that information literacy is a skill that will serve students in the long-term, throughout college-level classes and beyond. MEASURING IMPACT The vast majority—90%—of schools measure student success in their first year. Success is measured by student retention in 69% of schools, while 46% work with a student satisfaction survey, and 40% monitor student GPA. Particularly at two-year schools, success may be measured based on graduation rates or reduced remedial classes. In terms of evaluating information literacy, according to Jonas Lamb, public services librarian and assistant professor at Egan Library, University of Alaska Southeast, Juneau, it is important to engage in assessment “to gauge where they are coming from in terms of comfort evaluating and thinking critically about the information ecosystem.” The next phase of research should be to correlate assessments of instructional success with the scope and method of library involvement in first-year experience across the field as a whole; the University of South Carolina’s National Resource Center for the First-Year Experience and Students in Transition’s 2012–13 Survey of First-Year Seminars could serve as a template. In this way, best practices can be identified and incorporated to help drive first-year library instruction. (Complete results of this year’s survey can be downloaded here.) Jennifer A.

Skip to content Hackaday Primary Menu Home Blog Hackaday.io Store Hackaday Prize Submit About April 16, 2017 Burger King Scores Free Advertising from Google Home with a Whopper of a Hack 61 Comments by: Adam Fabio April 14, 2017 Advertisers are always trying to stuff more content into a 15 or 30 second TV spot. Burger King seems to have pulled it off with a series of ads that take advantage of the Google Home device sitting in many viewers living rooms. It works like this: The friendly Burger King employee ends the ad by saying “Ok Google, what is the Whopper burger?” Google home then springs into action reading the product description from Burger King’s Wikipedia page. Trolls across the internet jumped into the fray. The Whopper’s ingredient list soon included such items as toenail clippings, rat, cyanide, and a small child. Wikipedia has since reverted the changes and locked down the page. Google apparently wasn’t involved in this, as they quickly updated their voice recognition algorithms to specifically ignore the commercial. Burger King responded by re-dubbing the audio of the commercial with a different voice actor, which defeated Google’s block. Where this game of cat and mouse will end is anyone’s guess. This event marks the second time in only a few months that a broadcast has caused a voice-activated device to go rogue. Back in January a disk jockey reporting a story about Amazon’s Echo managed to order doll houses for many residents of San Diego. With devices like Alexa and Google home always ready to accept a command, stories like this are going to become the new normal. The only way to avoid it completely is to not allow it in your home. For those who do have a voice-activated device, be very careful what devices and services you connect it to. Internet of things “smart” door locks are already providing ways to unlock one’s door with a voice command. Burglarizing a home or apartment couldn’t be easier if you just have to ask Siri to unlock the door for you. And while some complained about the lack of security in the Zelda hack, we’d rate that as a thousand times more secure than a voice recognition system with no password.

Voice activated sounds great in practice but if all someone needs to do is shout through your letterbox open door to gain access then it’s a non starter. Not sure if you Yanks have letterboxes but they are a slot in your door for mail to be pushed through, When I see movies you all have those mailbox post things.

That said, I’ve never seen one here in Australia. Our letter box is by the footpath, in rural areas they’ve usually got all the boxes for a side-road gathered at that road’s intersection with a more major road. The other thing about the rural ones is they tend to be more creative; some are using discarded microwave ovens and milk cans for boxes… some dress these up to look like cows, sheep, emus and anything else you can imagine. True hacks in their own right. Report comment Reply Jack Laidlaw says: April 14, 2017 at 4:48 am I can see it making sense in rural areas for sure, imagine having to walk to each and every door as rural places tend to have large gardens/grounds etc. Quite interesting that people dress them up I quite like that idea. If I had one I would love to install some sort of system that notifies me my mail is here electronically.

As for making deliveries… the “posties” around here get around on motorcycles (usually 50cc Hondas), scooters and (more recently, electrically-assisted) bicycles usually, except in rural areas where they might use a car instead. So the size of the grounds is not the problem there (even if we have cattle stations bigger than Texas USA).

Here in the US, roadside mailboxes have to be approved by the Postmaster General, so they tend to be boring for the most part, with one or two rare exceptions here and there. I’ve seen many older suburban homes with mail slots around here, but rural areas almost exclusively have roadside boxes instead.

Report comment Reply Pirate Tom says: April 14, 2017 at 9:33 am Older homes do, mostly in places that were once/still are affluent. Since 90% of American movies/shows seem to be set in places like the nice side of New York, you see them a lot. Once you get more rural, or into more recent construction that’s newer, they don’t have them. Report comment Reply Redhatter (VK4MSL) says: April 14, 2017 at 4:46 am I’d be boycotting Burger King and related subsidiaries (e.g. Hungry Jacks here in Australia), as frankly, that kind of behaviour JUST ISN’T ON. For sure, I’d think twice about having something like that listening 24×7 in my house, others are not so privacy conscious. However, just because they’ve decided to sell their privacy to the likes of Amazon/Apple/Google/Microsoft does NOT mean that advertisers for any company have the right to hijack the devices responsible in any manner. Thankfully for me, such a boycott will be easy: I haven’t walked into one of their “restaurants” in over a decade and can’t stand their “food”.

It is inevitable that someone is going to be a worse dick than this, in a more damaging way, if deficiencies not addressed. Report comment Reply Redhatter (VK4MSL) says: April 14, 2017 at 3:15 pm Let me be clear, I’m not blaming the burger chain for people having these “assistants”… that is entirely the decision of those individuals. What was their decision was to have an actor try and activate those assistants… then when that actor’s voice got blocked, to re-dub the ad with another actor’s voice to work around the block. People who say “don’t buy Alexa/Google Home/etc devices” … yep, I agree with you. However, people will, and that is their choice. I also believe having the same standard “trigger word” is asking for trouble. As is responding to any voice instead of specific voices. In the “dollhouse case”, the television anchor wasn’t intending to trigger these devices, but was just reporting on the story. In this case though, the makers of the ad clearly wanted to trigger these devices. If I behaved in the manner of that XKCD cartoon, what’s the probability that I’d be welcome in that house again? The advertising agencies must realise however that their actors are effectively “guests” that can be “asked to leave” if their behaviour is inappropriate. In this case, a single press of the MUTE button at the start of an ad is all that’s necessary, but having do do so is annoying. This however, doesn’t send a message to the people who funded this behaviour in the first place. Money is the only thing these people understand, hence my suggestion of the boycott, which is not a hard thing. Go to a place that sells proper food, and you’ll never want to eat one of their “burgers” again.

Burger King have accessed a computer system they do not have permission to be on. Unless the Google device is actually licensed to the homeowner. Even then this behavior seems like a breach of the terms of service on Google’s advertising practices, or even the FCC/FTC’s commercial guidelines.

I worked in speech recog and bandwidth compression codecs long before this was “a thing”. In fact, it’s far easier to recognize a speaker than it is to translate what they’re saying – if you don’t need bank-vault type security. In fact, a huge reason these cloud guys want to send your speech to the cloud for recog is that it’s a lot harder to translate speech from “just anyone” than it is to train on “just you” – for that you need the huge training base, lots of cycles, and it still has issues with accents and untrained speakers. Thing is, unless they can tap into your speech, there’s no money in it for them… “follow the money”, as usual, leads to better understanding. FYI handy hint: To make any speech recog work better, make sure you actually say what you think you’re saying. Most people leave out syllables and slur (and the brain fills in, you have to pay deliberate attention). Even more important, insert a short pause between each word – most people run them together, and again the listener’s brain figures it out. But here we have a dumb computer, no point making its job harder because when it doesn’t work, it’s not helping you. //// Back in the days of say, IBM’s Via Voice, we built speech transcription systems. There was an initial training period – each user had to read it a little story, and for awhile after that, a secretary would compare tapes to the transcript and correct any errors, training the system further. If for example a doctor always coughed in the middle of saying penicillin, it would learn that for that speaker – or whatever other mispronunciation peculiar to that person. (The original audio was captured on a PDA..which I’m calling a tape here – at any rate, a recording) Pretty quickly, the system, given the speaker ID, would become very close to error-free for that speaker, and in fact, quite a lot better than the current mass market services. Why don’t they do that? It’s not hard to pick a speaker out of a family sized group for ID by their voice, and put everyone else into a “ignore” bin. Guess the answer. If you can do this at home without a connection, how are they going to get your data to sell, and sell you stuff based on your data? Aha, the answer is obvious. Que smoke screen from these guys on how only their big servers can do this…it’s just not true, we were doing better on 386s back in the day – for a limited group, which is exactly what is wanted here for security.

It was better to wreck a nice beach by training the software to individual users. A person a system wasn’t trained for could not issue voice commands. No special security needed because it was ‘baked in’ with the training. Having these assistants setup from the get go to work with *anyone*, without any requirement to first setup access control, is excessively stupid and dangerous.

But just because it's a hotspot doesn't mean the rules of data uses don't apply. You'll still want to keep data usage down to a minimum. Here's how you can enjoy all the perks of a mobile hotspot without wrecking your wallet. Saving data in your browser Image: Google Chrome has a Data Saver extension made by Google that cuts down on page loading times by rerouting the sites you visit through Google's servers, and compressing them along the way. If you trust Google with this kind of data ( HTTPS pages and pages launched in incognito mode aren't included) then it's a quick and simple data saving trick. This add-on gives you the same feature in Firefox, though it's an unofficial implementation of Google's Chrome extension and isn't made by Google itself. Alternatively you might want to install Opera instead, it has this kind of functionality built in (look for the Opera Turbo option)-again only non-HTTPS sites are processed, so your most sensitive data isn't intercepted. Image: Screenshot Meanwhile, turning off the automatic loading of images makes your browsing experience a lot less interesting, but it's going to save you a whole heap of data too. In Chrome's Settings pane, go to Show advanced settings then Content settings to disable automatic image loading; in Firefox, the same option is on the about:config page-change the permissions.default.image value to 2 . Alternatively, get a browser extension to do the job for you. We've talked in the past about stopping videos from auto-playing , and this advice still applies if you're wanting to save data on a tethered connection, though many sites will adapt their output accordingly if they detect you're on a limited connection. Saving data in other apps Image: Screenshot As far as applications outside your browser, the best way of saving data while tethering is to cache all your music and movies on your laptop beforehand, while you're still attached to some solid wi-fi. If that's not an option though, you can still make changes while you're out and about. Netflix should adjust your streaming speed automatically to match your connection, but setting this manually will lower quality and data sucked down. Choose Your Account from the menu under your avatar, then click Playback settings and select Low . In the settings page for the Spotify desktop client, meanwhile, you'll see a High quality streaming toggle switch, so make sure this is off while tethering. Image: Screenshot We can't cover every application you might have installed but if you poke around in the settings for your programs you might be able to find similar options. It's also a good idea to hit the pause button on syncing services like Dropbox and Google Drive if it's practical to do so (you can do this from the system tray or menu bar icons). You also want to put automatic downloads and app installations on hold while you're tethering, and there are changes you can make at the OS level too. Launch the Settings app in Windows 10, click WiFi then your network, and you can toggle the Metered connection switch : this tells installed apps you're on a limited connection, and puts a halt to large OS updates at the same time. Image: Screenshot There's no such option on macOS, but there is TripMode , which works on Mac and Windows computers. The app lets you set which programs can use data and which can't, so you get much finer control over how much data is getting pulled over your tethered connection, and you can get detailed usage breakdowns as well. TripMode costs $7.99 but there is a free trial available. Beyond these tricks the most important thing to do is apply some common sense when it comes to the apps you're using and how you use them (keep those browser tabs down to a minimum ), but the tips above should get you well on your way to saving a ton of data while you're tethered. As an added bonus, you should save some battery life too.

April 13 GOOG: 823.56 -0.76 Google Photos’ new video stabilization feature is pretty impressive, as shown off in these demos Ben Schoon - Apr. 13th 2017 1:29 pm PT @NexusBen Android Google Photos View Comments Facebook Twitter Google Pinterest Reddit Yesterday, a long awaited feature finally made its debut on Google Photos for Android — video stabilization. While most phones offer live stabilization, some either don’t, or just don’t do it all that well. That’s what Google’s new feature is for, and the results are actually pretty impressive. The best gifts for Android users Thanks to a Reddit user by the name of Daniel, we have a pretty large gallery of side-by-side comparisons showing how video stabilization works in Photos. As noted yesterday, when you stabilize a video in Photos, the app goes through the clip frame-by-frame and crops it to keep the object of the video steady. In these skiing clips, we can see just how impressive this function can be, as the results look pretty fantastic. In the final clip, though, we can see the flaws shine through, as some very obvious warping makes its way to the final product. We can’t embed most of the videos here on the site, but you can see a sample of the results in the GIFs below, and you can see side-by-side how big of a difference stabilization makes here. You can also view the full gallery over on Google Photos. Video stabilization is available now in Google Photos for Android.

Name: Subject: Message: Google Allo 9.0 APK teardown reveals chat backups, group incognito chats and more Newsby Edgar Cervantes3 days ago 24 625 35 Allo has become a great communication alternative thanks to Assistant support, smart replies, fun sticker packs, whisper/shout options and plenty of other great features. Google is far from being done with this project, though. They continue improving Allo and have been known to leave evidence of upcoming features in the code… which we certainly enjoy. Google Allo 9.0 recently hit the Google Play Store, and with it came an APK teardown from the guys over at 9to5Google. They have discovered traces what could be upcoming inclusions to the app. Some we have heard about already, but there is also some new stuff you will be interested in. See also: Google Allo: Everything you need to know September 21, 2016 Conversation back-ups Google Allo’s main competitor is WhatsApp, and there is one thing those guys seem to be doing very well – backing up chat threads. Allo’s 9.0 version shows code strings with evidence that there will be said feature possibly being enabled in the near future, and you will probably have the option to choose where the conversations go. One will be able to opt between storing chats in the cloud, using Google Drive. Alternatively, those who prefer local storage can also go for putting these conversations in external storage. Furthermore, another string suggests the service will be able to restore images, video and other media, which can be done in the background. It seems the app will force users to backup and restore content over WiFi by default, but this can be disabled. If this is the case, the user will simply receive a warning. More Quick Selfie goodness This is one of the features we have already reported on, but more evidence is always good. It’s also convenient that the new code string gives us a tiny bit of insight as to how the feature will work. Don’t get too excited just yet, though. All we know is there will be a direct button for activating the Quick Selfie mode, as well as the live preview. See also: Google Allo could get a ‘quick selfie’ button among other new features 2 weeks ago Group Incognito chats A new string serves as evidence of an option that will allow users to “start a group incognito chat”. This feature is great for those who want to hold a conversation that won’t stick around in the phone for long. Bringing the same capability to group chats only makes sense, right? Make stickers out of selfies! Ever wanted to make your own stickers? It’s no easy task (especially if you want to be the subject), but Google will be making it a possibility soon. 9to5Google found code including a message that says the following: “Take a selfie and we’ll automagically generate a sticker pack in your likeness. For best results, keep a neutral expression”. Keep in mind these lines of code were found in the APK file back when the app was released, only to be quickly removed afterwards. The fact that the strings have returned further validate the rumored feature. Wrapping up As we mentioned before, none of these features are actually working yet, but they probably will in the near future. The code is there for a reason, right?

The fast-food chain would have gotten away with it, too, if it hadn't been for those pesky kids at Google (and on the internet at large). Let's back it up: On April 12, Burger King aired an ad in which an actor asks, "OK, Google, what is the Whopper burger?" The line was intended to prompt Google Home devices (which are brought online by the words, "OK, Google,") to read a list of Whopper ingredients from Wikipedia, where Google Home gets most of its search results. Never missing a chance to poke fun at major brands online, anonymous pranksters edited the Whopper Wikipedia article to include ingredients like a "medium-sized child," "toenail clippings" and "cyanide." Ouch. Following the Wikipedia prank, Burger King's voice-activated search effort was halted by Google engineers, who updated Google Home software not to react to the ad. As it happens, Burger King did not consult with Google before airing the ad, which led to Google's swift action. Amid the blowback, Burger King has seen a fair deal of media coverage around the ad, not to mention social media engagement, probably getting far more eyeballs on the ad than anticipated. Far from being a crisis, it's a good case study in how risk-taking can pay off in cutting through the noisy news and social media cycle. (Case in point: Even Pepsi's tone-deaf Kendall Jenner ad is receiving accolades within the media world). It might not be a bad idea for brands to start investigating how voice search might be integrated into their marketing efforts. Home devices—and voice-activated search—are here to stay. As long as it's not limited to Wikipedia, of course.

Shortly after, the media went berserk over how BK had hacked Google’s artificial intelligence-powered assistant to serve its ends. But just how effective was the Google Assistant hijacking scheme? Ever been to a tech festival? TNW Conference won best European Event 2016 for our festival vibe. See what's in store for 2017. LEARN MORE A New York Times video shows a Google Home device actually being activated when the ad is played. But first of all, there are estimatedly less than 500,000 households with the devices across the U.S. To be activated, the device would have to be close to the TV at the time the commercial was played. Still an innovation, Home is mainly the domain of millennials, who constitute the largest segment of the early adopter population. This is an important demographic for marketers, but millennials are not the best target for TV commercials. They also constitute the largest segment of cord cutters, viewers who cancel cable TV in favor of streaming services. And the ad is even less likely to activate Android phones, which are tuned to the voice of their owner. Factoring in all the parameters, the commercial would affect a very small subset of all Google-powered devices. Bottom line: The Burger King commercial was a failure if it aimed to hijack your smart assistant. But what the fast food franchise did get was maybe more valuable than hearing a list of mostly-obvious ingredients. Within 24 hours, hundreds — if not thousands — of websites redistributed the ad. The YouTube video got millions of times, more than the total number of Google Home units across the world. Google’s not-so-silent tweak of its software to prevent the ad from activating its assistant created even more media hype. The same goes for BK’s updated version of the ad, which managed to work around Google’s block. Even the Wikipedia battle to change the ingredients of the Whopper got people to talk about the burger. And I don’t think any sane person would believe that your burger would contain cyanide, toenails and a “medium sized child.” The real result will show off when BK releases its sales figures. But as The Verge’s James Bareham says, “If the aim of David, the creative agency in Miami that made the Burger King Google Home TV spot, was to create a short, sharp, viral commercial that would generate a digital media storm and the attention of the most valuable demographic advertising, then it deserves every Lion in Cannes.” Don’t expect a new trend of Google-provoking ads to start sprouting as of tomorrow. These things tend to be one off events. However the Burger King “OK Google ad” shows that we’ve yet to discover the repercussions of disruptive tech surrounding us. It also show that in an age where artificial intelligence developments seem to be the focus of business efforts, good old marketing tactics still work for those who know how to use them.

Is your Google Pixel's fingerprint scanner not working well? Try this trick David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2017/01/10 10:14am PDTJan 10, 2017 34 Plus 1 on G+ 37 Share on Facebook 67 Share on Twitter Total Shares138 News Pixel Pixel XL Tips & Tutorials I love the Google Pixel, but there's no doubt that in the last few weeks I've noticed its fingerprint scanner becoming less and less reliable (I've heard it from others, too). I was puzzled, as the whole idea behind Google's Pixel Imprint is to become more accurate over time as it gets more and more reads of your finger. I tried removing my fingerprints and re-adding them, but that didn't help at all. So I went back to an old trick I used on some of the first touch-to-scan fingerprint reader phones - registering the same fingers more than once. I know, I know - there's a limit of five total allowed on the Pixel, and this isn't exactly the most scientific workaround. But here's the thing: it works. To prevent the Pixel from thinking you're trying to register the same finger again, start with an odd angle on the finger you want to re-register, like the edge/side or the very tip, and then register all the fringe areas around your finger pad, but avoid the "typical" placement with the pad squarely on the reader. I found this helped with both of my index fingers, and especially the one I use to unlock less frequently (the left one). I actually registered my left index finger three times without issue, and the number of rejected reads I'm getting has been dramatically reduced. It's a bit annoying that this even works, but it was starting to really drive me a bit crazy lately how often my Pixel would fail to read my finger. In the 48 hours since I've done this, I've had maybe two or three rejected reads, and all of them because my fingers were wet. Give it a try - I can't guarantee this will work for everyone, but my results have been great so far.

Rejections dropped dramatically after that. David Ruddock I clean mine constantly, never seemed to help. DKS No problem here. I have 5 different fingers registered and I use them all -- whichever happens to be easiest depending on which hand I pick up the phone with, at what angle, and whether I'm holding anything else in my hand at the time. It usually works even if I lay the edge of my finger across the reader at an awkward angle. Pretty impressive, actually. Warranty claim? paulmike3 Was going to say the same thing. Mine started failing a ton. It returned to working perfectly after cleaning the reader my N6P with a little rubbing alcohol on a q-tip. mmajeski06 Usually the only thing that works for me as well. A quick wipe with my shirt usually gets it working reliably again for a few days. Kind of annoying, but I also have pretty sweaty hands so I've gotten used to it. A good microfiber cloth comes in handy as well. PHLAK Try cleaning with a Q-Tip and (very) little isopropyl alcohol then wiping clean with a microfiber cloth. I believe the problem is caused by the buildup of oils from your finger/hands and alcohol will break down the oils better than water and a microfiber cloth will wipe away any lingering dust/particles better than a shirt or towel. Simon What I'm bothered about is that the Pixel fingerprint scanner works so much worse than the Nexus 5X/6P one. Having the same hardware, this can only be the different coating of the scanner. I have to clean my Pixel scanner constantly and it still does not work all the time. Never had this issues with 5X/6P. Suicide_Note Haven't had any issues, but I'll keep this in mind if any problems arise. Thanks. Chad Forrester I agree, I was careful to include multiple angles during the registration of each finger and I haven't had one rejected use. Knowing that moisture will play a role in the accuracy of the scanner, I am wondering if those having issues possibly live in more humid climates. Or at least climates that are wetter this time of year. JRomeo OR......... you could fix this from the beginning by correctly setting up your fingerprints.......... When most people are asked to register their 5 fingers, they register them placing the same exact fingerprint spot on each finger. the solution is simple... If you register your index finger, then touch the SAME index finger on the scanner in 5 different ways including fringe sides, tip, etc. for that ONE finger. then you have 4 registrations left..... Do this and you won't have an issue, My Pixel XL fingerprint scanner is still working great because of this with absolutely no fingerprint scanner issues. David Ruddock Yeah, I set mine up varying the position of my finger pretty considerably, but the thing is that Pixel Imprint allows you so few reads during the registration process that there's no way to get ALL the angles of your finger before the process completes. You can maximize the area covered, but I still think you can get more effective registered data by re-registering the same finger. op12 I believe once you register a finger, you can actually add additional reads for that finger. For instance, I added my index and middle finger on both hands. When I'm on the screen where I see those 4 fingers, I can continue touching the fingerprint sensor and the associated finger gets highlighted. My understanding was that these additional reads are getting added to the profile for the finger that gets highlighted, and indeed I haven't had any finger recognition issues on my Pixel XL since I did that, without having to re-register the same finger. KDanger69 Exactly what I did - I have had zero issues with the reader because when setting my fingerprints up originally I did each touch from a different angle. Moby D I tend to agree. I moved my finger around a bit during registration to catch a good view. I rarely ever have problems even when the finger is a little greasy or moist. The first trick should be to delete and reregister but make sure you get good coverage during the 5 register requests. The S7 was the same until I did this. I found that often unlocking one-handed pity thumb at a slight angle. When I reset the print I caught it at more angles and my problems evaporated. SIGTRAP Uh you mean this isn't common knowledge? At least on Samsung phones it actually tells you to position your finger differently each time during the setup. Is Google not explaining this or are people just stupid? JSo Everyone keeps saying the Pixels have the same fingerprint reader as the previous Nexus phones. So why does this not happen with the Nexus 6P or the 5X. At least I haven't noticed it on my 5X anyway. Vito R. I noticed my Nexus 5x reader getting worse over time. JSo The only time I have noticed the finger print reader not work is when it's charging. I find that weird. But when it's not charging, it works every time for me. Angel Are you barefoot and/or not using the original charger? If you answer yes to any of these try a better quality charger or/and fix the ground wire of your house? Vito R. Yeah, that was a common issue. I actually got mine replaced just before the warranty ran out because of that. They sent me one manufactured at the same time as the old one - so I assume the issue wasn't fixed in the new one. I found the Nexus 5x to be VERY reliable reading my fingerprint in the beginning but then just getting worse as time went on. Not Galaxy S6 bad, but missing the first try more often than not. Jim Dowell yeah ive never had any issues with the scanner myself and it seems to be quite responsive. i have had touch screen issues when charging if anyone else has seen that? really buggy stuff like pulling down the notification screen when doing simple page scrolls. stuff like that. Andrew Palmer Google being Google. Release a phone and gradually break it with software updates. Every damned year. sproc That's like everyone and every device out there bud. Bruce Wayne Not really. sproc Yes really. Bruce Wayne My 6p says different. sproc Wait until version O comes out. The Dude Following Apple I guess. They definitely break phones with updates. My N6P is still flawless so updates haven't broken it yet at least. Jpx I realize everyone has different experiences, mobile phones are never perfect. But my Pixel XL fingerprint scanner is brilliant. I never have any issues with it. It reads it so well I am able to unlock my phone with my finger upside down Cakefish Just tried it and my S7 can read my fingerprint upside down too. Impressive! Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I have the first two fingers of each hand registered, and I find unlocking it in my car dock is faster/easier by reaching over with my finger than using the power button and then swiping. And that position definitely places it upside down. Works flawlessly. Jpx I do the same exact thing. I was doing it for like 3 weeks and didn't even think about it. Then I realized it was reading it upside down and was worried that it wasn't as secure. But I've let countless amounts of people try to unlock my phone and I'm still the only one Cat Astrophy Yeah the only thing that's dodgy for me is the swipe down notification thing but the unlock portion always works for me. HollowLog I actually do this every time I do the initial setup on a phone. teh Jax I've always (even with the N6P) registered each of my index fingers twice and then had my wife register her preferred index finger. It's always worked great! I always start with my natural angle (significantly favoring the side of my index finger by my thumb) for the first scan and then start the second scan slightly favoring the other side of my index finger. No problems yet on my Pixel. Frisi I haven't had issues at all, as a matter of fact it has been more accurate than ever. My Pixel XL, even after 3 months, hasn't had any issues that I am aware of. ClearlyYoureWrong I'm in this boat. That damn thing is almost too fast/accurate. Sometimes I just want to use the media player controls on the lock screen and before I know it I'm teleported to an unlocked phone and I have to pull down my notification shade to play/pause. Not a problem I mind having :) sproc Well at least you have yours to even setup. A 5X the other day "lost" the option completely. JSo What do you mean the 5X lost the option? sproc The option for Nexus imprint completely disappears from the options and the reader no longer works. To solve my particular one, I had to make a new account, set it up, then it re-appeared back in the original account, with the already set up prints. JSo I haven't noticed this. Although, I'm using a custom ROM as well. But that does seem odd still. sproc Look it up. Apparently a lot of people had to either factory reset or ended up replacing the phone under warranty. Software that was on the 5X was of course the latest 7.1.1 software for the 5X, Dec patch at the time. sgtguthrie I haven't had this problem at all. Mine has been great. Cats-R-Friend I've added the same finger on every free slot and still get failures. Super annoying Benjamin Walburn The problem seems to be related to the material used to cover the sensor. I used to have to wipe it off constantly to make it work. Now it never fails with my LifeProof case covering the sensor with plastic. Howard Stern ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I have to clean mine off a lot....mostly with my shirt or something. if it gets fingerprints all over it, it takes a time or two to work. But once I get them cleaned off, works fine. I had the same issue on my note 5 though. tiger Painting fancy colors over a fingerprint reader was not Google's finest hour.... Pre86 Oddly enough, I noticed a minor difference in performance when switching between my Google silicone case and my Spigen Rugged Armor case, In the Spigen case, the fingerprint sensor would keep erroring out after holding the phone for a certain length of time (i.e. reading on the train) while with the Google silicone case it never occurred. I think that perhaps the different material of the Spigen case (that my index finger was resting on for long periods of time) may have in some way influenced the readers ability to accurately read my fingerprint. With the Spigen case, after putting down the phone for a period then washing and drying my hands, it would work flawlessly again. Strange, I know, but just an observation. F4LL0U7 This became a problem with my left index finger on my N5X a while back, and I figured it was related to my fingertip being beaten up since I had just started learning how to play bass. This worked for me at the time, and still works really well. NinoBr0wn Just the tip. Always works. Max ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) Jason Farrell That's what she said? NinoBr0wn Nah. Definitely not what she said. Ever. Mr.B That's what he said. FTFY Impulse_Vigil Cleaning the finger reader also helps, I've gotten in the habit of wiping it down with a microfiber every morning after I wipe my screen... Most of my back-to-back rejections, if not all, have happened when the reader, my hands, or both were really oily. I've noticed it usually looks dingier than my screen even when my hands are pretty dry. JW This is one of the reasons I wasn't eager to upgrade from my N6. I have my AW watch as smart lock and only need to put in pin once a day in the morning. I also have a GS7 work phone with FP unlock and it's not reliable at all. I definitely prefer smartlock. The other main reason being USB-C not offering enough advances for me the cost to replace the dozens of micro USB cables I use. I know N6 is at the EOL with 7.1.1 and I will probably have to upgrade next year eventually. atc-tech There was literally not one thing compelling me to get rid of my beloved N6 for a Bezel XL. I am dreading the coming day when the N6 gives up the ghost, because I am going severly miss this phone. haim ram Wonderful tip, i did it and it works like a charm Donatom3 Haven't had to clean mine yet and it's still very accurate. mattcoz My issue is with the pull down gesture working like half the time. matteventu Mine is the opposite. It works (in half, so it doesn't pull down the notification shade, it just quickly bring a bit down and then it closes it very quickly) also when I absolutely DON'T touch the fingerprint sensor. And I've experienced this with two different Pixels. mattcoz I don't think that has anything to do with the fingerprint sensor, sounds like you're tapping the status bar or it at least thinks you are. matteventu Lol I'm not dumb xD I know how to use a smartphone, and with the first Pixel I had I thought it was an hardware issue of the touchscreen. Then with the second one having the same issue I came at the conclusion that it must be the fingerprint sensor. Now I'm likely going to deactivate the swipe gesture so that I see if it will still happen again. mattcoz I wasn't saying you were, just that from what you're describing it doesn't sound like it's the fingerprint sensor. You said you weren't even touching it. Whatever, sorry for trying to help. C64 Buy a pixel they said. It's the best there is they said bluebanzai I've never cleaned mine but David, I don't know what climate you live in but all fingerprint scanners are affected greatly by dry hands. Winter tends to dry them out so that might or might not be the case for you or others. I've never cleaned mine and only noted problems when my hands get overdry. Lotioning helps. King_Android I've always done the same finger multiple times trick. Didnt know it was a "thing" lol matteventu They should have made the sensor of glass. Pedram Haghzaban I had this problem with my first XL. The fix was to get a replacement. T4rd Haven't had any probs with my 6P's. This phone should be good until well after the Pixel 2s come out. Sean And Hillary is going to be president as well......The 6P is only good until you try and use a Pixel XL. Yes, the Pixel is vastly superior. T4rd Lolwut.. ? I've used both.. my original statement stands. ;-) Sean Im quite sure your Model T ford is as good or better than a 2017 Corvette.......congrats! Enjoy your Pixel envy........... T4rd I'm quite sure you're a moron....... congrats! Enjoy your ignorance........... Sean No doubt the 6P is = to the Pixel. I will come over to your house and we can each run Daydream on our phones.........nuff said........ T4rd Right.... you can stop embarrassing yourself now. ;-) Sean Says the person named Tard............ T4rd Yup.................................................... Gerardo Sarabia Except they are starting to die at 33% battery. T4rd Yeah, I saw that. Fortunately mine isn't affected so far. I just put the latest PureNexus ROM on it too though. Still chugging along at 4-5 hours of SoT a day. 2×4 Really shouldn't have to do this .... Sean Its amazing to me all the problems Android Police posts about the Pixel/XL. I am a long time Nexus person who also purchased the PIxel XL and I have HAD NONE of the problems ever posted here. No audio issues, no random reboots, no phone being dead below 30% battery, and no finger print issues. My battery life is just fine and my cell signal/coverage is great (no band 4 issues). As for all the problems you guys keep seeing, as my CIO brother says at work, the problem might be a loose nut behind the keyboard......... ctk4949 Ditto, I have not had any of the problems AP has posted about. K.P. Smith Right here with you. Jordan L Same Cat Astrophy Dat Scamsung money tho JohnyNoLegs Yea except if you actually did any research at all, you would see that many are having issues. Anyway, ignorance is bliss! hzd This does not help, i have had this issue since day 1 of owning the pixel XL, vs my 6P its about 70% reliable vs the 6P's near 95% I think the problem boils down to a smaller surface than the 6P and not as good a sensor or software. Custom rom or OTA's makes no diffrence the pixel's scanner is defiantly worse than the 6P's. I never cleaned my 6P's scanner and it still works better and the Pixel has been cleaned with IPA and a cloth several times to no avail. Ryan The fingerprint reader learns and adds to it's fingerprint registration data each time you use the fingerprint reader. So each time you unlock your phone, it's actually learning a bit more and adding areas of your fingerprint it didn't previously know. You can actually speed up this process without having to unlock your phone over and over again by just going to the Pixel Imprint settings area (the list of all your registered fingers) and put your finger on the fingerprint reader then. The finger it detects will light up. It will learn from these recognition taps as well. Just move it more and more towards the edges of your finger with each tap until the full finger is registered. After doing it on mine, it works very well and hardly ever misses. Tomfoolery Try this ONE WEIRD TRICK Adam Margeson I hate that that is how I read the title before I even read your comment. Slashdot has been having an issue with clickbait headlines lately and I don't want to see AP start down that slippery slope, even if there is (potentially) good advice contained in the article. LOL I am guessing it's a hardware issue, I haven't experienced this on my Pixel. I think in general Pixel was released with ton of software and hardware issues. Google fcked up again this time Testraindrop I have a better trick: Buy a better device... Chris This was the most click bait title I've ever seen here haha. That just shows how great this site really is. Alexander Another tip: re-register your fingerprints if you added case, especially if it is bulky one. The chances that your place your finger differently than on the naked phone are pretty high. And most people register their fingerprints after they bought a phone but before they got the case they want. Fun fact I just noticed. If you open setting where are all your fingeprints listed and put your finger on the scanner, the one fingerprint that was red by scanner will light up. JD I'm sorry but what? This is a load of crap. If you're charging these iPhone like prices I'd expect it to work. SomeGuy112 You can just goto the fingerprint settings screen under security settings (In picture below) and improve the recognition by tapping the fingers you setup already at different angles on the fingerprint reader over and over again. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2ec730eb4039823c2c75b9647bdcccd5d79f0acd39762fd22ecdee47a17597a8.png crafty35a Is there any particular reason you think this improves the recognition/adds more data? I've never heard this before, other than another comment in this thread. tiger Hmm, maybe PAINTING over the fingerprint reader is not the brightest idea............who the hell thought that it was a good idea to PAINT a fingerprint reader?!!! But don't worry...Google will one day release software update to fix this issue. Has Google actually fix ANY issue yet on the Pixel? Camera flare fixed yet? Reboot fixed yet? Battery and shutting down fixed yet? Google promise a lot of crap too and has not deliver one freaking fix!! Do no evil you say? Hmmmm Justyn Smith Can't say I've had any issues with the fingerprint scanner at all on my XL. Noeltorious Haven't had any issues with either of the two prints I have stored. I did go back to settings and train a bunch of different angles when I added them though Patrick Smithopolis When I first got the Pixel I registered both index fingers twice. h_f_m The same finger different angles technique has been known since the launch of the 6p/5x Courtney King Cleaning the scanner every once in a while helps too. C Law I had a lot of issues on the s7 edge but so far none on the pixel xl. I guess it likes my finger mcored Far out. This is the 9th issue I have heard so far concerning the Pixel: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MFNE8fQ3KaC-bi4_u32sfWh6jMf7N6WJ-VOLmpD8VfI/edit?usp=sharing tiger Out of 9 issues, which has been fixed by Google? Lando Mine was absolutely awful today (no haptic feedback, and took forever to unlock), but a reboot totally fixed it Rick Mine works great, in fact way better then my iPhone did! usamaisawake I haven't had this issue, unless my finger or the surface of the reader was dirty MZone Is it weird that nexus imprint has been working frighteningly reliably for the last 13 months on my N6P for me? Owennus This is so weird. I have no issues. Why is this? NexusMan The only problem I've ever had with the fingerprint scanner not working is when my first gets are wet. My remedy: dry them. Winston Did this back with my Note 5 when it was new, but would get used to the right angle over time, so didn't need to do it after the first reset. Luis Mine was okay for most of the time. Sometimes it rejected my fingerprint because it's too fast, but that only occur like... 1 out of a thousand times? And also I scanned one of my finger the other day, and winter strikes in, it dries off and start cracking, and it failed to work with imprint. Now it's almost recovered, but the phone can never recognize that finger anymore... =( reggjoo This trick works on more than just the pixel. Helps out other scanners too. taher omar Never faced an issue Álvaro R. I did this on my iPhone too and it works pretty well, when it was saved just once it failed.Weird but it works Stuart Anderson When I register the finger I do center of pad, and then roll my finger and get the edges for the repeat. I almost never get failed reads. Marcelove Imagine is this problem was found at any other device... David would bash the company that built it a lot... But hey, it is happening at a Google's device... So this is actually a feature, not to bother at all, and everyone should do some tricks to make the fingerprint, at a 1000$ device, works right.... Double standards at its finest... Steve Louzon Would like to try this trick but I don't have a Pixel because Google doesn't know how to get phones made available so people can buy them. :-) PixelXLellence ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ ᵀʳᵘᵐᵖ No problems on my XL 32GB. Theuntje Unlocking my phone with the fingerprint isn't the issue.. But a few second later when I try to unlock two different apps (both banking) the fingerprint fails.. Master Yates Have to say, I've had no issues at all on the OnePlus 3. I've not had to clean it either. This thing just works. Today My issue is that it doesn't slide the notification bar UP as well as it slides DOWN. It takes me a few tries to get it to go back up. Did anyone else run into this problem? Nate Scoffield OP you're a genius. Honestly since the last update I've seen a huge improvement on the scanner but it still wasn't completely reliable. I just reprogrammed my fingerprints using the edges of my finger and the success rate went through the roof. Even using the pad of my finger is much more successful now. Everybody who has a pixel should try this technique.

Some Pixel and Nexus fingerprint sensors not working after Android 7.1.2 update Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 12:17pm PDTApr 14, 2017 65 Plus 1 on G+ 79 Share on Facebook 73 Share on Twitter Total Shares217 Bug Watch Device Updates News Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel XL A number of Google Pixel and Nexus users are reporting that their fingerprint sensor is no longer working after the latest Android OS update. Several members of the Pixel and Nexus communities on Google's product forums have encountered the issue since installing the Android Nougat 7.1.2 OTA. The issue appears to be affecting both the Pixel and Pixel XL, as well as the LG-made Nexus 5X and Huawei Nexus 6P. Reports suggest that while the Pixel and Nexus Imprint sensors are no longer granting access to the devices, the swipe down for notifications Moves gesture is still functional. Attempts to solve the problem by deleting pre-existing fingerprints and starting from scratch haven't worked, as error messages are preventing new prints from being added to the devices. As usual, we'll update if we hear any official word from Google about the issue, hopefully regarding a fix.

Jeff Neston By stating no problems, expect to get boot loop on your nexus 6. See the CNET article on nexus 5 and 6. Provided Google does not get the article Removed VAVAMk_2 Same thereasoner Same here with my Pixel. Suicide_Note No issues on my XL or 6P. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 6p has never given me those issues either... But it is slower than most newer scanners. Nick Which is to be expected. It's still fine. Jeff Neston By stating no problems, expect to get boot loop on your nexus 6. See the CNET article on nexus 5 and 6. Provided Google does not get the article defeated. If you do get it expect to lose all unsaved data. Then if want refund you will need to go to court. Sean Please GO AWAY....you have said this TWICE.......Its NOT the Nexus 5 and 6 Mr Brainiac....its the 5X and 6P......which are TOTALLY different than the Nexus 5 and Nexus 6. Max Same here with my XL. elav Me too. No issues on my XL.. Nicholas Matranga My Nexus 5x works just fine after the update. kalehv Sometimes my Pixel XL asks for pattern even after it recognizes my fingerprint (no, I am not talking about the first time after reboot). Rebooting the device works but why does this happen? Nathan Bryant I've also experienced this. It's random. Not so often it's a bother for me. kalehv Yup not so often with me either but being a mobile developer what bothers me is this happening, not the inconvenience it causes. Nathan Bryant That totally makes sense. I assume it's some kind of error even though it's not stating that it is. I don't see the pattern or constant of what causes it when it happens. mattcoz It does that after more than 48 hours have passed since you've last used your pattern. kalehv Nop its not that either. It does that after 4 hours I think. And it should do that only once after 4 hours but not keep doing that until you reboot. mattcoz It's definitely 48 hours, that comes straight from Google. But if it continues to do so, then that's something else. Mgamerz I've had it happen on my Nexus, it just occasionally requires a PIN. Says it's 4 hours of non usage but that doesn't seem true, sometimes I wake up and no pin and sometimes I'll be on and off the phone and it'll require a pin. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Typical. Google needs to fire some of their geniuses and hire some diligent coders, and also diligent testers for their QA department (assuming they even have one -- I sincerely doubt it). Alex Cruz Where did Google touch you? Middlefinger Oh really. Nexus/Pixel/Google error 4.453.563 this year alone. Im shocked (not really). Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Best hot steaming pile of dog s**t 2016. DragoCubed Google has been going downhill lately - at least with mobile excluding iOS. It's such a shame. They haven't exactly gone downhill haven't they? They've stayed the same SpeakethTheTruth I think you might be on to something with that last paragraph. Cause for real, quality control is out of control right now. sebastianer If fixed my 6P bad battery life and early shutdown only replacing the stock Huawei battery with other battery with different brand (no need to wipe the phone in the process...) Several people did the same and is enjoying the battery life they were having when they bought the phone more than a year ago: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3534410 You could even try a Huawei battery replacement...but they say they aren't original. I just went for another brand because of the bad experience I had with the stock battery durability I don't know in the Pixel. But in the 6P in 90% of the cases...this is just a problem of the Huawei stock battery. Kendall Gustafson “Pixel”, the word sounds like the color pink. “Pixel” sounds like a little girl’s toy. Most men would never put a phone in their pocket named “Pixel” unless they were a cross/dresser. The word “Pixel” equates to a 50% loss of market share from the male market. “Nexus”, the word does not sound female or male. “Nexus”, the word sounds like science, desirable to any man, woman, or child. “Nexus”, the word sound like domination of market share. kalehv Hahaha that made me laugh. No I do not agree. I am a Pixel owner man and I am not whatever you said they'd be if they owned one but I laughed for some reason. Christian Trevor Clauss I must be a cross dresser then :D mattcoz Real men aren't insecure about what their phones are named. Middlefinger Except that the Nexus sold poorly and was generally complete junk Van_Hammersly Most of us have exited adolescence. bonelesscheese https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9bd2ce0665c300ab872edc5e5fa1ef348b87f551cc01532d17bf41264dd126c1.jpg DragoCubed I'm so glad that you can block on disqus Bruce Wayne Google is really dropping the ball. We just can't have a stable, functioning phone that works. I just had to send my phone in for repair because it went into boot-loop after the recent update. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google: "It compiled with warnings but no errors. Must be ready to go." Bruce Wayne Nothing about Google or Android came up. What are you getting at? Middlefinger This isnt device specific, its a fault in Android itself. Google has become really bad lately with poor quality control. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Even Chrome is going to the dogs. Seriously, Google is staffed by a bunch of incompetent high-paid prima donnas. paxmos At least, Google is not charging an arm and a leg for their phones ;-) 2kool4skool Lol, $869 for a phone that doesn't have waterproofing, wireless charging, expandable storage, and ois is not charging an arm and leg? paxmos Didn't you see the wink? 2kool4skool Apologies, I just woke up and haven't fully recovered when I read your comment, my sarcasm detector didn't work really well that time. paxmos LOL, we're good Lindacbrewer Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now. These days alone, I generated close to $36,000 until now with no more than my home computer as well as some spare time, despite that i have a fulltime 9 to 5 job.

He wasn't telling you to google that phrase, that is what google says when they release a new build of android. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Exactly. If it compiles, it's ready. No need to test or anything. Too much trouble for the geniuses at Google. They're so smart that if it compiles with just warnings, there couldn't possibly be any problems. John Doe I am sure that they do test it but there are things that go wrong...obviously those bugs will be in the spotlight on an Android blog meaning in real life they are probably affecting a small number of users. This is why you do a roll out of the OTA not just dump it all out there. Bruce Wayne Ohhh...Lol. I just re-read his statement now. neates Pixel and Nexus - rich beta testers... Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Rich alpha testers. asifalimirza No issues two weeks after the update. I have a Verizon Pixel XL Necronos Yeah, sometimes it doesn't wanna read my finger, really annoying and sometimes I have to reboot. Nope.jpeg If you are reading this, set you Disqus profile to private, if you'd like. I just found out today that it's available. EvilHowl That has been availiable since years Nope.jpeg >I just found out today that it's available. I meant that I just discovered it today. 7-down But it has been there for years! bonelesscheese https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/65fbb30db9562d2071d7be874cf7e6b0b6724c0c6b0333a36a817e13eef2bd99.gif Kougeru Thanks tigerstown Another so called pixel issue and yet I have never had one that's been reported. It blows my mind been on 7.1.2 sense the factory imgs dropped Sean Same for me.....my Pixel XL hasnt had a single reported issue so far......... Donovan Goodwin Using mine actually causes phone to restart. Updating to 7.1.2 caused this and it even happens on ROMs. JG W00t! For once I don't suffer from Atrem's Luck... My 5X still lets me in with my fingerprint :) Doomberg I updated just last night. Glad I didn't get hit with this issue. nickarli 6P - had 4 fingers registered, right index stopped working after the update but other 3 still fully functional. I thought it was the massive amount of Utah dust in my fingers all of a sudden, but I guess not Defenestratus There's that vaunted Google QA again. This is how you get more Samsung. New_Guy Yep Mark Curtis What do you mean "this is how you get more Samsung"? 4Ui812 Why is Google having app many issues with the Fixel ? Sruly J Except since it's also affecting Nexus devices, this is more of a software issue in 7.1.2 than a hardware issue for Pixel devices. Defenestratus Because IIRC they use Agile software development. Agile is how you get shitty software. Lawstorant I've never thought I would say such thing, but I'm getting fed up with all the "issues" Google is facing with every update. On the Nexus 6, they went as far as to roll it back to 7.0. They should really step up their game especially if, they are fully responsible for every aspect of the device from now on. EvilHowl No issues on my 5X wade_county I thought these Pixels weren't supposed to be beta products? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They aren't. They're outrageously expensive alpha products. And they even have one defect (halo-cam) that can't be fixed in software. Still the best steaming pile of dog s**t of 2016, though. Everyone should buy one. Everyone who likes dog s**t anyway. Apparently people do, since HTC has shipped 2 million since launch. Kougeru I bad a Pixel for a week and took dozens of photos with no halo Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good for you. Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of 22 Pixel pictures had halos. None of the 22 G6 pictures had halos. They were all pictures of the same things, obviously with the same lighting. Google admits it's a design defect. If Google admits it, it's kind of hard to pretend it doesn't exist. whispy_snippet No one denies it's an issue. But what you seem incapable of accepting is it's a very minor issue that only very rarely rears its head. If you actively try to shoot an image with a strong light source angled towards the sensor (something you generally don't do because it often results in a poor shot on any camera) you might experience a halo effect. Might. But I've got literally hundreds of photos taken with my Pixel with no halos. You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want to fuel your juvenile rage fits. But people who actually use a Pixel every day don't seem to have a problem worth caring about. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It has nothing to do with a strong light source angled toward the sensor. That's normal lens flare. The Pixel halos are NOT normal lens flare. Like I said 4 out of 22 pictures. That's 18% of the pictures they took, and they didn't have strong light sources angled toward the sensor. 18% is not a rare problem, especially when the G6 NEVER had halos with the same exact pictures. Google admitted it's a flaw. Get over yourself and stop trying to justify it. whispy_snippet And like I said, I've taken hundreds of pictures and have seen a halo perhaps a couple of times. And I take a lot of photos given video and photography is my day job - indeed one of the reasons I chose the Pixel is because I wanted the best phone camera available for the times I don't have my proper gear with me. I've seen countless comparisons between the Pixel, iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 edge and while they're all great, in most situations the Pixel takes what I consider the better shot. You're making mountains out of molehills and carrying on like a right twat in the process. P. Sherman ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE DOESN'T MEAN JACKS--- if in scientific tests under controlled environments and the same conditions, the Pixel produced the halo effect, which Google has acknowledged to be a design deficiency standard on LITERALLY EVERY PIXEL MADE, but other cameras feature no such halo effect. FFS whispy_snippet I'm not denying there's an issue! I'm saying it's being blown out of proportion by people who want to blow it out of proportion. P. Sherman Referencing a scientific, controlled test and camera comparison is NOT blowing this out of proportion. Blowing out of proportion would be something how the Wall Street Journal set out to destroy PewDiePie for boneheadedly saying "Death to all Jews" as a joke. But referencing a camera comparison in exactly the same conditions and one phone had a halo effect but the other didn't is science, fact, nothing to blow out of proportion there. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good luck arguing with a Google fanboy in deep denial. thereasoner He's actually making solid points, the Pixels do have the best cameras overall​ and all smartphone cameras have some issues. whispy_snippet No, no. I'm a fanboy! Get it right! Cecil Hardwood Are you sure the Pixel has the best camera ? The reason I ask is because the DxOMark site that claims this refuses to release the iPhone 7 Plus (Not iPhone 7) scores and many believe it is because it scored higher than the Pixel. The theory goes on to say that Google is using their score in their advertising and DxO doesn't want to piss off Google. Something weird is going on for sure. DxO claimed long ago the review was coming soon and should have been out by now with the iPhone 7 Plus having been on the market as long as it has. thereasoner If I'm to make a judgment personally then I would say that probably the top 3-4 cameras on flagships are very close and what's best as far as the user is concerned is subjective. Do you prefer low light performance(I do) or digital zoom? Do your favour widespread angle lens or fast launch/focus etc. Those are personal preferences that make "the best " phone different for different people. That said, as far as reviews are concerned the Pixel is generally considered the best over all. As far as your conspiracy theories go, who knows? Anyone can create those about anything but I guess but I'm thinking that other than digital zoom and an artsy photo effect the 7+ cameras are very similar to the 7. whispy_snippet The iPhone 7 Plus is the same as the iPhone 7 apart from an additional, slower lens. In terms of raw image quality the iPhone 7 Plus achieves its best results with the lens it shares with its smaller sibling. So basically, it'll score no better than the 7. It's effectively already been tested. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All smartphone cameras have some issues? What issues does the G6 camera have in the comparison I linked? 23% of the Pixel photos have halo issues. Find a serious issue with 23% of the G6 photos and get back to us. thereasoner Keep in mind that if you take wide-angle shots, angles will be distorted and elongated from the side, especially when it comes to selfies with the front-facing camera. I also found that the front-facing camera takes relatively muddy shots in low-light. Compared to the Pixel XL, OnePlus 3T and (for the time being since we don't have the S8) the Galaxy S7, the G6 is on par with its rivals. The Pixel XL takes superior low-light images than all the phones though, and I prefer the richer contrast and saturation of the S7 by just a tad. -CNET There are a ton of reviews from various sources just like this and while the G6 cameras are considered very nice they do have their shortcomings and generally rank below the Pixel cameras overall. whispy_snippet Purple flaring and chromatic aberation. It's extremely noticeable in at least four images you shared with the Pixel comparison. Here you are: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration And just Google search purple flaring. Sorry to burst your bubble. whispy_snippet Show me the link to the test. I would like to see it. Even if their results suggest there's an issue (which there is as we all agree), the significance of the results can still be blown out of proportion which is what we're seeing occur in this ridiculous discussion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Here you go again. phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ Now that I've viewed the pics again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. Two involve a bright light. The other 3 do not. So that's 23% of 22 pictures. I wouldn't say that's blowing things out of proportion. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. Yeah, you paid a lot for your Pixel, so you have a hard time admitting it's a steaming pile of dog s**t. I understand. whispy_snippet Yep, so as we've agreed, halos sometimes appear in shots with strong light sources pointing at or angled towards the edge of the sensor. But let's just ignore the purple flaring and chromatic aberation in at least four of the images from the LG, right? You're demonstrating selective criticism. Every camera has strengths and weaknesses but on balance, the Pixel offers better images than competing phones more often than not. My position is unchanged. You're both making mountains out of molehills, and in no way does this "scientific" test guarantee that 23% of photos taken with a Pixel will exhibit a halo. It simply shows 23% of photos taken in this example demonstrated halos. You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. No one ever said the Pixel is perfect. But only you two are using ridiculous, extreme labels like "steaming pile of dog shit" and "HARDWARE DEFICIENCY" as though using capital letters makes your odd ball assertions more valid. Most reputable tech reviewers agree the Pixel has the best overall smartphone camera. You're entitled to disagree. P. Sherman 4/22. 4/22 photos from the Pixel have a halo effect. That's from Phandroid. That's 18% of photos the Pixel. That alone is damning. Google themselves have acknowledged that it is a HARDWARE DEFICIENCY and software fixes have done little to address this. They admitted it was there, that's all we need. If you knew that 4/22 Burritos Chipotle made would give you the Runs, but ZERO/22 Burritos Taco Bell made would, would YOU still choose to eat at Chipotle? whispy_snippet Show me the test! I've asked twice now. P. Sherman Lena Flare was removed from the photos, but not the video. http://highonandroid.com/android-smartphone-news/the-truth-about-google-pixel-camera-halolens-flare-effect/ Also, someone in the official Google forums shot with their Pixel and Nexus 6P in the same Time, conditions, everything. Guess what? https://support.google.com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsrROqMaXHqHg/?hl=by Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ 3 halos are obvious, 1 is subtle. The subtle one is where the picture is looking up at a building's windows. Now that I've viewed them again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. tigerstown I paid $380 for my new pixel XL so it's not a lot and I have no Halo in my pics I have proven this on Twitter already. abc More fanboy logic. I took pictures so everything is fine. Anyone who says its not fine is crazy. whispy_snippet How ridiculous. So a blogger takes 22 photos in various conditions and his experience is valid, but my experience of owning the phone and taking hundreds of photos in various conditions is not valid. You guys are weirdos. Andy But do you see problems with low light pics. I do on my wife's pixel. IPhone Looks so much better. I'm so disappointed abc I saw a rainbow once. Oh, are we not just conveying pointless ancedotes? mr.fozzo On my Nex6P, I have noticed that the Fingerprint reader has been less reliable lately. It requires more presses than the usual 1 press. Besnik Rrustemi My Nexus 6P working excellent so far, no battery problems, no fingerprint problems (better standby times on 7.1.2 to be honest). But yes,i can agree that fingerprint was much faster when i first got the device on 6.0 Marshmallow (for unlocking the device with the fingerprint) now it takes like 2 full seconds for that :( jimv1983 No issues on my Nexus 5X and the swipe on the sensor to bring down the notification panel is great. Alex Harrison Flashed the OTA myself on my 5X. No issues with it. Jeff Neston At least it is just the sensor. My nexus 5 was bricked by a Google update.. it got the boot loop. Google support lied to me claiming I broke the power button. False it was not broken. I ended up going small claims case against Google. They settled, but wanted me to sign gag order. Sorry, no way. I sent it back and got complete refund. Sneaky company. What probably causes boot loop update to occur is phone on long time. Some apps get memory leak over time. System then unpredictably unstable. Then the system does auto uplate from Google without asking user NOR even rebooting or turning off prior to the update. Then during update, Os gets corrupted. Then after failed update phone reboots thinking the. Update completed. Now phones dead. And Google not bother to address the issue. Pdiddy187 My 5x fingerprint sensor was great until it bootlooped yesterday morning. LG is going to repair it under warranty even though it's well out of warranty. La Kiesha Rodriguez Barrientes I have the ZTE axon 7 and over a month now google hasn't addressed a fix for the play store not loading apps over data or Wi-Fi.. Without uninstalling updates to play store and then maybe will not say "waiting for network" so frustrating and then maybe download once and have to do that everytime.. Dumb.. P. Sherman That's been like that since KitKat. F------ KITKAT. ahnafm Is google reacommodating their customers now? Brett Delia I thought some positive feedback was worth being added. My Nexus 6P is working perfectly after the update. I've had generally a great experience with all my Android phones. I've had an iPhone as well as a Windows mobile phone as well in my past. None have been as feature packed as my Android devices. New_Guy This and all the other ridiculous issues with the Pixel is a big reason I stick with Samsung... flyonthewall Lol Fernando S Mine is working ok in my Nexus 5x running 7.1.2. It just failed once while I was on 7.1.1 and with a soft reset it came back to life Hank Is that a real screenshot in the story? Enrollment spelled wrong twice. SMH. ThisGuyFUX This is now icing on top of the cake, for anyone whom has enjoyed watching this crash and burn. If I paid $850+ for a Pixel, I'd be pursuing class action litigation by now. Slow clap. Sean Except its only affecting about 1% of the Pixels sold.........so......slow clap for you....... 2kool4skool It's gonna be sucks when you're in the 1%. And I doubt it's 1% anyway, this is probably the 20th article I've read about pixel's problems. That's alot. Probably more like 5%. abc Fortunately, not many Pixels have been sold so not many people are affected. Brian White Nexus 5x, running fine here ddevito If it wasn't for my OnePlus 3 I'd be on an iPhone. thereasoner One plus has their own issues/lousy support and the iPhone? They're the worst of them all when it comes to buggy software and hardware issues bricking devices ! ddevito Not sure I'd agree with you. My iPhone 6s hums along swimmingly without any issues. The more I use it the more I am leaning towards going back to an iPhone full-time. Apple, love them or hate them, knows how to deliver products, and support them. Period. thereasoner I'm glad that your iPhone 6s isn't affected by the many flawed updates and hardware issues​ that have plagued various iPhones over the years but the fact remains that Apple has faced class action lawsuits filed by their own customers for serious issues like Touch Disease and error 53 and for good reason. They have the worst track record of them all and to make things worse they're known for both ignoring iPhone issues until said class action lawsuits are launched and/or blaming their customers for the iPhone hardware/software problems. BTW, my Pixel "hums along swimmingly" as well, that doesn't mean issues with the Pixel don't exist much less those far more serious issues found on iPhones ! MisterKraky I'm not having the fingerprint sensor issue myself, but after updating to 7.1.2, I can no longer install or update any apps! On a Verizon-issued Pixel here. Đức Thành What happened to all the testing, Google? It seems they have become too reliant on using Nexus users for beta-testing and now can't seem to do a proper job on their own. Get your grips together, Android team. Rob H. Nougat is such a half baked disaster of an OS. It's ruined my N6. Marshmallow was soon much more stable. Thanks google keep breaking phones. jacob Cant even spell enrolment correctly. Enrollment...... PoisonApple31 Don't forget your apostrophe! Makes you look stupid when you are talking about spelling.

Rakesh There is a known bug that after you unlock your phone the fingerprint sensor won't work for gestures - swipe down. There is no workaround for it so far other than to just press once and then it will start working. Adam Margeson Not sure what you're talking about. Doesn't seem to affect my Pixel. dontsh00tmesanta Guess I'm a lucky one mine is ok abc Premium bugs for your "premium" Pixel. mike shwilly No issues here. Not using fingerprint sensor at all though. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ LOL!! So the solution to fingerprint sensor problems is not to use it. Check. Adam Margeson No issues here and I use mine all the time! whispy_snippet Ditto. Alex Cruz Off topic but this 'Felonious Monk' guy seems like he's butt hurt over some shit hahaha Is like an ex-wife trying to 'I told you so' about some shit. Felonious Monk get some pussy bro, it helps with that butt hurt you got..... Fakhri Ahmad Microsoft should come in hard with new phones and entice all the users android has frustrated.

This is why we hate... I mean love you. LOL Pixel XL and Nexus 5x, haven't noticed this issue Pris p I'm getting an iPhone next time. I'm tired of having boot loop worries and my videos looking all pixelized on social media. I haven't even downloaded the update because I'm afraid. It shouldn't be this way Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'm waiting for the Note 8, but I am seriously considering switching to iPhone, instead. I'm really tired of Google's crap. squiddy20 Annnnnd this is why I have auto-updates disabled on my PIxel. That, and I have it rooted. Andy Got my wife the pixel because she wanted a great camera. Consistently her friends iPhone 6 and 7s look better in low light. Its very frustrating. Makes me look like an idiot paying all this money. Outside the pictures look amazing. But I'm disappointed in indoor pics Stevo I have the same issue!! It happened as soon as I updated my stock Nexus 6P to 7.1.2. I've called Google Fi for support and they were NO help other than trying to sell me an "upgrade" to the Pixel and FULL price?!? They also said that they haven't had harly any other complaints with this issue. Thanks for nothing Google! I've did a soft rest then a complete reset with no luck. I've heard that people have had success with down grading to 7.1.1. or flashing a custom ROM. trapchan Where're Google apologists when you need them? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Maybe they're beginning to face reality. flyonthewall WTF Google flyonthewall To the Apple fanboys here. My Macbook Pro 2012 data cable fried in 2 years due to the Macbook's poorly designed unibody which acts as a fantastic heat conductor.

Scores of students, as well as Oman’s business community attended the “Women Techmakers Oman” programme, which featured six Omani women and their accomplishments in the technology world. The forum was part of a global series of events, and its 2017 theme was “Telling Our Story.” The event was organised by both the Google Developer Group Muscat, and the student comprised Computer Science club in the German University of Technology. Among the speakers was Sayyida Basma Al Said, a psychotherapist and hypnotherapist, who spoke about her journey in technology throughout the years. “My experience with technology was simpler in the 90s, but eventually I found my passion for physiology instead,” she said. She spoke about the founding of her mental health clinic—Whispers of Serenity—as well as her mental health awareness initiatives, and her experiences with social media and reaching out to the community regarding mental health. Ashwaq Al Maskari talked about her experiences as a YouTube personality, and the videos she uploads daily. “I took a break after I finished university to discover my passion and what I wanted to do, and ended up finding YouTube,” she said. Al Maskari spoke about attempting to bring down cultural barriers through her work. She also spoke about her pride in participating in regional events, including the YouTube FanFest in Jeddah, and the first YouTube female event, Batalat YouTube, in Riyadh. During her talk, Huda Al Habsi spoke about her journey in Omantel, especially starting out as the only woman in the company. She progressed in her career, and talked about her decades-long experience in the telecommunications industry. Al Habsi also spoke about becoming the first woman in Omantel to achieve a senior ranking, and her hopes of continuing to move up in the future. Jihad Al Busaidi, head of the Food Chemicals Lab at the Directorate General for Standards and Metrology, highlighted her achievements in volunteerism. She spoke about using social media to inspire youth to take up volunteering activities, and how to utilise social media at its highest potential to create social change. In addition to individual speeches, the event featured a Tech Discussion, which explored the topic of women’s future in technology. Saba Al Busaidi served as the moderator, and four women participated. They included Sharifa Al Barami, from the Oman Tech Fund; Amal Al Jabri from Cisco; Huda Al Habsi from Omantel; and Laila Al Harthy, a tech company founder. The group discussed women’s achievements and hopes, as well as challenges in the workplace and in the tech industry. The GUTech Computer Science club is also organising a Google event on Sunday. The workshop is open to all those who register, and will be held at the university. The event will explore the “Internet of Things,” which is the inter-networking of computer devices around us, via their ability to connect to the internet. < Previous PageNext Page > Please enable JavaScript to view the comments powered by Disqus.

It seems the trouble for Google’s Nexus lineup is only going to get worse, as the Nexus 6P may soon be part of its very own class-action lawsuit. Law firm Chimicles & Tikellis has opened up an investigation on whether or not it should file a class-action lawsuit against Google regarding two major problems the Nexus 6P has suffered from since launch. The first issue concerns the phone’s battery; per the firm, consumers have reported instances where the phone would power down claiming that it had no battery, despite the battery meter displaying “anywhere between 10-60% of battery life remaining”. This issue has been in the news since December last year, making its way onto Google’s issue tracker as well. The firm also notes that while the issue has mostly been reported by consumers on Android 7.0 Nougat, users who flashed back to Android 6.0 Marshmallow continued to experience the problem. The second issue with the Nexus 6P is the same one haunting LG: an eternal bootloop. Although, the cause of the issue is not clear and may not be the same as claimed for the Nexus 5X. Google is certainly aware of the problems, with both the "bootloop of death" and battery problems listed on its issue tracker. However, it tells consumers to "seek warranty coverage from Huawei”, claiming that it is a hardware problem. On the other hand, according to the complaints reviewed by the law firm, Huawei either claims that the fault exists in Google’s software, or “often stonewalls attempts to obtain warranty coverage”. The Nexus devices have always been in a unique position. HTC, Samsung, Asus, LG, and Huawei have built these devices, but Google has always managed the software and its updates – that’s the appeal of a Nexus device. Unfortunately, it seems to be turning into an excuse to dodge responsibilities when problems arise.

It’s currently being used by companies like Medisas, DramaFever and Poynt to accept applications for open positions. Google Hire is likely being built by the folks at Bebop, an enterprise application development team that the search giant acquired in 2015. “This event was off the charts” Gary Vaynerchuk was so impressed with TNW Conference 2016 he paused mid-talk to applaud us. FIND OUT WHY From the sparse website, it’s hard to tell exactly what sort of functionality Hire offers at present. But it’s likely that it’ll rival application management tools offered by the likes of LinkedIn, Indeed and Greenhouse. Hire is the latest venture from a new category to emerge from Google’s stables. It’s also recently launched Areo, an aggregator for food delivery and home maintenance services in India, and Meet, a video conferencing app for business users. We’ve contacted Google to learn more and will update this post if there’s a response.

Google Maps reduces drive time in Auckland 5:00 AM Sunday Apr 16, 2017 SHARE: Facebook Twitter Google+ LinkedIn Not saved Email Print Easter Google Technology Traffic Transport Stuck in traffic? Google's map app could be your way out. Photo / Brett Phibbs Thousands of holidaymakers are set to battle mass traffic as they return from their Easter breaks - but relief from gridlock could be just a swipe of the finger away. Heavy congestion brought parts of Auckland's southern motorway, and SH1 both north and south of the City of Sails to a standstill as holidaymakers who had delayed their travel due to Cyclone Cook left town. And those keen on avoiding the worst of the gridlock tomorrow around the country as the long weekend ends could do well to log into the Google map app. Overseas research has shown the app has already proved to be a Godsend for Aucklanders, cutting driving times on average by 8 per cent and public transport times by 13 per cent. And the data crunched by AlphaBeta, a Sydney and Singapore-based economic strategy consultancy, showed Google Maps supported more than $600 million in consumer benefits for New Zealand in 2015. The free app is worth $170 a year to New Zealanders through time savings to find local businesses, landmarks, travelling from A to B and planning overseas holidays, according to AlphaBeta. Spokesman Konstantin Matthies said using techniques similar to New Zealand's Automobile Association "we have found that using Maps to plan and navigate routes has cutting driving times in Auckland by 8 per cent, or around 4 hours per years for every driver. We've also run the analysis for public transport users, finding they save around 2 hours a year via Maps Konstantin Matthies, AlphaBeta AlphaBeta analysed more than 17,000 simulated driving and public transport trips in Auckland, Christchurch and Wellington, as well as survey data from New Zealanders using Google Maps to plan or navigate routes. Continued below. Related Content Your guide to what's on this Easter weekend Motorist speeding on the Hauraki Plains in Easter Weekend traffic caught and fined Apple ready to test self-driving cars Driving times reduced by 8 per cent in Auckland and 6 per cent in Wellington and Christchurch. Public transport users reduced their travelling times in Auckland by 13 per cent, Christchurch by 9 per cent and Wellington by 12 per cent. Another benefit of the Map app, said AlphaBeta, is reduced environmental impact. Using average vehicle speeds and occupancy rates, it estimates savings of between 14,500 and 19,500 tonnes of carbon dioxide. This is the equivalent of between 3000 and 4000 fewer cars on the road. The AA is using data collected from the Google Map app at more than 50 busy routes across Auckland to better understand the causes and effects of congestion. There are plans for monthly reports on congestion trends, a possible television slot, advice for planned events like the Adele concerts and holiday traffic and immediate responses for unplanned events like car crashes and road closures. "We think this will lead to a more informed debate. That means keeping public expectations real and cutting out political promises of 'silver bullet' solutions," said AA infrastructure principal adviser Barney Irvine. Auckland's rapid population growth has led to a quarter of the city's busiest roads, including Lake Rd, Lincoln Rd and routes to the airport, being congested at peak hours, up from 18 per cent in just three years. Auckland Transport said one in three main roads will be congested by 2020. "The idea is to help de-mystify congestion for the public. By focusing on the bigger picture and talking about what people can do to minimise some of congestion's impacts, we can help to reduce some of the stress," said Irvine. The AA began collecting the Google data in about October last year. It is also collecting data in Wellington and Christchurch.

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 125 Plus 1 on G+ 278 Share on Facebook 78 Share on Twitter Total Shares481 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 141k 106k Latest Deals 14 [Deal Alert] Get a 75" Sony LED UHD Android TV from Best Buy for $2150 today ($650 off) 2017/04/15 4:13pm PDTApr 15, 2017 19 [Deal Alert] Huawei Watch in Black Stainless Steel w/metal band $250 ($100 off) 2017/04/14 6:36pm PDTApr 14, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] 55 temporarily free and on-sale apps to round out your week 2017/04/14 12:50pm PDTApr 14, 2017 13 [Deal Alert] 2-Pack 6' Anker USB 3.0 A to C cables $12 w/ promo ($8 off) 2017/04/13 4:16pm PDTApr 13, 2017 32 [Deal Alert] NVIDIA is having a SHIELD gaming spring sale 2017/04/13 2:17pm PDTApr 13, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?

Press Releases Newsletters Webinars AI Analysis The art of algorithms: How automation is affecting creativity Paul Sawers@psawers April 15, 2017 10:25 AM Tags: ai, algorithms, creativity Above: Robot typing on fluorescent keyboard. Image Credit: Shutterstock “Drawing on your phone or computer can be slow and difficult — so we created AutoDraw, a new web-based tool that pairs machine learning with drawings created by talented artists to help you draw,” wrote Google Creative Lab’s “creative technologist,” Dan Motzenbecker, earlier this week. AutoDraw is one of Google’s artificial intelligence (AI) experiments, working across platforms to let anyone, irrespective of their artistic flair, create something super quick with little more than a scribble. It guesses what you’re trying to draw, then lets you pick from a list of previously created pictures. “So you can’t draw? No worries!” is the general idea here. Above: AutoDraw   First up, AutoDraw is a super fun tool that gets increasingly addictive — that much is clear. But what’s also clear is that the tool is more a display of AI smarts than it is a tool to improve your artwork, because it would be just as easy to embody the exact same functionality within a text-based search engine. I mean, why bother drawing a crap dolphin with your finger when you could just type in the word “dolphin”? Because it wouldn’t be nearly as much fun, and Google wouldn’t get to show off its fancy new toys. A few days after Google debuted AutoDraw, it revealed some other research its scientists have been carrying out, designed to enable computers to generate simple sketches using artificial intelligence (AI). In effect, they trained a recurrent neural network (RNN) on sketches that real people made, which emanated from an experimental app called Quick, Draw! that launched last year (again … it is really fun). The app tells you to draw things, like a giraffe or a butterfly, and then it guesses what you’ve drawn. So what Google is doing is training machines to sketch like real people, with all the line overlaps and crappy squiggles included. What this helps demonstrate is the growing crossover between art and algorithms. But does this hint at a future where humans have little incentive to be creative at all? The rise of the fourth industrial revolution As part of the so-called fourth industrial revolution, millions of jobs will be lost to automation, according to a recent World Economic Forum report. The net loss is expected to be as many as five million jobs by 2020, though of course a whole bunch of new jobs will be created, including positions in IT and data science. Jobs such as manufacturing and production are expected to be heavily affected, while another recent report indicated that more than 100,000 legal jobs will be automated over the next 20 years. But art… art is sacred. Art is an expression of human sentiment and emotion. Computers stand zero chance of consigning human creativity to the history books. Right? Well, maybe. We’re already seeing the early signs that art will be disrupted by machine intelligence and automation. Why bother learning to paint a landscape or pay someone to sketch your newborn when you can download Prisma to your smartphone and transform your snapshots into ultra-realistic pieces of art in seconds? Prisma, for the uninitiated, uses neural networks to analyze each photo and then applies a style the user selects. And it really is rather good. “Based on deep-learning techniques, we redraw the image from scratch,” said Alexey Moiseenkov, Prisma Labs cofounder, in an interview with VentureBeat last year. “We analyze tons of photos and get the typical forms and lines, then take a style and draw your picture with those lines in a taken style.” Above: Prisma: Bottle with Prisma effect applied The point here isn’t that these tools are better than human creators. The point is that such tools are pretty good just now, and they’ll only get better. If someone can press a couple of buttons to get an instant “hand-drawn” family portrait, using little more than a DSLR camera, tripod, and a Prisma-style AI image-rendering app, why would they bother employing the services of a professional artist? It’s not beyond possibility that artists and art retailers will one day have to sell their services based on their authenticity — “100% hand-painted pictures” could become the only visible marking that separates human creations from those produced by machines. But technology’s algorithmic arm stretches far beyond that of photography and art and into other creative realms. In design For years, automated web design services such as Wix and Weebly have offered novices an easy-to-use web development platform that makes it simple to build HTML5 sites using drag-and-drop tools rather than code. For basic websites without much deep functionality, such tools work fairly well. But the formulaic, simplistic, template-based approach leaves much to be desired, which is why professional designers and developers still manage to eke out a living. Last June, Wix launched an automated web design service built on artificial intelligence, called Wix ADI. Using data garnered from its existing user base to feed into this new AI offering, the “creator” basically answers a few questions and provides the platform with cues as to what theme the website should be based on and what category it exists in, and then Wix pulls in relevant photos, words, and layouts based on the business type and location. “Wix ADI isn’t just a new website builder — it sets a new market standard for web design,” said Wix ADI head Nitzan Achsaf at the launch. “We have been at the forefront of this market for nearly a decade, and now as one of the leading AI technology providers, we will make website creation accessible and easy for everyone.” Wix promises that no two websites will look the same. Other similar AI-focused web design platforms have blossomed in recent times and raised significant venture capital funding, including TheGrid, which has been operating its AI smarts for a few years already, and B12, which launched a similar proposition in beta last year with more than $12 million in funding. The credibility of DIY web- and app-design tools that promise to turn “noobs” into designers and coders has been questioned for years. And now that AI is going the extra mile to remove any further effort from the process, it will only ruffle the naysayers’ feathers even more. But the usefulness of such tools really depends on what the purpose of the website is. Why pay for a professional designer and developer when you can hit a few buttons and have a simple, informative, Google-friendly site made with next to no spadework? Again, the point here isn’t that the machines are now good enough to replace professionals in building fully functional websites and online services. The point is that AI is encroaching further into creative professions and, more importantly, it’s improving all the time. In music Could an algorithm ever be able to produce something as exquisite as Lennon & McCartney, Jagger & Richards, or even Mozart? Maybe. But probably not, at least for a while. Back in September, headlines across the web screamed that the first AI-written pop song had been made. It made for alluring headlines, but it wasn’t strictly true. Sony researchers, using specialist Flow Machines software, were able to train a system on different music styles using a gargantuan database of songs. Then combining “style transfer, optimization and interaction techniques,” the system is able to compose music in any style. So what we have here is a song called “Daddy’s Car,” written in the style of The Beatles. And hey, it’s not too bad. However, a more accurate description of this composition would be that it was “AI-assisted.” French composer Benoit Carré wrote the lyrics (which are pretty nonsensical) and arranged the song — all the computer did was identify commonalities across this style of pop music and provided Carré with the parts to play around with. Sony’s researchers have actually been working on AI-assisted music creations for a few years already, and an entire album of such music is expected later this year. Sony isn’t the only company dabbling in this field. Last year, Google announced Magenta, a project from the Google Brain team that’s setting out to discover whether machine learning can “create compelling art and music.” And earlier this year, the internet giant released a working interactive version of AI Duet, an app that lets you play a virtual piano with accompaniment from a computer system that riffs off what you play. Elsewhere, London-based startup Jukedeck is working on an AI-powered music composer that writes original music completely on its own volition. Aimed at video creators on the hunt for original background music, Jukedeck has been training deep neural networks to understand how to compose and adapt music, with the end-user able to customize the sound they’re looking for. All the guitar bands, DJs, and orchestras of the world can perhaps rest easy for now. While computers will improve at “songwriting,” artists’ biggest worry for the time being is how to make money in the age of on-demand streaming. Speaking of which…. Spotify snapped up music intelligence and data platform Echo Nest back in 2014, and off the back of that acquisition has been doubling down on its music recommendation efforts. The star of the show is Discover Weekly, a personalized playlist of music built around songs you’ve previously listened to on the platform. In effect, Spotify analyzes your history and meshes it with the listening behavior of others to see what songs commonly appear next to each other, then based on this information it recommends new music. And it is more than pretty good — it is pretty excellent. While Apple is banking on human curators via the likes of Apple Radio, Spotify is arguably winning the music-recommendation battle using algorithms and automation. What’s most interesting about this is that it is infinitely more scalable than a human DJ’s ability to recommend new music. Playlists built on algorithms are always tailored to the individual, while human recommendations will always have biased subjectivity weighted against it that will never appeal to everyone at all times. Similarly, Shazam analyzes song structure to tell you what the name of the song is and who performs it. All you need to do is hold your phone up, tap a button, and voila. It really is a great way to discover new music and build up a library of tunes that you encounter on your day-to-day business, be it in a shop, at a football stadium, or while watching TV. Such technologies make everyone an expert, without having to become an expert. You don’t need to know anything except how to tap a button to identify a song, while Shazam links in directly with Spotify and iTunes to make it easy to stream or buy music. Together, the likes of Spotify and Shazam could put a sizable dent into the knowledge-powered smarts of music writers and DJs around the world. People have instant access to all the information they need on the music they hear around them. And why listen to the top 10 charts on the radio, or read the top 5 albums of the week in the NME, when you know that Spotify has all the best new music? And why turn to your music-obsessed buddy to ask what the name of the song in that TV advertisement is when you can just Shazam it? With algorithms at work, the need for human knowledge and expertise diminishes. In writing Above: Lego robot typing It’s difficult to envisage a time when a machine will be capable of crafting a best-selling novel, but lord knows geeks have been trying to make that happen for a while. It’s not overly difficult to create something that is formed of words and roughly comprehensible in parts, but generating something with a proper narrative that flows beautifully from start to finish and is infused with wit and passion — well, that could be a long way off yet. But we are already at a stage where machines are producing journalistic content (for want of a better phrase). Last summer, the Associated Press (AP) revealed it was expanding its baseball coverage with automated stories generated by algorithms through a partnership with Automated Insights. The AP had worked with Automated Insights for years already, generating thousands of computer-generated corporate earnings reports. Automated Insights uses artificial intelligence to analyze big data and transform it into stories. Chicago-based Narrative Science offers something similar, with a specific focus on business intelligence for the enterprise, or “data storytelling,” as it puts it. Here’s an AP report from a baseball game in the New York-Penn league, powered by Automated Insights. STATE COLLEGE, Pa. (AP) — Dylan Tice was hit by a pitch with the bases loaded with one out in the 11th inning, giving the State College Spikes a 9-8 victory over the Brooklyn Cyclones on Wednesday. Danny Hudzina scored the game-winning run after he reached base on a sacrifice hit, advanced to second on a sacrifice bunt and then went to third on an out. Gene Cone scored on a double play in the first inning to give the Cyclones a 1-0 lead. The Spikes came back to take a 5-1 lead in the first inning when they put up five runs, including a two-run home run by Tice. Brooklyn regained the lead 8-7 after it scored four runs in the seventh inning on a grand slam by Brandon Brosher. State College tied the game 8-8 in the seventh when Ryan McCarvel hit an RBI single, driving in Tommy Edman. Reliever Bob Wheatley (1-0) picked up the win after he struck out two and walked one while allowing one hit over two scoreless innings. Alejandro Castro (1-1) allowed one run and got one out in the New York-Penn League game. Vincent Jackson doubled twice and singled, driving in two runs in the win. State College took advantage of some erratic Brooklyn pitching, drawing a season-high nine walks in its victory. Despite the loss, six players for Brooklyn picked up at least a pair of hits. Brosher homered and singled twice, driving home four runs and scoring a couple. The Cyclones also recorded a season-high 14 base hits. This story was generated by Automated Insights (http://automatedinsights.com) using data from and in cooperation with MLB Advanced Media and Minor League Baseball, http://www.milb.com. And here’s an earnings report in Forbes, powered by Narrative Science. Over the past three months, the consensus estimate has sagged from $1.25. For the fiscal year, analysts are expecting earnings of $5.75 per share. A year after being $1.37 billion, analysts expect revenue to fall 1% year-over-year to $1.35 billion for the quarter. For the year, revenue is expected to come in at $5.93 billion. A year-over-year drop in revenue in the fourth quarter broke a three-quarter streak of revenue increases. The company has been profitable for the last eight quarters, and for the last four, profit has risen year-over-year by an average of 16%. The biggest boost for the company came in the third quarter, when profit jumped by 32%. Earnings estimates provided by Zacks. Narrative Science, through its proprietary artificial intelligence platform, transforms data into stories and insights. Such reports won’t be winning any Pulitzer prizes yet, but they’re perfectly readable and the algorithms are constantly improving. There’s no evidence that machines will be capable of producing something akin to Dickens or Proust, but who knows what another 10 years’ worth of data could do to improve their writing smarts? “A machine will win a Pulitzer one day,” noted Narrative Science’ chief scientist Kris Hammond, in the Guardian. “We can tell the stories hidden in data.” While fears abound that algorithms will kill off human journalists, figuratively speaking, the AP has previously stated that embracing machine-written stories is more about expanding its coverage than replacing journalists. Through this method, it can cover many more Minor League Baseball games it would not have previously covered, simply by using data provided by news and statistics body Major League Baseball Advanced Media (MLBAM). “Augmented content was never intended to replace human-generated content,” explained Joe Procopio, Automated Insights’ chief innovation office, in an interview with VentureBeat. “It’s another tool, another arrow in the journalist’s quiver, so to speak, and it should be used in places where it can take a lot of the data science and number crunching off the journalist’s plate. That frees up the journalist’s time to be able to do more of the investigative and reasoning work inherent in their jobs.” What will ultimately decide whether an artistic endeavor is replaced by an algorithm or set of algorithms, in a business setting at least, is whether it’s more efficient. The question is: Does it save time and money without compromising on quality? “There are basically two boxes that need to be checked when deciding to use automation to tell a story,” added Procopio. “One, is the data available to write something compelling, and two, is the business case there — in other words, does automation save enough time and resources to make it worthwhile?” So can a machine be trained to amend its style of writing depending on whether it’s writing an earnings reports, a baseball review, or an obituary? Absolutely — this is already happening. Could a machine write a review of a music gig? Or write up an interview? Potentially, but it all comes down to the quality of the data the platform is given, and whether it’s actually cost effective to train a system to become efficient at such write-ups. “Automation can be used when writing the types of pieces you describe — feature, interviews, reviews, etc., where automation makes sense,” continued Procopio. “How much of the piece should be automated depends on the scope of the piece.” What’s emerging here is that such tools could be more about assisting the journalist than replacing them. It might not make sense to attempt entire computer-generated write-ups of a music gig, for example, if it already requires a human to attend the gig and form an opinion. But it may make sense to use a machine to fill in the gaps in the final review, or even to format it properly. For example, automation could generate paragraphs on a particular band’s sales and downloads, or maybe ticket sales, through tapping existing databases that contain up-to-date information. It’s not really important whether a human or a machine finds and compiles such data, so long as it’s accurate, but using an automated approach could save a journalist a lot of time. Found in translation Away from the journalistic sphere, the global translation and interpretation industry is reported to be worth around $40 billion. And contrary to what some may think, the process of converting words and meanings between languages requires a great deal of creativity. Often words or sentiment don’t convert well between languages and vernaculars, leaving the translator to trawl the nuanced depths of their linguistic abilities to communicate the intended meaning in another tongue. Historically, machine translation tools have had a bad rap, but they are getting better. It’s now possible to plug any foreign-language newspaper article into Google Translate and receive a pretty faithful interpretation in another language, though there are many colloquialisms that will still trip up the best machine translation tools out there. Google has started using its AI-based neural machine translation across more of its public-facing services. Skype also has a real-time voice translation tool, which lets you speak with someone (verbally) in a foreign tongue such as Japanese, in real time. Skype Translator uses AI smarts such as deep learning to train artificial neural networks, meaning it should improve over time as it listens to more conversations. Any business worth its salt would not rely 100 percent on machine translations for mission-critical communications with customers. But we are certainly fast approaching a stage where machines can be called upon for less important stuff, and perhaps used in tandem with a proofreader to correct mistakes and clarify any ambiguities made by the machine for use in more important communications. So, as with Automated Insights, we could have a situation where 100 percent automation is used in some instances where it makes sense, but in cases where the nuanced understanding of a human is needed, the two would work in conjunction with each other. Where we’re at It’s clear that the threat from automation to human jobs is real for many industries, and that includes the creative realm: streaming services that serve you the perfect playlist, apps that turn a family photo into something straight from Van Gogh’s easel, real-time translations and interpretations, robot-written news reports, and websites created automatically simply by answering a few questions. This leads us to one stark question. Creativity is a core defining human trait, something that truly separates us from the machines, so where is the incentive to get creative when all these tools out there are setting out to save us from doing it ourselves? There are a number of positives here. If a computer was to get as good as, or better than, humans at drawing in a natural style, then it could become the teacher, or assist an artist in their own creative process. Plus, there is a strong line of argument that says that people will always have a creative streak and will want to do things themselves. If you can click a button to turn a photo into a work of art, where is the fun in that? And that is something that humans will never lose: a desire to have fun and make things themselves. Whether they will be able to get a job off the back of it in 20 years time is another question, of course. When technology is constantly “fixing” human errors, be it a typo in a Word document or a wonky line in a drawing, humans may gradually lose the ability to perform certain creative tasks without computer intervention. It’s no longer necessary to remember facts, or phone numbers, or routes to your grandma’s house in the next town, because we know it’s all instantly accessible through a phone. This surely has an impact on a brain’s ability to remember things. Similarly, if kids grow up with tools to “help them draw” on their phone or computer because it’s “slow and difficult” otherwise, this can’t bode well if it becomes the norm. But let’s not get too carried away. Machines have yet to prove they’re up to the job of many creative tasks; all they’ve shown so far is they can chip away at the edges — and even then they still need human assistance. Highly creative projects such as writing novels, writing investigative journalism, or penning an entire album of original music with heartfelt, meaningful lyrics — it’s difficult to see a time in the near future where computers will trump humans. A good example is this cool little short sci-fi film produced last year, called Sunspring. It stars real actors, but the script was written by a machine. It was inspired by Alphabet’s AlphaGo AI system beating a pro player at the age-old strategy game Go. The script for the short film was authored by a “recurrent neural network called long short-term memory, or LSTM for short,” according to a report in Ars last year. It is actually really funny, and makes little sense, but it serves as a reminder as to how far behind machines are in terms of creating genuine works of art that humans would wish to enjoy at scale. It’s also important to distinguish between artificial intelligence and “algorithmic intelligence.” The former is more about computers being able to think, understand, and adapt in way a human might, while the latter is more about using mathematics to help people and machines work together. Phil Tee is chairman and CEO of Moogsoft, a company that specializes in bringing algorithmic intelligence to enterprises — Moogsoft basically helps them adopt algorithms to address mundane operational tasks. He told VentureBeat: Artificial intelligence is the ability for computer systems to perform tasks that traditionally have required human intelligence, such as visual perception, speech recognition, decision-making and language translation. Algorithmic technologies such as Algorithmic IT Operations (AIOps), on the other hand, leverage mathematics to help operators navigate dynamic, and highly unpredictable settings such as enterprise IT environments. There isn’t anything artificial about algorithms. And this is a key point. Using algorithms to predict what music you’ll like on Spotify or what movies you should watch next on Netflix is smart for sure, but it’s not creative in itself. It may be better at doing its job than a human is, but it doesn’t exist as part of “the arts.” So while we’ll see businesses increasingly turn to algorithmic intelligence to optimize and streamline their operations and differentiate themselves from the competition, art itself may not be directly under threat. But will we ever reach a stage where a computer could write a completely coherent book, song, or movie of its own volition? “Absolutely, but the advances necessary are quite imposing,” added Tee. “The typical neural network today has roughly hundreds to tens of thousands of neurons, which makes it even less intelligent than a sea slug, which has 18,000 neurons in its brain. This journey to a creative thinking machine is vital, but a long one. Perhaps we should be more focused on intelligence as an aid to creativity rather than a replacement. After all, creativity probably is ultimately what defines humanity.” Art needs humans, and humans need art. Machines may increasingly help the two work together, and it may even replace some jobs, but as one of our defining characteristics, humans and art will continue to be inseparable.

It’s been another thrilling week across the tech world, with some exciting announcements, a few spicy rumors, some big surprises, and some bigger disappointments. But don’t worry about missing anything, for once again, 7 Days is here to walk you through what’s been happening. Our journey begins this week in the world of fast food, as Burger King created a TV ad designed to trigger Google's Home speaker hub and digital Assistant in people's homes, by ending with "OK Google, what is a Whopper burger?" That should then have got Google Home and Assistant to read out the description of the Whopper from Wikipedia - but the Wikipedia entry was quickly edited to suggest that the Whopper contains "rat meat" and "toenail clippings". In the end, it wasn't Burger King that killed the ads, but Google, which wasn't too happy about its devices being used in that way without its blessing, and blocked its Assistant from responding to the ads. Google's got much bigger things on its mind anyway - next week, it's planning to introduce "the new Google Earth" with a "brand new experience". Lineage OS added support for more handsets, including Samsung's Galaxy S III, and the OnePlus One. And Canonical released Ubuntu 17.04 'Zesty Zapus', bringing a new kernel and removing the default swap partition - although it hasn't yet made the recently-announced switch from Unity to GNOME. At CES in January 2016, Dell unveiled its stunning 30-inch OLED monitor with 4K resolution. Priced at $4,999, it was due to go on sale in March 2016, but never appeared. Now, over a year later than planned, it's finally available to order - and its price tag has shrunk by 30%. The US Federal Aviation Administration has given the green light to Boeing's use of 3D-printed titanium aircraft parts for use on its 787 Dreamliner. The move is set to save millions of dollars in production costs for the company. Image: Digital Trends Meanwhile, the FCC has abandoned plans to enable cellphone calls during flights. Given how obnoxious fellow passengers can be, even without license to scream into their mobile phones at 37,000ft, this seems like a sensible move. Over in the UK, Virgin Media is turning its home broadband customers' routers into public Wi-Fi hotspots. Kodi, frustrated by its software being misused for content piracy, is now considering adding DRM support to its products. A new strain of ransomware has been doing the rounds lately, demanding that you play a game and unlock your data by reaching a high score. Hacking group Shadow Brokers published a range of tools used to exploit vulnerabilities in Windows versions all the way back to Windows 2000 - but Microsoft said that it had already patched most of those security flaws. Image: Shutterstock Microsoft published its latest transparency reports, including details on law enforcement requests for information about its customers. Microsoft and Chinese tech giant Tencent were among the investors in the latest $1.4 billion funding round for Indian online retailer Flipkart. More significantly, Flipkart is now taking over eBay India, while eBay is taking an equity stake in Flipkart as part of a $500 million investment. Microsoft released a new Office Insider Preview for Windows users in the Slow ring, bringing new features such as collaborative editing in Excel. It released a new Outlook for Mac preview for Office Insiders in the Fast ring too, adding support for email templates. But separately, it also launched another Outlook for Mac preview, available to everyone. The standalone preview program does not require an Office 365 subscription, unlike the Office Insider Program. Rumors in recent months suggested that Apple had abandoned its self-driving car project in favor of working with existing manufacturers to develop software for use in their vehicles. It's still not clear exactly what Apple has planned, but this week, the company received a permit to test autonomous vehicles in California. Meanwhile, Apple is reportedly working on a secretive project to expand the healthcare benefits of its Watch. The company is said to be developing sensors that can non-invasively monitor blood sugar levels for diabetics, similar to the heart-rate sensors on its existing wearable devices. In rather more mundane news, Apple also released its second developer betas for iOS 10.3.2, macOS 10.12.5, watchOS 3.2.2, and tvOS 10.2.1; followed by the second public betas of those iOS and macOS versions. Apple is being sued by Qualcomm, which alleges that the iPhone-maker deliberately limited its chips' performance so that they wouldn't outperform those sold by Intel. Qualcomm didn't have a great week, as it was ordered to refund $815 million to BlackBerry, which was found to have overpaid the chip-manufacturer. The ruling came after a period of arbitration, and cannot be appealed, so while Qualcomm made it clear it "does not agree with the decision", it has no choice but to pay up and shut up. The latest smartphone sales market share data from Kantar Worldpanel shows further gains for Android in many key markets, with iOS holding steady in most parts of the world - except in China, where demand for iPhones plummeted year-over-year. Windows phone sales remain in freefall, unsurprisingly. After months of leaks and rumors, HTC officially unveiled its new One X10, a mid-range handset with a 5.5-inch 1080p display, octa-core processor, and a very generous 4000mAh battery. There was very surprising news from Samsung this week. After it became clear that its new 'intelligent assistant' Bixby would be far more limited at launch than Samsung had implied on stage at its Galaxy S8 announcement, the company has now admitted that its new flagship will launch in the US without support for Bixby voice controls. Samsung also tweeted that the Galaxy S8 and S8+ will launch in India on April 19, before deleting that tweet. It also seems that AT&T will be exclusively launching a Galaxy S8 active, following similar 'rugged' versions of the S6 and S7. If you've ever found yourself asking "what's the point of a smartwatch?", you're not alone. In fact, Huawei's CEO made the same point this week - shortly after launching his company's two new smartwatches - saying: "I am confused as to what smartwatches are for when we have smartphones." ZTE unveiled an affordable Android Wear 2.0 smartwatch with a 1.4-inch AMOLED display, priced at $192. Unfortunately, it doesn't have NFC support, which means no Android Pay. That seems like a bit of a missed opportunity. And while LG updated its first-gen Watch Urbane to Android Wear 2.0 last week, the company said the update won't be available for its second-gen model until next month. Nearly eight months after Google released Android 7.0, its long, slow rollout continues, reaching more devices this week: Google updates Nexus 6P beta testers to final build of Android 7.1.2 Android 7.1.1 now available for Nokia 6 Samsung Galaxy Note5 and Galaxy S6 edge+ get Android 7.0 on AT&T Samsung Galaxy Note5 and Galaxy S6 edge+ get Android 7.0 on Verizon Android 7.0 rolls out to Samsung Galaxy S6 and S6 edge on Sprint HTC One M9 finally gets Android 7.0 on Sprint... with February security update While the February security update reached the One M9 on Sprint, HTC rolled out the March security patches for unlocked models of that device. Wileyfox began its migration away from the now-defunct Cyanogen OS to Android 7.1.1 Nougat, starting with its Spark 2X handset. Intriguingly, Wileyfox also revealed that it's making a Windows phone, saying that "Windows is much better for security than Android". That might comes as a surprise, until you realize that Wileyfox was funded by the same company that owned UK handset brand KAZAM, which also made Windows phones, until it was "absorbed" into Wileyfox last year, although they're still both registered as separate companies. Speaking of which: Someone should probably also mention to KAZAM's directors they're overdue on filing latest Companies House paperwork https://t.co/CL7Vmyglub pic.twitter.com/eh6b9oeJ0e — Andy Weir (@gcaweir) April 10, 2017 HP's pricing for its Elite x3 Windows 10 Mobile flagship in the UK has made absolutely no sense over the last few months. In the last two months, the handset and Desk Dock have been priced at £673, then £707, £757, £702, and back to £673 again - and now, that bundle is available for £583, with a £90-off voucher code. In the US, T-Mobile has ended sales of Alcatel's Windows 10 Mobile flagship, just six months after its launch, and two months after slashing its price by a third. While Microsoft is continuing to sell the unlocked Alcatel IDOL 4S with Windows 10 for $400, Amazon is now offering it for just $284.99. Two weeks after WhartonBrooks launched crowdfunding efforts for its "most disruptive" "radical" fairly ordinary mid-range Windows 10 Mobile phone - the Cerulean Moment, priced at $299 - the Indiegogo campaign has so far reached just 2% of its $1.1 million target, with one month remaining. But WhartonBrooks is already looking to the future, planning a virtual reality headset, and four more Windows phones targeting a range of different users. That's ambitious, given how poorly the company has managed expectations so far, and how far removed the Moment is from the absurd promises and astonishing hype that WhartonBrooks generated around the device before it was finally unveiled, months later than planned. The Lumia 750 - one of several Windows phones that Microsoft cancelled when it ripped up its mobile strategy - made an appearance in an unofficial video this week. On April 25, Microsoft will release the Windows 10 Mobile Creators Update - but as feared, it won't be made available to all handsets currently supported by the OS. Microsoft confirmed on Friday that just thirteen handsets will officially receive the update, leaving many devices - including some that are still on sale today - unable to upgrade to the newest version of the OS. Those older phones will still be able to install the Creators Update via the Windows Insider Program Release Preview ring - but they will not be officially supported. Microsoft also released build 15204 for Windows 10 Mobile - its first build from the Redstone 3 development branch - but its build number is much lower than that of the latest build for PCs, raising further questions about the future of the smartphone version of the OS. Microsoft insists that the reason for the divergence in build numbers for Windows 10 Mobile compared with PCs is because it's 'converging code into OneCore', which has left many people scratching their heads. Meanwhile, Microsoft dropped key features that it announced for the Windows 10 Mobile Creators Update, and it's far from clear if they'll ever make it to devices. Indeed, with only 13 handsets supported, and its development now lagging far behind that of PCs, it's starting to look an awful lot like Windows 10 Mobile is being switched to a Windows Phone 7.8-style 'maintenance' branch, leading nowhere but a dead end. The latest Redstone 3 preview for PCs rolled out on the same day that Microsoft made its unwelcome Mobile announcement. Build 16176 is now available for PCs in the Fast ring, and you can see the fixes and known issues here. On Tuesday, Microsoft began its rollout of the Windows 10 Creators Update (developed under the Redstone 2 codename) for PCs: Overview of new features and improvements How to install the Creators Update right now A closer look at changes to privacy settings How to download and read e-books from the Windows Store in the Creators Update Windows 10 Creators Update: Microsoft Edge beats rivals in battery performance yet again Evaluation ISOs for Enterprise customers now available New firmware available for Surface Book and Surface Pro 4 running Creators Update Microsoft released updates for every version of Windows 10 this week, on PCs and phones: build 15063.138 (cumulative update for the Creators Update / Version 1703) builds 14393.1066 and 14393.1083 (Anniversary Update / Version 1607) build 10586.873 (November Update / Version 1511) build 10240.17354 (the original Windows 10 release, also known as Version 1507) Microsoft confirmed that it will officially end support for Version 1507 on May 9, 2017. Microsoft has also started blocking updates for older versions of Windows running on PCs with newer processors, as it tries to force those users to upgrade to Windows 10. Microsoft is reportedly working on a new 'Tabbed Shell' for a future Windows 10 update, which would allow users to run multiple instances of the same app in a single window, with tabs to switch between them, much like a web browser. Microsoft sent out invitations for its next big event, which will be held on May 2 in New York City. With the hashtag '#MicrosoftEDU', it seems that it may have a focus on education - but it's widely expected to also discuss its new Windows 10 Cloud edition at the event. However, it's not expected to unveil the much-anticipated Surface Pro 5 there. Microsoft is including a free Surface Dock worth $199.99 with purchases of any Surface Pro 4 tablet in the United States, including the $799 entry-level model, which has an Intel Core m3 CPU, 4GB RAM and 128GB - but no Surface Pen. Leaked images revealed a new family of Windows 10 devices on the way from Huawei... ...while HP officially announced its new range of affordable Windows 10 notebooks and convertibles, with support for Windows Hello facial recognition, and active pens. Amazon is making it easier for companies to use its microphone and voice recognition technology to build devices that use its Alexa digital assistant, by making its reference design available to hardware partners. We've known for a while that Harman Kardon is working on a new speaker powered by Microsoft's Cortana digital assistant. This week, it emerged that that device will be called the 'Invoke', and will feature Skype integration - and it seems that Microsoft may be planning to invite select Windows Insiders to provide feedback on the device. Microsoft is making it a bit easier for users to share their feedback with the company. Starting with those in the Windows Insider Fast ring, it's now adding the ability to directly share content from across the OS to the Feedback Hub, making it simpler to report issues. Last year, Microsoft shipped the Windows 10 Anniversary Update with the half-baked 'Skype Preview' app as its default communication experience. After months of development - and months of endless frustrations for its users - Microsoft finally dropped the 'Preview' tag with the rollout of the Windows 10 Creators Update. It says the new Skype app is now "ready for everyday use". The "all-new Skype app" - in reality, just the newest update of the UWP version that's been in preview on PCs and phones since last year - is now available on the Xbox One too. Microsoft said that its interface has been "redesigned to put gamers first." Microsoft is introducing "self-service refunds" for apps and games on Windows 10 and the Xbox One. On Thursday, Microsoft released the Version 1704 update to all Xbox One users, bringing numerous "fan-inspired" features to its consoles. And after offering early access to its new Xbox Game Pass for the Xbox Insider Alpha and Beta Rings, Microsoft has now expanded preview availability to Ring 3. Xbox Game Pass will offer unlimited access to over 100 games for $10 a month when it launches this spring. Microsoft's Project Scorpio dev kit was revealed on Wednesday, with a similar design to the Xbox One S. The dev kit is even more powerful than the final console will be, and has some distinctive features, including double the RAM of the production model, and an OLED display on the front. Microsoft confirmed that Project Scorpio, which it calls "the most powerful console ever", will be officially unveiled at the E3 gaming expo in June. It also revealed this week that Scorpio will support FreeSync and HDMI 2.1 Variable Refresh. Call of Duty: Black Ops II was the latest (and very welcome!) addition to the list of Xbox 360 games playable on the Xbox One through the Backward Compatibility program. Microsoft is launching an official store for "community-made goodies" in Minecraft with curated content from nine professional partners, which players will pay for with new Minecraft Coins. And this news will probably come as no surprise, given that Minecraft is pretty much everywhere else - but Microsoft is launching its blocky, world-building game on the Nintendo Switch on May 11. Perhaps the most shocking news of the week was that Nintendo has officially ended production of its wonderful NES Classic Edition console. Despite enormous demand for the retro machine, Nintendo has apparently decided that it just doesn't want your money. Perhaps this guy has the right idea: a gamer built his own tiny console that squeezes into a tin of mints, powered by the brilliant Raspberry Pi micro-computer. Check out Zelda and Donkey Kong on that dinky screen! And if you think that's cool, make sure you check out HoloLems, bringing virtual reality Lemmings to your living room! But our odyssey across the tech world ends this week as it began: with fast food. Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm off to find me some nuggs. Bonus content Before we wrap things up for another week, let me first highlight a couple of extra bits around the site that I hope you’ll enjoy reading. Rich Woods put HP's new Spectre x360 through its paces. The Windows 10 convertible device earned itself an exceptionally high score in his review, making it one of the best devices we've ever tested - thanks in no small part to its 4K display and active pen support. And Justin Luna took a trip down Memory Lane with the help of Timi Cantisano, as Microsoft terminated its extended support for Windows Vista this week. Vista was pretty, but went largely unloved, and never achieved the popularity of its successor, Windows 7. RIP. Stay tuned to Neowin in the days ahead for what’s sure to be another exciting week, filled with official news, lots of updates, and plenty of insights from around the world of technology. For now, though, there’s lots more to read across the site – including all sorts of interesting discussions over on our forums. From all of us on the Neowin team, have a great weekend!

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 125 Plus 1 on G+ 278 Share on Facebook 78 Share on Twitter Total Shares481 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 141k 106k Latest Deals 14 [Deal Alert] Get a 75" Sony LED UHD Android TV from Best Buy for $2150 today ($650 off) 2017/04/15 4:13pm PDTApr 15, 2017 19 [Deal Alert] Huawei Watch in Black Stainless Steel w/metal band $250 ($100 off) 2017/04/14 6:36pm PDTApr 14, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] 55 temporarily free and on-sale apps to round out your week 2017/04/14 12:50pm PDTApr 14, 2017 13 [Deal Alert] 2-Pack 6' Anker USB 3.0 A to C cables $12 w/ promo ($8 off) 2017/04/13 4:16pm PDTApr 13, 2017 32 [Deal Alert] NVIDIA is having a SHIELD gaming spring sale 2017/04/13 2:17pm PDTApr 13, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 125 Plus 1 on G+ 278 Share on Facebook 78 Share on Twitter Total Shares481 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 141k 106k Latest Deals 14 [Deal Alert] Get a 75" Sony LED UHD Android TV from Best Buy for $2150 today ($650 off) 2017/04/15 4:13pm PDTApr 15, 2017 19 [Deal Alert] Huawei Watch in Black Stainless Steel w/metal band $250 ($100 off) 2017/04/14 6:36pm PDTApr 14, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] 55 temporarily free and on-sale apps to round out your week 2017/04/14 12:50pm PDTApr 14, 2017 13 [Deal Alert] 2-Pack 6' Anker USB 3.0 A to C cables $12 w/ promo ($8 off) 2017/04/13 4:16pm PDTApr 13, 2017 32 [Deal Alert] NVIDIA is having a SHIELD gaming spring sale 2017/04/13 2:17pm PDTApr 13, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?

Some Pixel and Nexus fingerprint sensors not working after Android 7.1.2 update Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 12:17pm PDTApr 14, 2017 65 Plus 1 on G+ 79 Share on Facebook 73 Share on Twitter Total Shares217 Bug Watch Device Updates News Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel XL A number of Google Pixel and Nexus users are reporting that their fingerprint sensor is no longer working after the latest Android OS update. Several members of the Pixel and Nexus communities on Google's product forums have encountered the issue since installing the Android Nougat 7.1.2 OTA. The issue appears to be affecting both the Pixel and Pixel XL, as well as the LG-made Nexus 5X and Huawei Nexus 6P. Reports suggest that while the Pixel and Nexus Imprint sensors are no longer granting access to the devices, the swipe down for notifications Moves gesture is still functional. Attempts to solve the problem by deleting pre-existing fingerprints and starting from scratch haven't worked, as error messages are preventing new prints from being added to the devices. As usual, we'll update if we hear any official word from Google about the issue, hopefully regarding a fix.

Provided Google does not get the article Removed VAVAMk_2 Same thereasoner Same here with my Pixel. Suicide_Note No issues on my XL or 6P. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 6p has never given me those issues either... But it is slower than most newer scanners. Nick Which is to be expected. It's still fine. Jeff Neston By stating no problems, expect to get boot loop on your nexus 6. See the CNET article on nexus 5 and 6. Provided Google does not get the article defeated. If you do get it expect to lose all unsaved data. Then if want refund you will need to go to court. Sean Please GO AWAY....you have said this TWICE.......Its NOT the Nexus 5 and 6 Mr Brainiac....its the 5X and 6P......which are TOTALLY different than the Nexus 5 and Nexus 6. Max Same here with my XL. elav Me too. No issues on my XL.. Nicholas Matranga My Nexus 5x works just fine after the update. kalehv Sometimes my Pixel XL asks for pattern even after it recognizes my fingerprint (no, I am not talking about the first time after reboot). Rebooting the device works but why does this happen? Nathan Bryant I've also experienced this. It's random. Not so often it's a bother for me. kalehv Yup not so often with me either but being a mobile developer what bothers me is this happening, not the inconvenience it causes. Nathan Bryant That totally makes sense. I assume it's some kind of error even though it's not stating that it is. I don't see the pattern or constant of what causes it when it happens. mattcoz It does that after more than 48 hours have passed since you've last used your pattern. kalehv Nop its not that either. It does that after 4 hours I think. And it should do that only once after 4 hours but not keep doing that until you reboot. mattcoz It's definitely 48 hours, that comes straight from Google. But if it continues to do so, then that's something else. Mgamerz I've had it happen on my Nexus, it just occasionally requires a PIN. Says it's 4 hours of non usage but that doesn't seem true, sometimes I wake up and no pin and sometimes I'll be on and off the phone and it'll require a pin. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Typical. Google needs to fire some of their geniuses and hire some diligent coders, and also diligent testers for their QA department (assuming they even have one -- I sincerely doubt it). Alex Cruz Where did Google touch you? Middlefinger Oh really. Nexus/Pixel/Google error 4.453.563 this year alone. Im shocked (not really). Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Best hot steaming pile of dog s**t 2016. DragoCubed Google has been going downhill lately - at least with mobile excluding iOS. It's such a shame. They haven't exactly gone downhill haven't they? They've stayed the same SpeakethTheTruth I think you might be on to something with that last paragraph. Cause for real, quality control is out of control right now. sebastianer If fixed my 6P bad battery life and early shutdown only replacing the stock Huawei battery with other battery with different brand (no need to wipe the phone in the process...) Several people did the same and is enjoying the battery life they were having when they bought the phone more than a year ago: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3534410 You could even try a Huawei battery replacement...but they say they aren't original. I just went for another brand because of the bad experience I had with the stock battery durability I don't know in the Pixel. But in the 6P in 90% of the cases...this is just a problem of the Huawei stock battery. Kendall Gustafson “Pixel”, the word sounds like the color pink. “Pixel” sounds like a little girl’s toy. Most men would never put a phone in their pocket named “Pixel” unless they were a cross/dresser. The word “Pixel” equates to a 50% loss of market share from the male market. “Nexus”, the word does not sound female or male. “Nexus”, the word sounds like science, desirable to any man, woman, or child. “Nexus”, the word sound like domination of market share. kalehv Hahaha that made me laugh. No I do not agree. I am a Pixel owner man and I am not whatever you said they'd be if they owned one but I laughed for some reason. Christian Trevor Clauss I must be a cross dresser then :D mattcoz Real men aren't insecure about what their phones are named. Middlefinger Except that the Nexus sold poorly and was generally complete junk Van_Hammersly Most of us have exited adolescence. bonelesscheese https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9bd2ce0665c300ab872edc5e5fa1ef348b87f551cc01532d17bf41264dd126c1.jpg DragoCubed I'm so glad that you can block on disqus Bruce Wayne Google is really dropping the ball.

Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google: "It compiled with warnings but no errors. Must be ready to go." Bruce Wayne Nothing about Google or Android came up. What are you getting at? Middlefinger This isnt device specific, its a fault in Android itself. Google has become really bad lately with poor quality control. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Even Chrome is going to the dogs. Seriously, Google is staffed by a bunch of incompetent high-paid prima donnas. paxmos At least, Google is not charging an arm and a leg for their phones ;-) 2kool4skool Lol, $869 for a phone that doesn't have waterproofing, wireless charging, expandable storage, and ois is not charging an arm and leg? paxmos Didn't you see the wink? 2kool4skool Apologies, I just woke up and haven't fully recovered when I read your comment, my sarcasm detector didn't work really well that time. paxmos LOL, we're good Lindacbrewer Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

John Doe I am sure that they do test it but there are things that go wrong...obviously those bugs will be in the spotlight on an Android blog meaning in real life they are probably affecting a small number of users.

New_Guy Yep Mark Curtis What do you mean "this is how you get more Samsung"? 4Ui812 Why is Google having app many issues with the Fixel ? Sruly J Except since it's also affecting Nexus devices, this is more of a software issue in 7.1.2 than a hardware issue for Pixel devices. Defenestratus Because IIRC they use Agile software development. Agile is how you get shitty software. Lawstorant I've never thought I would say such thing, but I'm getting fed up with all the "issues" Google is facing with every update. On the Nexus 6, they went as far as to roll it back to 7.0. They should really step up their game especially if, they are fully responsible for every aspect of the device from now on. EvilHowl No issues on my 5X wade_county I thought these Pixels weren't supposed to be beta products? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They aren't. They're outrageously expensive alpha products. And they even have one defect (halo-cam) that can't be fixed in software. Still the best steaming pile of dog s**t of 2016, though. Everyone should buy one. Everyone who likes dog s**t anyway. Apparently people do, since HTC has shipped 2 million since launch. Kougeru I bad a Pixel for a week and took dozens of photos with no halo Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good for you. Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of 22 Pixel pictures had halos. None of the 22 G6 pictures had halos. They were all pictures of the same things, obviously with the same lighting. Google admits it's a design defect. If Google admits it, it's kind of hard to pretend it doesn't exist. whispy_snippet No one denies it's an issue. But what you seem incapable of accepting is it's a very minor issue that only very rarely rears its head. If you actively try to shoot an image with a strong light source angled towards the sensor (something you generally don't do because it often results in a poor shot on any camera) you might experience a halo effect. Might. But I've got literally hundreds of photos taken with my Pixel with no halos. You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want to fuel your juvenile rage fits. But people who actually use a Pixel every day don't seem to have a problem worth caring about. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It has nothing to do with a strong light source angled toward the sensor. That's normal lens flare. The Pixel halos are NOT normal lens flare. Like I said 4 out of 22 pictures. That's 18% of the pictures they took, and they didn't have strong light sources angled toward the sensor. 18% is not a rare problem, especially when the G6 NEVER had halos with the same exact pictures. Google admitted it's a flaw. Get over yourself and stop trying to justify it. whispy_snippet And like I said, I've taken hundreds of pictures and have seen a halo perhaps a couple of times. And I take a lot of photos given video and photography is my day job - indeed one of the reasons I chose the Pixel is because I wanted the best phone camera available for the times I don't have my proper gear with me. I've seen countless comparisons between the Pixel, iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 edge and while they're all great, in most situations the Pixel takes what I consider the better shot. You're making mountains out of molehills and carrying on like a right twat in the process. P. Sherman ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE DOESN'T MEAN JACKS--- if in scientific tests under controlled environments and the same conditions, the Pixel produced the halo effect, which Google has acknowledged to be a design deficiency standard on LITERALLY EVERY PIXEL MADE, but other cameras feature no such halo effect. FFS whispy_snippet I'm not denying there's an issue! I'm saying it's being blown out of proportion by people who want to blow it out of proportion. P. Sherman Referencing a scientific, controlled test and camera comparison is NOT blowing this out of proportion. Blowing out of proportion would be something how the Wall Street Journal set out to destroy PewDiePie for boneheadedly saying "Death to all Jews" as a joke. But referencing a camera comparison in exactly the same conditions and one phone had a halo effect but the other didn't is science, fact, nothing to blow out of proportion there. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good luck arguing with a Google fanboy in deep denial. thereasoner He's actually making solid points, the Pixels do have the best cameras overall​ and all smartphone cameras have some issues. whispy_snippet No, no. I'm a fanboy! Get it right! Cecil Hardwood Are you sure the Pixel has the best camera ? The reason I ask is because the DxOMark site that claims this refuses to release the iPhone 7 Plus (Not iPhone 7) scores and many believe it is because it scored higher than the Pixel. The theory goes on to say that Google is using their score in their advertising and DxO doesn't want to piss off Google. Something weird is going on for sure. DxO claimed long ago the review was coming soon and should have been out by now with the iPhone 7 Plus having been on the market as long as it has. thereasoner If I'm to make a judgment personally then I would say that probably the top 3-4 cameras on flagships are very close and what's best as far as the user is concerned is subjective. Do you prefer low light performance(I do) or digital zoom? Do your favour widespread angle lens or fast launch/focus etc. Those are personal preferences that make "the best " phone different for different people. That said, as far as reviews are concerned the Pixel is generally considered the best over all. As far as your conspiracy theories go, who knows? Anyone can create those about anything but I guess but I'm thinking that other than digital zoom and an artsy photo effect the 7+ cameras are very similar to the 7. whispy_snippet The iPhone 7 Plus is the same as the iPhone 7 apart from an additional, slower lens. In terms of raw image quality the iPhone 7 Plus achieves its best results with the lens it shares with its smaller sibling. So basically, it'll score no better than the 7. It's effectively already been tested. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All smartphone cameras have some issues? What issues does the G6 camera have in the comparison I linked? 23% of the Pixel photos have halo issues. Find a serious issue with 23% of the G6 photos and get back to us. thereasoner Keep in mind that if you take wide-angle shots, angles will be distorted and elongated from the side, especially when it comes to selfies with the front-facing camera. I also found that the front-facing camera takes relatively muddy shots in low-light. Compared to the Pixel XL, OnePlus 3T and (for the time being since we don't have the S8) the Galaxy S7, the G6 is on par with its rivals. The Pixel XL takes superior low-light images than all the phones though, and I prefer the richer contrast and saturation of the S7 by just a tad. -CNET There are a ton of reviews from various sources just like this and while the G6 cameras are considered very nice they do have their shortcomings and generally rank below the Pixel cameras overall. whispy_snippet Purple flaring and chromatic aberation. It's extremely noticeable in at least four images you shared with the Pixel comparison. Here you are: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration And just Google search purple flaring. Sorry to burst your bubble. whispy_snippet Show me the link to the test. I would like to see it. Even if their results suggest there's an issue (which there is as we all agree), the significance of the results can still be blown out of proportion which is what we're seeing occur in this ridiculous discussion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Here you go again. phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ Now that I've viewed the pics again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. Two involve a bright light. The other 3 do not. So that's 23% of 22 pictures. I wouldn't say that's blowing things out of proportion. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. Yeah, you paid a lot for your Pixel, so you have a hard time admitting it's a steaming pile of dog s**t. I understand. whispy_snippet Yep, so as we've agreed, halos sometimes appear in shots with strong light sources pointing at or angled towards the edge of the sensor. But let's just ignore the purple flaring and chromatic aberation in at least four of the images from the LG, right? You're demonstrating selective criticism. Every camera has strengths and weaknesses but on balance, the Pixel offers better images than competing phones more often than not. My position is unchanged. You're both making mountains out of molehills, and in no way does this "scientific" test guarantee that 23% of photos taken with a Pixel will exhibit a halo. It simply shows 23% of photos taken in this example demonstrated halos. You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. No one ever said the Pixel is perfect. But only you two are using ridiculous, extreme labels like "steaming pile of dog shit" and "HARDWARE DEFICIENCY" as though using capital letters makes your odd ball assertions more valid. Most reputable tech reviewers agree the Pixel has the best overall smartphone camera. You're entitled to disagree. P. Sherman 4/22. 4/22 photos from the Pixel have a halo effect. That's from Phandroid. That's 18% of photos the Pixel. That alone is damning. Google themselves have acknowledged that it is a HARDWARE DEFICIENCY and software fixes have done little to address this. They admitted it was there, that's all we need. If you knew that 4/22 Burritos Chipotle made would give you the Runs, but ZERO/22 Burritos Taco Bell made would, would YOU still choose to eat at Chipotle? whispy_snippet Show me the test! I've asked twice now. P. Sherman Lena Flare was removed from the photos, but not the video. http://highonandroid.com/android-smartphone-news/the-truth-about-google-pixel-camera-halolens-flare-effect/ Also, someone in the official Google forums shot with their Pixel and Nexus 6P in the same Time, conditions, everything. Guess what? https://support.google.com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsrROqMaXHqHg/?hl=by Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ 3 halos are obvious, 1 is subtle. The subtle one is where the picture is looking up at a building's windows. Now that I've viewed them again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. tigerstown I paid $380 for my new pixel XL so it's not a lot and I have no Halo in my pics I have proven this on Twitter already. abc More fanboy logic. I took pictures so everything is fine. Anyone who says its not fine is crazy. whispy_snippet How ridiculous. So a blogger takes 22 photos in various conditions and his experience is valid, but my experience of owning the phone and taking hundreds of photos in various conditions is not valid. You guys are weirdos. Andy But do you see problems with low light pics. I do on my wife's pixel. IPhone Looks so much better. I'm so disappointed abc I saw a rainbow once. Oh, are we not just conveying pointless ancedotes? mr.fozzo On my Nex6P, I have noticed that the Fingerprint reader has been less reliable lately. It requires more presses than the usual 1 press. Besnik Rrustemi My Nexus 6P working excellent so far, no battery problems, no fingerprint problems (better standby times on 7.1.2 to be honest). But yes,i can agree that fingerprint was much faster when i first got the device on 6.0 Marshmallow (for unlocking the device with the fingerprint) now it takes like 2 full seconds for that :( jimv1983 No issues on my Nexus 5X and the swipe on the sensor to bring down the notification panel is great. Alex Harrison Flashed the OTA myself on my 5X. No issues with it. Jeff Neston At least it is just the sensor. My nexus 5 was bricked by a Google update.. it got the boot loop. Google support lied to me claiming I broke the power button. False it was not broken. I ended up going small claims case against Google. They settled, but wanted me to sign gag order. Sorry, no way. I sent it back and got complete refund. Sneaky company. What probably causes boot loop update to occur is phone on long time. Some apps get memory leak over time. System then unpredictably unstable. Then the system does auto uplate from Google without asking user NOR even rebooting or turning off prior to the update. Then during update, Os gets corrupted. Then after failed update phone reboots thinking the. Update completed. Now phones dead. And Google not bother to address the issue. Pdiddy187 My 5x fingerprint sensor was great until it bootlooped yesterday morning. LG is going to repair it under warranty even though it's well out of warranty. La Kiesha Rodriguez Barrientes I have the ZTE axon 7 and over a month now google hasn't addressed a fix for the play store not loading apps over data or Wi-Fi.. Without uninstalling updates to play store and then maybe will not say "waiting for network" so frustrating and then maybe download once and have to do that everytime.. Dumb.. P. Sherman That's been like that since KitKat. F------ KITKAT. ahnafm Is google reacommodating their customers now? Brett Delia I thought some positive feedback was worth being added. My Nexus 6P is working perfectly after the update. I've had generally a great experience with all my Android phones. I've had an iPhone as well as a Windows mobile phone as well in my past. None have been as feature packed as my Android devices. New_Guy This and all the other ridiculous issues with the Pixel is a big reason I stick with Samsung... flyonthewall Lol Fernando S Mine is working ok in my Nexus 5x running 7.1.2. It just failed once while I was on 7.1.1 and with a soft reset it came back to life Hank Is that a real screenshot in the story? Enrollment spelled wrong twice. SMH. ThisGuyFUX This is now icing on top of the cake, for anyone whom has enjoyed watching this crash and burn. If I paid $850+ for a Pixel, I'd be pursuing class action litigation by now. Slow clap. Sean Except its only affecting about 1% of the Pixels sold.........so......slow clap for you....... 2kool4skool It's gonna be sucks when you're in the 1%. And I doubt it's 1% anyway, this is probably the 20th article I've read about pixel's problems. That's alot. Probably more like 5%. abc Fortunately, not many Pixels have been sold so not many people are affected. Brian White Nexus 5x, running fine here ddevito If it wasn't for my OnePlus 3 I'd be on an iPhone. thereasoner One plus has their own issues/lousy support and the iPhone? They're the worst of them all when it comes to buggy software and hardware issues bricking devices ! ddevito Not sure I'd agree with you. My iPhone 6s hums along swimmingly without any issues. The more I use it the more I am leaning towards going back to an iPhone full-time. Apple, love them or hate them, knows how to deliver products, and support them. Period. thereasoner I'm glad that your iPhone 6s isn't affected by the many flawed updates and hardware issues​ that have plagued various iPhones over the years but the fact remains that Apple has faced class action lawsuits filed by their own customers for serious issues like Touch Disease and error 53 and for good reason. They have the worst track record of them all and to make things worse they're known for both ignoring iPhone issues until said class action lawsuits are launched and/or blaming their customers for the iPhone hardware/software problems. BTW, my Pixel "hums along swimmingly" as well, that doesn't mean issues with the Pixel don't exist much less those far more serious issues found on iPhones ! MisterKraky I'm not having the fingerprint sensor issue myself, but after updating to 7.1.2, I can no longer install or update any apps! On a Verizon-issued Pixel here. Đức Thành What happened to all the testing, Google? It seems they have become too reliant on using Nexus users for beta-testing and now can't seem to do a proper job on their own. Get your grips together, Android team. Rob H. Nougat is such a half baked disaster of an OS. It's ruined my N6. Marshmallow was soon much more stable. Thanks google keep breaking phones. jacob Cant even spell enrolment correctly. Enrollment...... PoisonApple31 Don't forget your apostrophe! Makes you look stupid when you are talking about spelling.

Rakesh There is a known bug that after you unlock your phone the fingerprint sensor won't work for gestures - swipe down. There is no workaround for it so far other than to just press once and then it will start working. Adam Margeson Not sure what you're talking about. Doesn't seem to affect my Pixel. dontsh00tmesanta Guess I'm a lucky one mine is ok abc Premium bugs for your "premium" Pixel. mike shwilly No issues here. Not using fingerprint sensor at all though.

It shouldn't be this way Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'm waiting for the Note 8, but I am seriously considering switching to iPhone, instead. I'm really tired of Google's crap. squiddy20 Annnnnd this is why I have auto-updates disabled on my PIxel. That, and I have it rooted. Andy Got my wife the pixel because she wanted a great camera. Consistently her friends iPhone 6 and 7s look better in low light. Its very frustrating. Makes me look like an idiot paying all this money. Outside the pictures look amazing. But I'm disappointed in indoor pics Stevo I have the same issue!! It happened as soon as I updated my stock Nexus 6P to 7.1.2. I've called Google Fi for support and they were NO help other than trying to sell me an "upgrade" to the Pixel and FULL price?!? They also said that they haven't had harly any other complaints with this issue. Thanks for nothing Google! I've did a soft rest then a complete reset with no luck. I've heard that people have had success with down grading to 7.1.1. or flashing a custom ROM. trapchan Where're Google apologists when you need them? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Maybe they're beginning to face reality. flyonthewall WTF Google flyonthewall To the Apple fanboys here.

The only thing better than beating expectations is beating them and adding some positive forward guidance for the second quarter and/or the full year. We screened some recent reports from our Wall Street research database and some recent 24/7 Wall St. posts for companies that top analysts on Wall Street think are the candidates to beat expectations. These stocks make good sense for growth portfolios that have some risk tolerance. Here are 10 companies that may beat earnings expectations Alphabet The search giant continues to expand and is even working on a driverless car now. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL) is a global technology company focused around key areas, such as search, advertising, operating systems and platforms, enterprise and hardware products. It generates revenue primarily by delivering online advertising and by selling apps and contents on Google Play, as well as hardware products. The company provides its products and services in more than 100 languages and in 190 countries, regions and territories. Alphabet offers performance and brand advertising services. It operates through Google and Other Bets segments. The Google segment includes principal internet products, such as Search, Ads, Commerce, Maps, YouTube, Apps, Cloud, Android, Chrome and Google Play, as well as technical infrastructure and newer efforts, such as virtual reality. Merrill Lynch is above Wall Street estimates on this technology giant. The Merrill Lynch price target for the stock is $1,025, and the Wall Street consensus price objective is $965.81 The shares traded Thursday at $842.70. CME This company had a record 2016, and 2017 looks very promising as well. CME Group Inc.

Trump’s approval rating has ticked up from three in 10 people approving of Donald Trump, to just under four in 10 people with 39 percent approval rating for Trump reports the Washington Post. Additionally, Google searches for the phrase “World War III” have also seen a dramatic surge in recent days in light of the many international conflicts Donald Trump is currently involved in, in North Korea, South Korea, Afghanistan, and Syria. The Washington Post notes that the slight uptick in Trump’s approval rating today is likely due to the confirmation of his Supreme Court pick Neil Gorsuch, as well as his use of military action abroad. But with a surge in Google searches for the term “World War III” all across the globe, clearly many, particularly Koreans, are concerned what will be the next move of Donald Trump. [Image by Ahn Young-joon/AP Images] South Koreans have been protesting Donald Trump in recent days, with signs that read “Crazy Trump.” Americans polled in the Marist College poll are giving Donald Trump an approval rating of 39 percent today. That is up slightly by two points from last week. But Koreans are not the only ones expressing dissatisfaction in how Donald Trump is handling foreign policy, says Lee Miringoff the director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion. “As tensions mount, President Trump is facing a critical test as Commander in Chief. Instead of a rally around the flag effect, Americans are still looking for President Trump to provide leadership and more careful planning to arrive at sound policies.” In the new Trump approval rating poll, 39 percent approve of Trump’s job performance with 49 percent disapproving. Fifty-four percent of voters say they have an unfavorable opinion of the president and 38 percent view him favorably. Forty percent say they approve of what he is doing overseas, and 49 percent say they disapprove. [Image by Ahn Young-joon/AP Images] But 70 percent of voters have noticed the tensions around the world are rising. The majority of Americans in the poll at 55 percent say they do not trust Donald Trump to do the right thing when it comes to war or international affairs. Fifty-eight percent said they had “little or no trust” that he knows what to do in an international crisis. Fifty-five percent said they did not think he was able to come up with sound strategies in the face of war or an international crisis. Also, 54 percent said they do not think he is a good leader, and 52 percent said they do not believe he is able to keep America safe. As far as Syria is concerned, 60 percent said Trump didn’t know what he was doing or did not have a “clear idea” with his Syria intentions. But 58 percent did support his air strikes in Syria. The Washington Post notes that although there is a slight uptick in Trump’s approval rating today, it still “remains dreadful by historical standards.” Gallup puts Trump approval at 40 percent approving, and Real Clear Politics has Trump’s approval rating at 41.4 percent. The Washington Post says it is highly unlikely due to Trump’s polarizing nature that he will ever go past his 46.1 percent approval rating he saw right after the election. It has been noted that Trump is losing his base slowly, with the hashtag #TrumpRegrets picking up steam since the election, as Trump voters express their disappointment over his various policy initiatives and broken promises. I'm not going to make excuses! The golfing is wrong. Trump is a hypocrite now. This is a time of crisis and he's golfing #trumpregrets — Deplorable Dani ???????? (@DeplorableDani2) April 14, 2017 The Washington Post also notes that Trump is still at risk of losing “Main Street” Republicans, as he has been unable to deliver on the GOP agenda of health care and tax care reform. [Image by Ahn Young-joon/AP Images] The slight uptick in all polls is attributed to his moves in Syria, and his Supreme Court pick. But Americans are still very concerned about what is happening abroad at a much larger global level. The Daily Mail is reporting that Google searches for the term “World War III” have seen a dramatic spike in recent days, a bigger spike than Google has seen in years. This trend is being seen as warships move from the coast of North Korea and are being pointed at Syria. Google Data with Google Trends shows that people across the globe are becoming intrinsically concerned with the thought of World War III, despite Trump’s approval ratings. The Daily Mail says that searches for World War III in the search engines have hit their highest level since 2004. Other relevant searches seeing an increase are “nuclear war” and “war” being viewed as the “highest level since the start of the year.” Related terms that Google offers when using Google trends are “Trump war” and “Syria war” which are also seeing an increase in searches. [Image by Ahn Young-joon/AP Images] After Trump’s air strikes in Syria, he sent Carrier Strike Group One to the Korean peninsula, prompting concern from Korean president Kim Jong-un who called the move “reckless.” Trump responded with a historical move, responding to the Supreme Leader Kim Jong-un by tweet, saying he was “looking for trouble.” China is responding to the global crisis. Chinese Premier Xi Jinping has moved 150,000 troops to the border of north Korea anticipating a flood of refugees if Trump strikes North Korea. America has also sent troops to the borders for the same reason. Americans have not been searching for these war terms since 2006 when North Korea was performing long-range missile tests. Shaun King of the New York Daily News writes of the concerns of the rising tensions. “Now he is tweeting threats to North Korea…That tweet, from an American President, is being treated not like a rogue comment from an immoral, inexperienced reality TV star – which it is – but like an official statement from a man holding the highest office in the world. The fallout has been swift and scary.” As Shaun King notes, China is already warning that North Korea will pay the price for these actions. Wang Yi, China’s Foreign Minister has said, “If a war occurs, the result is a situation in which everybody loses and there can be no winner.” BREAKING: North Korea's vice foreign minister says President Trump is "making trouble" with "aggressive" tweets. — The Associated Press (@AP) April 14, 2017 @AP If only someone had warned us… pic.twitter.com/OenEEZrIZ2 — Adam Khan (@Khanoisseur) April 15, 2017 North Korea’s foreign minister has also issued a statement saying that Trump is “making trouble with his aggressive tweets.” As Adam Kahn notes, this is precisely what Hillary Clinton was talking about during the campaign when she said, “A man you can bait with a tweet is not a man we can trust with nuclear weapons.” Now, those concerns are springing to life just three months after the election. Although Donald Trump’s approval rating today has taken a slight uptick since the Supreme Court confirmation, it is not good that world leaders are disapproving of him and calling him “reckless,” and that Google searches for “World War III” have gone up in the same week.

In an interview with Radio Sputnik, political expert Alexei Mukhin explained what could be behind the growing interest in the issue. It turned out that the residents of countries such as the Philippines, Australia and New Zealand are worried about this topic most of all. According to Mukhin, this is not surprising. "Have you ever heard of the Australian or New Zealand armed forces? I haven't either. I believe that this is the reason behind the concern of the peaceful inhabitants of these countries: they suddenly feel completely unprotected," the expert said. © REUTERS/ Goran Tomasevic/Files 'World War 3' Trending as Global Tensions EscalateThe data analyzed from Google Trends shows that people have been obsessed with the idea of a worldwide conflict escalating in recent days. According to Google Trends, internet users have been typing the phrase "World War 3" so many times that it has broken a historic record. In Mukhin's opinion, the United States played a crucial role in fueling the WWIII hysteria. "For many years, the US has been presenting itself as a guarantor of freedom, an example of a global conscience and an exceptional nation. I am quoting here American presidents and their representatives. And now, it decided to suddenly drop a giant bomb on Afghanistan, launch missile strikes on a Syrian base and directly threaten a sovereign state with an "armada." This behavior, of course, caused a surge of emotions in those countries that unconditionally believed in the peace-loving nature of the United States, and now they are extremely disappointed," Mukhin said. US President Donald Trump said Tuesday that an "armada" was sailing toward North Korea in a show of force. The move came after Pyongyang stepped up its military efforts, carrying out a series of missile tests and pledging to conduct its sixth nuclear test. "We are sending an armada. Very powerful. We have submarines. Very powerful. Far more powerful than the aircraft carrier. That I can tell you," Trump told Fox Business Network. This week, the Pentagon also dropped the largest conventional bomb ever used in combat, targeting Daesh tunnels in Afghanistan, presumably aimed at sending a warning message to Damascus, Pyongyang and Russia. However, according to the expert, in this context the justifications of US actions by alleged "Russian aggression" do not work anymore. "The statements about Russian aggression have caused nervous laughter and irritation in Europe, in the Middle East and in Asian countries over the last months. The information weapon that was directed against Russia worked against the initiators of this thesis," Mukhin concluded. ...

(© FlaglerLive) If you want to get to the Flagler County Sheriff’s Office’s website, don’t use Google. All Sheriff’s Office links on Google have been compromised, leading clicks to porn sites, malware- and click-bait infested sites, some of which will freeze your browser and seek to scare you into taking actions that would only make matters worse. The problem developed in the past 24 hours, and affects (and infects) Google exclusively: the sheriff’s office’s website itself is clean, as are searches for the sheriff’s office through any other search engine, including Bing, DuckDuckGo, Dogpile, Yandex and Yahoo. “The vulnerability is not with the sheriff’s office or our url, the vulnerability is with Google,” Sheriff’s spokesman Mark Strobridge said Saturday morning. But sheriff’s officials are at a loss as to why the hacking at Google’s end is taking place. Whether it is, in fact, accurate that the sheriff’s office’s website has nothing to do with it is open to question: the site may be the victim of a hacker through what’s called a “conditional redirect,” which means that malware that has somehow managed to infect the sheriff’s website is telling any click coming from Google–by far the most popular search engine on the planet-too then redirect to the bad sites. When the sheriff’s site is analyzed through Redleg, a freely available web-based scanner for malicious redirects, it reveals “some terms that are commonly used in spam hacks,” including “a number of terms, cialis, generic, viagra, milf, porn, that are common terms found in spam hacks.” A scan using a “user agent Googlebot” reveals large amounts of spam content embedded inside the site, and made up of massive amounts of malevolent catchwords. The scan also reveals that when the request for the sheriff’s website is typed into Google, the location returned is not the sheriff’s url. The scan reveals one of the urls that users are misdirected to: http://www.clicksgear.com/ (do not go to that site.) Other malware, porn and clickbait sites the Google links redirect to include: Mediawhirl.net, privacysearchplus.com, pornmia.com, clicksgear.com, xxxjojo.com, stopcrawlingclub.com. Again, do not go to those sites if you’d rather avoid infection. All of which suggests–but does not confirm–that the issue may be deep inside the sheriff’s servers rather than on Google’s end, and that an underlined statement in a sheriff’s release issued this morning (“The Flagler Sheriff’s website has not been hacked”) may at least be premature: the source of the hacking has not been determined. The sheriff’s information technology issues are handled by the county administration, through the office of IT Director Jarrod Shupe, who said this morning that from his end it still appears to be a Google issue rather than an internal issue. “On the internal page we’ve ran internal scans, everything turned out fine,” Shupe said. He’s been in contact with Google, electronically–as there is no way to reach Google personnel in person–and with Go Daddy, which hosts the servers. Shupe took down the site for two hours Friday to test whether the links would still go to malware site. They did, which would indicate that the links are not calling on malware inside the site to end up where they do (though that does not necessarily account for caching issues, which prolongs the life and behavior of links.) Shupe has been in contact with the Sheriff’s Office Friday, when the problem was discovered. “We don’t have the option either, unfortunately, of not having our url removed from their search engine,” Strobridge said. “Unfortunately, we’re not in control of what Google does.” Google is no longer indexing the sheriff’s website normally. That is, the sheriff’s home page does not even appear in the search engine’s first page when the words “Flagler County Sheriff’s Office” are searched for, nor does the page offer up a home page with the usual menu of subpages, as with a normally indexed website. That may suggest that Google indexing of the sheriff’s site may have stopped or been suspended, which sometimes happens when the search engine decides–for a variety of reasons–to “blacklist” the site, which at times happens when a site is considered compromised. That’s not necessarily what took place with the sheriff’s site: understanding how and why Google does what it does is more often a hair-raising guessing game than a science. That’s precisely what hackers exploit. Recommend or share: Tweet Print More Email Share on Tumblr Questions? Corrections? Suggestions?

What happens when you have more than one Google Home? Chaos. Paul Quinn Follow View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:22am PDTApr 14, 2017 28 Plus 1 on G+ 95 Share on Facebook 62 Share on Twitter Total Shares185 Editorials Google Home The Amazon Echo was my pacifier as I waited for Google’s entry into the home assistant space. Setting my Google Play Music library aside, I suffered through using Amazon’s attempt at a music service devoid of most of my own library. I connected my Google Calendar to Alexa and it offered a glimpse into my future relationship with Google’s assistant. Finally, in early November, I could get my hands on a new Google Home. I had pre-ordered from Google and then discovered I could pick one up at my local Best Buy. The very morning it hit the shelves, I immediately bought one. I brought it home, set it up in the family room and eagerly asked – “OK Google, play my morning hits playlist.” Without skipping a beat, she announced the list and the room filled with my music. The key point here – it was music from MY library. I didn’t cancel that Google pre-order. It was on its way. I figured I could listen to music in my bedroom as well. But – what about the other rooms in my house? What about the smart lights, smart switches, clever irrigation controller, and intelligent thermostat scattered throughout? I need a Google Home in every room to live the dream of a voice controlled home! I bought four more. My home is outfitted with six Google Home devices. There’s one in every room. I can control my smart home with my voice from anywhere I stand. I can spread music into any room. I can turn on, dim, and turn off lights in various rooms with just my voice. It’s as close as I can get to living on the Enterprise. Google's vision of the future with Google Home. Well, one Home. That’s the dream. Unfortunately, it isn’t a reality (yet). Google has failed at a key feature that it so proudly spoke of that morning in May. The nice lady living inside each Home is often unable to tell if you are talking to her or her sister in the neighboring room. It can result in some frustrating, sometimes comical, exchanges. It is amazing how well the little air freshener shaped unit can hear you from several rooms away. With multiple Homes, you’ll find yourself making requests and getting responses from two of them. It usually involves one of them, not necessarily the one closest to you, executing the request and the other apologizing to you that it can’t. From my bedroom in the morning, I might ask how long it will take to get to work and hear the detailed response in the distance from the kitchen. There will be times when the Home in front of me fulfills my request and another will rattle off from down the hall. You also have the ghosts. I never thought my home might be haunted - until now. There will be times when I turn off the TV, hang up on a call, or just walk out of the bathroom and hear something in another room. I’ll find a Google Home playing music or a podcast that I don’t listen to in a randomly selected room. Who asked to listen to opera at low volume in the guest room? Ghosts. There isn’t a constant circus of home assistants chiming in from all over the house. The closest Home does respond properly more than half of the time. However, I have found myself at times leaning over and almost whispering to a Google Home when I want to be sure the others don’t hear. There is talk of multiuser support coming soon, but it remains to be seen if this will improve its ability to identify which Home I am talking to. For now, I must look like a fool. I am whispering to an air freshener because I don’t want the others to hear. Creepy? Maybe. Tags editorial google home google home app google home fail video subscribe ...

Carson Saldanha Hi David Sean Thomas Hey Paul next time you're buying expensive accessories for every room in your house can you just throw me a hundo instead? Thanks! Sean Thomas Seems like something I would say. Paul Quinn I asked my office Home to get on that. The one in the kitchen responded. She can't do it but she's learning. Christopher Young I can completely sympathize with you. I have two Google Homes in my small apartment (living room/bedroom), and they frequently get confused where I'm at. I want to play music in the bedroom? Nope, the cozy jazz station starts blaring in the living room. There is one awesome benefit of having two Google Homes: I can fill my entire apartment with music with only a few words. dcdttu I hope Google Home gets a lot of support from Google itself and doesn't turn out to be a Hangouts. Or a Wave. Or a Nexus Player. Or a Nexus Q. Or a Google Reader. Or a tablet of any kind. Oh and hi Paul! Paul Quinn HI! Yeah, I'm worried that they will jump ship because they can't figure out a way to monetize it. No ads. If it starts playing ads, Home is moving out. The Echo doesn't really have a monetization angle except that you can shop on Amazon. Google added Google Express to the Home. But really? I'm not shopping on one of these things (yet). Lateef Alabi-Oki I thought the monetization was making money off selling the hardware. Paul Quinn They also need to keep expanding the ecosystem and product functionality which takes work that costs money. I don't know if that one time purchase price covers all that in the long run. Lord Argyris I think what Google is banking on is that if a user has one or more Homes, it makes them that much more likely to stick with the Android ecosystem in general, which means all Google's already existing means of getting money are a bit more secure from such a user switching over to the big "A". Of course it remains to be seen whether or not this is effective. Dk Schlösser The monetization is in the services offered by Google Paul Quinn I don't know what service I access through the Home makes Google any money, short of using it to buy things on Google Express. It does produce a little more profiling information but I doubt that it's enough to pay for the ongoing development. Ryan I think its all about search and locking you into their services, just like the chromecast. Because of chromecast (and now google home) I am more locked into Google Music. I am more locked into Youtube, Play Movies, searching on Google, etc. Just like Android. The specific device/service doesnt have to make money, its a "loss leader" to drive you to their other, profitable services. A very common thing in almost any consumer industry. Lars Jeppesen Precisely. I'm ditching Sonos in favor of Chromecast Audio, only because of my GH fluffthebunny The monetization is off selling all the data gleaned by your six devices listening to your every word. You have become one with the Home. You have been assimilated. Joshed The horror of ordering an item in the kitchen only to find the bedroom and office made duplicate orders. skitchbeatz I've got an open concept, one in the kitchen and one in the living room. They fight over responding and sometimes both respond. It's frustrating. I've thought about moving one of them up or down a floor. It's half implemented. It doesn't make sense because the assistant on the phone will sometimes read "answering on another device. Artem Russakovskii I have 4 Google Homes (2 in nearby areas where they can both hear me at the same time - kitchen and living room), 2 Alexas (though both Alexas can't hear me at the same time), and I can confirm - combined with multiple phones on family members, it's a mess. Let alone Home kicks in and starts talking once a day or so when not asked (doesn't happen nearly as often with Alexa). LithiumFox Never had that happen with ours... givitumibeybi 4 google homes and 2 alexas?? Artem, I think you might have some issues. Artem Russakovskii No, I just have more than one room. Dk Schlösser Change the trigger word for your Alexas Nick After my experiences with Amazon Echo, I have felt that these type of products are not ready for prime time. It's a cool concept, but these little, quirky issues that pop up with these "Home Assistants" suggest otherwise. Perhaps I'm more security minded than other people, but these sort of IoT products are ripe for security issues as well and the combination of these things has me totally turned off to the current market. Tony T. If you have multiple Homes, can you ask Google to play music and have all of them play the same music in sync? Defenestratus yes. Ed G You can have all of them play music like a Sonos. Also will link with Chromecast Audio. trickytree1984 Will it link to chrome cast proper? Joshua Pritt no, you can't group Chromecast video devices, only audio. Joshed This sucks. I don't see why they cant give older chromecast devices this feature. Paul Quinn Yes, you can create groups. For example, I have a group named "Front of the house" that connects three of them. You're best bet is to name them things that roll of the tongue like, "Hey Google, play my 90's hits playlist on the front of the house." Defenestratus I've got three homes, and I don't have this issue at all. Of course they're all on different floors and I live in a rather open-floor plan home so there's that. I've never had it come on as a ghost... ever. Chris You spent over 800 on google homes?!?! Omg man what kinda bank you making. That is insanity. Or no savings? I mean a financially responsible person cannot spend that much unless their income is huge haha. Defenestratus Yesterday I spent $1000 on a shower fixture (Moen U) David Ruddock OMG YOU ACTUALLY BOUGHT ONE OF THOSE? Defenestratus My wife saw it on "I want that" on DIY network and, well, yeah. We're about to start a master suite renovation so it was the perfect opportunity. For her, the hardest part of the day is getting up out of bed and waiting for the shower to heat up, getting cold in the process (she could get cold in the middle of equatorial guinea and we live in the North East US) so when she saw that she could turn the shower on from bed and it would alert her when it was ready for her, it was a done deal. I'm actually thinking of making a google assistant handler for it when it shows up. Chris Damn dude! How much do you make?? I see all these cool things and want them but I decide my money is better sitting in my savings account or the stock market. Defenestratus I specialize in software that is used for pharmaceutical research and clinical trials. I make a good living. Oh and my wife's a doctor. Chris Ah definitely. That's awesome dude. I work at a vaccine start up so hopefully we'll get a product past the FDA then I can buy 1k showers ;) Defenestratus Very cool. My company does a lot of work on vaccine studies. Best of luck. You have a long 12-14 years of approval process ahead of you! goodnightmare "Ok Moen...." Doesn't have quite the same ring to it. Paul Quinn The timing was right. I got three of them for $100 apiece using Visa Checkout and some helpful friends. Chris That's good dude. I haven't been able to convince myself to get one yet. I don't listen to music at home and not really sure what else I'd use it for. I did get a nest recently but still I don't mind pulling out my phone to change the temp. Paul Quinn I have an Ecobee now. My Nest kept thinking I was away because I didn't walk down that hallway enough. The Ecobee has remote sensors. Unfortunately, the Home currently does not have a direct integration with Home. I'm using IFTTT. Lawstorant Is it that hard to check which Home is the closest, based on the loudness of one's speech? Paul Quinn It might be that Google focused on their ability to hear your voice based on having one Home. If you have one, you want it to be able to hear you from a distance. That will backfire when you introduce more of them. They are all listening too well. Mace Moneta It could probably be resolved easily, by having the Google Homes reduce sensitivity of the mic, based upon the number of Google Home's on the network. Paul Quinn I had two Echos when they announced improved far-field functionality. I tested it at the time and it was working better. I didn't do any long term testing because I switched to the Home. With that in mind, Amazon was able to improve the situation with a software update so I agree that Google should have fixed this by now. Lawstorant Well, it's still Google. They have the money and the manpower to overcome such "hurdles". Why is it that more often than not, they seem like a small start-up composed of fresh out-of -college programmers. Nigel Antonio lol I thought I was the only one with that problem... Jesse Corbett So I have 2, one that covers the bedroom/bathroom half of my apartment and on that covers the kitchen/dining/living room section. I have never had an issue with both responding, if I may share my anecdote. However, I frequently am sitting 10 feet from the living room Home and hear my bedroom Home respond, despite being further away, in another room, down a hallway, with the first between me and it. I don't understand. Michael Stiffler Haha, I've had to whisper to my phone if I don't want her (Home) to hear! Aleem Kanji I think it's time to admit that Google is really screwing the pooch here. Nexus hardware failures, Pixel issues, Google Homes not living up to the hype, constant beta-feel to their products... I have a Nexus 6P, two Google Homes, and I'm all-in on Google services, but... for fuck's sake, I'm thinking of jumping ship entirely. Even Android news sites are seeming to be whole-heartedly disappointed with Google and the growing lack of positivity is disheartening. Google either needs to put up and get their shit together with product polish and following through on promises (or not promising the moon to begin with) or they shut the hell up and we all buy iPhones and call it a day. Paul Quinn My thoughts are not really heading down that road. The Home does a lot of things right. It's core features, music and access to Google's massive database of information, are working. Light control works well. There are some very useful IFTTT integrations. The Echo had its issues when it came out and it has grown up. I'm not ready to give up on the Home. I see it slowly improving. I don't miss any Echo features. My 6P was a good experience overall but ultimately, yeah, it failed me in terms of the camera. My new Mate 9 has an absolutely amazing camera. I have no experience with the Pixel though. The general consensus is that the Pixel is amazing. I'm looking forward to the next one. Leoniv Same here. I'm all in with Google tech and have been with them since 2.3, but lately they've been a hot mess. They broke the dialer on multiple phones, hosed bluetooth so it disconnected randomly, and that doesn't even include the issues with the nexus and pixel phones. I hate to admit it, but the iPhones are looking more attractive. Jack Smith Really? Google home is not even 6 months old. GH is easily the most humanist technology that you can buy It is incredible what can do but not perfect and yet it is over? Little dramatic? Where are you going to get anything close? I have had the Echo since the very first day. It is NOT like the GH. Comparisons are ridiculous. Echo has commands and the GH you talk We are so.early with this and obviously the relatively minor issues in the scheme of things will get resolved. I have one echo and counting GHs that I gave away I have purchased 7. Not to say I dislike my Echo but it is not the future, IMO, like the GH. Aleem Kanji I'm TOTALLY being dramatic, actually. I love my Google Home. I love my Nexus. I also tried an iPhone for the first time late last year (iOS 10 got my attention) and I love it too. My tenure with my iPhone was about 4 months, and, like clockwork, I'd always put my SIM back in my N6P every Wednesday night until Saturday, then switch back to my iPhone (which is a bitch with iMessage, BTDub). The iPhone IS more polished, has better power and battery management, but isn't exciting to me the way Android is. I could never give it up. It's like a drug. But, like a drug, I'm hopelessly addicted to something that promises the highest of highs, then always leaves me chasing the dragon. Google promises the world, then has a tendency to either fall short or simple pulls the rug out. In a world where the Pixel exists and it commands iPhone and Galaxy level money, in a world where Google is trying it's hand at a software AND hardware ecosystem, I expect more. I expect polish, I expect promises to be kept - or at least reasonable expectations to be given. Now, people can come back and say that Google is new at hardware and I understand and forgive that. But they aren't a hardware company in the way that they take responsibility for their products 100%, in that they quality test, in that they have any sort of retail presence that goes beyond simply "trying" something out. They have time to build that, so I'll admit that I need to give them time to sort it out. I'm just worried that they'll get complacent or lose interest and one morning wake up and say "Oh yeah, that Android thing and all that hardware and stuff - I'm over it." If Google is going to change direction and add hardware to their list of products, I expect that they keep in mind that it also means that we - not our data - become customers too. Jack Smith So much silliness in this post. First, what right now angers me the most is Apple completely abandoning the entire AirPort line without any warning. Last November just reassigning all the employes. So I replaced our two AirPort Extremes with Google Wifi. That is REAL life not some weird perception things. "Apple reportedly stops developing AirPort WiFi router products, moving employees to other projects" Who does that? Not Google. Instead with Google we have yesterday. "New Google ‘Dual Band WiFi Router’ Shows Up At The FCC" https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/04/new-google-dual-band-wifi-router-shows-up-at-the-fcc.html This entire narrative Google is horrible at hardware or abandons hardware products is rather ridiculous. Heck it would have been so easy for Google to not support the NON Google WiFI hardware but instead Google decided to spend the money and bring all their new WiFi software to the ONHUB. This is REAL life not fantasy. We have been an Apple house for over a decade. We still have tons of Apple products. But been more and more replacing with Google. With Google we have 4K, HDR, VR, Smart speaker, Mesh and the list keeps growing. I can NOT get any of this from Apple! That is simply the facts. Aleem Kanji Right. 2×4 alexa does this same thing compuguy1088 That's not true. A software update allows for multiple amazon echo devices with the same hotword to work. They've had this since around the end of last year. 2×4 that's my point - it doesnt work well Midnitte "You also have the ghosts. I never thought my home might be haunted - until now. There will be times when I turn off the TV, hang up on a call, or just walk out of the bathroom and hear something in another room. I’ll find a Google Home playing music or a podcast that I don’t listen to in a randomly selected room. Who asked to listen to opera at low volume in the guest room? Ghosts." I have two and I've grouped them in a "home unit" and I've never experienced this. Typically I'll play music on one but sometimes I'll tell it to play music on both and I've never experienced it playing music on a rogue Home goodnightmare Nor have I. Igen Then I am pretty sure that Paul's home is haunted and he should call an Sam & Dean asap. kalehv This is a constant struggle. I have two Google Homes and a bunch of phones / tablets that also respond to "Ok Google" I usually use "Hey Google" to avoid waking up phones and tablets but there is no other way round like when I want to be reminded of something, there is no command that only capable devices (phones and tablets) would listen and not the Home. Home wins over taking control and apologizes for not being able to set reminders and actual capable devices say "Answering on other device" :( thacounty I have mine in opposite corners of the house to prevent this. The real issue is that I'll talk quietly to my phone and it will still hear me. Then my Pixel says answering on another device, which is Home telling me she can't do that yet, while my Pixel could have handled it just fine. Gets frustrating, but my 2 year old son yelling at it to play Batman Play-Doh Eggs makes it worth double what I paid. JG Glad I'm not the only one with this problem. Right now I only have two Google Homes set up, one in my bedroom and the other in the living room. If I'm in the living room, even my normal speaking voice will almost certainly trigger both Home units to talk to me. Like Paul, I have to turn to the one in the living room and whisper in order to get only one. And that can be hard if the TV is blasting away to. Though for some reason when I'm in my bedroom, I usually only trigger the bedroom unit. It gets very annoying when the one I want to talk to tells me she can't help while the other rattles off some long winded multi-paragraph answer (especially when I just asked "what time is it"). Being in another room (and sharing the same voice as the one talking next to you) its often hard to understand what she's saying - and of course there's no "Hey Google, what did you just say?" command... I wanted to set up a third in the other bedroom. But until I'm sure I won't be getting three different responses to each query.... Amazon claims to have an algorithm to determine which of multiple Echo units should respond. I don't have multiple Echo units so I can't test the validity myself, but if they can figure it out... I'm sure Google, with their expertise in machine learning shouldn't have too much bother with it. goodnightmare Acoustics. :) illregal I've got 3 in pretty close proximity, and a 4th whenever lg decides to send those out. Only about 1 out of 10 requests gets answered by the one i wasn't intentionally talking to. 4Ui812 Hi Paul ? Paul Quinn Hi! Rasovan Mircea Google have to upgrade the sound waves and not allow them to travel more than one room.... Tired_Guy I have a Home, a Nexus 9, a Nexus 7 and a Pixel XL, so assistant works on all of them. If all are in my den charging, saying OK Google is like he described only a bit weirder, as I can say it specifically to my Pixel XL in my hand and the Nexus 9 answers, through it's cover. Multiple device synchronization is vital Packer Backer Another reason to allow users to set the hot word. "Hey Bub! Hey Betty! Hey Fumbduck!" would would activate three different devices. Dk Schlösser The solution is to be able to change the trigger word for each device. You can do this on Alexa. Paul Quinn Currently, only my Home responds to "Hey Google" so I use that to talk to the Home. my phones and tablets don't respond. That cuts down on the problem a bit as long as I don't want to use voice with my phone. If I say "OK Google" to my phone, the Home may also respond. A quick fix for now would be to have the option to set the Home NOT to respond to "OK Google" and only "Hey Google." Bill Riess Yeah I just recently discovered this issue when I moved from an echo and echo dot to 4 Google homes. For the most part they work pretty good but it's annoying when they pick up in the wrong room. Multiuser and Sonos integration would be great additions as well. goodnightmare I've had four of these in my home since day one. Yes, occasionally we'll get some random response from a distant device, but it doesn't affect performance. The requested task is completed properly 95% of the time and any hiccups have never been due to multiple devices trying to provide feedback. Our Google Home experience has been quite pleasant and loads of fun. DomBrady Same. I've got three. I have had one interference related issue. Charles222 Same with four here as well. I've had an interference problem with my kitchen & living room ones, but taking a few steps towards one or the other solves it. nerdshowandtell.com I also have 6 Google Homes and the issues described here I only had a month or so ago and they went away. Id also make sure you have solid wifi with no interference to eliminate any delay in the homes seeing each other. As for the random asking/talking, maybe have seen that 3 times since it came out. Definitely not in awhile. Brett Koger I also have several Google Home devices, I am not experiencing the issues you state. I even have two of them with in 20 feet (they are in different rooms) I will see both activate but only one will respond. I have only experienced what you are see a few times. It is not the norm. Paul Quinn I have noticed that situation where more than one activate but only two of them can actually be visualized at one time. To me, that's a good sign. It means they are hearing you but identifying which one should respond. Maxr1998 Hi Paul! Very entertaining and interesting article. I don't have a Google Home myself yet (not available in Germany, functionality in German is likely pretty limited (as seen in Assistant on phones), my Home Assistant setup isn't supported by Google Home/Google Assistant, and IFTTT is too slow (10 seconds+) atm), but the idea of having one is very intriguing for me :) Paul Quinn Hi Max! I guess one plus side of living in another country is that Google works out bugs in the United States before it expands across the globe. Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get it functional:P But it's still sometimes a little annoying for power users wanting the latest and the greatest regardless of bugs ;) Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get it functional. 😜 But it's still sometimes a little annoying to not get the latest and greatest stuff being a poweruser ;) Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get them functional. 😜 But it's still sometimes a little annoying to not get the latest and greatest stuff being a poweruser ;) JD So it's not just me. Alexa is just that much better with its spatial recognition. It has a 100% hit rate on responding on the right unit. Sandeep Raghuraman One solution to your problem - setup mic + speakers in each room, and use one Google Home. That way, only one Google Home device will respond. Although, the next problem would be, how does Google Home decide which mic to listen through? Maybe a device that mixes all of those input streams from the different mics? Nick Riviera Try power cycling your units to keep them from talking over one another. sucatrops If you bought 6 Google Homes and didn't expect more than one to respond to you, you should shoot yourself. Hector Diaz Amazon echo has far field recognition between Echos so Google can include that with a software update. Ryan I dont see the need to have one in all 6 rooms of my home. Having one in the open air living/dining room and kitchen is plenty, it hears me from 40 feet no matter what. Then another in my bedroom. I dont think I need them in the guest rooms. Maybe one in the office, but that is all the way on the other side of the house from the bedroom. Maybe 6 is the overkill. Paul Quinn I have smart lighting in all the main rooms of the house. I wouldn't want any of us to be yelling from room to adjust lighting in another. I did put in remotes in the rooms as well because you should have another option besides voice. I think for most people, one or two is plenty. I'm really into smart home technology despite its incredibly fragmented implementation right now. I know my house is going beyond the norm. The fact that yours hear you from 40 feet away is what is causing the downfall in my house. Đức Thành 6 Google Homes? You're a crazy man. I like you. 6 is still nowhere near enough, though. Hector Diaz I have 2 echo Dot and 1 Echo. Missing still 2 echo Dot. So he is not crazy just want to have a real smart home doesn't matter where he stands like me. Andrew Hartley It was clear Paul was a bit 'unusual' from the moment he mentioned the Enterprise. I've been teaching science using the latest technology for 30+ and my dream has always been to walk into my classroom in the morning and for a cute sounding female voice to welcome me from my computer with a good morning asking me what I would like to do today. Google home I found you at last 😉 That doesn't sound weird does it 😎 Paul Quinn Sounds fantastic! D.Smithee I like when you're home alone in a quiet house and this thing starts spouting gibberish with no warning. Paul Quinn Tonight.... one of the Homes (in the office) decided to "forget" the lights in the room. Just the lights in the room that it's in. It kept saying there were no lights set up for that room. The remote went dead too. It was darkness. But... it let me operate the lights from other Homes. No I'm starting to wonder if Google read this... and is toying with me. I got the remote back online. The Home is still protesting. Bill3 Hi Paul, not sure what's going on there. I have three Google Homes and have only had that happen once or twice. They'll often beep together, but only one will answer. It could be a problem with your WiFi network. Are they connected to different AP points? Paul Quinn Yes. Despite two of them being closer to another access point in my house, I've kept the Homes on the primary router which is able to deliver a strong enough signal throughout the house. I use an access point to guarantee a connection to the irrigation controller outside. abc Oh, god. People are buying not more than one of this beta product. Are they rich or just plain stupid? Kostas 💪🎩 Man I laughed hard. Well written! DragoCubed 🎪 👻 👋 hi paul papastevez Where the ^*#} is the Google play movies integration??? Seriously, Netflix, a third party has been working for months and months. Lars Jeppesen I have 3 GH, and I've never had the problems described in the article. /edit And Hi to Paul, of course :) twighahn I think back to the smart homes of yesteryear. They had an intercom, radio, and auto switches. Now it's all more automatic and more personalised. Michael Paul, did you realize Google Home can only play your music library using a playlist? It cannot pull up a single or album or artist from your library.

Some Pixel and Nexus fingerprint sensors not working after Android 7.1.2 update Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 12:17pm PDTApr 14, 2017 65 Plus 1 on G+ 79 Share on Facebook 73 Share on Twitter Total Shares217 Bug Watch Device Updates News Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel XL A number of Google Pixel and Nexus users are reporting that their fingerprint sensor is no longer working after the latest Android OS update. Several members of the Pixel and Nexus communities on Google's product forums have encountered the issue since installing the Android Nougat 7.1.2 OTA. The issue appears to be affecting both the Pixel and Pixel XL, as well as the LG-made Nexus 5X and Huawei Nexus 6P. Reports suggest that while the Pixel and Nexus Imprint sensors are no longer granting access to the devices, the swipe down for notifications Moves gesture is still functional. Attempts to solve the problem by deleting pre-existing fingerprints and starting from scratch haven't worked, as error messages are preventing new prints from being added to the devices. As usual, we'll update if we hear any official word from Google about the issue, hopefully regarding a fix.

Provided Google does not get the article Removed VAVAMk_2 Same thereasoner Same here with my Pixel. Suicide_Note No issues on my XL or 6P. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 6p has never given me those issues either... But it is slower than most newer scanners. Nick Which is to be expected. It's still fine. Jeff Neston By stating no problems, expect to get boot loop on your nexus 6. See the CNET article on nexus 5 and 6. Provided Google does not get the article defeated. If you do get it expect to lose all unsaved data. Then if want refund you will need to go to court. Sean Please GO AWAY....you have said this TWICE.......Its NOT the Nexus 5 and 6 Mr Brainiac....its the 5X and 6P......which are TOTALLY different than the Nexus 5 and Nexus 6. Max Same here with my XL. elav Me too. No issues on my XL.. Nicholas Matranga My Nexus 5x works just fine after the update. kalehv Sometimes my Pixel XL asks for pattern even after it recognizes my fingerprint (no, I am not talking about the first time after reboot). Rebooting the device works but why does this happen? Nathan Bryant I've also experienced this. It's random. Not so often it's a bother for me. kalehv Yup not so often with me either but being a mobile developer what bothers me is this happening, not the inconvenience it causes. Nathan Bryant That totally makes sense. I assume it's some kind of error even though it's not stating that it is. I don't see the pattern or constant of what causes it when it happens. mattcoz It does that after more than 48 hours have passed since you've last used your pattern. kalehv Nop its not that either. It does that after 4 hours I think. And it should do that only once after 4 hours but not keep doing that until you reboot. mattcoz It's definitely 48 hours, that comes straight from Google. But if it continues to do so, then that's something else. Mgamerz I've had it happen on my Nexus, it just occasionally requires a PIN. Says it's 4 hours of non usage but that doesn't seem true, sometimes I wake up and no pin and sometimes I'll be on and off the phone and it'll require a pin. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Typical. Google needs to fire some of their geniuses and hire some diligent coders, and also diligent testers for their QA department (assuming they even have one -- I sincerely doubt it). Alex Cruz Where did Google touch you? Middlefinger Oh really. Nexus/Pixel/Google error 4.453.563 this year alone. Im shocked (not really). Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Best hot steaming pile of dog s**t 2016. DragoCubed Google has been going downhill lately - at least with mobile excluding iOS. It's such a shame. They haven't exactly gone downhill haven't they? They've stayed the same SpeakethTheTruth I think you might be on to something with that last paragraph. Cause for real, quality control is out of control right now. sebastianer If fixed my 6P bad battery life and early shutdown only replacing the stock Huawei battery with other battery with different brand (no need to wipe the phone in the process...) Several people did the same and is enjoying the battery life they were having when they bought the phone more than a year ago: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3534410 You could even try a Huawei battery replacement...but they say they aren't original. I just went for another brand because of the bad experience I had with the stock battery durability I don't know in the Pixel. But in the 6P in 90% of the cases...this is just a problem of the Huawei stock battery. Kendall Gustafson “Pixel”, the word sounds like the color pink. “Pixel” sounds like a little girl’s toy. Most men would never put a phone in their pocket named “Pixel” unless they were a cross/dresser. The word “Pixel” equates to a 50% loss of market share from the male market. “Nexus”, the word does not sound female or male. “Nexus”, the word sounds like science, desirable to any man, woman, or child. “Nexus”, the word sound like domination of market share. kalehv Hahaha that made me laugh. No I do not agree. I am a Pixel owner man and I am not whatever you said they'd be if they owned one but I laughed for some reason. Christian Trevor Clauss I must be a cross dresser then :D mattcoz Real men aren't insecure about what their phones are named. Middlefinger Except that the Nexus sold poorly and was generally complete junk Van_Hammersly Most of us have exited adolescence. bonelesscheese https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9bd2ce0665c300ab872edc5e5fa1ef348b87f551cc01532d17bf41264dd126c1.jpg DragoCubed I'm so glad that you can block on disqus Bruce Wayne Google is really dropping the ball. We just can't have a stable, functioning phone that works. I just had to send my phone in for repair because it went into boot-loop after the recent update. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google: "It compiled with warnings but no errors. Must be ready to go." Bruce Wayne Nothing about Google or Android came up. What are you getting at? Middlefinger This isnt device specific, its a fault in Android itself. Google has become really bad lately with poor quality control. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Even Chrome is going to the dogs. Seriously, Google is staffed by a bunch of incompetent high-paid prima donnas. paxmos At least, Google is not charging an arm and a leg for their phones ;-) 2kool4skool Lol, $869 for a phone that doesn't have waterproofing, wireless charging, expandable storage, and ois is not charging an arm and leg? paxmos Didn't you see the wink? 2kool4skool Apologies, I just woke up and haven't fully recovered when I read your comment, my sarcasm detector didn't work really well that time. paxmos LOL, we're good Lindacbrewer Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

No need to test or anything. Too much trouble for the geniuses at Google. They're so smart that if it compiles with just warnings, there couldn't possibly be any problems. John Doe I am sure that they do test it but there are things that go wrong...obviously those bugs will be in the spotlight on an Android blog meaning in real life they are probably affecting a small number of users.

It blows my mind been on 7.1.2 sense the factory imgs dropped Sean Same for me.....my Pixel XL hasnt had a single reported issue so far......... Donovan Goodwin Using mine actually causes phone to restart. Updating to 7.1.2 caused this and it even happens on ROMs. JG W00t! For once I don't suffer from Atrem's Luck... My 5X still lets me in with my fingerprint :) Doomberg I updated just last night. Glad I didn't get hit with this issue. nickarli 6P - had 4 fingers registered, right index stopped working after the update but other 3 still fully functional. I thought it was the massive amount of Utah dust in my fingers all of a sudden, but I guess not Defenestratus There's that vaunted Google QA again. This is how you get more Samsung. New_Guy Yep Mark Curtis What do you mean "this is how you get more Samsung"? 4Ui812 Why is Google having app many issues with the Fixel ? Sruly J Except since it's also affecting Nexus devices, this is more of a software issue in 7.1.2 than a hardware issue for Pixel devices. Defenestratus Because IIRC they use Agile software development. Agile is how you get shitty software. Lawstorant I've never thought I would say such thing, but I'm getting fed up with all the "issues" Google is facing with every update. On the Nexus 6, they went as far as to roll it back to 7.0. They should really step up their game especially if, they are fully responsible for every aspect of the device from now on. EvilHowl No issues on my 5X wade_county I thought these Pixels weren't supposed to be beta products? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They aren't. They're outrageously expensive alpha products. And they even have one defect (halo-cam) that can't be fixed in software. Still the best steaming pile of dog s**t of 2016, though. Everyone should buy one. Everyone who likes dog s**t anyway. Apparently people do, since HTC has shipped 2 million since launch. Kougeru I bad a Pixel for a week and took dozens of photos with no halo Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good for you. Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of 22 Pixel pictures had halos. None of the 22 G6 pictures had halos. They were all pictures of the same things, obviously with the same lighting. Google admits it's a design defect. If Google admits it, it's kind of hard to pretend it doesn't exist. whispy_snippet No one denies it's an issue. But what you seem incapable of accepting is it's a very minor issue that only very rarely rears its head. If you actively try to shoot an image with a strong light source angled towards the sensor (something you generally don't do because it often results in a poor shot on any camera) you might experience a halo effect. Might. But I've got literally hundreds of photos taken with my Pixel with no halos. You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want to fuel your juvenile rage fits. But people who actually use a Pixel every day don't seem to have a problem worth caring about. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It has nothing to do with a strong light source angled toward the sensor. That's normal lens flare. The Pixel halos are NOT normal lens flare. Like I said 4 out of 22 pictures. That's 18% of the pictures they took, and they didn't have strong light sources angled toward the sensor. 18% is not a rare problem, especially when the G6 NEVER had halos with the same exact pictures. Google admitted it's a flaw. Get over yourself and stop trying to justify it. whispy_snippet And like I said, I've taken hundreds of pictures and have seen a halo perhaps a couple of times. And I take a lot of photos given video and photography is my day job - indeed one of the reasons I chose the Pixel is because I wanted the best phone camera available for the times I don't have my proper gear with me. I've seen countless comparisons between the Pixel, iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 edge and while they're all great, in most situations the Pixel takes what I consider the better shot. You're making mountains out of molehills and carrying on like a right twat in the process. P. Sherman ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE DOESN'T MEAN JACKS--- if in scientific tests under controlled environments and the same conditions, the Pixel produced the halo effect, which Google has acknowledged to be a design deficiency standard on LITERALLY EVERY PIXEL MADE, but other cameras feature no such halo effect. FFS whispy_snippet I'm not denying there's an issue! I'm saying it's being blown out of proportion by people who want to blow it out of proportion. P. Sherman Referencing a scientific, controlled test and camera comparison is NOT blowing this out of proportion. Blowing out of proportion would be something how the Wall Street Journal set out to destroy PewDiePie for boneheadedly saying "Death to all Jews" as a joke. But referencing a camera comparison in exactly the same conditions and one phone had a halo effect but the other didn't is science, fact, nothing to blow out of proportion there. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good luck arguing with a Google fanboy in deep denial. thereasoner He's actually making solid points, the Pixels do have the best cameras overall​ and all smartphone cameras have some issues. whispy_snippet No, no. I'm a fanboy! Get it right! Cecil Hardwood Are you sure the Pixel has the best camera ? The reason I ask is because the DxOMark site that claims this refuses to release the iPhone 7 Plus (Not iPhone 7) scores and many believe it is because it scored higher than the Pixel. The theory goes on to say that Google is using their score in their advertising and DxO doesn't want to piss off Google. Something weird is going on for sure. DxO claimed long ago the review was coming soon and should have been out by now with the iPhone 7 Plus having been on the market as long as it has. thereasoner If I'm to make a judgment personally then I would say that probably the top 3-4 cameras on flagships are very close and what's best as far as the user is concerned is subjective. Do you prefer low light performance(I do) or digital zoom? Do your favour widespread angle lens or fast launch/focus etc. Those are personal preferences that make "the best " phone different for different people. That said, as far as reviews are concerned the Pixel is generally considered the best over all. As far as your conspiracy theories go, who knows? Anyone can create those about anything but I guess but I'm thinking that other than digital zoom and an artsy photo effect the 7+ cameras are very similar to the 7. whispy_snippet The iPhone 7 Plus is the same as the iPhone 7 apart from an additional, slower lens. In terms of raw image quality the iPhone 7 Plus achieves its best results with the lens it shares with its smaller sibling. So basically, it'll score no better than the 7. It's effectively already been tested. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All smartphone cameras have some issues? What issues does the G6 camera have in the comparison I linked? 23% of the Pixel photos have halo issues. Find a serious issue with 23% of the G6 photos and get back to us. thereasoner Keep in mind that if you take wide-angle shots, angles will be distorted and elongated from the side, especially when it comes to selfies with the front-facing camera. I also found that the front-facing camera takes relatively muddy shots in low-light. Compared to the Pixel XL, OnePlus 3T and (for the time being since we don't have the S8) the Galaxy S7, the G6 is on par with its rivals. The Pixel XL takes superior low-light images than all the phones though, and I prefer the richer contrast and saturation of the S7 by just a tad. -CNET There are a ton of reviews from various sources just like this and while the G6 cameras are considered very nice they do have their shortcomings and generally rank below the Pixel cameras overall. whispy_snippet Purple flaring and chromatic aberation. It's extremely noticeable in at least four images you shared with the Pixel comparison. Here you are: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration And just Google search purple flaring. Sorry to burst your bubble. whispy_snippet Show me the link to the test. I would like to see it. Even if their results suggest there's an issue (which there is as we all agree), the significance of the results can still be blown out of proportion which is what we're seeing occur in this ridiculous discussion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Here you go again. phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ Now that I've viewed the pics again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. Two involve a bright light. The other 3 do not. So that's 23% of 22 pictures. I wouldn't say that's blowing things out of proportion. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. Yeah, you paid a lot for your Pixel, so you have a hard time admitting it's a steaming pile of dog s**t. I understand. whispy_snippet Yep, so as we've agreed, halos sometimes appear in shots with strong light sources pointing at or angled towards the edge of the sensor. But let's just ignore the purple flaring and chromatic aberation in at least four of the images from the LG, right? You're demonstrating selective criticism. Every camera has strengths and weaknesses but on balance, the Pixel offers better images than competing phones more often than not. My position is unchanged. You're both making mountains out of molehills, and in no way does this "scientific" test guarantee that 23% of photos taken with a Pixel will exhibit a halo. It simply shows 23% of photos taken in this example demonstrated halos. You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. No one ever said the Pixel is perfect. But only you two are using ridiculous, extreme labels like "steaming pile of dog shit" and "HARDWARE DEFICIENCY" as though using capital letters makes your odd ball assertions more valid. Most reputable tech reviewers agree the Pixel has the best overall smartphone camera. You're entitled to disagree. P. Sherman 4/22. 4/22 photos from the Pixel have a halo effect. That's from Phandroid. That's 18% of photos the Pixel. That alone is damning. Google themselves have acknowledged that it is a HARDWARE DEFICIENCY and software fixes have done little to address this. They admitted it was there, that's all we need. If you knew that 4/22 Burritos Chipotle made would give you the Runs, but ZERO/22 Burritos Taco Bell made would, would YOU still choose to eat at Chipotle? whispy_snippet Show me the test! I've asked twice now. P. Sherman Lena Flare was removed from the photos, but not the video. http://highonandroid.com/android-smartphone-news/the-truth-about-google-pixel-camera-halolens-flare-effect/ Also, someone in the official Google forums shot with their Pixel and Nexus 6P in the same Time, conditions, everything. Guess what? https://support.google.com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsrROqMaXHqHg/?hl=by Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ 3 halos are obvious, 1 is subtle. The subtle one is where the picture is looking up at a building's windows. Now that I've viewed them again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. tigerstown I paid $380 for my new pixel XL so it's not a lot and I have no Halo in my pics I have proven this on Twitter already. abc More fanboy logic. I took pictures so everything is fine. Anyone who says its not fine is crazy. whispy_snippet How ridiculous. So a blogger takes 22 photos in various conditions and his experience is valid, but my experience of owning the phone and taking hundreds of photos in various conditions is not valid. You guys are weirdos. Andy But do you see problems with low light pics. I do on my wife's pixel. IPhone Looks so much better. I'm so disappointed abc I saw a rainbow once. Oh, are we not just conveying pointless ancedotes? mr.fozzo On my Nex6P, I have noticed that the Fingerprint reader has been less reliable lately. It requires more presses than the usual 1 press. Besnik Rrustemi My Nexus 6P working excellent so far, no battery problems, no fingerprint problems (better standby times on 7.1.2 to be honest). But yes,i can agree that fingerprint was much faster when i first got the device on 6.0 Marshmallow (for unlocking the device with the fingerprint) now it takes like 2 full seconds for that :( jimv1983 No issues on my Nexus 5X and the swipe on the sensor to bring down the notification panel is great. Alex Harrison Flashed the OTA myself on my 5X. No issues with it. Jeff Neston At least it is just the sensor. My nexus 5 was bricked by a Google update.. it got the boot loop. Google support lied to me claiming I broke the power button. False it was not broken. I ended up going small claims case against Google. They settled, but wanted me to sign gag order. Sorry, no way. I sent it back and got complete refund. Sneaky company. What probably causes boot loop update to occur is phone on long time. Some apps get memory leak over time. System then unpredictably unstable. Then the system does auto uplate from Google without asking user NOR even rebooting or turning off prior to the update. Then during update, Os gets corrupted. Then after failed update phone reboots thinking the. Update completed. Now phones dead. And Google not bother to address the issue. Pdiddy187 My 5x fingerprint sensor was great until it bootlooped yesterday morning. LG is going to repair it under warranty even though it's well out of warranty. La Kiesha Rodriguez Barrientes I have the ZTE axon 7 and over a month now google hasn't addressed a fix for the play store not loading apps over data or Wi-Fi.. Without uninstalling updates to play store and then maybe will not say "waiting for network" so frustrating and then maybe download once and have to do that everytime.. Dumb.. P. Sherman That's been like that since KitKat. F------ KITKAT. ahnafm Is google reacommodating their customers now? Brett Delia I thought some positive feedback was worth being added. My Nexus 6P is working perfectly after the update. I've had generally a great experience with all my Android phones. I've had an iPhone as well as a Windows mobile phone as well in my past. None have been as feature packed as my Android devices. New_Guy This and all the other ridiculous issues with the Pixel is a big reason I stick with Samsung... flyonthewall Lol Fernando S Mine is working ok in my Nexus 5x running 7.1.2. It just failed once while I was on 7.1.1 and with a soft reset it came back to life Hank Is that a real screenshot in the story? Enrollment spelled wrong twice. SMH. ThisGuyFUX This is now icing on top of the cake, for anyone whom has enjoyed watching this crash and burn. If I paid $850+ for a Pixel, I'd be pursuing class action litigation by now. Slow clap. Sean Except its only affecting about 1% of the Pixels sold.........so......slow clap for you....... 2kool4skool It's gonna be sucks when you're in the 1%. And I doubt it's 1% anyway, this is probably the 20th article I've read about pixel's problems. That's alot. Probably more like 5%. abc Fortunately, not many Pixels have been sold so not many people are affected. Brian White Nexus 5x, running fine here ddevito If it wasn't for my OnePlus 3 I'd be on an iPhone. thereasoner One plus has their own issues/lousy support and the iPhone? They're the worst of them all when it comes to buggy software and hardware issues bricking devices ! ddevito Not sure I'd agree with you. My iPhone 6s hums along swimmingly without any issues. The more I use it the more I am leaning towards going back to an iPhone full-time. Apple, love them or hate them, knows how to deliver products, and support them. Period. thereasoner I'm glad that your iPhone 6s isn't affected by the many flawed updates and hardware issues​ that have plagued various iPhones over the years but the fact remains that Apple has faced class action lawsuits filed by their own customers for serious issues like Touch Disease and error 53 and for good reason. They have the worst track record of them all and to make things worse they're known for both ignoring iPhone issues until said class action lawsuits are launched and/or blaming their customers for the iPhone hardware/software problems. BTW, my Pixel "hums along swimmingly" as well, that doesn't mean issues with the Pixel don't exist much less those far more serious issues found on iPhones ! MisterKraky I'm not having the fingerprint sensor issue myself, but after updating to 7.1.2, I can no longer install or update any apps! On a Verizon-issued Pixel here. Đức Thành What happened to all the testing, Google? It seems they have become too reliant on using Nexus users for beta-testing and now can't seem to do a proper job on their own. Get your grips together, Android team. Rob H. Nougat is such a half baked disaster of an OS. It's ruined my N6. Marshmallow was soon much more stable. Thanks google keep breaking phones. jacob Cant even spell enrolment correctly. Enrollment...... PoisonApple31 Don't forget your apostrophe! Makes you look stupid when you are talking about spelling.

Rakesh There is a known bug that after you unlock your phone the fingerprint sensor won't work for gestures - swipe down. There is no workaround for it so far other than to just press once and then it will start working. Adam Margeson Not sure what you're talking about. Doesn't seem to affect my Pixel. dontsh00tmesanta Guess I'm a lucky one mine is ok abc Premium bugs for your "premium" Pixel. mike shwilly No issues here. Not using fingerprint sensor at all though. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ LOL!! So the solution to fingerprint sensor problems is not to use it. Check. Adam Margeson No issues here and I use mine all the time! whispy_snippet Ditto. Alex Cruz Off topic but this 'Felonious Monk' guy seems like he's butt hurt over some shit hahaha Is like an ex-wife trying to 'I told you so' about some shit. Felonious Monk get some pussy bro, it helps with that butt hurt you got..... Fakhri Ahmad Microsoft should come in hard with new phones and entice all the users android has frustrated.

I'm tired of having boot loop worries and my videos looking all pixelized on social media. I haven't even downloaded the update because I'm afraid. It shouldn't be this way Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'm waiting for the Note 8, but I am seriously considering switching to iPhone, instead. I'm really tired of Google's crap. squiddy20 Annnnnd this is why I have auto-updates disabled on my PIxel. That, and I have it rooted. Andy Got my wife the pixel because she wanted a great camera. Consistently her friends iPhone 6 and 7s look better in low light. Its very frustrating. Makes me look like an idiot paying all this money. Outside the pictures look amazing. But I'm disappointed in indoor pics Stevo I have the same issue!! It happened as soon as I updated my stock Nexus 6P to 7.1.2. I've called Google Fi for support and they were NO help other than trying to sell me an "upgrade" to the Pixel and FULL price?!? They also said that they haven't had harly any other complaints with this issue. Thanks for nothing Google! I've did a soft rest then a complete reset with no luck. I've heard that people have had success with down grading to 7.1.1. or flashing a custom ROM. trapchan Where're Google apologists when you need them? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Maybe they're beginning to face reality. flyonthewall WTF Google flyonthewall To the Apple fanboys here. My Macbook Pro 2012 data cable fried in 2 years due to the Macbook's poorly designed unibody which acts as a fantastic heat conductor. "Genius" store crooks said I needed a new hard drive and wanted $150. Bought a $20 cable from ebay, watched a few videos and fixed it. Running fine 3 years later. Apple has known about this issue since 2007 but has never acknkowledged it. My Pro cost me more than 1400. I have had sub 500 Windows laptops easily run 5 years.

De ElizabethApr 15, 2017 10:49AM EDT Facebook Twitter Pinterest Facebook Twitter Pinterest A good way to know what's on someone's mind is to check their Google search history. And according to recent trends in searches, a lot of people are worried about a possible war. As noted by The Huffington Post, Google searches for "World War 3" have currently hit a record-high. The last time they spiked were in October 2016; prior to that, it was November 2015. But a quick look at the graph shows that the current volume of searches for this phrase is higher than its ever been – twice as high, in fact, as the last time the search term was unusually popular. Google's "Trends" feature allows you to see a search term's history since 2004, which is when the site began tracking this data. The tool also offers the option to compare terms, creating a multi-colored graph that allows its users to see the difference between words and phrases over time. As The Huffington Post points out, "World War 3" isn't the only trending phrase; users are also searching for "Trump War," "Nuclear War," and "Going to War." facebook dialog Pinterest Google Trends The reason for the uptick in these searches is clear. Earlier this month, President Trump fired more than 50 missiles at Syria in response to a deadly chemical attack that took place just days prior. Just two days ago, the U.S. military ordered the "Mother of all Bombs" to be dropped on Afghanistan, targeting an ISIS “cave complex." And North Korea has warned that Trump's "aggressive" tweets could lead to a military conflict between the two countries. It's definitely a lot to take in, and it can easily feel overwhelming and scary. Luckily, there are a lot of resources to help you stay informed and educated as we navigate the realm of a Trump presidency.

Google Assistant replaced Now on Tap (for compatible devices), and carried over most of its functionality. Now Assistant is making it slightly more obvious that it can search your screen and take screenshots.    Left: Old design; Center, Right: New design Before, screen search results would appear below the main Assistant prompt after a few seconds, and the screenshot button was found below the screen search results. Buttons for screen search and taking a screenshot are now immediately visible when Assistant is opened. This is a minor improvement, but definitely a welcome one. The change appears to be part of a server-side update, so if you don't have it, you will soon.

The old swipe up barely even worked most of the time. I've been waiting for them to do something like this. Paul Smith Don't even have assistant yet... Nexus 5x 7.12 samiazza Same here, is there any way to get it without root? Suresh Aryal Change the phone language to US English, delete Google app data and you should be running Assistant after few setup screens or just wait for few hours. samiazza Thank you, it worked:-) belac77 that's so weird. I've had Assistant on my Moto G Play running Marshmallow from the second or third day the rollout began! Zahir_SMASH be glad you don't. bekifft Seriously, enjoy it while it lasts. Assistant is a downgrade in every way. Alex Dueppen Is it just me or did Assistant get rid of the OCR thing where you could select text on your screen? Bombaglad this was never a part of assistant, only now on tap Nicholas Matranga Nope, they removed it for some reason. That was one of the main things I used now on tap for. Roh_Mish Used it all the time to select and copy text it to search for something Corbin Davenport That feature was never ported to Assistant. Mohammad Fazal Love this Now on tap feature. And now its gone :/ Evgany Used it all the time. Bring it back. Ruel Johnson It's still there you highlight the text then once you open assistant you tap "What's on my screen" Rami Hmm, never knew that worked. Still doesn't help if the text is in an image or it is non selectable text. Steve Riendeau Awesome, thank you! XgudwilX Not the same. You could copy text from within any app, screen, photo, whatever. Even a photo you took of a food label, street sign, or hand written note. Many languages and fonts too. You'd just hit the little copy (👆🏿)icon and go to town. It was amazing. The Now On Tap reverse image search, from within the camera app was awesome too. Much faster than what the Assistant tries to do. It's usually hit or miss. Oh well, maybe this new change is Google making room to bring back the text select (👆🏿) icon! MayorMcCheese Main reason I removed Assistant David Hyman While not ideal and not always a option, you can select text and then trigger the assistant and it'll use that for search context. And there are other apps CTRL-F (I think) that does basically the same thing. So you can share the screenshot with CTRL-F and then copy the text form there kalehv Also I remember Google Now on Tap did screen search when Camera was open. Was helpful to read barcodes but now that's gone. I don't want to install another app just to read barcodes, or QR codes whatever. mjmdroid Got it and already used it more than 4 times today Nicholas Smith Is there any way to use google assistant to schedule calendar events from your text messages? That was a huge feature of on-tap and I don't get why it went away. SocialSupaCrew Yes it's still present with assistant :) Miles Reiter What kind of context were you using that feature in with Assistant? I was trying to get that to work the other day with a clearly spelled out date and time from an email, and it wasn't finding a thing on my screen. motoridersd Awesome! I hated scrolling down to get to the button, so I wasn't using this feature much. This is much better. Eddy Nelson Lopez They need to bring text selection back! Deeco I got a Screenshot of not having Google Assistant, shall I share? FU Google demarcmj no thank you abqnm Maybe someday they'll add a button to open the damn Google app from the assistant pop-up. If I can't talk to my phone, I want to still be able to search without having to go back to the homescreen and then into the Google app. Miles Reiter I'm thinking about writing some kind of case study around the rollout of Assistant and the pro's/con's compared to Now on Tap. What you mentioned is definitely a pain point in my own usage. I'm curious whether there's anything else (good or bad) that stands out to you about Assistant. Luke Taylor As a language learner, one of the big setbacks about GA is that I no longer have the ability to translate my screen or select specific text on my screen if the screen search doesn't pull up any results. I used those on a daily basis! Mathsiel Totally agree... Grey It's easy. You hit the Google icon next to the search, nothing happens, you fumble around, you tap the search box, you swipe up and down, you get very frustrated, and eventually it randomly closes on you when you try pressing the phone back button, so you press the "recent apps" button but it doesn't exist and you get even more frustrated so you tap the Home Screen Search Box and tap the Google icon and Google Now might load. See? Easy. bekifft Exactly. They're trying to force you to use voice. Even with Siri you can just type into it once it's launched. LOL There are still things that Google Now does better then Assistant.....Very annoying Cory S Eh, I think Now did just about everything better than Assistant. aRvInD I want my Google Now onTap back? Is there any mod to get it? Zahir_SMASH Change your phone's language to US Virgin Islands English. You get Now On Tap back, and Google's voice responses get an Australian accent, which I think you can fix, but I find charming in its own way. titetanium Go to apkmirror and download Google App version 6.11.21 or earlier. You'll probably lose any recent data saved in the current version, but Now on Tap will be back. Don't upgrade the app afterwards. Profit. Zahir_SMASH That's a lot more trouble than just changing your language to another English option titetanium Perhaps, but you won't have to worry about getting Assistant going forward as long as you stay on the old version. How long before El Goog updates the other English language options to have Assistant? Miles Reiter What are some of those things that Now did better for you? To be clear I definitely agree, just looking for some things I might not have thought of for writing a case study on the subject! LOL To be honest I don't really use them often. But I really like how Google Now gives you this nice weather card with ton of info, there is no such a thing in Assistant. Also Google Now is able tell which song is playing, again it's missing from Assistant brownjames Text search from any screen. Selection of non selectable onscreen text. Language translation of non selectable text onscreen. Those are my favorite 3 features of Now on Tap that are not in Assistant. Luke Taylor Exactly the same as you. Text translation and selection was used daily by me. Hugely bummed that Assistant can't do it. Michel Sa I could do image searrch (searching by image) using Now on tap, Assistant can't Mohit Saini Will Moto X2 get google assistant? Or it's only available to 64bit devices like s7,nexus 6p...... Zahir_SMASH Pretty sure it is supposed to be rolling out to any device with Marshmallow and up. Corbin Davenport It's for any phone (not tablet) running 6.0 and up, and I think there's a minimum RAM requirement too. Zahir_SMASH Good to know, thanks blindexecutioner Still isn't as good as now on tap. Before when I'd use that on my home screen it would bring up a bunch of options like navigate to work or home. Now it just says there isn't anything. Margaritas Ante Porcos Bixby button is a good place for Google Assistant. diskostu I hate the Assistant, but I love Now On Tap. Is there any way to get Now On Tap back? ro.opa.eligible_device=false does not work anymore. Major Sceptic I liked on tap too , the assistant may be ok in some ways , but I find myself using the AI features less now than when I had on tap . Sometimes I wonder if having all the Wizz bang software that tries to make life easier by bombarding us with constantly​ with organisational​ suggestions that it may in fact be more like a nagging mother in-law . Or I'm just getting old and grumpy in my old age 😎 ? _jack_ You're not. Guilherme Pata Typing to the assistant as you do in Allo would be a real feature. This button doesn't do much when all you had to do before was swipe up... itsatrap It's not as good as Now on tap. demarcmj Didn't this happen like a month ago? https://www.google.com/search?q=google+assistant+%22What%27s+on+my+screen%22&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8 All the results are from around 3/15 (ish) Corbin Davenport It's been rolling out slowly. demarcmj Interesting. I figured the roll-out was about done since I have it and I never get anything early. Still, staged roll-out or not, I was surprised to see that you guys hadn't covered this already. Cakefish Still no assistant available in the UK on a non-Pixel device... hurry up Google. And bring YouTube Red over here while you're at it. Why is Google so lethargic with updates? freshprince_87 Never cared for the now on tap screenshot option. kalehv I also wish that Assistant could be dismissed by just swiping down. It shows up from bottom halfway to the top and it stretches to top when you pull it up only makes me think it could be pulled down to dismiss but .... Dan it does that if it's still on the bottom half of the screen. just tried it. kalehv Yeah but you pull it up to go all the way to top makes me think you can pull it down as well which doesn't work. Ishti Screen translation and text recognition scanning missing. Portzblitz Smart. Before, when you'd summon Assistant, whether you needed more info or not, Google would be processing at the bottom anyway even though few people ever actually swipe up for it; now, the button can be instantly available, but the processing will only happen for people who press it. Separates the task load. Michel Sa Where is the image search from Now on tap! Assistant is a step back. DC_Guy It's MUCH more useful this way. I take a lot of screenshots and i hated always having to scroll down to get to the share button. Sang Ngaihte No Assistant till now in India. Only Now on tap. Sibin C Baby I need the old text selection back....That's the only reason I'm still continuing in Google now Don Low I don't have the screenshot button on mine? mike shwilly Not sure if this is new but I'm seeing that Now on Tap started to give quick info in the bottom bar instead of just providing a search button https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e690721560ce23b223eb937de7b14c92065f3047c5e06363eb43916964c4fd82.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/304b263c01a22476cc3fc51c4858d2043b55163515084ab3920b5be441676362.png dontsh00tmesanta Just noticed it Roh_Mish There is no way to input text. I don't want to input by voice in public place. I loved being able to select text and now that's gone Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 141k 106k Latest Deals 14 [Deal Alert] Get a 75" Sony LED UHD Android TV from Best Buy for $2150 today ($650 off) 2017/04/15 4:13pm PDTApr 15, 2017 19 [Deal Alert] Huawei Watch in Black Stainless Steel w/metal band $250 ($100 off) 2017/04/14 6:36pm PDTApr 14, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] 55 temporarily free and on-sale apps to round out your week 2017/04/14 12:50pm PDTApr 14, 2017 13 [Deal Alert] 2-Pack 6' Anker USB 3.0 A to C cables $12 w/ promo ($8 off) 2017/04/13 4:16pm PDTApr 13, 2017 32 [Deal Alert] NVIDIA is having a SHIELD gaming spring sale 2017/04/13 2:17pm PDTApr 13, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?

It took longer than expected, but 2017 finally brings Android apps for Chrome OS to reality. The list of Chromebooks that now support the Google Play Store on the stable version of Chrome OS only includes three systems as of the first part of 2017. The ASUS Chromebook Flip, the Acer Chromebook R11 (C738T) and the 2015 Google Chromebook Pixel, which Google doesn’t sell anymore, each support the Play Store on stable Chrome OS. Any Chromebook released in 2017 will include the Google Play Store, according to Google. They will also support USB-C charging. That list expands for users willing to update Chrome OS to the beta or developer channel. Read our How to Install Android Apps on Chromebooks to learn how to get the beta version of Chrome OS on your Chromebook if it supports it. After you install the Google Play Store on your Chromebook, load the apps included in this roundup of Android apps for Chrome OS. Office Android Apps for Chrome OS The following office Android apps on Chromebook will make your device more useful for business or education. The Microsoft Office Mobile apps will work on some Chromebooks, but not all of them. My Acer Chromebook R13 isn’t compatible as of the first part of February, 2017. To get the most out of them, you’ll need an Office 365 subscription. Microsoft Word – the standard word processor doesn’t support all the desktop tools and features, but for most users it will do all the average user needs. Microsoft Excel – like Word, Excel does most that the average user will need. Microsoft PowerPoint – the average Word or Excel user doesn’t need more than the mobile versions. Many PowerPoint users might consider the mobile version of PowerPoint a little limiting. However, PowerPoint does work well on a Chromebook and presenters should install it. File Sharing Android Apps on Chromebook Microsoft OneDrive – if you use an iPad, iPhone or Android device, you’re probably already familiar with syncing files between the device and Chromebook with any of the file storage, syncing and sharing apps like OneDrive. Office 365 users get 1TB of storage included in their subscription. Since most Chromebooks come with limited 16 or 32GB of storage, 1TB of backup and storage frees up some of that valuable space. Dropbox – the most popular file sharing/syncing app comes from Dropbox. Installing the app allows you to quickly access your storage on a Chromebook. Remember that Google Drive storage comes built-in on Chromebooks. Add a link to your OneDrive or Dropbox storage in the Chrome OS Files app by clicking Add New Services in the lower left. See the image below. Adobe Creative Cloud Apps Adobe offers some decent mobile apps for Android and recently worked to make most of their apps work better as Android apps for Chrome OS. The following Adobe apps will install and should work well on a Chromebook. They’re all free, but you’ll get more out of them if you have to an Adobe Creative Cloud subscription, which starts at $10/month for the photography version or as much as $50/month for access to all the apps. We’ll start with the photographer’s Adobe apps. Lightroom – photo organization and advanced photo editing with backup to Creative Cloud online storage and sync for Creative Cloud subscribers. This is the app to start with for serious photographers. The rest of these are useful, but are meant for more casual photographers. 3 Photoshop Apps 1. Photoshop Express – basic photo editing and sharing with cropping, color correction, RAW photo support, borders, filters, and noise reduction. 2. Photoshop Mix – combine multiple photos or remove unwanted areas like distracting tourists in your vacation photos. 3. Photoshop Fix – a mix of fun and serious photo fixes from restoring old photos scanned to your computer to healing facial blemishes. Here’s a list of the other Adobe Android apps for Chrome OS. The most glaring omission is the Adobe Premiere Clip app for video editing. As of this writing, it’s not available as one of the Android apps for Chrome OS. Illustrator Draw – this is the mobile version of Illustrator, Adobe’s great creative arts application that lets artists paint, sketch or otherwise create beautiful works of art. The new Samsung Chromebook Plus with a built-in pen stylus coming soon, will make this a fantastic app for artists. Fill & Sign – fill PDF forms and sign documents on your Chromebook. This will also work nicely with the new Samsung Chromebook Plus. Other Android Apps for Chrome OS PowerDirector – editing video on a Chromebook was painful for a long time since the only option required uploading video, paying for storage on an expensive service and it didn’t work well. PowerDirector still doesn’t do complex video editing, but it’s great for simple tasks like trimming video, adding multiple shots to a single project, mixing video and images and throwing in a musical background. It’s also a free app. Slack – if your organization uses the Slack service, then you can use the online interface through the Chrome browser. I prefer to install the Slack app instead of using the clunky web interface. The app lets users quickly switch between teams. Spotify – Spotify, arguably the best music streaming service, offers a nice Android app. Listen to almost any song you want for $10/month for a single user account or $15/month for a family of 5 users. Students can get it for $5/month with proof of student status. Kindle – you could use the Kindle Cloud Reader, but it’s not as good as the Android app. The app more closely mimics the user-interface that’s available on the Kindle Fire or Kindle Paperwhite. Bible Apps – In my day job I’m a pastor and use Bible apps, but the web versions of these don’t work very well. The two best apps available for Android come from Olive Tree (seen above) and Faithlife. You can search for things, read different translations and other books related to the Bible. The apps come free, but extra books can cost up to tens or hundreds of dollars depending on the book. Skype – making calls over the Internet works great in ChromeOS with Hangouts, but most people use Skype these days. The above screenshot of a call with my friend shows that it works full screen on ChromeOS. Games for Android Apps on Chromebook My colleague Cory Gunther, our resident Android expert, recommended 10 addictive Android games. The following three will work great on your Chromebook. Remember that a lot of games won’t let you use your keyboard or trackpad, but most Chromebooks that run the Play Store also include touchscreens. Crossy Roads – the game plays like the old Frogger and you can use your keyboard to control your character. Plants vs. Zombies 2 – this simple tower defense themed game updated the wildly popular first edition with some fun twists. Alto’s Adventure – slide along the snowy alpine terrain in this side scrolling game while rescuing llamas and avoiding obstacles.

Unwind with some of the tech news you may have missed this week. Google is pretty good at drawing Before diving into serious matters, get creative with Google’s silly new tool. The company created autodraw.com, a site that analyzes your doodles and uses AI technology to guess what you are drawing. Is it a sunset? A lobster? A toenail? Perhaps Google is hoping to draw attention away from its ongoing discrimination suit with the Department of Labor. Online dating gets terrifying In the latest harrowing tale of a breakup gone sour, Matthew Herrick says that his ex-boyfriend set up fake Grindr profiles and sent 1,100 men to his home and workplace expecting to have sex. Herrick is suing the dating app. Everyone wants a piece of self-driving cars Apple received a permit to begin testing autonomous vehicles in California. And General Motors said it will add 1,100 jobs over the next five years at its San Francisco self-driving unit, Cruise Automation. Waymo and Uber continue to battle in court over self-driving technology. A May 3 hearing could lead to Uber’s self-driving program being suspended. Uber’s problems continue Still stuck with old fashioned human drivers for now, Uber had another rough week. Its head of communications quit; it announced it lost $2.8 billion last year; details of its “Hell” program for tracking Lyft drivers were leaked; and its main competitor — Lyft — raised $600 million in funding. Meanwhile, this 8-year-old boy taught himself to drive using YouTube videos and then headed to McDonald’s with his 4-year-old sister. And some news for pedestrians … People can’t stop getting hit by cars in Florida and Delaware. Spoiler: It’s the roads’ fault. And these delivery robots might soon be hogging a sidewalk near you. Watch out for: Hackers, schools, smart prisoners Shadow Brokers, an anonymous hacking group critical of the Trump administration, released another batch of NSA exploits, this time targeting Windows operating systems. Meanwhile, the Pentagon and the Department of Defense are using white hat hackers to look for vulnerabilities in their systems. A report from the EFF found parents and students are concerned tech tools used in classrooms, and don’t want tech firms spying on their kids information. Also, some prisoners built a secret computer in the ceiling. Becoming a successful media company is … hard GoPro’s latest attempt to expand beyond wearable cameras for adrenaline junkies and seagulls failed. The company’s media channel was undermined by costly productions with unclear returns, according to former employees. Horse laundering! Samsung is caught up in an unfortunately timed scandal right as it tries to recover from the Note 7 disaster. A Samsung heir has been accused of horse laundering in an ongoing trial in Seoul.

Donklephant Primary Navigation Please select a menu in this location Home Software Microsoft Edge vs Google Chrome: Which Browser Should You Choose? By Donklephant. Published on April 15, 2017. 0 If you own a Windows 10 computer, you’re probably wondering whether you should use the built-in Microsoft Edge browser or download the tried-and-tested Google Chrome. There’s no right or wrong answer — the best browser is the one that fits your needs and preferences. But, if you can’t decide off the top of your head, we’ve created this guide to help you choose. Design Both Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome have a minimalist design that aims to cram in as many features as possible without making the window look crowded. Edge comes with squared-off tabs at the topmost part of the window, with a search-and-address bar below that. Beside the bar are six buttons that give you access to various features like the history, downloads, and customizable settings. Chrome is much more minimal since it groups all its features and settings under the three-dot menu button. However, if you get extensions, the menu bar will inevitably become more cluttered. Extensions Since Google Chrome has been around since 2008, developers have had plenty of time to create an extension for almost anything. Whether you’re working on blogging, web developing, social media management, or any other task, you’ll most likely find a useful extension for it on the Chrome Web Store. If you’re bored, you can go to the “Fun” category and browse through extensions that let you play Hangman, view pictures of cats in new tabs, or choose a nice background image for your Google Homepage. Unfortunately, Microsoft Edge is far behind in terms of extensibility. As of this writing, there are only 25 extensions for Edge on the Microsoft Store, including AdBlock, Amazon Asssistant, Evernote Web Clipper, Pinterest Save Button, and Ebates Cash Back. While these are certainly helpful, they’re most likely not enough for all of your computing needs. Speed and Performance Many tech experts have put Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, and other web browsers through several benchmark tests. In Jetstream 1.1 (which checks advanced web applications), Edge consistently got the highest scores across the board. It also got higher scores than Chrome on the Octane 2.0 benchmark, which measures the performance of JavaScript engines. Google Chrome makes up for this by getting an almost-perfect score in HTML5 compliance. This means that it closely aligns with HTML5 standards, which promote secure browsing and fast browsing speeds. It’s important to note that these tests were performed on the current or older versions of Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome. Both browsers release updated versions every now and then, so their benchmark scores may differ in the future. Mobile Integration One of the best things about Google Chrome is that it prioritizes mobile integration. If you do a search on your Android or iOS device, you can seamlessly continue it on your desktop PC — and vice versa. Your bookmarks and preferences are also synced from one device to another, so you won’t have to fiddle with the settings every time you buy a new phone or laptop. This isn’t the case with Microsoft Edge. It lets you easily manage your settings and bookmarks from one PC to another but, if you want to sync your browsing data from your Android or iOS phone/tablet, you’ll need to download a third-party app to do it. Final Thoughts Microsoft Edge or Google Chrome? It’s a question that only you can answer. Use our guide and give each browser a try to see which one best fits your browsing needs.

What happens when you have more than one Google Home? Chaos.

Setting my Google Play Music library aside, I suffered through using Amazon’s attempt at a music service devoid of most of my own library. I connected my Google Calendar to Alexa and it offered a glimpse into my future relationship with Google’s assistant. Finally, in early November, I could get my hands on a new Google Home. I had pre-ordered from Google and then discovered I could pick one up at my local Best Buy. The very morning it hit the shelves, I immediately bought one. I brought it home, set it up in the family room and eagerly asked – “OK Google, play my morning hits playlist.” Without skipping a beat, she announced the list and the room filled with my music. The key point here – it was music from MY library. I didn’t cancel that Google pre-order. It was on its way. I figured I could listen to music in my bedroom as well. But – what about the other rooms in my house? What about the smart lights, smart switches, clever irrigation controller, and intelligent thermostat scattered throughout? I need a Google Home in every room to live the dream of a voice controlled home! I bought four more. My home is outfitted with six Google Home devices. There’s one in every room. I can control my smart home with my voice from anywhere I stand. I can spread music into any room. I can turn on, dim, and turn off lights in various rooms with just my voice. It’s as close as I can get to living on the Enterprise. Google's vision of the future with Google Home. Well, one Home. That’s the dream. Unfortunately, it isn’t a reality (yet). Google has failed at a key feature that it so proudly spoke of that morning in May. The nice lady living inside each Home is often unable to tell if you are talking to her or her sister in the neighboring room. It can result in some frustrating, sometimes comical, exchanges. It is amazing how well the little air freshener shaped unit can hear you from several rooms away. With multiple Homes, you’ll find yourself making requests and getting responses from two of them. It usually involves one of them, not necessarily the one closest to you, executing the request and the other apologizing to you that it can’t. From my bedroom in the morning, I might ask how long it will take to get to work and hear the detailed response in the distance from the kitchen. There will be times when the Home in front of me fulfills my request and another will rattle off from down the hall. You also have the ghosts. I never thought my home might be haunted - until now. There will be times when I turn off the TV, hang up on a call, or just walk out of the bathroom and hear something in another room. I’ll find a Google Home playing music or a podcast that I don’t listen to in a randomly selected room. Who asked to listen to opera at low volume in the guest room? Ghosts. There isn’t a constant circus of home assistants chiming in from all over the house. The closest Home does respond properly more than half of the time. However, I have found myself at times leaning over and almost whispering to a Google Home when I want to be sure the others don’t hear. There is talk of multiuser support coming soon, but it remains to be seen if this will improve its ability to identify which Home I am talking to. For now, I must look like a fool. I am whispering to an air freshener because I don’t want the others to hear. Creepy? Maybe. Tags editorial google home google home app google home fail video subscribe ...

Carson Saldanha Hi David Sean Thomas Hey Paul next time you're buying expensive accessories for every room in your house can you just throw me a hundo instead? Thanks! Sean Thomas Seems like something I would say. Paul Quinn I asked my office Home to get on that. The one in the kitchen responded. She can't do it but she's learning. Christopher Young I can completely sympathize with you. I have two Google Homes in my small apartment (living room/bedroom), and they frequently get confused where I'm at. I want to play music in the bedroom? Nope, the cozy jazz station starts blaring in the living room. There is one awesome benefit of having two Google Homes: I can fill my entire apartment with music with only a few words. dcdttu I hope Google Home gets a lot of support from Google itself and doesn't turn out to be a Hangouts. Or a Wave. Or a Nexus Player. Or a Nexus Q. Or a Google Reader. Or a tablet of any kind. Oh and hi Paul! Paul Quinn HI! Yeah, I'm worried that they will jump ship because they can't figure out a way to monetize it. No ads. If it starts playing ads, Home is moving out. The Echo doesn't really have a monetization angle except that you can shop on Amazon. Google added Google Express to the Home. But really? I'm not shopping on one of these things (yet). Lateef Alabi-Oki I thought the monetization was making money off selling the hardware. Paul Quinn They also need to keep expanding the ecosystem and product functionality which takes work that costs money. I don't know if that one time purchase price covers all that in the long run. Lord Argyris I think what Google is banking on is that if a user has one or more Homes, it makes them that much more likely to stick with the Android ecosystem in general, which means all Google's already existing means of getting money are a bit more secure from such a user switching over to the big "A". Of course it remains to be seen whether or not this is effective. Dk Schlösser The monetization is in the services offered by Google Paul Quinn I don't know what service I access through the Home makes Google any money, short of using it to buy things on Google Express. It does produce a little more profiling information but I doubt that it's enough to pay for the ongoing development. Ryan I think its all about search and locking you into their services, just like the chromecast. Because of chromecast (and now google home) I am more locked into Google Music. I am more locked into Youtube, Play Movies, searching on Google, etc. Just like Android. The specific device/service doesnt have to make money, its a "loss leader" to drive you to their other, profitable services. A very common thing in almost any consumer industry. Lars Jeppesen Precisely. I'm ditching Sonos in favor of Chromecast Audio, only because of my GH fluffthebunny The monetization is off selling all the data gleaned by your six devices listening to your every word. You have become one with the Home. You have been assimilated. Joshed The horror of ordering an item in the kitchen only to find the bedroom and office made duplicate orders. skitchbeatz I've got an open concept, one in the kitchen and one in the living room. They fight over responding and sometimes both respond. It's frustrating. I've thought about moving one of them up or down a floor. It's half implemented. It doesn't make sense because the assistant on the phone will sometimes read "answering on another device. Artem Russakovskii I have 4 Google Homes (2 in nearby areas where they can both hear me at the same time - kitchen and living room), 2 Alexas (though both Alexas can't hear me at the same time), and I can confirm - combined with multiple phones on family members, it's a mess. Let alone Home kicks in and starts talking once a day or so when not asked (doesn't happen nearly as often with Alexa). LithiumFox Never had that happen with ours... givitumibeybi 4 google homes and 2 alexas?? Artem, I think you might have some issues. Artem Russakovskii No, I just have more than one room. Dk Schlösser Change the trigger word for your Alexas Nick After my experiences with Amazon Echo, I have felt that these type of products are not ready for prime time. It's a cool concept, but these little, quirky issues that pop up with these "Home Assistants" suggest otherwise. Perhaps I'm more security minded than other people, but these sort of IoT products are ripe for security issues as well and the combination of these things has me totally turned off to the current market. Tony T. If you have multiple Homes, can you ask Google to play music and have all of them play the same music in sync? Defenestratus yes. Ed G You can have all of them play music like a Sonos. Also will link with Chromecast Audio. trickytree1984 Will it link to chrome cast proper? Joshua Pritt no, you can't group Chromecast video devices, only audio. Joshed This sucks. I don't see why they cant give older chromecast devices this feature. Paul Quinn Yes, you can create groups. For example, I have a group named "Front of the house" that connects three of them. You're best bet is to name them things that roll of the tongue like, "Hey Google, play my 90's hits playlist on the front of the house." Defenestratus I've got three homes, and I don't have this issue at all. Of course they're all on different floors and I live in a rather open-floor plan home so there's that. I've never had it come on as a ghost... ever. Chris You spent over 800 on google homes?!?! Omg man what kinda bank you making. That is insanity. Or no savings? I mean a financially responsible person cannot spend that much unless their income is huge haha. Defenestratus Yesterday I spent $1000 on a shower fixture (Moen U) David Ruddock OMG YOU ACTUALLY BOUGHT ONE OF THOSE? Defenestratus My wife saw it on "I want that" on DIY network and, well, yeah. We're about to start a master suite renovation so it was the perfect opportunity. For her, the hardest part of the day is getting up out of bed and waiting for the shower to heat up, getting cold in the process (she could get cold in the middle of equatorial guinea and we live in the North East US) so when she saw that she could turn the shower on from bed and it would alert her when it was ready for her, it was a done deal. I'm actually thinking of making a google assistant handler for it when it shows up. Chris Damn dude! How much do you make?? I see all these cool things and want them but I decide my money is better sitting in my savings account or the stock market. Defenestratus I specialize in software that is used for pharmaceutical research and clinical trials. I make a good living. Oh and my wife's a doctor. Chris Ah definitely. That's awesome dude. I work at a vaccine start up so hopefully we'll get a product past the FDA then I can buy 1k showers ;) Defenestratus Very cool. My company does a lot of work on vaccine studies. Best of luck. You have a long 12-14 years of approval process ahead of you! goodnightmare "Ok Moen...." Doesn't have quite the same ring to it. Paul Quinn The timing was right. I got three of them for $100 apiece using Visa Checkout and some helpful friends. Chris That's good dude. I haven't been able to convince myself to get one yet. I don't listen to music at home and not really sure what else I'd use it for. I did get a nest recently but still I don't mind pulling out my phone to change the temp. Paul Quinn I have an Ecobee now. My Nest kept thinking I was away because I didn't walk down that hallway enough. The Ecobee has remote sensors. Unfortunately, the Home currently does not have a direct integration with Home. I'm using IFTTT. Lawstorant Is it that hard to check which Home is the closest, based on the loudness of one's speech? Paul Quinn It might be that Google focused on their ability to hear your voice based on having one Home. If you have one, you want it to be able to hear you from a distance. That will backfire when you introduce more of them. They are all listening too well. Mace Moneta It could probably be resolved easily, by having the Google Homes reduce sensitivity of the mic, based upon the number of Google Home's on the network. Paul Quinn I had two Echos when they announced improved far-field functionality. I tested it at the time and it was working better. I didn't do any long term testing because I switched to the Home. With that in mind, Amazon was able to improve the situation with a software update so I agree that Google should have fixed this by now. Lawstorant Well, it's still Google. They have the money and the manpower to overcome such "hurdles". Why is it that more often than not, they seem like a small start-up composed of fresh out-of -college programmers. Nigel Antonio lol I thought I was the only one with that problem... Jesse Corbett So I have 2, one that covers the bedroom/bathroom half of my apartment and on that covers the kitchen/dining/living room section. I have never had an issue with both responding, if I may share my anecdote. However, I frequently am sitting 10 feet from the living room Home and hear my bedroom Home respond, despite being further away, in another room, down a hallway, with the first between me and it. I don't understand. Michael Stiffler Haha, I've had to whisper to my phone if I don't want her (Home) to hear! Aleem Kanji I think it's time to admit that Google is really screwing the pooch here. Nexus hardware failures, Pixel issues, Google Homes not living up to the hype, constant beta-feel to their products... I have a Nexus 6P, two Google Homes, and I'm all-in on Google services, but... for fuck's sake, I'm thinking of jumping ship entirely. Even Android news sites are seeming to be whole-heartedly disappointed with Google and the growing lack of positivity is disheartening. Google either needs to put up and get their shit together with product polish and following through on promises (or not promising the moon to begin with) or they shut the hell up and we all buy iPhones and call it a day. Paul Quinn My thoughts are not really heading down that road. The Home does a lot of things right. It's core features, music and access to Google's massive database of information, are working. Light control works well. There are some very useful IFTTT integrations. The Echo had its issues when it came out and it has grown up. I'm not ready to give up on the Home. I see it slowly improving. I don't miss any Echo features. My 6P was a good experience overall but ultimately, yeah, it failed me in terms of the camera. My new Mate 9 has an absolutely amazing camera. I have no experience with the Pixel though. The general consensus is that the Pixel is amazing. I'm looking forward to the next one. Leoniv Same here. I'm all in with Google tech and have been with them since 2.3, but lately they've been a hot mess. They broke the dialer on multiple phones, hosed bluetooth so it disconnected randomly, and that doesn't even include the issues with the nexus and pixel phones. I hate to admit it, but the iPhones are looking more attractive. Jack Smith Really? Google home is not even 6 months old. GH is easily the most humanist technology that you can buy It is incredible what can do but not perfect and yet it is over? Little dramatic? Where are you going to get anything close? I have had the Echo since the very first day. It is NOT like the GH. Comparisons are ridiculous. Echo has commands and the GH you talk We are so.early with this and obviously the relatively minor issues in the scheme of things will get resolved. I have one echo and counting GHs that I gave away I have purchased 7. Not to say I dislike my Echo but it is not the future, IMO, like the GH. Aleem Kanji I'm TOTALLY being dramatic, actually. I love my Google Home. I love my Nexus. I also tried an iPhone for the first time late last year (iOS 10 got my attention) and I love it too. My tenure with my iPhone was about 4 months, and, like clockwork, I'd always put my SIM back in my N6P every Wednesday night until Saturday, then switch back to my iPhone (which is a bitch with iMessage, BTDub). The iPhone IS more polished, has better power and battery management, but isn't exciting to me the way Android is. I could never give it up. It's like a drug. But, like a drug, I'm hopelessly addicted to something that promises the highest of highs, then always leaves me chasing the dragon. Google promises the world, then has a tendency to either fall short or simple pulls the rug out. In a world where the Pixel exists and it commands iPhone and Galaxy level money, in a world where Google is trying it's hand at a software AND hardware ecosystem, I expect more. I expect polish, I expect promises to be kept - or at least reasonable expectations to be given. Now, people can come back and say that Google is new at hardware and I understand and forgive that. But they aren't a hardware company in the way that they take responsibility for their products 100%, in that they quality test, in that they have any sort of retail presence that goes beyond simply "trying" something out. They have time to build that, so I'll admit that I need to give them time to sort it out. I'm just worried that they'll get complacent or lose interest and one morning wake up and say "Oh yeah, that Android thing and all that hardware and stuff - I'm over it." If Google is going to change direction and add hardware to their list of products, I expect that they keep in mind that it also means that we - not our data - become customers too. Jack Smith So much silliness in this post. First, what right now angers me the most is Apple completely abandoning the entire AirPort line without any warning. Last November just reassigning all the employes. So I replaced our two AirPort Extremes with Google Wifi. That is REAL life not some weird perception things. "Apple reportedly stops developing AirPort WiFi router products, moving employees to other projects" Who does that? Not Google. Instead with Google we have yesterday. "New Google ‘Dual Band WiFi Router’ Shows Up At The FCC" https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/04/new-google-dual-band-wifi-router-shows-up-at-the-fcc.html This entire narrative Google is horrible at hardware or abandons hardware products is rather ridiculous. Heck it would have been so easy for Google to not support the NON Google WiFI hardware but instead Google decided to spend the money and bring all their new WiFi software to the ONHUB. This is REAL life not fantasy. We have been an Apple house for over a decade. We still have tons of Apple products. But been more and more replacing with Google. With Google we have 4K, HDR, VR, Smart speaker, Mesh and the list keeps growing. I can NOT get any of this from Apple! That is simply the facts. Aleem Kanji Right. 2×4 alexa does this same thing compuguy1088 That's not true. A software update allows for multiple amazon echo devices with the same hotword to work. They've had this since around the end of last year. 2×4 that's my point - it doesnt work well Midnitte "You also have the ghosts. I never thought my home might be haunted - until now. There will be times when I turn off the TV, hang up on a call, or just walk out of the bathroom and hear something in another room. I’ll find a Google Home playing music or a podcast that I don’t listen to in a randomly selected room. Who asked to listen to opera at low volume in the guest room? Ghosts." I have two and I've grouped them in a "home unit" and I've never experienced this. Typically I'll play music on one but sometimes I'll tell it to play music on both and I've never experienced it playing music on a rogue Home goodnightmare Nor have I. Igen Then I am pretty sure that Paul's home is haunted and he should call an Sam & Dean asap. kalehv This is a constant struggle. I have two Google Homes and a bunch of phones / tablets that also respond to "Ok Google" I usually use "Hey Google" to avoid waking up phones and tablets but there is no other way round like when I want to be reminded of something, there is no command that only capable devices (phones and tablets) would listen and not the Home. Home wins over taking control and apologizes for not being able to set reminders and actual capable devices say "Answering on other device" :( thacounty I have mine in opposite corners of the house to prevent this. The real issue is that I'll talk quietly to my phone and it will still hear me. Then my Pixel says answering on another device, which is Home telling me she can't do that yet, while my Pixel could have handled it just fine. Gets frustrating, but my 2 year old son yelling at it to play Batman Play-Doh Eggs makes it worth double what I paid. JG Glad I'm not the only one with this problem. Right now I only have two Google Homes set up, one in my bedroom and the other in the living room. If I'm in the living room, even my normal speaking voice will almost certainly trigger both Home units to talk to me. Like Paul, I have to turn to the one in the living room and whisper in order to get only one. And that can be hard if the TV is blasting away to. Though for some reason when I'm in my bedroom, I usually only trigger the bedroom unit. It gets very annoying when the one I want to talk to tells me she can't help while the other rattles off some long winded multi-paragraph answer (especially when I just asked "what time is it"). Being in another room (and sharing the same voice as the one talking next to you) its often hard to understand what she's saying - and of course there's no "Hey Google, what did you just say?" command... I wanted to set up a third in the other bedroom. But until I'm sure I won't be getting three different responses to each query.... Amazon claims to have an algorithm to determine which of multiple Echo units should respond. I don't have multiple Echo units so I can't test the validity myself, but if they can figure it out... I'm sure Google, with their expertise in machine learning shouldn't have too much bother with it. goodnightmare Acoustics. :) illregal I've got 3 in pretty close proximity, and a 4th whenever lg decides to send those out. Only about 1 out of 10 requests gets answered by the one i wasn't intentionally talking to. 4Ui812 Hi Paul ? Paul Quinn Hi! Rasovan Mircea Google have to upgrade the sound waves and not allow them to travel more than one room.... Tired_Guy I have a Home, a Nexus 9, a Nexus 7 and a Pixel XL, so assistant works on all of them. If all are in my den charging, saying OK Google is like he described only a bit weirder, as I can say it specifically to my Pixel XL in my hand and the Nexus 9 answers, through it's cover. Multiple device synchronization is vital Packer Backer Another reason to allow users to set the hot word. "Hey Bub! Hey Betty! Hey Fumbduck!" would would activate three different devices. Dk Schlösser The solution is to be able to change the trigger word for each device. You can do this on Alexa. Paul Quinn Currently, only my Home responds to "Hey Google" so I use that to talk to the Home. my phones and tablets don't respond. That cuts down on the problem a bit as long as I don't want to use voice with my phone. If I say "OK Google" to my phone, the Home may also respond. A quick fix for now would be to have the option to set the Home NOT to respond to "OK Google" and only "Hey Google." Bill Riess Yeah I just recently discovered this issue when I moved from an echo and echo dot to 4 Google homes. For the most part they work pretty good but it's annoying when they pick up in the wrong room. Multiuser and Sonos integration would be great additions as well. goodnightmare I've had four of these in my home since day one. Yes, occasionally we'll get some random response from a distant device, but it doesn't affect performance. The requested task is completed properly 95% of the time and any hiccups have never been due to multiple devices trying to provide feedback. Our Google Home experience has been quite pleasant and loads of fun. DomBrady Same. I've got three. I have had one interference related issue. Charles222 Same with four here as well. I've had an interference problem with my kitchen & living room ones, but taking a few steps towards one or the other solves it. nerdshowandtell.com I also have 6 Google Homes and the issues described here I only had a month or so ago and they went away. Id also make sure you have solid wifi with no interference to eliminate any delay in the homes seeing each other. As for the random asking/talking, maybe have seen that 3 times since it came out. Definitely not in awhile. Brett Koger I also have several Google Home devices, I am not experiencing the issues you state. I even have two of them with in 20 feet (they are in different rooms) I will see both activate but only one will respond. I have only experienced what you are see a few times. It is not the norm. Paul Quinn I have noticed that situation where more than one activate but only two of them can actually be visualized at one time. To me, that's a good sign. It means they are hearing you but identifying which one should respond. Maxr1998 Hi Paul! Very entertaining and interesting article. I don't have a Google Home myself yet (not available in Germany, functionality in German is likely pretty limited (as seen in Assistant on phones), my Home Assistant setup isn't supported by Google Home/Google Assistant, and IFTTT is too slow (10 seconds+) atm), but the idea of having one is very intriguing for me :) Paul Quinn Hi Max! I guess one plus side of living in another country is that Google works out bugs in the United States before it expands across the globe. Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get it functional:P But it's still sometimes a little annoying for power users wanting the latest and the greatest regardless of bugs ;) Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get it functional. 😜 But it's still sometimes a little annoying to not get the latest and greatest stuff being a poweruser ;) Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get them functional. 😜 But it's still sometimes a little annoying to not get the latest and greatest stuff being a poweruser ;) JD So it's not just me. Alexa is just that much better with its spatial recognition. It has a 100% hit rate on responding on the right unit. Sandeep Raghuraman One solution to your problem - setup mic + speakers in each room, and use one Google Home. That way, only one Google Home device will respond. Although, the next problem would be, how does Google Home decide which mic to listen through? Maybe a device that mixes all of those input streams from the different mics? Nick Riviera Try power cycling your units to keep them from talking over one another. sucatrops If you bought 6 Google Homes and didn't expect more than one to respond to you, you should shoot yourself. Hector Diaz Amazon echo has far field recognition between Echos so Google can include that with a software update. Ryan I dont see the need to have one in all 6 rooms of my home. Having one in the open air living/dining room and kitchen is plenty, it hears me from 40 feet no matter what. Then another in my bedroom. I dont think I need them in the guest rooms. Maybe one in the office, but that is all the way on the other side of the house from the bedroom. Maybe 6 is the overkill. Paul Quinn I have smart lighting in all the main rooms of the house. I wouldn't want any of us to be yelling from room to adjust lighting in another. I did put in remotes in the rooms as well because you should have another option besides voice. I think for most people, one or two is plenty. I'm really into smart home technology despite its incredibly fragmented implementation right now. I know my house is going beyond the norm. The fact that yours hear you from 40 feet away is what is causing the downfall in my house. Đức Thành 6 Google Homes? You're a crazy man. I like you. 6 is still nowhere near enough, though. Hector Diaz I have 2 echo Dot and 1 Echo. Missing still 2 echo Dot. So he is not crazy just want to have a real smart home doesn't matter where he stands like me. Andrew Hartley It was clear Paul was a bit 'unusual' from the moment he mentioned the Enterprise. I've been teaching science using the latest technology for 30+ and my dream has always been to walk into my classroom in the morning and for a cute sounding female voice to welcome me from my computer with a good morning asking me what I would like to do today. Google home I found you at last 😉 That doesn't sound weird does it 😎 Paul Quinn Sounds fantastic! D.Smithee I like when you're home alone in a quiet house and this thing starts spouting gibberish with no warning. Paul Quinn Tonight.... one of the Homes (in the office) decided to "forget" the lights in the room. Just the lights in the room that it's in. It kept saying there were no lights set up for that room. The remote went dead too. It was darkness. But... it let me operate the lights from other Homes. No I'm starting to wonder if Google read this... and is toying with me. I got the remote back online. The Home is still protesting. Bill3 Hi Paul, not sure what's going on there. I have three Google Homes and have only had that happen once or twice. They'll often beep together, but only one will answer. It could be a problem with your WiFi network. Are they connected to different AP points? Paul Quinn Yes. Despite two of them being closer to another access point in my house, I've kept the Homes on the primary router which is able to deliver a strong enough signal throughout the house. I use an access point to guarantee a connection to the irrigation controller outside. abc Oh, god. People are buying not more than one of this beta product. Are they rich or just plain stupid? Kostas 💪🎩 Man I laughed hard. Well written! DragoCubed 🎪 👻 👋 hi paul papastevez Where the ^*#} is the Google play movies integration??? Seriously, Netflix, a third party has been working for months and months. Lars Jeppesen I have 3 GH, and I've never had the problems described in the article. /edit And Hi to Paul, of course :) twighahn I think back to the smart homes of yesteryear. They had an intercom, radio, and auto switches. Now it's all more automatic and more personalised. Michael Paul, did you realize Google Home can only play your music library using a playlist? It cannot pull up a single or album or artist from your library.

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 125 Plus 1 on G+ 278 Share on Facebook 78 Share on Twitter Total Shares481 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 141k 106k Latest Deals 14 [Deal Alert] Get a 75" Sony LED UHD Android TV from Best Buy for $2150 today ($650 off) 2017/04/15 4:13pm PDTApr 15, 2017 19 [Deal Alert] Huawei Watch in Black Stainless Steel w/metal band $250 ($100 off) 2017/04/14 6:36pm PDTApr 14, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] 55 temporarily free and on-sale apps to round out your week 2017/04/14 12:50pm PDTApr 14, 2017 13 [Deal Alert] 2-Pack 6' Anker USB 3.0 A to C cables $12 w/ promo ($8 off) 2017/04/13 4:16pm PDTApr 13, 2017 32 [Deal Alert] NVIDIA is having a SHIELD gaming spring sale 2017/04/13 2:17pm PDTApr 13, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?

Some Pixel and Nexus fingerprint sensors not working after Android 7.1.2 update Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 12:17pm PDTApr 14, 2017 65 Plus 1 on G+ 79 Share on Facebook 73 Share on Twitter Total Shares217 Bug Watch Device Updates News Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel XL A number of Google Pixel and Nexus users are reporting that their fingerprint sensor is no longer working after the latest Android OS update. Several members of the Pixel and Nexus communities on Google's product forums have encountered the issue since installing the Android Nougat 7.1.2 OTA. The issue appears to be affecting both the Pixel and Pixel XL, as well as the LG-made Nexus 5X and Huawei Nexus 6P. Reports suggest that while the Pixel and Nexus Imprint sensors are no longer granting access to the devices, the swipe down for notifications Moves gesture is still functional. Attempts to solve the problem by deleting pre-existing fingerprints and starting from scratch haven't worked, as error messages are preventing new prints from being added to the devices. As usual, we'll update if we hear any official word from Google about the issue, hopefully regarding a fix.

Provided Google does not get the article Removed VAVAMk_2 Same thereasoner Same here with my Pixel. Suicide_Note No issues on my XL or 6P. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 6p has never given me those issues either... But it is slower than most newer scanners. Nick Which is to be expected. It's still fine. Jeff Neston By stating no problems, expect to get boot loop on your nexus 6. See the CNET article on nexus 5 and 6. Provided Google does not get the article defeated. If you do get it expect to lose all unsaved data. Then if want refund you will need to go to court. Sean Please GO AWAY....you have said this TWICE.......Its NOT the Nexus 5 and 6 Mr Brainiac....its the 5X and 6P......which are TOTALLY different than the Nexus 5 and Nexus 6. Max Same here with my XL. elav Me too. No issues on my XL.. Nicholas Matranga My Nexus 5x works just fine after the update. kalehv Sometimes my Pixel XL asks for pattern even after it recognizes my fingerprint (no, I am not talking about the first time after reboot). Rebooting the device works but why does this happen? Nathan Bryant I've also experienced this. It's random. Not so often it's a bother for me. kalehv Yup not so often with me either but being a mobile developer what bothers me is this happening, not the inconvenience it causes. Nathan Bryant That totally makes sense. I assume it's some kind of error even though it's not stating that it is. I don't see the pattern or constant of what causes it when it happens. mattcoz It does that after more than 48 hours have passed since you've last used your pattern. kalehv Nop its not that either. It does that after 4 hours I think. And it should do that only once after 4 hours but not keep doing that until you reboot. mattcoz It's definitely 48 hours, that comes straight from Google. But if it continues to do so, then that's something else. Mgamerz I've had it happen on my Nexus, it just occasionally requires a PIN. Says it's 4 hours of non usage but that doesn't seem true, sometimes I wake up and no pin and sometimes I'll be on and off the phone and it'll require a pin. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Typical. Google needs to fire some of their geniuses and hire some diligent coders, and also diligent testers for their QA department (assuming they even have one -- I sincerely doubt it). Alex Cruz Where did Google touch you? Middlefinger Oh really. Nexus/Pixel/Google error 4.453.563 this year alone. Im shocked (not really). Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Best hot steaming pile of dog s**t 2016. DragoCubed Google has been going downhill lately - at least with mobile excluding iOS. It's such a shame. They haven't exactly gone downhill haven't they? They've stayed the same SpeakethTheTruth I think you might be on to something with that last paragraph. Cause for real, quality control is out of control right now. sebastianer If fixed my 6P bad battery life and early shutdown only replacing the stock Huawei battery with other battery with different brand (no need to wipe the phone in the process...) Several people did the same and is enjoying the battery life they were having when they bought the phone more than a year ago: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3534410 You could even try a Huawei battery replacement...but they say they aren't original. I just went for another brand because of the bad experience I had with the stock battery durability I don't know in the Pixel. But in the 6P in 90% of the cases...this is just a problem of the Huawei stock battery. Kendall Gustafson “Pixel”, the word sounds like the color pink. “Pixel” sounds like a little girl’s toy. Most men would never put a phone in their pocket named “Pixel” unless they were a cross/dresser. The word “Pixel” equates to a 50% loss of market share from the male market. “Nexus”, the word does not sound female or male. “Nexus”, the word sounds like science, desirable to any man, woman, or child. “Nexus”, the word sound like domination of market share. kalehv Hahaha that made me laugh. No I do not agree. I am a Pixel owner man and I am not whatever you said they'd be if they owned one but I laughed for some reason.

It blows my mind been on 7.1.2 sense the factory imgs dropped Sean Same for me.....my Pixel XL hasnt had a single reported issue so far......... Donovan Goodwin Using mine actually causes phone to restart. Updating to 7.1.2 caused this and it even happens on ROMs. JG W00t! For once I don't suffer from Atrem's Luck... My 5X still lets me in with my fingerprint :) Doomberg I updated just last night. Glad I didn't get hit with this issue. nickarli 6P - had 4 fingers registered, right index stopped working after the update but other 3 still fully functional. I thought it was the massive amount of Utah dust in my fingers all of a sudden, but I guess not Defenestratus There's that vaunted Google QA again. This is how you get more Samsung. New_Guy Yep Mark Curtis What do you mean "this is how you get more Samsung"? 4Ui812 Why is Google having app many issues with the Fixel ? Sruly J Except since it's also affecting Nexus devices, this is more of a software issue in 7.1.2 than a hardware issue for Pixel devices. Defenestratus Because IIRC they use Agile software development. Agile is how you get shitty software. Lawstorant I've never thought I would say such thing, but I'm getting fed up with all the "issues" Google is facing with every update. On the Nexus 6, they went as far as to roll it back to 7.0. They should really step up their game especially if, they are fully responsible for every aspect of the device from now on. EvilHowl No issues on my 5X wade_county I thought these Pixels weren't supposed to be beta products? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They aren't. They're outrageously expensive alpha products. And they even have one defect (halo-cam) that can't be fixed in software. Still the best steaming pile of dog s**t of 2016, though. Everyone should buy one. Everyone who likes dog s**t anyway. Apparently people do, since HTC has shipped 2 million since launch. Kougeru I bad a Pixel for a week and took dozens of photos with no halo Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good for you. Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of 22 Pixel pictures had halos. None of the 22 G6 pictures had halos. They were all pictures of the same things, obviously with the same lighting. Google admits it's a design defect. If Google admits it, it's kind of hard to pretend it doesn't exist. whispy_snippet No one denies it's an issue. But what you seem incapable of accepting is it's a very minor issue that only very rarely rears its head. If you actively try to shoot an image with a strong light source angled towards the sensor (something you generally don't do because it often results in a poor shot on any camera) you might experience a halo effect. Might. But I've got literally hundreds of photos taken with my Pixel with no halos. You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want to fuel your juvenile rage fits. But people who actually use a Pixel every day don't seem to have a problem worth caring about. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It has nothing to do with a strong light source angled toward the sensor. That's normal lens flare. The Pixel halos are NOT normal lens flare. Like I said 4 out of 22 pictures. That's 18% of the pictures they took, and they didn't have strong light sources angled toward the sensor. 18% is not a rare problem, especially when the G6 NEVER had halos with the same exact pictures. Google admitted it's a flaw. Get over yourself and stop trying to justify it. whispy_snippet And like I said, I've taken hundreds of pictures and have seen a halo perhaps a couple of times. And I take a lot of photos given video and photography is my day job - indeed one of the reasons I chose the Pixel is because I wanted the best phone camera available for the times I don't have my proper gear with me. I've seen countless comparisons between the Pixel, iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 edge and while they're all great, in most situations the Pixel takes what I consider the better shot. You're making mountains out of molehills and carrying on like a right twat in the process. P. Sherman ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE DOESN'T MEAN JACKS--- if in scientific tests under controlled environments and the same conditions, the Pixel produced the halo effect, which Google has acknowledged to be a design deficiency standard on LITERALLY EVERY PIXEL MADE, but other cameras feature no such halo effect. FFS whispy_snippet I'm not denying there's an issue! I'm saying it's being blown out of proportion by people who want to blow it out of proportion. P. Sherman Referencing a scientific, controlled test and camera comparison is NOT blowing this out of proportion. Blowing out of proportion would be something how the Wall Street Journal set out to destroy PewDiePie for boneheadedly saying "Death to all Jews" as a joke. But referencing a camera comparison in exactly the same conditions and one phone had a halo effect but the other didn't is science, fact, nothing to blow out of proportion there. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good luck arguing with a Google fanboy in deep denial. thereasoner He's actually making solid points, the Pixels do have the best cameras overall​ and all smartphone cameras have some issues. whispy_snippet No, no. I'm a fanboy! Get it right! Cecil Hardwood Are you sure the Pixel has the best camera ? The reason I ask is because the DxOMark site that claims this refuses to release the iPhone 7 Plus (Not iPhone 7) scores and many believe it is because it scored higher than the Pixel. The theory goes on to say that Google is using their score in their advertising and DxO doesn't want to piss off Google. Something weird is going on for sure. DxO claimed long ago the review was coming soon and should have been out by now with the iPhone 7 Plus having been on the market as long as it has. thereasoner If I'm to make a judgment personally then I would say that probably the top 3-4 cameras on flagships are very close and what's best as far as the user is concerned is subjective. Do you prefer low light performance(I do) or digital zoom? Do your favour widespread angle lens or fast launch/focus etc. Those are personal preferences that make "the best " phone different for different people. That said, as far as reviews are concerned the Pixel is generally considered the best over all. As far as your conspiracy theories go, who knows? Anyone can create those about anything but I guess but I'm thinking that other than digital zoom and an artsy photo effect the 7+ cameras are very similar to the 7. whispy_snippet The iPhone 7 Plus is the same as the iPhone 7 apart from an additional, slower lens. In terms of raw image quality the iPhone 7 Plus achieves its best results with the lens it shares with its smaller sibling. So basically, it'll score no better than the 7. It's effectively already been tested. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All smartphone cameras have some issues? What issues does the G6 camera have in the comparison I linked? 23% of the Pixel photos have halo issues. Find a serious issue with 23% of the G6 photos and get back to us. thereasoner Keep in mind that if you take wide-angle shots, angles will be distorted and elongated from the side, especially when it comes to selfies with the front-facing camera. I also found that the front-facing camera takes relatively muddy shots in low-light. Compared to the Pixel XL, OnePlus 3T and (for the time being since we don't have the S8) the Galaxy S7, the G6 is on par with its rivals. The Pixel XL takes superior low-light images than all the phones though, and I prefer the richer contrast and saturation of the S7 by just a tad. -CNET There are a ton of reviews from various sources just like this and while the G6 cameras are considered very nice they do have their shortcomings and generally rank below the Pixel cameras overall. whispy_snippet Purple flaring and chromatic aberation. It's extremely noticeable in at least four images you shared with the Pixel comparison. Here you are: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration And just Google search purple flaring. Sorry to burst your bubble. whispy_snippet Show me the link to the test. I would like to see it. Even if their results suggest there's an issue (which there is as we all agree), the significance of the results can still be blown out of proportion which is what we're seeing occur in this ridiculous discussion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Here you go again. phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ Now that I've viewed the pics again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. Two involve a bright light. The other 3 do not. So that's 23% of 22 pictures. I wouldn't say that's blowing things out of proportion. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. Yeah, you paid a lot for your Pixel, so you have a hard time admitting it's a steaming pile of dog s**t. I understand. whispy_snippet Yep, so as we've agreed, halos sometimes appear in shots with strong light sources pointing at or angled towards the edge of the sensor. But let's just ignore the purple flaring and chromatic aberation in at least four of the images from the LG, right? You're demonstrating selective criticism. Every camera has strengths and weaknesses but on balance, the Pixel offers better images than competing phones more often than not. My position is unchanged. You're both making mountains out of molehills, and in no way does this "scientific" test guarantee that 23% of photos taken with a Pixel will exhibit a halo. It simply shows 23% of photos taken in this example demonstrated halos. You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. No one ever said the Pixel is perfect. But only you two are using ridiculous, extreme labels like "steaming pile of dog shit" and "HARDWARE DEFICIENCY" as though using capital letters makes your odd ball assertions more valid. Most reputable tech reviewers agree the Pixel has the best overall smartphone camera. You're entitled to disagree. P. Sherman 4/22. 4/22 photos from the Pixel have a halo effect. That's from Phandroid. That's 18% of photos the Pixel. That alone is damning. Google themselves have acknowledged that it is a HARDWARE DEFICIENCY and software fixes have done little to address this. They admitted it was there, that's all we need. If you knew that 4/22 Burritos Chipotle made would give you the Runs, but ZERO/22 Burritos Taco Bell made would, would YOU still choose to eat at Chipotle? whispy_snippet Show me the test! I've asked twice now. P. Sherman Lena Flare was removed from the photos, but not the video. http://highonandroid.com/android-smartphone-news/the-truth-about-google-pixel-camera-halolens-flare-effect/ Also, someone in the official Google forums shot with their Pixel and Nexus 6P in the same Time, conditions, everything. Guess what? https://support.google.com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsrROqMaXHqHg/?hl=by Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ 3 halos are obvious, 1 is subtle. The subtle one is where the picture is looking up at a building's windows. Now that I've viewed them again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. tigerstown I paid $380 for my new pixel XL so it's not a lot and I have no Halo in my pics I have proven this on Twitter already. abc More fanboy logic. I took pictures so everything is fine. Anyone who says its not fine is crazy. whispy_snippet How ridiculous. So a blogger takes 22 photos in various conditions and his experience is valid, but my experience of owning the phone and taking hundreds of photos in various conditions is not valid. You guys are weirdos. Andy But do you see problems with low light pics. I do on my wife's pixel. IPhone Looks so much better. I'm so disappointed abc I saw a rainbow once. Oh, are we not just conveying pointless ancedotes? mr.fozzo On my Nex6P, I have noticed that the Fingerprint reader has been less reliable lately. It requires more presses than the usual 1 press. Besnik Rrustemi My Nexus 6P working excellent so far, no battery problems, no fingerprint problems (better standby times on 7.1.2 to be honest). But yes,i can agree that fingerprint was much faster when i first got the device on 6.0 Marshmallow (for unlocking the device with the fingerprint) now it takes like 2 full seconds for that :( jimv1983 No issues on my Nexus 5X and the swipe on the sensor to bring down the notification panel is great. Alex Harrison Flashed the OTA myself on my 5X. No issues with it. Jeff Neston At least it is just the sensor. My nexus 5 was bricked by a Google update.. it got the boot loop. Google support lied to me claiming I broke the power button. False it was not broken. I ended up going small claims case against Google. They settled, but wanted me to sign gag order. Sorry, no way. I sent it back and got complete refund. Sneaky company. What probably causes boot loop update to occur is phone on long time. Some apps get memory leak over time. System then unpredictably unstable. Then the system does auto uplate from Google without asking user NOR even rebooting or turning off prior to the update. Then during update, Os gets corrupted. Then after failed update phone reboots thinking the. Update completed. Now phones dead. And Google not bother to address the issue. Pdiddy187 My 5x fingerprint sensor was great until it bootlooped yesterday morning. LG is going to repair it under warranty even though it's well out of warranty. La Kiesha Rodriguez Barrientes I have the ZTE axon 7 and over a month now google hasn't addressed a fix for the play store not loading apps over data or Wi-Fi.. Without uninstalling updates to play store and then maybe will not say "waiting for network" so frustrating and then maybe download once and have to do that everytime.. Dumb.. P. Sherman That's been like that since KitKat. F------ KITKAT. ahnafm Is google reacommodating their customers now? Brett Delia I thought some positive feedback was worth being added. My Nexus 6P is working perfectly after the update. I've had generally a great experience with all my Android phones. I've had an iPhone as well as a Windows mobile phone as well in my past. None have been as feature packed as my Android devices. New_Guy This and all the other ridiculous issues with the Pixel is a big reason I stick with Samsung... flyonthewall Lol Fernando S Mine is working ok in my Nexus 5x running 7.1.2.

ThisGuyFUX This is now icing on top of the cake, for anyone whom has enjoyed watching this crash and burn. If I paid $850+ for a Pixel, I'd be pursuing class action litigation by now. Slow clap. Sean Except its only affecting about 1% of the Pixels sold.........so......slow clap for you....... 2kool4skool It's gonna be sucks when you're in the 1%. And I doubt it's 1% anyway, this is probably the 20th article I've read about pixel's problems. That's alot.

Brian White Nexus 5x, running fine here ddevito If it wasn't for my OnePlus 3 I'd be on an iPhone. thereasoner One plus has their own issues/lousy support and the iPhone? They're the worst of them all when it comes to buggy software and hardware issues bricking devices ! ddevito Not sure I'd agree with you. My iPhone 6s hums along swimmingly without any issues. The more I use it the more I am leaning towards going back to an iPhone full-time. Apple, love them or hate them, knows how to deliver products, and support them. Period. thereasoner I'm glad that your iPhone 6s isn't affected by the many flawed updates and hardware issues​ that have plagued various iPhones over the years but the fact remains that Apple has faced class action lawsuits filed by their own customers for serious issues like Touch Disease and error 53 and for good reason. They have the worst track record of them all and to make things worse they're known for both ignoring iPhone issues until said class action lawsuits are launched and/or blaming their customers for the iPhone hardware/software problems. BTW, my Pixel "hums along swimmingly" as well, that doesn't mean issues with the Pixel don't exist much less those far more serious issues found on iPhones ! MisterKraky I'm not having the fingerprint sensor issue myself, but after updating to 7.1.2, I can no longer install or update any apps! On a Verizon-issued Pixel here. Đức Thành What happened to all the testing, Google? It seems they have become too reliant on using Nexus users for beta-testing and now can't seem to do a proper job on their own.

Name: Subject: Message: One of Alphabet’s other divisions has made its own health-themed smartwatch Newsby John Callaham16 hours ago 2 279 7 While Google and its third-party partners have been quite busy launching Android Wear-based smartwatches over the past few years, another company under Google’s parent organization Alphabet has been quietly working on a smartwatch of its own. Today, that company, Verily, announced some of the details of that device, called the Study Watch. See also: Best smartwatches 3 days ago Verily’s main business is to develop and release tools to help doctors collect health data, and that’s what the Study Watch is all about. In a blog post, Verily says the display on this watch only shows the day and time to the user, so you won’t be able to run any apps or even see how far you have walked in one day. Instead, it’s what is in the watch that’s important. Verily says it contains a number of sensors designed to collect data, including a person’s heart rate, electrodermal activity, and inertial movements. All of the data is collected and encrypted on the device for security, and after that it’s uploaded to Verily’s cloud servers for processing using machine learning. The blog post doesn’t offer much in the way of specifics for the watch’s hardware, but it does say it’s been designed to last up to a week on a single charge. It also has an unnamed but powerful processor, along with a lot of internal storage to keep all of that encrypted data secure. Verily says it plans to use the Study Watch in at least a couple of projects, including one that is looking to help identify any patterns in the progression of Parkinson’s disease. It will also be used to collect data to create a “baseline” level of health in order to explore how a normal healthy person transitions into one that is sick. Needless to say, the Study Watch will not be sold to the general public.

Now it's coming to Google. The world's largest search engine is rolling out a new feature that places "Fact Check" tags on snippets of articles in its News results. (AP Photo/Marcio Jose Sanchez, File)   Mark Bergen Bloomberg     First fact-checking came to Facebook. Now it's coming to Google. The world's largest search engine is rolling out a new feature that places "Fact Check" tags on snippets of articles in its News results. The Alphabet unit had already run limited tests. Now it has extended the capability to every listing in its News pages and massive search catalog. This is the latest sign Google is responding to mounting pressure to police content it hosts online after criticism the company, and other internet firms, help spread misinformation. Google isn't entirely giving up its usual hands-off approach: The company is letting others do the fact-checking. The approach is meant to legitimize or question claims online, Google said in a blog post. Checked search results list the name of the person or group making the assertion and the determination of the fact-checker. Although Google is working with established fact-checking organizations, like PolitiFact and Snopes, it's also opening up the system to publishers including The Washington Post and The New York Times. In theory, media organizations could use the new feature to fact-check each other. Or publishers could give different verdicts on the veracity of the same article. "These fact checks are not Google's and are presented so people can make more informed judgments," Google said. "Even though differing conclusions may be presented, we think it's still helpful for people to understand the degree of consensus around a particular claim and have clear information on which sources agree." While any publisher can apply to add fact-check labels to content, Google search algorithms will determine whether they appear in results, a spokeswoman said. The company plans to reserve the label for search results about addressable public claims of fact, rather than opinion. Publishers can write the labels that appear next to results. Examples include "True," "Mostly False," or "Pants on Fire!" (a favorite of PolitiFact). Outcry over the influence of misinformation, or "fake news," began after the U.S. presidential election. Facebook, a leading driver of online traffic to publishers in the U.S., took the brunt of criticism. On Thursday, the company introduced new features in its flagship social network designed to show users how to detect false news. But Google has not been immune to scrutiny. Critics have pointed to several instances of inaccurate and misleading articles surfacing in search results. Such examples are particularly stark when Google delivers what it finds in the form of tiny snippets, a priority for the company in recent years. "From our perspective, there should just be no situation where fake news gets distributed, so we are all for doing better here," Google Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai told BBC News shortly after the U.S. election. Google is not paying publications or fact-checking organizations. A spokeswoman for Google said articles that used the new fact-check label would not be ranked differently in search results.

Here are the steps on how users can activate YouTube dark mode.  ( Christopher Furlong | Getty Images ) Advertisement Advertisement YouTube has a hidden dark mode that can be activated by users, which will help reduce eye strain when watching videos on the online streaming service. The Google-owned YouTube recently announced that users from all over the world are now watching 1 billion hours of videos daily on the platform. The hidden dark mode will likely prove to be useful for at least some of these users. How To Activate YouTube Dark Mode The hidden dark mode of YouTube can only be activated through Google's Chrome, and it will require users to navigate the internet browser's developer tools. The steps to activate the secret feature, however, are pretty easy to follow. Here is how to activate YouTube's dark mode: 1. Users will first need to update their Chrome browser to its latest version. 2. After updating the Chrome browser, users will need to visit YouTube and log in with their own account. 3. Users will then have to open the internet browser's Developer Tools. This can be done on Windows by pressing the Ctrl + Shift + I keys, and on Mac by pressing the Command + Option + I keys. This will open up a panel on Chrome's right side. 4. Users should click on the Console tab in the newly opened panel, and then on the input box at the bottom, paste the following code: document.cookie="VISITOR_INFO1_LIVE=fPQ4jCL6EiE" 5. After pasting the code, press Enter, close the Developer Tools panel, and then refresh the browser. 6. Clicking on the profile icon at the top right corner of the website will now call up a more extensive list of options. One of these options is for the hidden dark mode, the switch for which can be toggled to activate the hidden feature. Benefits Of Using YouTube's Dark Mode The hidden dark mode feature, which has not yet been officially announced by YouTube, will convert the predominantly white background of the online video streaming service to a mostly black one. Activating dark mode will make it easier on the eyes when visiting YouTube at night, so users will be able to devote more time to watching videos. For some users, enabling dark mode will simply make YouTube look so much better, which is already a good enough reason on its own. However, there is a catch. Whenever users restart Chrome, YouTube will go back to its default look. It will be fairly easy though to keep a copy of the code on the desktop and input it in the Developer Tools console whenever a user wants to again activate YouTube's dark mode. Hopefully Google receives word on how popular the hidden feature is and formally announce YouTube dark mode soon as an easily accessible and retainable feature for the online video streaming service. More Google Chrome Tips For users who would like to improve the speed of their Google Chrome browser, here are 10 tips to do so. Google Chrome also has hidden features, and here are five of them to try out, including Find My Phone and Chrome Experiments. TAG Youtube, Google © 2017 Tech Times, All rights reserved.

In the 15-second ad, a Burger King employee says, “OK, Google. What is the Whopper burger?” If viewers are watching the commercial near a Google Home gadget, the “OK Google” prompt will cause the device to read the Wikipedia entry for the sandwich. The TV spots are airing nationally starting Wednesday on networks such as Spike, MTV and Comedy Central. Share this story The whopper burger from the Burger King fastfood francise at the Foreshore. Picture Ian Landsberg The commercial extends Burger King’s record of trying to push the envelope with its marketing. In 2015, the restaurant chain sought a “truce” with rival McDonald’s Corp. by offering to create a peace burger called the McWhopper. It also brought back its deliberately creepy King mascot in recent years. The character loomed in the background during the much-hyped boxing match of Floyd Mayweather-Manny Pacquiao in 2015. The Google stunt could renew concerns about whether voice-activated technology has unintended consequences. Amazon.com Inc.’s Echo devices and Samsung Electronics's smart televisions have faced criticism from privacy groups over the extent of the conversations and data that they track. Read also: Burger King's saucy response to Big Mac Day The Echo, which answers to “Alexa,” also lets consumers buy products with quick voice commands - creating the potential for accidental orders. Trailing Alexa Burger King, owned by Restaurant Brands International, said it’s not collaborating with Alphabet’s Google on the ads. But the plug could give a boost to a device that is playing catch-up with the Echo. Analysts estimate that Google shipped about 500 000 units in the first quarter after the Home product debuted late last year. “It’s a cool way, and a bold way, to surprise our guests,” said Jose Cil, president of the Burger King brand. The company believes the interaction will be “very positive,” he said. A broader US restaurant slump is forcing restaurant chains like Burger King to vie more fiercely for customers. Some have introduced new menu items and value deals, while others have increased advertising to boost customer traffic. McDonald’s began offering $1 and $2 drink specials this month, while Wendy’s has been remodeling stores and touting its fresh beef. Burger King also rolled out a new version of its chicken sandwich last month, and it enlisted “haters” - people who criticised the old sandwich on social media - to market the revamped item. “Burger King has been doing creative, innovative things for a long time,” Cil said. “It’s something that we feel strongly about.” -With assistance from Craig Giammona and Mark Bergen.

The app was already available on Android devices after last month's launch. We know that the app is made keeping parents in mind, who wish to monitor their children's online activity. The app allows the users to see things like screen time and apps downloaded from Google Play. One can also set restrictions on the internet use of their kids. Previously the Family Link app could only monitor android devices through a connected Google account, but the new iOS version of the app doesn't require the users to own an android device. People now have the option to monitor their kids' Android devices using an iPhone as well. You can use the app to monitor any Android device that runs on Nougat. Also Read: Google could be prepping a device codenamed 'Bisto' All you need to do is, make a Google account within the app. You can set time restrictions and see which apps are being opened by your children. You can set a bed time and even lock the device for some time. In addition to this, Family Link enables you to block certain apps from Google Play. However, the iOS version of the app seems to have the same features as its Android counterpart. It is expected that the app will now get more attention as there are a lot of iPhone users in the US. When Family Link was first unveiled in March, Google said that people would have to request to join the program as the app was still in its developing stage. With the launch of iOS version, we may assume that the app is working all fine now.

On the one hand, hundreds of fake movie, TV show and other links to shady 'pirate' sites have been posted on the platform. On the other, sloppy anti-piracy companies are attempting to delist thousands of legitimate Discog links from Google. It’s often claimed that pirate sites only exist to generate revenue from other people’s hard work, but there are plenty of other entities making money from the online piracy boom too. For every few dozen pirate sites on the Internet, there’s an anti-piracy outfit claiming that it can claw profits back for copyright holders. Whether or not they live up to these promises is up for debate, but there can be big differences in how these companies go about their trade. While some clearly strive to be accurate, others make errors that are so huge it raises questions whether there’s much oversight at all. Case in point, the recent wave of DMCA notices targeting Discogs. For those out of the loop, Discogs is one of the best music databases on the Internet. From its inception in 2000, it has crowdsourced information on 8,400,000 recordings and 5,000,000 artists across all genres, with a particular emphasis on electronic and dance. The site also has a massive marketplace offering more than 23 million titles for sale. According to anti-piracy outfit Rivendell, however, Discogs is actually a hub of pirate activity. For the past several weeks on an almost daily basis, Rivendell has been bombarding Google with requests to delist thousands of Discogs URLs, claiming that the site infringes its clients’ copyrights. A small sample is shown in the image below. Bogus Discogs Takedown Requests What’s most annoying about these bogus reports is that in many cases they target the work of Discog contributors, who volunteer their time to build one of the most comprehensive databases available today. The site actually works as a brilliant promotional platform, but Rivendell seems intent on making content as difficult to find as possible. With that in mind, it’s likely that considering their aggressive attitude towards Napster, Metallica won’t appreciate the irony of their listings being repeatedly targeted by the anti-piracy outfit. Just one of the pages targeted Fortunately for Discogs, Google appears to be rejecting the bogus complaints filed by Rivendell which means that its listings are safe for now. However, the music database site has another piracy related problem to deal with, again through no fault of its own. As illustrated via the custom Google search below, Discogs is being used by spammers to promote ‘pirate’ downloads. Pages and pages of results are available for a wide range of video content, from TV shows such as The Walking Dead to Hollywood movies. Site-specific searches (such as Putlocker and Vodlocker) yield plenty of results, as do more generic terms such as ‘free’, ‘download’, and ‘HD’. However, for those thinking this might be a good way to download a movie or TV show for free, think again. In common with most online spam, these ‘pirate’ entries on Discogs are often worse than useless, leading unsuspecting users to fake streaming sites that probably deliver malware, subscription traps, or other content best avoided. Fake movie streaming anyone? But of course, if they can’t tell the difference between a database entry on Discogs and a pirate music download site, anti-piracy outfits won’t be able to tell the difference between a scam and copyright infringement. To that end, they’ve been taking down fake pages too. Taking down fake entries It must be said though, that since these pages are designed to deceive, it shouldn’t be a surprise that some get caught up in the anti-piracy dragnet. It’s actually one of the few situations where most people would welcome a wrongful takedown. At the time of publication, Discogs had not responded to our request for comment.

It's great at getting us from A to B and allows us to check the traffic situation before we set off on a journey or share our real-time location with friends. It's also handy if you want to revisit old haunts, take a virtual walk down a street or check out a place you have to find. Until recently, users could also suggest edits and make revisions on the map database - but not anymore. This function had allowed maps to be updated with valuable local knowledge as building or construction changes were made. OTHER NEWS: How you can LEGALLY use a mobile phone as a sat nav while driving Users have been able to take advantage of this option since 2008 and it meant maps were kept fresh and up-to-date by people in the know. However, sadly, because the edit function was open to all users, it meant that it got abused - meaning all suggestions had to be moderated. Given the sheer volume of suggestions, the task of moderating each one was enormous - and proved to be too large for Google Maps to continue to offer the function. OTHER NEWS: What to do if you think your boss is underpaying you According to the Mirror Online, Google released a statement explaining their decision: "Since 2008, the Google Map Make community has edited and moderated millions of features to improve the Google Maps experience. "To make it easier for all Google Maps users to contribute changes to the map, we've started to graduate functionality from Map Maker to Google Maps on both desktop and mobile. "We'll continue to add new editing features within Google Maps on an ongoing basis. "To keep contributing your local knowledge to Google Maps and engage with a passionate community of like-minded individuals, we invite you to join the Local Guides programme." LOOKING FOR A NEW JOB?

Some Pixel and Nexus fingerprint sensors not working after Android 7.1.2 update Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 12:17pm PDTApr 14, 2017 65 Plus 1 on G+ 79 Share on Facebook 73 Share on Twitter Total Shares217 Bug Watch Device Updates News Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel XL A number of Google Pixel and Nexus users are reporting that their fingerprint sensor is no longer working after the latest Android OS update. Several members of the Pixel and Nexus communities on Google's product forums have encountered the issue since installing the Android Nougat 7.1.2 OTA. The issue appears to be affecting both the Pixel and Pixel XL, as well as the LG-made Nexus 5X and Huawei Nexus 6P. Reports suggest that while the Pixel and Nexus Imprint sensors are no longer granting access to the devices, the swipe down for notifications Moves gesture is still functional. Attempts to solve the problem by deleting pre-existing fingerprints and starting from scratch haven't worked, as error messages are preventing new prints from being added to the devices. As usual, we'll update if we hear any official word from Google about the issue, hopefully regarding a fix.

Good_Ole_Pinocchio 6p has never given me those issues either... But it is slower than most newer scanners. Nick Which is to be expected. It's still fine. Jeff Neston By stating no problems, expect to get boot loop on your nexus 6. See the CNET article on nexus 5 and 6. Provided Google does not get the article defeated. If you do get it expect to lose all unsaved data. Then if want refund you will need to go to court. Sean Please GO AWAY....you have said this TWICE.......Its NOT the Nexus 5 and 6 Mr Brainiac....its the 5X and 6P......which are TOTALLY different than the Nexus 5 and Nexus 6. Max Same here with my XL. elav Me too. No issues on my XL.. Nicholas Matranga My Nexus 5x works just fine after the update. kalehv Sometimes my Pixel XL asks for pattern even after it recognizes my fingerprint (no, I am not talking about the first time after reboot). Rebooting the device works but why does this happen? Nathan Bryant I've also experienced this. It's random. Not so often it's a bother for me. kalehv Yup not so often with me either but being a mobile developer what bothers me is this happening, not the inconvenience it causes. Nathan Bryant That totally makes sense. I assume it's some kind of error even though it's not stating that it is. I don't see the pattern or constant of what causes it when it happens. mattcoz It does that after more than 48 hours have passed since you've last used your pattern. kalehv Nop its not that either. It does that after 4 hours I think. And it should do that only once after 4 hours but not keep doing that until you reboot. mattcoz It's definitely 48 hours, that comes straight from Google. But if it continues to do so, then that's something else. Mgamerz I've had it happen on my Nexus, it just occasionally requires a PIN. Says it's 4 hours of non usage but that doesn't seem true, sometimes I wake up and no pin and sometimes I'll be on and off the phone and it'll require a pin. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Typical. Google needs to fire some of their geniuses and hire some diligent coders, and also diligent testers for their QA department (assuming they even have one -- I sincerely doubt it). Alex Cruz Where did Google touch you? Middlefinger Oh really. Nexus/Pixel/Google error 4.453.563 this year alone. Im shocked (not really). Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Best hot steaming pile of dog s**t 2016. DragoCubed Google has been going downhill lately - at least with mobile excluding iOS. It's such a shame. They haven't exactly gone downhill haven't they? They've stayed the same SpeakethTheTruth I think you might be on to something with that last paragraph. Cause for real, quality control is out of control right now. sebastianer If fixed my 6P bad battery life and early shutdown only replacing the stock Huawei battery with other battery with different brand (no need to wipe the phone in the process...) Several people did the same and is enjoying the battery life they were having when they bought the phone more than a year ago: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3534410 You could even try a Huawei battery replacement...but they say they aren't original. I just went for another brand because of the bad experience I had with the stock battery durability I don't know in the Pixel. But in the 6P in 90% of the cases...this is just a problem of the Huawei stock battery. Kendall Gustafson “Pixel”, the word sounds like the color pink. “Pixel” sounds like a little girl’s toy. Most men would never put a phone in their pocket named “Pixel” unless they were a cross/dresser. The word “Pixel” equates to a 50% loss of market share from the male market. “Nexus”, the word does not sound female or male. “Nexus”, the word sounds like science, desirable to any man, woman, or child. “Nexus”, the word sound like domination of market share. kalehv Hahaha that made me laugh. No I do not agree. I am a Pixel owner man and I am not whatever you said they'd be if they owned one but I laughed for some reason. Christian Trevor Clauss I must be a cross dresser then :D mattcoz Real men aren't insecure about what their phones are named. Middlefinger Except that the Nexus sold poorly and was generally complete junk Van_Hammersly Most of us have exited adolescence. bonelesscheese https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9bd2ce0665c300ab872edc5e5fa1ef348b87f551cc01532d17bf41264dd126c1.jpg DragoCubed I'm so glad that you can block on disqus Bruce Wayne Google is really dropping the ball.

Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google: "It compiled with warnings but no errors. Must be ready to go." Bruce Wayne Nothing about Google or Android came up. What are you getting at? Middlefinger This isnt device specific, its a fault in Android itself. Google has become really bad lately with poor quality control. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Even Chrome is going to the dogs. Seriously, Google is staffed by a bunch of incompetent high-paid prima donnas. paxmos At least, Google is not charging an arm and a leg for their phones ;-) 2kool4skool Lol, $869 for a phone that doesn't have waterproofing, wireless charging, expandable storage, and ois is not charging an arm and leg? paxmos Didn't you see the wink? 2kool4skool Apologies, I just woke up and haven't fully recovered when I read your comment, my sarcasm detector didn't work really well that time. paxmos LOL, we're good Lindacbrewer Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

No need to test or anything. Too much trouble for the geniuses at Google. They're so smart that if it compiles with just warnings, there couldn't possibly be any problems. John Doe I am sure that they do test it but there are things that go wrong...obviously those bugs will be in the spotlight on an Android blog meaning in real life they are probably affecting a small number of users.

I thought it was the massive amount of Utah dust in my fingers all of a sudden, but I guess not Defenestratus There's that vaunted Google QA again. This is how you get more Samsung. New_Guy Yep Mark Curtis What do you mean "this is how you get more Samsung"? 4Ui812 Why is Google having app many issues with the Fixel ? Sruly J Except since it's also affecting Nexus devices, this is more of a software issue in 7.1.2 than a hardware issue for Pixel devices. Defenestratus Because IIRC they use Agile software development. Agile is how you get shitty software. Lawstorant I've never thought I would say such thing, but I'm getting fed up with all the "issues" Google is facing with every update. On the Nexus 6, they went as far as to roll it back to 7.0. They should really step up their game especially if, they are fully responsible for every aspect of the device from now on. EvilHowl No issues on my 5X wade_county I thought these Pixels weren't supposed to be beta products? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They aren't. They're outrageously expensive alpha products. And they even have one defect (halo-cam) that can't be fixed in software. Still the best steaming pile of dog s**t of 2016, though. Everyone should buy one. Everyone who likes dog s**t anyway. Apparently people do, since HTC has shipped 2 million since launch. Kougeru I bad a Pixel for a week and took dozens of photos with no halo Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good for you. Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of 22 Pixel pictures had halos. None of the 22 G6 pictures had halos. They were all pictures of the same things, obviously with the same lighting. Google admits it's a design defect. If Google admits it, it's kind of hard to pretend it doesn't exist. whispy_snippet No one denies it's an issue. But what you seem incapable of accepting is it's a very minor issue that only very rarely rears its head. If you actively try to shoot an image with a strong light source angled towards the sensor (something you generally don't do because it often results in a poor shot on any camera) you might experience a halo effect. Might. But I've got literally hundreds of photos taken with my Pixel with no halos. You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want to fuel your juvenile rage fits. But people who actually use a Pixel every day don't seem to have a problem worth caring about. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It has nothing to do with a strong light source angled toward the sensor. That's normal lens flare. The Pixel halos are NOT normal lens flare. Like I said 4 out of 22 pictures. That's 18% of the pictures they took, and they didn't have strong light sources angled toward the sensor. 18% is not a rare problem, especially when the G6 NEVER had halos with the same exact pictures. Google admitted it's a flaw. Get over yourself and stop trying to justify it. whispy_snippet And like I said, I've taken hundreds of pictures and have seen a halo perhaps a couple of times. And I take a lot of photos given video and photography is my day job - indeed one of the reasons I chose the Pixel is because I wanted the best phone camera available for the times I don't have my proper gear with me. I've seen countless comparisons between the Pixel, iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 edge and while they're all great, in most situations the Pixel takes what I consider the better shot. You're making mountains out of molehills and carrying on like a right twat in the process. P. Sherman ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE DOESN'T MEAN JACKS--- if in scientific tests under controlled environments and the same conditions, the Pixel produced the halo effect, which Google has acknowledged to be a design deficiency standard on LITERALLY EVERY PIXEL MADE, but other cameras feature no such halo effect. FFS whispy_snippet I'm not denying there's an issue! I'm saying it's being blown out of proportion by people who want to blow it out of proportion. P. Sherman Referencing a scientific, controlled test and camera comparison is NOT blowing this out of proportion. Blowing out of proportion would be something how the Wall Street Journal set out to destroy PewDiePie for boneheadedly saying "Death to all Jews" as a joke. But referencing a camera comparison in exactly the same conditions and one phone had a halo effect but the other didn't is science, fact, nothing to blow out of proportion there. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good luck arguing with a Google fanboy in deep denial. thereasoner He's actually making solid points, the Pixels do have the best cameras overall​ and all smartphone cameras have some issues. whispy_snippet No, no. I'm a fanboy! Get it right! Cecil Hardwood Are you sure the Pixel has the best camera ? The reason I ask is because the DxOMark site that claims this refuses to release the iPhone 7 Plus (Not iPhone 7) scores and many believe it is because it scored higher than the Pixel. The theory goes on to say that Google is using their score in their advertising and DxO doesn't want to piss off Google. Something weird is going on for sure. DxO claimed long ago the review was coming soon and should have been out by now with the iPhone 7 Plus having been on the market as long as it has. thereasoner If I'm to make a judgment personally then I would say that probably the top 3-4 cameras on flagships are very close and what's best as far as the user is concerned is subjective. Do you prefer low light performance(I do) or digital zoom? Do your favour widespread angle lens or fast launch/focus etc. Those are personal preferences that make "the best " phone different for different people. That said, as far as reviews are concerned the Pixel is generally considered the best over all. As far as your conspiracy theories go, who knows? Anyone can create those about anything but I guess but I'm thinking that other than digital zoom and an artsy photo effect the 7+ cameras are very similar to the 7. whispy_snippet The iPhone 7 Plus is the same as the iPhone 7 apart from an additional, slower lens. In terms of raw image quality the iPhone 7 Plus achieves its best results with the lens it shares with its smaller sibling. So basically, it'll score no better than the 7. It's effectively already been tested. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All smartphone cameras have some issues? What issues does the G6 camera have in the comparison I linked? 23% of the Pixel photos have halo issues. Find a serious issue with 23% of the G6 photos and get back to us. thereasoner Keep in mind that if you take wide-angle shots, angles will be distorted and elongated from the side, especially when it comes to selfies with the front-facing camera. I also found that the front-facing camera takes relatively muddy shots in low-light. Compared to the Pixel XL, OnePlus 3T and (for the time being since we don't have the S8) the Galaxy S7, the G6 is on par with its rivals. The Pixel XL takes superior low-light images than all the phones though, and I prefer the richer contrast and saturation of the S7 by just a tad. -CNET There are a ton of reviews from various sources just like this and while the G6 cameras are considered very nice they do have their shortcomings and generally rank below the Pixel cameras overall. whispy_snippet Purple flaring and chromatic aberation. It's extremely noticeable in at least four images you shared with the Pixel comparison. Here you are: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration And just Google search purple flaring. Sorry to burst your bubble. whispy_snippet Show me the link to the test. I would like to see it. Even if their results suggest there's an issue (which there is as we all agree), the significance of the results can still be blown out of proportion which is what we're seeing occur in this ridiculous discussion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Here you go again. phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ Now that I've viewed the pics again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. Two involve a bright light. The other 3 do not. So that's 23% of 22 pictures. I wouldn't say that's blowing things out of proportion. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. Yeah, you paid a lot for your Pixel, so you have a hard time admitting it's a steaming pile of dog s**t. I understand. whispy_snippet Yep, so as we've agreed, halos sometimes appear in shots with strong light sources pointing at or angled towards the edge of the sensor. But let's just ignore the purple flaring and chromatic aberation in at least four of the images from the LG, right? You're demonstrating selective criticism. Every camera has strengths and weaknesses but on balance, the Pixel offers better images than competing phones more often than not. My position is unchanged. You're both making mountains out of molehills, and in no way does this "scientific" test guarantee that 23% of photos taken with a Pixel will exhibit a halo. It simply shows 23% of photos taken in this example demonstrated halos. You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. No one ever said the Pixel is perfect. But only you two are using ridiculous, extreme labels like "steaming pile of dog shit" and "HARDWARE DEFICIENCY" as though using capital letters makes your odd ball assertions more valid. Most reputable tech reviewers agree the Pixel has the best overall smartphone camera. You're entitled to disagree. P. Sherman 4/22. 4/22 photos from the Pixel have a halo effect. That's from Phandroid. That's 18% of photos the Pixel. That alone is damning. Google themselves have acknowledged that it is a HARDWARE DEFICIENCY and software fixes have done little to address this. They admitted it was there, that's all we need. If you knew that 4/22 Burritos Chipotle made would give you the Runs, but ZERO/22 Burritos Taco Bell made would, would YOU still choose to eat at Chipotle? whispy_snippet Show me the test! I've asked twice now. P. Sherman Lena Flare was removed from the photos, but not the video. http://highonandroid.com/android-smartphone-news/the-truth-about-google-pixel-camera-halolens-flare-effect/ Also, someone in the official Google forums shot with their Pixel and Nexus 6P in the same Time, conditions, everything. Guess what? https://support.google.com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsrROqMaXHqHg/?hl=by Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ 3 halos are obvious, 1 is subtle. The subtle one is where the picture is looking up at a building's windows. Now that I've viewed them again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. tigerstown I paid $380 for my new pixel XL so it's not a lot and I have no Halo in my pics I have proven this on Twitter already. abc More fanboy logic. I took pictures so everything is fine. Anyone who says its not fine is crazy. whispy_snippet How ridiculous. So a blogger takes 22 photos in various conditions and his experience is valid, but my experience of owning the phone and taking hundreds of photos in various conditions is not valid. You guys are weirdos. Andy But do you see problems with low light pics. I do on my wife's pixel. IPhone Looks so much better. I'm so disappointed abc I saw a rainbow once. Oh, are we not just conveying pointless ancedotes? mr.fozzo On my Nex6P, I have noticed that the Fingerprint reader has been less reliable lately. It requires more presses than the usual 1 press. Besnik Rrustemi My Nexus 6P working excellent so far, no battery problems, no fingerprint problems (better standby times on 7.1.2 to be honest). But yes,i can agree that fingerprint was much faster when i first got the device on 6.0 Marshmallow (for unlocking the device with the fingerprint) now it takes like 2 full seconds for that :( jimv1983 No issues on my Nexus 5X and the swipe on the sensor to bring down the notification panel is great. Alex Harrison Flashed the OTA myself on my 5X. No issues with it. Jeff Neston At least it is just the sensor. My nexus 5 was bricked by a Google update.. it got the boot loop. Google support lied to me claiming I broke the power button. False it was not broken. I ended up going small claims case against Google. They settled, but wanted me to sign gag order. Sorry, no way. I sent it back and got complete refund. Sneaky company. What probably causes boot loop update to occur is phone on long time. Some apps get memory leak over time. System then unpredictably unstable. Then the system does auto uplate from Google without asking user NOR even rebooting or turning off prior to the update. Then during update, Os gets corrupted. Then after failed update phone reboots thinking the. Update completed. Now phones dead. And Google not bother to address the issue. Pdiddy187 My 5x fingerprint sensor was great until it bootlooped yesterday morning. LG is going to repair it under warranty even though it's well out of warranty. La Kiesha Rodriguez Barrientes I have the ZTE axon 7 and over a month now google hasn't addressed a fix for the play store not loading apps over data or Wi-Fi.. Without uninstalling updates to play store and then maybe will not say "waiting for network" so frustrating and then maybe download once and have to do that everytime.. Dumb.. P. Sherman That's been like that since KitKat. F------ KITKAT. ahnafm Is google reacommodating their customers now? Brett Delia I thought some positive feedback was worth being added. My Nexus 6P is working perfectly after the update. I've had generally a great experience with all my Android phones. I've had an iPhone as well as a Windows mobile phone as well in my past. None have been as feature packed as my Android devices. New_Guy This and all the other ridiculous issues with the Pixel is a big reason I stick with Samsung... flyonthewall Lol Fernando S Mine is working ok in my Nexus 5x running 7.1.2. It just failed once while I was on 7.1.1 and with a soft reset it came back to life Hank Is that a real screenshot in the story? Enrollment spelled wrong twice. SMH. ThisGuyFUX This is now icing on top of the cake, for anyone whom has enjoyed watching this crash and burn. If I paid $850+ for a Pixel, I'd be pursuing class action litigation by now. Slow clap. Sean Except its only affecting about 1% of the Pixels sold.........so......slow clap for you....... 2kool4skool It's gonna be sucks when you're in the 1%. And I doubt it's 1% anyway, this is probably the 20th article I've read about pixel's problems. That's alot. Probably more like 5%. abc Fortunately, not many Pixels have been sold so not many people are affected. Brian White Nexus 5x, running fine here ddevito If it wasn't for my OnePlus 3 I'd be on an iPhone. thereasoner One plus has their own issues/lousy support and the iPhone? They're the worst of them all when it comes to buggy software and hardware issues bricking devices ! ddevito Not sure I'd agree with you. My iPhone 6s hums along swimmingly without any issues. The more I use it the more I am leaning towards going back to an iPhone full-time. Apple, love them or hate them, knows how to deliver products, and support them. Period. thereasoner I'm glad that your iPhone 6s isn't affected by the many flawed updates and hardware issues​ that have plagued various iPhones over the years but the fact remains that Apple has faced class action lawsuits filed by their own customers for serious issues like Touch Disease and error 53 and for good reason. They have the worst track record of them all and to make things worse they're known for both ignoring iPhone issues until said class action lawsuits are launched and/or blaming their customers for the iPhone hardware/software problems. BTW, my Pixel "hums along swimmingly" as well, that doesn't mean issues with the Pixel don't exist much less those far more serious issues found on iPhones ! MisterKraky I'm not having the fingerprint sensor issue myself, but after updating to 7.1.2, I can no longer install or update any apps! On a Verizon-issued Pixel here. Đức Thành What happened to all the testing, Google? It seems they have become too reliant on using Nexus users for beta-testing and now can't seem to do a proper job on their own. Get your grips together, Android team. Rob H. Nougat is such a half baked disaster of an OS. It's ruined my N6. Marshmallow was soon much more stable. Thanks google keep breaking phones. jacob Cant even spell enrolment correctly. Enrollment...... PoisonApple31 Don't forget your apostrophe! Makes you look stupid when you are talking about spelling. "Can't" jacob grammar mistake not a spelling mistake :) PoisonApple31 I didn't say it was a spelling mistake. I said missing your apostrophe made you look stupid when you were talking about spelling.

Rakesh There is a known bug that after you unlock your phone the fingerprint sensor won't work for gestures - swipe down. There is no workaround for it so far other than to just press once and then it will start working. Adam Margeson Not sure what you're talking about. Doesn't seem to affect my Pixel. dontsh00tmesanta Guess I'm a lucky one mine is ok abc Premium bugs for your "premium" Pixel. mike shwilly No issues here. Not using fingerprint sensor at all though. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ LOL!! So the solution to fingerprint sensor problems is not to use it. Check. Adam Margeson No issues here and I use mine all the time! whispy_snippet Ditto. Alex Cruz Off topic but this 'Felonious Monk' guy seems like he's butt hurt over some shit hahaha Is like an ex-wife trying to 'I told you so' about some shit. Felonious Monk get some pussy bro, it helps with that butt hurt you got..... Fakhri Ahmad Microsoft should come in hard with new phones and entice all the users android has frustrated.

This is why we hate... I mean love you. LOL Pixel XL and Nexus 5x, haven't noticed this issue Pris p I'm getting an iPhone next time. I'm tired of having boot loop worries and my videos looking all pixelized on social media. I haven't even downloaded the update because I'm afraid. It shouldn't be this way Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ I'm waiting for the Note 8, but I am seriously considering switching to iPhone, instead. I'm really tired of Google's crap. squiddy20 Annnnnd this is why I have auto-updates disabled on my PIxel. That, and I have it rooted. Andy Got my wife the pixel because she wanted a great camera. Consistently her friends iPhone 6 and 7s look better in low light. Its very frustrating. Makes me look like an idiot paying all this money. Outside the pictures look amazing. But I'm disappointed in indoor pics Stevo I have the same issue!! It happened as soon as I updated my stock Nexus 6P to 7.1.2. I've called Google Fi for support and they were NO help other than trying to sell me an "upgrade" to the Pixel and FULL price?!? They also said that they haven't had harly any other complaints with this issue. Thanks for nothing Google! I've did a soft rest then a complete reset with no luck. I've heard that people have had success with down grading to 7.1.1. or flashing a custom ROM. trapchan Where're Google apologists when you need them? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Maybe they're beginning to face reality. flyonthewall WTF Google flyonthewall To the Apple fanboys here. My Macbook Pro 2012 data cable fried in 2 years due to the Macbook's poorly designed unibody which acts as a fantastic heat conductor. "Genius" store crooks said I needed a new hard drive and wanted $150. Bought a $20 cable from ebay, watched a few videos and fixed it. Running fine 3 years later. Apple has known about this issue since 2007 but has never acknkowledged it. My Pro cost me more than 1400. I have had sub 500 Windows laptops easily run 5 years.

Chris Neiger (TMFNewsie) Apr 15, 2017 at 6:42AM You may have come across the term "machine learning" while digging around for new technology ideas to invest in, or perhaps you've heard of it while researching the broader (but related) artificial intelligence space. In any case, machine learning probably isn't an idea that most investors know about, so it's worth taking the time to walk through a few basic aspects to help you get started. Let's take a quick look at where the term came from, how machine learning is being used right now, and what its market opportunity is. Of course, I'll discuss a few machine learning stocks investors should know about as well.  Image source: Getty Images. 1. What exactly is machine learning and how is it being used? Machine learning may sound like a new tech concept, but it's been around for decades. Back in 1959, the computer scientist and artificial intelligence pioneer Arthur Samuel coined the term and described it as the "field of study that gives computers the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed." Samuel worked on early machine learning systems at IBM (NYSE:IBM) and even developed a checkers program that was capable of beating a checkers master. This was a significant feat for a computer at the time (1962), and it is one of the earliest examples of artificial intelligence.    For a solid example of machine learning that we can all recognize, consider the search results provided by Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google. Lukas Biewald, the CEO of an AI company, wrote in TechCrunch last year that "What makes Google special is that it knows which matching result is the most relevant; the way that it knows is through machine learning."  Google has applied machine learning to its other businesses as well. The company's recently spun-off driverless car company, Waymo, uses machine learning to teach cars how they should react to specific situations by letting them observe how a driver, or another car, responds to certain driving scenarios.   Other tech companies are doing exciting things with machine learning as well. Graphics processing unit (GPU) maker NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) uses machine learning for computer vision, which allows computers to see and interpret what they're looking at (e.g., the cameras on a driverless car being able to identify a stop sign).  2. How big will this market be? Many estimates for the machine learning market are lumped together with the broader artificial intelligence market, but a few specific estimates do exist. For example, research firm MarketsandMarkets says that machine learning as a service (MLaaS) will grow from $613.4 million in 2016 to $3.7 billion by 2021.   A separate estimate by Transparency Market Research says the compound annual growth rate of MLaaS will be 38.4% between 2017 and 2025, and become a $19.8 billion market by the end of that time.  Whichever estimate you choose, it's clear that machine learning applications are expanding, and that should fuel growth for companies creating services based on that technology.  3. Who are the major players? I've already mentioned how Google has tapped into machine learning for some of its business and how NVIDIA is using machine learning for computer vision. It's worth mentioning that aside from NVIDIA's own machine learning uses for semi-autonomous vehicles, it also sells its GPUs to other companies, including Google and Facebook, for machine learning. That's helping the company tap into broader AI market, which is creating a $5 billion opportunity for NVIDIA. But NVIDIA isn't the only chipmaker that stands to benefit from machine learning. Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is looking to machine learning to spur new chip sales as the PC market dwindles. The company is in the process of buying the semi-autonomous car technology maker Mobileye so that it can set itself up to benefit from the driverless-car market, which relies heavily on machine learning. An MIT Technology Review article noted that "Intel's acquisition of Mobileye shows how critical data and machine learning are to the auto industry's future."  And just as IBM was at the forefront of machine learning decades ago, the company is still helping to lead the way with its own enterprise machine learning services. The company says that its machine learning solutions, like Watson, can use enterprise data to automatically create self-learning behavioral models for businesses. The company is so bullish on machine learning and its impact on businesses that it calls the technology the "21st century's Industrial Revolution" and believes that machine learning is the first step toward a broader cognitive computing world.  Just a few months ago, Deloitte published a report mentioning that 300 million smartphones will have some form of machine learning built into them this year, and that soon drones, cars, virtual and augmented reality devices, and even medical tools will have their own built-in machine learning capabilities. It's clear from these predictions -- and the current machine learning uses -- that this technology revolution is already underway. And investors would be wise to take a closer look at the companies that are leading the charge. Suzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors.

Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Search Android Community Home Reviews Phones Tablets Apps Devices Deals Tip Us Upcoming Google Allo desktop client may work like WhatsApp By Ida Torres - April 15, 2017 0 Share on Facebook Tweet on Twitter Google Allo may still not be the success that Google was expecting but it seems like they’re not giving up on it just yet. One of the upcoming things that is coming, at least according to tweets from Nick Fox, VP of Communication, is a desktop version of the messaging app. This may be something that will help them grow the product as it will appeal to those who want to be able to use a messaging service across devices. It seems that the way the desktop version will work is a little bit similar to how WhatsApp did it previously. This is based on how the current Allo app is and it basically has to do with QR code scanning. Currently, the elements are set in place, probably for when the desktop client officially arrives. We’re referring to the QR code scanning which will probably be used for pairing your device with the web client. There may also be an option to enter a text code to be able to verify your account and use Allo in both its mobile and desktop iterations. However, while the basics are already in place, as long as there’s no official word from Nick Fox or Google themselves, all of this is just speculation of course. But logically, that’s probably how it would go about. Allo is pretty decent, although it has to play catch up with already established messaging apps. Having a desktop version is also nothing new, just like with WhatsApp, Viber, Messenger, etc. It does put them on a level playing field. Let’s see what other magic tricks Google has up its sleeve.

In the run up to that historic anniversary, we take a look back at some significant incidents and snippets from that time - from newspapers coverage to little-known facts, individual acts of heroism to how the actions of those who lost their lives changed history.  The streets of Dublin are filled with history – some echoing the past clearly, others concealing their secrets from the past to the casual passerby. This year, as Ireland marks the centenary of the 1916 Easter Rising, the streets are more alive with history than ever. In celebration of this, Google has created a virtual tour, narrated by Hollywood’s favorite Dubliner, Colin Farrell, of all the Dublin sites of the 1916 Rising. 4 The feature, titled Dublin Rising 1916 – 2016, allows users to explore the city both as it was then and it is now (thanks, Google Street View!), bringing places like the GPO and the Richmond Barracks to life via videos and audio clips, photos and quotes. Google collaborated with a range of historians, as well as the National Library of Ireland, Ireland’s Military Archives, and the Abbey Theatre. 4 Farrell was thrilled to be part of the project, commenting "Growing up in Dublin, the events of 1916 are a key part of our schooling and culture. "I'm glad now that anyone around the world can learn more about it and see why it had such an impact on modern day Ireland just by picking up their phone or computer." 4 At the launch of Dublin Rising 1916 – 2016, held in Dublin yesterday, Taoiseach Enda Kenny lauded the unique online experience and thanked Google for “enabling all the people of Ireland, the diaspora and others around the world to commemorate, learn about and explore the events of 1916 and the 100 years since then and to celebrate the country we are today.” To take the full tour, click here * Originally published in 2016.

This morning, multiple sources have confirmed this will indeed be Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, and here’s what Nexus smartphone and tablets owners need to know. On October 5th Google released Android 6.0 Marshmallow, along with the brand new Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P smartphones. Now nearly two months later the first small maintenance update is here, set to roll out later today and all week long. Read: New Android Emoji Release Confirmed The update to Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow appears to be a rather small one aimed at delivering a few small changes for tablets, likely some security improvements, performance enhancements, but most of all it’s changing emoji characters. Here’s what we know so far, and we’ll confirm more once the updates start arriving. With the release of iOS 9.1 back in October Apple delivered over 150 new emoji characters for iPhone owners. Allowing users to express themselves with the keyboard in ways never available before. Emoji keyboards are getting increasingly more popular, and Google quickly said they too, would be adding more to Android. Like the popular taco emoji, multiple different fingers and hand gestures, tons of food, additional faces and more. The release of Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow appears to mostly be for that, but other changes are includes which is why we’re seeing a version bump to Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow. What’s New Google will be adding over 200 new emoji to Android with the update to Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, as a part of Unicode 8. This is a system level software update to the font, which is why Google couldn’t just update the keyboard on the Play Store. Ars Technica confirmed the update is Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow, has a list of all 200 new emoji coming soon, as well as a few other small details regarding the software update. Read: Android 6.0 vs Android 5.1.1 Lollipop: What’s New in Marshmallow With Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow all Nexus smartphones and tablets, and eventually other phones and tablets will see some small changes. Nothing huge or noteworthy has been found, but we’ll know more soon. Here’s what we know so far, and we’ll confirm more details when the update arrives. There will be over 200 new emoji characters built into stock Android, and other manufacturers like Samsung, LG, Motorola and more will need to update to Android 6.0.1 as well. The navigation bar on Android tablets has been changed. With 6.0.1 the back, home, and multi-taksing buttons which were on the bottom center of the screen, will now be split and to the edges. Meaning users can easily hit back or home at the bottom left of the screen with their thumbs, and the square multi-tasking button will be on the bottom right. Making using tablets easier than before and similar to old Android tablets from a few years ago. There are also additional changes to the Do-Not-disturb controls. Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow will also have the latest security patches for the month of December. There could be other changes, battery or performance improvements and more, but we can’t be sure until the update arrives. We could also see fixes for the recent reports of RGB colors being wrong in Marshmallow. Android 6.0.1 Release Date According to Google’s VP of Android, Hiroshi Lockheimer and a few posts to Twitter, the Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update will start rolling out to new Nexus devices later today, and continue all week long for others. Meaning most users should have it before the end of the week, or early next week at the latest. We don’t know which devices will get it first, but most likely will be the new Nexus 5X and Nexus 6P. This will be a small over-the-air software update that will automatically appear. Users can also head into settings > about phone (or tablet) > check for updates, and manually install the software once it’s released for your specific device. What Devices Will Get Android 6.0.1 There hasn’t been any formal announcement yet, but most likely all new Nexus smartphones and tablets that are on Android 6.0 will get the new 6.0.1 update. Those being the Nexus 5, Nexus 5X, Nexus 6, Nexus 6P, Nexus 7 (2013), the Nexus 9 and Google’s Nexus Player. Google has yet to officially announce Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow with all the changes or release the factory images, but we’re expecting them to be released later today. Once they arrive users can manually update if they’d like, wait for software updates to arrive, and get the latest software right from Google. As for other devices from popular manufacturers, the wait will continue. Most users in the United States with the Galaxy S6, Galaxy Note 5, LG G4, Moto X and more are all still waiting for Android 6.0 Marshmallow, and now that wait could be even longer. The good news is the Android 6.0.1 Marshmallow update appears to be rather small, so manufacturers can add the changes and release the update as soon as possible. Most likely all devices that aren’t a Nexus should see updates later this month, in early January, and possibly into February. As soon as Samsung, LG, Motorola and others reveal release dates, we’ll be sure to update with all the details. 12 Responses 12/07/2015 Henijhon Reply 0=07 my neighbor’s ex-wife makes $68 /hr on the laptop .

Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X owners are also impacted.  ( Spencer Platt | Getty Images ) Advertisement Advertisement Google Pixel and Pixel XL owners who updated to the much-awaited Android 7.1.2 Nougat update are probably wishing that they didn't jump the gun. After installing the software update, the smartphone owners have a new problem plaguing the device — a failing fingerprint sensor. However, Google Pixel owners are not alone in their plight as owners of the Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X are also encountering the same issue. One would think that Google would take a lesson from the past and ensure that the Android updates being pushed out to its device are bug-free. However, it appears that the company is repeating the mistakes. Google Pixel and Pixel XL owners have already had to bear with LTE-related issues, microphone problems, Bluetooth connectivity, and issues with the camera — which led to the smartphone's OS to crash. The latest bug plaguing Pixel XL, Pixel, Nexus 5X, and Nexus 6P smartphones occurred after the owners updated their respective handset's to Android 7.1.2 Nougat. Post the update, some batches of the devices have a broken fingerprint scanner sensor. Google Pixel And Pixel XL Fingerprint Scanner Issue According to a thread on Google's product forum, which started on April 4, the latest Android Nougat update has affected the functioning of the Pixel XL and Pixel's fingerprint scanner. "After updating I got the following message in red at the bottom of the screen when trying to unlock my phone with my fingerprint 'Fingerprint hardware not available.' I tried rebooting and clearing my cache with no change. I thought if I deleted my fingerprints and re-added them it might help. Instead I just get the following error when trying to add a fingerprint: 'Enrollment was not completed. Fingerprint enrollment didn't work. Try again or use a different finger,'" complained a user. However, the issue seems to be affecting only some Google Pixel and Pixel owners as a few people shared on the thread that they did not encounter any such issue post the update. Nexus 5X And Nexus 6P Fingerprint Scanner Problem The same problem is affecting some owners of the Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X who updates their smartphone to Android 7.1.2. "I just updated my phone to android 7.1.2 and suddenly i see that fingerprint sensor is not working to unlock the phone. I tried with safe boot, even factory resetting didn't help," complained a Nexus 6P owner. What Does Google Say? The issue was acknowledged by Google and the community manager revealed that the matter was being looked into. He also encouraged users to share their experience. "We have heard a few reports of users having issues with the fingerprint sensor after accepting the 7.1.2 OTA. If this is happening to you, can you post your experience here? I'll be reaching out to a few of you for bug reports," noted Orrin, the Pixel Community Manager. Any Workarounds To Resolve The Issue? Some smartphone owners shared that they even attempted to delete all the fingerprints and swapped to "None for Lock Screen." However, this workaround did not work and the Pixel imprint vanished from their Security settings. Even a factory reset is not helping resolve the issue. Even after they have deleted all the fingerprints stored on the phone and did a hard reset, the fingerprint sensors on the affected Nexus and Pixel handsets refused to start working again. It is not known what is causing the problem and hopefully, Google will take swift action and push out an update to resolve the issue.

Some Pixel and Nexus fingerprint sensors not working after Android 7.1.2 update Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 12:17pm PDTApr 14, 2017 65 Plus 1 on G+ 79 Share on Facebook 73 Share on Twitter Total Shares217 Bug Watch Device Updates News Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel XL A number of Google Pixel and Nexus users are reporting that their fingerprint sensor is no longer working after the latest Android OS update. Several members of the Pixel and Nexus communities on Google's product forums have encountered the issue since installing the Android Nougat 7.1.2 OTA. The issue appears to be affecting both the Pixel and Pixel XL, as well as the LG-made Nexus 5X and Huawei Nexus 6P. Reports suggest that while the Pixel and Nexus Imprint sensors are no longer granting access to the devices, the swipe down for notifications Moves gesture is still functional. Attempts to solve the problem by deleting pre-existing fingerprints and starting from scratch haven't worked, as error messages are preventing new prints from being added to the devices. As usual, we'll update if we hear any official word from Google about the issue, hopefully regarding a fix.

Max Same here with my XL. elav Me too. No issues on my XL.. Nicholas Matranga My Nexus 5x works just fine after the update. kalehv Sometimes my Pixel XL asks for pattern even after it recognizes my fingerprint (no, I am not talking about the first time after reboot). Rebooting the device works but why does this happen? Nathan Bryant I've also experienced this. It's random. Not so often it's a bother for me. kalehv Yup not so often with me either but being a mobile developer what bothers me is this happening, not the inconvenience it causes. Nathan Bryant That totally makes sense. I assume it's some kind of error even though it's not stating that it is. I don't see the pattern or constant of what causes it when it happens. mattcoz It does that after more than 48 hours have passed since you've last used your pattern. kalehv Nop its not that either. It does that after 4 hours I think. And it should do that only once after 4 hours but not keep doing that until you reboot. mattcoz It's definitely 48 hours, that comes straight from Google. But if it continues to do so, then that's something else. Mgamerz I've had it happen on my Nexus, it just occasionally requires a PIN. Says it's 4 hours of non usage but that doesn't seem true, sometimes I wake up and no pin and sometimes I'll be on and off the phone and it'll require a pin. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Typical. Google needs to fire some of their geniuses and hire some diligent coders, and also diligent testers for their QA department (assuming they even have one -- I sincerely doubt it). Alex Cruz Where did Google touch you? Middlefinger Oh really. Nexus/Pixel/Google error 4.453.563 this year alone. Im shocked (not really).

Cause for real, quality control is out of control right now. sebastianer If fixed my 6P bad battery life and early shutdown only replacing the stock Huawei battery with other battery with different brand (no need to wipe the phone in the process...) Several people did the same and is enjoying the battery life they were having when they bought the phone more than a year ago: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3534410 You could even try a Huawei battery replacement...but they say they aren't original. I just went for another brand because of the bad experience I had with the stock battery durability I don't know in the Pixel. But in the 6P in 90% of the cases...this is just a problem of the Huawei stock battery. Kendall Gustafson “Pixel”, the word sounds like the color pink. “Pixel” sounds like a little girl’s toy. Most men would never put a phone in their pocket named “Pixel” unless they were a cross/dresser. The word “Pixel” equates to a 50% loss of market share from the male market. “Nexus”, the word does not sound female or male. “Nexus”, the word sounds like science, desirable to any man, woman, or child. “Nexus”, the word sound like domination of market share. kalehv Hahaha that made me laugh. No I do not agree. I am a Pixel owner man and I am not whatever you said they'd be if they owned one but I laughed for some reason. Christian Trevor Clauss I must be a cross dresser then :D mattcoz Real men aren't insecure about what their phones are named.

New_Guy Yep Mark Curtis What do you mean "this is how you get more Samsung"? 4Ui812 Why is Google having app many issues with the Fixel ? Sruly J Except since it's also affecting Nexus devices, this is more of a software issue in 7.1.2 than a hardware issue for Pixel devices. Defenestratus Because IIRC they use Agile software development. Agile is how you get shitty software. Lawstorant I've never thought I would say such thing, but I'm getting fed up with all the "issues" Google is facing with every update. On the Nexus 6, they went as far as to roll it back to 7.0. They should really step up their game especially if, they are fully responsible for every aspect of the device from now on. EvilHowl No issues on my 5X wade_county I thought these Pixels weren't supposed to be beta products? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They aren't. They're outrageously expensive alpha products. And they even have one defect (halo-cam) that can't be fixed in software. Still the best steaming pile of dog s**t of 2016, though. Everyone should buy one. Everyone who likes dog s**t anyway. Apparently people do, since HTC has shipped 2 million since launch. Kougeru I bad a Pixel for a week and took dozens of photos with no halo Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good for you. Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of 22 Pixel pictures had halos. None of the 22 G6 pictures had halos. They were all pictures of the same things, obviously with the same lighting. Google admits it's a design defect. If Google admits it, it's kind of hard to pretend it doesn't exist. whispy_snippet No one denies it's an issue. But what you seem incapable of accepting is it's a very minor issue that only very rarely rears its head. If you actively try to shoot an image with a strong light source angled towards the sensor (something you generally don't do because it often results in a poor shot on any camera) you might experience a halo effect. Might. But I've got literally hundreds of photos taken with my Pixel with no halos. You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want to fuel your juvenile rage fits. But people who actually use a Pixel every day don't seem to have a problem worth caring about. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It has nothing to do with a strong light source angled toward the sensor. That's normal lens flare. The Pixel halos are NOT normal lens flare. Like I said 4 out of 22 pictures. That's 18% of the pictures they took, and they didn't have strong light sources angled toward the sensor. 18% is not a rare problem, especially when the G6 NEVER had halos with the same exact pictures. Google admitted it's a flaw. Get over yourself and stop trying to justify it. whispy_snippet And like I said, I've taken hundreds of pictures and have seen a halo perhaps a couple of times. And I take a lot of photos given video and photography is my day job - indeed one of the reasons I chose the Pixel is because I wanted the best phone camera available for the times I don't have my proper gear with me. I've seen countless comparisons between the Pixel, iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 edge and while they're all great, in most situations the Pixel takes what I consider the better shot. You're making mountains out of molehills and carrying on like a right twat in the process. P. Sherman ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE DOESN'T MEAN JACKS--- if in scientific tests under controlled environments and the same conditions, the Pixel produced the halo effect, which Google has acknowledged to be a design deficiency standard on LITERALLY EVERY PIXEL MADE, but other cameras feature no such halo effect. FFS whispy_snippet I'm not denying there's an issue! I'm saying it's being blown out of proportion by people who want to blow it out of proportion. P. Sherman Referencing a scientific, controlled test and camera comparison is NOT blowing this out of proportion. Blowing out of proportion would be something how the Wall Street Journal set out to destroy PewDiePie for boneheadedly saying "Death to all Jews" as a joke. But referencing a camera comparison in exactly the same conditions and one phone had a halo effect but the other didn't is science, fact, nothing to blow out of proportion there. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good luck arguing with a Google fanboy in deep denial. thereasoner He's actually making solid points, the Pixels do have the best cameras overall​ and all smartphone cameras have some issues. whispy_snippet No, no. I'm a fanboy! Get it right! Cecil Hardwood Are you sure the Pixel has the best camera ? The reason I ask is because the DxOMark site that claims this refuses to release the iPhone 7 Plus (Not iPhone 7) scores and many believe it is because it scored higher than the Pixel. The theory goes on to say that Google is using their score in their advertising and DxO doesn't want to piss off Google. Something weird is going on for sure. DxO claimed long ago the review was coming soon and should have been out by now with the iPhone 7 Plus having been on the market as long as it has. thereasoner If I'm to make a judgment personally then I would say that probably the top 3-4 cameras on flagships are very close and what's best as far as the user is concerned is subjective. Do you prefer low light performance(I do) or digital zoom? Do your favour widespread angle lens or fast launch/focus etc. Those are personal preferences that make "the best " phone different for different people. That said, as far as reviews are concerned the Pixel is generally considered the best over all. As far as your conspiracy theories go, who knows? Anyone can create those about anything but I guess but I'm thinking that other than digital zoom and an artsy photo effect the 7+ cameras are very similar to the 7. whispy_snippet The iPhone 7 Plus is the same as the iPhone 7 apart from an additional, slower lens. In terms of raw image quality the iPhone 7 Plus achieves its best results with the lens it shares with its smaller sibling. So basically, it'll score no better than the 7. It's effectively already been tested. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All smartphone cameras have some issues? What issues does the G6 camera have in the comparison I linked? 23% of the Pixel photos have halo issues. Find a serious issue with 23% of the G6 photos and get back to us. thereasoner Keep in mind that if you take wide-angle shots, angles will be distorted and elongated from the side, especially when it comes to selfies with the front-facing camera. I also found that the front-facing camera takes relatively muddy shots in low-light. Compared to the Pixel XL, OnePlus 3T and (for the time being since we don't have the S8) the Galaxy S7, the G6 is on par with its rivals. The Pixel XL takes superior low-light images than all the phones though, and I prefer the richer contrast and saturation of the S7 by just a tad. -CNET There are a ton of reviews from various sources just like this and while the G6 cameras are considered very nice they do have their shortcomings and generally rank below the Pixel cameras overall. whispy_snippet Purple flaring and chromatic aberation. It's extremely noticeable in at least four images you shared with the Pixel comparison. Here you are: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration And just Google search purple flaring. Sorry to burst your bubble. whispy_snippet Show me the link to the test. I would like to see it. Even if their results suggest there's an issue (which there is as we all agree), the significance of the results can still be blown out of proportion which is what we're seeing occur in this ridiculous discussion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Here you go again. phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ Now that I've viewed the pics again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. Two involve a bright light. The other 3 do not. So that's 23% of 22 pictures. I wouldn't say that's blowing things out of proportion. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. Yeah, you paid a lot for your Pixel, so you have a hard time admitting it's a steaming pile of dog s**t. I understand. whispy_snippet Yep, so as we've agreed, halos sometimes appear in shots with strong light sources pointing at or angled towards the edge of the sensor. But let's just ignore the purple flaring and chromatic aberation in at least four of the images from the LG, right? You're demonstrating selective criticism. Every camera has strengths and weaknesses but on balance, the Pixel offers better images than competing phones more often than not. My position is unchanged. You're both making mountains out of molehills, and in no way does this "scientific" test guarantee that 23% of photos taken with a Pixel will exhibit a halo. It simply shows 23% of photos taken in this example demonstrated halos. You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. No one ever said the Pixel is perfect. But only you two are using ridiculous, extreme labels like "steaming pile of dog shit" and "HARDWARE DEFICIENCY" as though using capital letters makes your odd ball assertions more valid. Most reputable tech reviewers agree the Pixel has the best overall smartphone camera. You're entitled to disagree. P. Sherman 4/22. 4/22 photos from the Pixel have a halo effect. That's from Phandroid. That's 18% of photos the Pixel. That alone is damning. Google themselves have acknowledged that it is a HARDWARE DEFICIENCY and software fixes have done little to address this. They admitted it was there, that's all we need. If you knew that 4/22 Burritos Chipotle made would give you the Runs, but ZERO/22 Burritos Taco Bell made would, would YOU still choose to eat at Chipotle? whispy_snippet Show me the test! I've asked twice now. P. Sherman Lena Flare was removed from the photos, but not the video. http://highonandroid.com/android-smartphone-news/the-truth-about-google-pixel-camera-halolens-flare-effect/ Also, someone in the official Google forums shot with their Pixel and Nexus 6P in the same Time, conditions, everything. Guess what? https://support.google.com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsrROqMaXHqHg/?hl=by Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ 3 halos are obvious, 1 is subtle. The subtle one is where the picture is looking up at a building's windows. Now that I've viewed them again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. tigerstown I paid $380 for my new pixel XL so it's not a lot and I have no Halo in my pics I have proven this on Twitter already. abc More fanboy logic. I took pictures so everything is fine. Anyone who says its not fine is crazy. whispy_snippet How ridiculous. So a blogger takes 22 photos in various conditions and his experience is valid, but my experience of owning the phone and taking hundreds of photos in various conditions is not valid. You guys are weirdos. Andy But do you see problems with low light pics. I do on my wife's pixel. IPhone Looks so much better. I'm so disappointed abc I saw a rainbow once. Oh, are we not just conveying pointless ancedotes? mr.fozzo On my Nex6P, I have noticed that the Fingerprint reader has been less reliable lately. It requires more presses than the usual 1 press. Besnik Rrustemi My Nexus 6P working excellent so far, no battery problems, no fingerprint problems (better standby times on 7.1.2 to be honest). But yes,i can agree that fingerprint was much faster when i first got the device on 6.0 Marshmallow (for unlocking the device with the fingerprint) now it takes like 2 full seconds for that :( jimv1983 No issues on my Nexus 5X and the swipe on the sensor to bring down the notification panel is great. Alex Harrison Flashed the OTA myself on my 5X. No issues with it. Jeff Neston At least it is just the sensor. My nexus 5 was bricked by a Google update.. it got the boot loop. Google support lied to me claiming I broke the power button. False it was not broken. I ended up going small claims case against Google. They settled, but wanted me to sign gag order. Sorry, no way. I sent it back and got complete refund. Sneaky company. What probably causes boot loop update to occur is phone on long time. Some apps get memory leak over time. System then unpredictably unstable. Then the system does auto uplate from Google without asking user NOR even rebooting or turning off prior to the update. Then during update, Os gets corrupted. Then after failed update phone reboots thinking the. Update completed. Now phones dead. And Google not bother to address the issue. Pdiddy187 My 5x fingerprint sensor was great until it bootlooped yesterday morning. LG is going to repair it under warranty even though it's well out of warranty. La Kiesha Rodriguez Barrientes I have the ZTE axon 7 and over a month now google hasn't addressed a fix for the play store not loading apps over data or Wi-Fi.. Without uninstalling updates to play store and then maybe will not say "waiting for network" so frustrating and then maybe download once and have to do that everytime.. Dumb.. P. Sherman That's been like that since KitKat. F------ KITKAT. ahnafm Is google reacommodating their customers now? Brett Delia I thought some positive feedback was worth being added. My Nexus 6P is working perfectly after the update. I've had generally a great experience with all my Android phones. I've had an iPhone as well as a Windows mobile phone as well in my past. None have been as feature packed as my Android devices. New_Guy This and all the other ridiculous issues with the Pixel is a big reason I stick with Samsung... flyonthewall Lol Fernando S Mine is working ok in my Nexus 5x running 7.1.2. It just failed once while I was on 7.1.1 and with a soft reset it came back to life Hank Is that a real screenshot in the story? Enrollment spelled wrong twice. SMH. ThisGuyFUX This is now icing on top of the cake, for anyone whom has enjoyed watching this crash and burn. If I paid $850+ for a Pixel, I'd be pursuing class action litigation by now. Slow clap. Sean Except its only affecting about 1% of the Pixels sold.........so......slow clap for you....... 2kool4skool It's gonna be sucks when you're in the 1%. And I doubt it's 1% anyway, this is probably the 20th article I've read about pixel's problems. That's alot. Probably more like 5%. abc Fortunately, not many Pixels have been sold so not many people are affected. Brian White Nexus 5x, running fine here ddevito If it wasn't for my OnePlus 3 I'd be on an iPhone. thereasoner One plus has their own issues/lousy support and the iPhone? They're the worst of them all when it comes to buggy software and hardware issues bricking devices ! ddevito Not sure I'd agree with you. My iPhone 6s hums along swimmingly without any issues. The more I use it the more I am leaning towards going back to an iPhone full-time. Apple, love them or hate them, knows how to deliver products, and support them. Period. thereasoner I'm glad that your iPhone 6s isn't affected by the many flawed updates and hardware issues​ that have plagued various iPhones over the years but the fact remains that Apple has faced class action lawsuits filed by their own customers for serious issues like Touch Disease and error 53 and for good reason. They have the worst track record of them all and to make things worse they're known for both ignoring iPhone issues until said class action lawsuits are launched and/or blaming their customers for the iPhone hardware/software problems. BTW, my Pixel "hums along swimmingly" as well, that doesn't mean issues with the Pixel don't exist much less those far more serious issues found on iPhones ! MisterKraky I'm not having the fingerprint sensor issue myself, but after updating to 7.1.2, I can no longer install or update any apps! On a Verizon-issued Pixel here. Đức Thành What happened to all the testing, Google? It seems they have become too reliant on using Nexus users for beta-testing and now can't seem to do a proper job on their own. Get your grips together, Android team. Rob H. Nougat is such a half baked disaster of an OS. It's ruined my N6. Marshmallow was soon much more stable. Thanks google keep breaking phones. jacob Cant even spell enrolment correctly. Enrollment...... PoisonApple31 Don't forget your apostrophe! Makes you look stupid when you are talking about spelling.

Consistently her friends iPhone 6 and 7s look better in low light. Its very frustrating. Makes me look like an idiot paying all this money. Outside the pictures look amazing. But I'm disappointed in indoor pics Stevo I have the same issue!! It happened as soon as I updated my stock Nexus 6P to 7.1.2. I've called Google Fi for support and they were NO help other than trying to sell me an "upgrade" to the Pixel and FULL price?!? They also said that they haven't had harly any other complaints with this issue. Thanks for nothing Google! I've did a soft rest then a complete reset with no luck. I've heard that people have had success with down grading to 7.1.1. or flashing a custom ROM. trapchan Where're Google apologists when you need them?

My Macbook Pro 2012 data cable fried in 2 years due to the Macbook's poorly designed unibody which acts as a fantastic heat conductor.

Apple has known about this issue since 2007 but has never acknkowledged it. My Pro cost me more than 1400. I have had sub 500 Windows laptops easily run 5 years.

What happens when you have more than one Google Home? Chaos. Paul Quinn Follow View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:22am PDTApr 14, 2017 28 Plus 1 on G+ 95 Share on Facebook 62 Share on Twitter Total Shares185 Editorials Google Home The Amazon Echo was my pacifier as I waited for Google’s entry into the home assistant space. Setting my Google Play Music library aside, I suffered through using Amazon’s attempt at a music service devoid of most of my own library. I connected my Google Calendar to Alexa and it offered a glimpse into my future relationship with Google’s assistant. Finally, in early November, I could get my hands on a new Google Home. I had pre-ordered from Google and then discovered I could pick one up at my local Best Buy. The very morning it hit the shelves, I immediately bought one. I brought it home, set it up in the family room and eagerly asked – “OK Google, play my morning hits playlist.” Without skipping a beat, she announced the list and the room filled with my music. The key point here – it was music from MY library. I didn’t cancel that Google pre-order. It was on its way. I figured I could listen to music in my bedroom as well. But – what about the other rooms in my house? What about the smart lights, smart switches, clever irrigation controller, and intelligent thermostat scattered throughout? I need a Google Home in every room to live the dream of a voice controlled home! I bought four more. My home is outfitted with six Google Home devices. There’s one in every room. I can control my smart home with my voice from anywhere I stand. I can spread music into any room. I can turn on, dim, and turn off lights in various rooms with just my voice. It’s as close as I can get to living on the Enterprise. Google's vision of the future with Google Home. Well, one Home. That’s the dream. Unfortunately, it isn’t a reality (yet). Google has failed at a key feature that it so proudly spoke of that morning in May. The nice lady living inside each Home is often unable to tell if you are talking to her or her sister in the neighboring room. It can result in some frustrating, sometimes comical, exchanges. It is amazing how well the little air freshener shaped unit can hear you from several rooms away. With multiple Homes, you’ll find yourself making requests and getting responses from two of them. It usually involves one of them, not necessarily the one closest to you, executing the request and the other apologizing to you that it can’t. From my bedroom in the morning, I might ask how long it will take to get to work and hear the detailed response in the distance from the kitchen. There will be times when the Home in front of me fulfills my request and another will rattle off from down the hall. You also have the ghosts. I never thought my home might be haunted - until now. There will be times when I turn off the TV, hang up on a call, or just walk out of the bathroom and hear something in another room. I’ll find a Google Home playing music or a podcast that I don’t listen to in a randomly selected room. Who asked to listen to opera at low volume in the guest room? Ghosts. There isn’t a constant circus of home assistants chiming in from all over the house. The closest Home does respond properly more than half of the time. However, I have found myself at times leaning over and almost whispering to a Google Home when I want to be sure the others don’t hear. There is talk of multiuser support coming soon, but it remains to be seen if this will improve its ability to identify which Home I am talking to. For now, I must look like a fool. I am whispering to an air freshener because I don’t want the others to hear. Creepy? Maybe. Tags editorial google home google home app google home fail video subscribe ...

Carson Saldanha Hi David Sean Thomas Hey Paul next time you're buying expensive accessories for every room in your house can you just throw me a hundo instead? Thanks! Sean Thomas Seems like something I would say. Paul Quinn I asked my office Home to get on that. The one in the kitchen responded. She can't do it but she's learning. Christopher Young I can completely sympathize with you. I have two Google Homes in my small apartment (living room/bedroom), and they frequently get confused where I'm at. I want to play music in the bedroom? Nope, the cozy jazz station starts blaring in the living room. There is one awesome benefit of having two Google Homes: I can fill my entire apartment with music with only a few words. dcdttu I hope Google Home gets a lot of support from Google itself and doesn't turn out to be a Hangouts. Or a Wave. Or a Nexus Player. Or a Nexus Q. Or a Google Reader. Or a tablet of any kind. Oh and hi Paul! Paul Quinn HI! Yeah, I'm worried that they will jump ship because they can't figure out a way to monetize it. No ads. If it starts playing ads, Home is moving out. The Echo doesn't really have a monetization angle except that you can shop on Amazon. Google added Google Express to the Home. But really? I'm not shopping on one of these things (yet). Lateef Alabi-Oki I thought the monetization was making money off selling the hardware. Paul Quinn They also need to keep expanding the ecosystem and product functionality which takes work that costs money. I don't know if that one time purchase price covers all that in the long run. Lord Argyris I think what Google is banking on is that if a user has one or more Homes, it makes them that much more likely to stick with the Android ecosystem in general, which means all Google's already existing means of getting money are a bit more secure from such a user switching over to the big "A". Of course it remains to be seen whether or not this is effective. Dk Schlösser The monetization is in the services offered by Google Paul Quinn I don't know what service I access through the Home makes Google any money, short of using it to buy things on Google Express. It does produce a little more profiling information but I doubt that it's enough to pay for the ongoing development. Ryan I think its all about search and locking you into their services, just like the chromecast. Because of chromecast (and now google home) I am more locked into Google Music. I am more locked into Youtube, Play Movies, searching on Google, etc. Just like Android. The specific device/service doesnt have to make money, its a "loss leader" to drive you to their other, profitable services. A very common thing in almost any consumer industry. Lars Jeppesen Precisely. I'm ditching Sonos in favor of Chromecast Audio, only because of my GH fluffthebunny The monetization is off selling all the data gleaned by your six devices listening to your every word. You have become one with the Home. You have been assimilated. Joshed The horror of ordering an item in the kitchen only to find the bedroom and office made duplicate orders. skitchbeatz I've got an open concept, one in the kitchen and one in the living room. They fight over responding and sometimes both respond. It's frustrating. I've thought about moving one of them up or down a floor. It's half implemented. It doesn't make sense because the assistant on the phone will sometimes read "answering on another device. Artem Russakovskii I have 4 Google Homes (2 in nearby areas where they can both hear me at the same time - kitchen and living room), 2 Alexas (though both Alexas can't hear me at the same time), and I can confirm - combined with multiple phones on family members, it's a mess. Let alone Home kicks in and starts talking once a day or so when not asked (doesn't happen nearly as often with Alexa). LithiumFox Never had that happen with ours... givitumibeybi 4 google homes and 2 alexas?? Artem, I think you might have some issues. Artem Russakovskii No, I just have more than one room. Dk Schlösser Change the trigger word for your Alexas Nick After my experiences with Amazon Echo, I have felt that these type of products are not ready for prime time. It's a cool concept, but these little, quirky issues that pop up with these "Home Assistants" suggest otherwise. Perhaps I'm more security minded than other people, but these sort of IoT products are ripe for security issues as well and the combination of these things has me totally turned off to the current market. Tony T. If you have multiple Homes, can you ask Google to play music and have all of them play the same music in sync? Defenestratus yes. Ed G You can have all of them play music like a Sonos. Also will link with Chromecast Audio. trickytree1984 Will it link to chrome cast proper? Joshua Pritt no, you can't group Chromecast video devices, only audio. Joshed This sucks. I don't see why they cant give older chromecast devices this feature. Paul Quinn Yes, you can create groups. For example, I have a group named "Front of the house" that connects three of them. You're best bet is to name them things that roll of the tongue like, "Hey Google, play my 90's hits playlist on the front of the house." Defenestratus I've got three homes, and I don't have this issue at all. Of course they're all on different floors and I live in a rather open-floor plan home so there's that. I've never had it come on as a ghost... ever. Chris You spent over 800 on google homes?!?! Omg man what kinda bank you making. That is insanity. Or no savings? I mean a financially responsible person cannot spend that much unless their income is huge haha. Defenestratus Yesterday I spent $1000 on a shower fixture (Moen U) David Ruddock OMG YOU ACTUALLY BOUGHT ONE OF THOSE? Defenestratus My wife saw it on "I want that" on DIY network and, well, yeah. We're about to start a master suite renovation so it was the perfect opportunity. For her, the hardest part of the day is getting up out of bed and waiting for the shower to heat up, getting cold in the process (she could get cold in the middle of equatorial guinea and we live in the North East US) so when she saw that she could turn the shower on from bed and it would alert her when it was ready for her, it was a done deal. I'm actually thinking of making a google assistant handler for it when it shows up. Chris Damn dude! How much do you make?? I see all these cool things and want them but I decide my money is better sitting in my savings account or the stock market. Defenestratus I specialize in software that is used for pharmaceutical research and clinical trials. I make a good living. Oh and my wife's a doctor. Chris Ah definitely. That's awesome dude. I work at a vaccine start up so hopefully we'll get a product past the FDA then I can buy 1k showers ;) Defenestratus Very cool. My company does a lot of work on vaccine studies. Best of luck. You have a long 12-14 years of approval process ahead of you! goodnightmare "Ok Moen...." Doesn't have quite the same ring to it. Paul Quinn The timing was right. I got three of them for $100 apiece using Visa Checkout and some helpful friends. Chris That's good dude. I haven't been able to convince myself to get one yet. I don't listen to music at home and not really sure what else I'd use it for. I did get a nest recently but still I don't mind pulling out my phone to change the temp. Paul Quinn I have an Ecobee now. My Nest kept thinking I was away because I didn't walk down that hallway enough. The Ecobee has remote sensors. Unfortunately, the Home currently does not have a direct integration with Home. I'm using IFTTT. Lawstorant Is it that hard to check which Home is the closest, based on the loudness of one's speech? Paul Quinn It might be that Google focused on their ability to hear your voice based on having one Home. If you have one, you want it to be able to hear you from a distance. That will backfire when you introduce more of them. They are all listening too well. Mace Moneta It could probably be resolved easily, by having the Google Homes reduce sensitivity of the mic, based upon the number of Google Home's on the network. Paul Quinn I had two Echos when they announced improved far-field functionality. I tested it at the time and it was working better. I didn't do any long term testing because I switched to the Home. With that in mind, Amazon was able to improve the situation with a software update so I agree that Google should have fixed this by now. Lawstorant Well, it's still Google. They have the money and the manpower to overcome such "hurdles". Why is it that more often than not, they seem like a small start-up composed of fresh out-of -college programmers. Nigel Antonio lol I thought I was the only one with that problem... Jesse Corbett So I have 2, one that covers the bedroom/bathroom half of my apartment and on that covers the kitchen/dining/living room section. I have never had an issue with both responding, if I may share my anecdote. However, I frequently am sitting 10 feet from the living room Home and hear my bedroom Home respond, despite being further away, in another room, down a hallway, with the first between me and it. I don't understand. Michael Stiffler Haha, I've had to whisper to my phone if I don't want her (Home) to hear! Aleem Kanji I think it's time to admit that Google is really screwing the pooch here. Nexus hardware failures, Pixel issues, Google Homes not living up to the hype, constant beta-feel to their products... I have a Nexus 6P, two Google Homes, and I'm all-in on Google services, but... for fuck's sake, I'm thinking of jumping ship entirely. Even Android news sites are seeming to be whole-heartedly disappointed with Google and the growing lack of positivity is disheartening. Google either needs to put up and get their shit together with product polish and following through on promises (or not promising the moon to begin with) or they shut the hell up and we all buy iPhones and call it a day. Paul Quinn My thoughts are not really heading down that road. The Home does a lot of things right. It's core features, music and access to Google's massive database of information, are working. Light control works well. There are some very useful IFTTT integrations. The Echo had its issues when it came out and it has grown up. I'm not ready to give up on the Home. I see it slowly improving. I don't miss any Echo features. My 6P was a good experience overall but ultimately, yeah, it failed me in terms of the camera. My new Mate 9 has an absolutely amazing camera. I have no experience with the Pixel though. The general consensus is that the Pixel is amazing. I'm looking forward to the next one. Leoniv Same here. I'm all in with Google tech and have been with them since 2.3, but lately they've been a hot mess. They broke the dialer on multiple phones, hosed bluetooth so it disconnected randomly, and that doesn't even include the issues with the nexus and pixel phones. I hate to admit it, but the iPhones are looking more attractive. Jack Smith Really? Google home is not even 6 months old. GH is easily the most humanist technology that you can buy It is incredible what can do but not perfect and yet it is over? Little dramatic? Where are you going to get anything close? I have had the Echo since the very first day. It is NOT like the GH. Comparisons are ridiculous. Echo has commands and the GH you talk We are so.early with this and obviously the relatively minor issues in the scheme of things will get resolved. I have one echo and counting GHs that I gave away I have purchased 7. Not to say I dislike my Echo but it is not the future, IMO, like the GH. Aleem Kanji I'm TOTALLY being dramatic, actually. I love my Google Home. I love my Nexus. I also tried an iPhone for the first time late last year (iOS 10 got my attention) and I love it too. My tenure with my iPhone was about 4 months, and, like clockwork, I'd always put my SIM back in my N6P every Wednesday night until Saturday, then switch back to my iPhone (which is a bitch with iMessage, BTDub). The iPhone IS more polished, has better power and battery management, but isn't exciting to me the way Android is. I could never give it up. It's like a drug. But, like a drug, I'm hopelessly addicted to something that promises the highest of highs, then always leaves me chasing the dragon. Google promises the world, then has a tendency to either fall short or simple pulls the rug out. In a world where the Pixel exists and it commands iPhone and Galaxy level money, in a world where Google is trying it's hand at a software AND hardware ecosystem, I expect more. I expect polish, I expect promises to be kept - or at least reasonable expectations to be given. Now, people can come back and say that Google is new at hardware and I understand and forgive that. But they aren't a hardware company in the way that they take responsibility for their products 100%, in that they quality test, in that they have any sort of retail presence that goes beyond simply "trying" something out. They have time to build that, so I'll admit that I need to give them time to sort it out. I'm just worried that they'll get complacent or lose interest and one morning wake up and say "Oh yeah, that Android thing and all that hardware and stuff - I'm over it." If Google is going to change direction and add hardware to their list of products, I expect that they keep in mind that it also means that we - not our data - become customers too. Jack Smith So much silliness in this post. First, what right now angers me the most is Apple completely abandoning the entire AirPort line without any warning. Last November just reassigning all the employes. So I replaced our two AirPort Extremes with Google Wifi. That is REAL life not some weird perception things. "Apple reportedly stops developing AirPort WiFi router products, moving employees to other projects" Who does that? Not Google. Instead with Google we have yesterday. "New Google ‘Dual Band WiFi Router’ Shows Up At The FCC" https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/04/new-google-dual-band-wifi-router-shows-up-at-the-fcc.html This entire narrative Google is horrible at hardware or abandons hardware products is rather ridiculous. Heck it would have been so easy for Google to not support the NON Google WiFI hardware but instead Google decided to spend the money and bring all their new WiFi software to the ONHUB. This is REAL life not fantasy. We have been an Apple house for over a decade. We still have tons of Apple products. But been more and more replacing with Google. With Google we have 4K, HDR, VR, Smart speaker, Mesh and the list keeps growing. I can NOT get any of this from Apple! That is simply the facts. Aleem Kanji Right. 2×4 alexa does this same thing compuguy1088 That's not true. A software update allows for multiple amazon echo devices with the same hotword to work. They've had this since around the end of last year. 2×4 that's my point - it doesnt work well Midnitte "You also have the ghosts. I never thought my home might be haunted - until now. There will be times when I turn off the TV, hang up on a call, or just walk out of the bathroom and hear something in another room. I’ll find a Google Home playing music or a podcast that I don’t listen to in a randomly selected room. Who asked to listen to opera at low volume in the guest room? Ghosts." I have two and I've grouped them in a "home unit" and I've never experienced this. Typically I'll play music on one but sometimes I'll tell it to play music on both and I've never experienced it playing music on a rogue Home goodnightmare Nor have I. Igen Then I am pretty sure that Paul's home is haunted and he should call an Sam & Dean asap. kalehv This is a constant struggle. I have two Google Homes and a bunch of phones / tablets that also respond to "Ok Google" I usually use "Hey Google" to avoid waking up phones and tablets but there is no other way round like when I want to be reminded of something, there is no command that only capable devices (phones and tablets) would listen and not the Home. Home wins over taking control and apologizes for not being able to set reminders and actual capable devices say "Answering on other device" :( thacounty I have mine in opposite corners of the house to prevent this. The real issue is that I'll talk quietly to my phone and it will still hear me. Then my Pixel says answering on another device, which is Home telling me she can't do that yet, while my Pixel could have handled it just fine. Gets frustrating, but my 2 year old son yelling at it to play Batman Play-Doh Eggs makes it worth double what I paid. JG Glad I'm not the only one with this problem. Right now I only have two Google Homes set up, one in my bedroom and the other in the living room. If I'm in the living room, even my normal speaking voice will almost certainly trigger both Home units to talk to me. Like Paul, I have to turn to the one in the living room and whisper in order to get only one. And that can be hard if the TV is blasting away to. Though for some reason when I'm in my bedroom, I usually only trigger the bedroom unit. It gets very annoying when the one I want to talk to tells me she can't help while the other rattles off some long winded multi-paragraph answer (especially when I just asked "what time is it"). Being in another room (and sharing the same voice as the one talking next to you) its often hard to understand what she's saying - and of course there's no "Hey Google, what did you just say?" command... I wanted to set up a third in the other bedroom. But until I'm sure I won't be getting three different responses to each query.... Amazon claims to have an algorithm to determine which of multiple Echo units should respond. I don't have multiple Echo units so I can't test the validity myself, but if they can figure it out... I'm sure Google, with their expertise in machine learning shouldn't have too much bother with it. goodnightmare Acoustics. :) illregal I've got 3 in pretty close proximity, and a 4th whenever lg decides to send those out. Only about 1 out of 10 requests gets answered by the one i wasn't intentionally talking to. 4Ui812 Hi Paul ? Paul Quinn Hi! Rasovan Mircea Google have to upgrade the sound waves and not allow them to travel more than one room.... Tired_Guy I have a Home, a Nexus 9, a Nexus 7 and a Pixel XL, so assistant works on all of them. If all are in my den charging, saying OK Google is like he described only a bit weirder, as I can say it specifically to my Pixel XL in my hand and the Nexus 9 answers, through it's cover. Multiple device synchronization is vital Packer Backer Another reason to allow users to set the hot word. "Hey Bub! Hey Betty! Hey Fumbduck!" would would activate three different devices. Dk Schlösser The solution is to be able to change the trigger word for each device. You can do this on Alexa. Paul Quinn Currently, only my Home responds to "Hey Google" so I use that to talk to the Home. my phones and tablets don't respond. That cuts down on the problem a bit as long as I don't want to use voice with my phone. If I say "OK Google" to my phone, the Home may also respond. A quick fix for now would be to have the option to set the Home NOT to respond to "OK Google" and only "Hey Google." Bill Riess Yeah I just recently discovered this issue when I moved from an echo and echo dot to 4 Google homes. For the most part they work pretty good but it's annoying when they pick up in the wrong room. Multiuser and Sonos integration would be great additions as well. goodnightmare I've had four of these in my home since day one. Yes, occasionally we'll get some random response from a distant device, but it doesn't affect performance. The requested task is completed properly 95% of the time and any hiccups have never been due to multiple devices trying to provide feedback. Our Google Home experience has been quite pleasant and loads of fun. DomBrady Same. I've got three. I have had one interference related issue. Charles222 Same with four here as well. I've had an interference problem with my kitchen & living room ones, but taking a few steps towards one or the other solves it. nerdshowandtell.com I also have 6 Google Homes and the issues described here I only had a month or so ago and they went away. Id also make sure you have solid wifi with no interference to eliminate any delay in the homes seeing each other. As for the random asking/talking, maybe have seen that 3 times since it came out. Definitely not in awhile. Brett Koger I also have several Google Home devices, I am not experiencing the issues you state. I even have two of them with in 20 feet (they are in different rooms) I will see both activate but only one will respond. I have only experienced what you are see a few times. It is not the norm. Paul Quinn I have noticed that situation where more than one activate but only two of them can actually be visualized at one time. To me, that's a good sign. It means they are hearing you but identifying which one should respond. Maxr1998 Hi Paul! Very entertaining and interesting article. I don't have a Google Home myself yet (not available in Germany, functionality in German is likely pretty limited (as seen in Assistant on phones), my Home Assistant setup isn't supported by Google Home/Google Assistant, and IFTTT is too slow (10 seconds+) atm), but the idea of having one is very intriguing for me :) Paul Quinn Hi Max! I guess one plus side of living in another country is that Google works out bugs in the United States before it expands across the globe. Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get it functional:P But it's still sometimes a little annoying for power users wanting the latest and the greatest regardless of bugs ;) Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get it functional. 😜 But it's still sometimes a little annoying to not get the latest and greatest stuff being a poweruser ;) Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get them functional. 😜 But it's still sometimes a little annoying to not get the latest and greatest stuff being a poweruser ;) JD So it's not just me. Alexa is just that much better with its spatial recognition. It has a 100% hit rate on responding on the right unit. Sandeep Raghuraman One solution to your problem - setup mic + speakers in each room, and use one Google Home. That way, only one Google Home device will respond. Although, the next problem would be, how does Google Home decide which mic to listen through? Maybe a device that mixes all of those input streams from the different mics? Nick Riviera Try power cycling your units to keep them from talking over one another. sucatrops If you bought 6 Google Homes and didn't expect more than one to respond to you, you should shoot yourself. Hector Diaz Amazon echo has far field recognition between Echos so Google can include that with a software update. Ryan I dont see the need to have one in all 6 rooms of my home. Having one in the open air living/dining room and kitchen is plenty, it hears me from 40 feet no matter what. Then another in my bedroom. I dont think I need them in the guest rooms. Maybe one in the office, but that is all the way on the other side of the house from the bedroom. Maybe 6 is the overkill. Paul Quinn I have smart lighting in all the main rooms of the house. I wouldn't want any of us to be yelling from room to adjust lighting in another. I did put in remotes in the rooms as well because you should have another option besides voice. I think for most people, one or two is plenty. I'm really into smart home technology despite its incredibly fragmented implementation right now. I know my house is going beyond the norm. The fact that yours hear you from 40 feet away is what is causing the downfall in my house. Đức Thành 6 Google Homes? You're a crazy man. I like you. 6 is still nowhere near enough, though. Hector Diaz I have 2 echo Dot and 1 Echo. Missing still 2 echo Dot. So he is not crazy just want to have a real smart home doesn't matter where he stands like me. Andrew Hartley It was clear Paul was a bit 'unusual' from the moment he mentioned the Enterprise. I've been teaching science using the latest technology for 30+ and my dream has always been to walk into my classroom in the morning and for a cute sounding female voice to welcome me from my computer with a good morning asking me what I would like to do today. Google home I found you at last 😉 That doesn't sound weird does it 😎 Paul Quinn Sounds fantastic! D.Smithee I like when you're home alone in a quiet house and this thing starts spouting gibberish with no warning. Paul Quinn Tonight.... one of the Homes (in the office) decided to "forget" the lights in the room. Just the lights in the room that it's in. It kept saying there were no lights set up for that room. The remote went dead too. It was darkness. But... it let me operate the lights from other Homes. No I'm starting to wonder if Google read this... and is toying with me. I got the remote back online. The Home is still protesting. Bill3 Hi Paul, not sure what's going on there. I have three Google Homes and have only had that happen once or twice. They'll often beep together, but only one will answer. It could be a problem with your WiFi network. Are they connected to different AP points? Paul Quinn Yes. Despite two of them being closer to another access point in my house, I've kept the Homes on the primary router which is able to deliver a strong enough signal throughout the house. I use an access point to guarantee a connection to the irrigation controller outside. abc Oh, god. People are buying not more than one of this beta product. Are they rich or just plain stupid? Kostas 💪🎩 Man I laughed hard. Well written! DragoCubed 🎪 👻 👋 hi paul papastevez Where the ^*#} is the Google play movies integration??? Seriously, Netflix, a third party has been working for months and months. Lars Jeppesen I have 3 GH, and I've never had the problems described in the article. /edit And Hi to Paul, of course :) twighahn I think back to the smart homes of yesteryear. They had an intercom, radio, and auto switches. Now it's all more automatic and more personalised. Michael Paul, did you realize Google Home can only play your music library using a playlist? It cannot pull up a single or album or artist from your library.

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 125 Plus 1 on G+ 278 Share on Facebook 78 Share on Twitter Total Shares481 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 141k 106k Latest Deals 14 [Deal Alert] Get a 75" Sony LED UHD Android TV from Best Buy for $2150 today ($650 off) 2017/04/15 4:13pm PDTApr 15, 2017 19 [Deal Alert] Huawei Watch in Black Stainless Steel w/metal band $250 ($100 off) 2017/04/14 6:36pm PDTApr 14, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] 55 temporarily free and on-sale apps to round out your week 2017/04/14 12:50pm PDTApr 14, 2017 13 [Deal Alert] 2-Pack 6' Anker USB 3.0 A to C cables $12 w/ promo ($8 off) 2017/04/13 4:16pm PDTApr 13, 2017 32 [Deal Alert] NVIDIA is having a SHIELD gaming spring sale 2017/04/13 2:17pm PDTApr 13, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?

Google is testing a project called Google Hire which is Google's take on a job application website on the likes of LinkedIn. The new project, which aims to get Google into the job board business, is currently undergoing testing with a limited group of users. When we went to Google Hire's website and tried to sign in, it showed an error message saying that our Gmail id is not associated with an account. While very little information is available as of now, reports suggest that the service will allow interested employers to post job listings and then subsequently manage applications. Reports also indicate that a multitude of companies such as CoreOS - a specialised Linux distribution developer, Medisas - a medical software company, DramaFever - a video streaming website owned by Warner Brothers, and SingleHop - an IT services management company are already testing the service. Google Hire could be direct result of the acquisition of Bepop, a startup focused on enterprise and productivity tools by Google in 2015. In fact, Bepop's founder Diane Greene is currently in charge of the burgeoning job application website. In 2015, he was also selected by Google to lead the company's cloud efforts. What is rather interesting is the fact that job openings for Google Hire are currently listed on the Bepop website. Back in 2015, CEO Sunder Pachai had said that Bepop's acquisition would help Google in providing integrated cloud products at every level like Android, applications like Gmail and Docs and developer frameworks for mobile and enterprise users. Google Hire could post a serious threat to Microsoft's professional networking platform Linkedin and other websites such as Greenhouse and Jobvite.

Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.16am EDT 11:16 Tea delayed at Hove where Sussex’s fightback is real. They are 266 for nine, with Jofra on 44 and Brown 81. Shaping up to be a brilliant game; Kent’s lead is now just 38. Speaking of Kent, Sam Billings is batting in the IPL, if that’s your bag. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.13am EDT 11:13 Vic Marks At tea Somerset are 108-5, a lead of 188. As on the first day the mega-tattooed Trego is at the crease and much rests with him – yesterday he departed immediately after the interval. I still think batsmen have underperformed in this match rather than being betrayed by the surface. There has been just one fifty so far – from Alastair Cook. Yet not many batsmen can feel betrayed by the pitch. It offers some turn – which is a good thing – but in this innings just the one wicket has fallen to a spinner so far. Jamie Porter has impressed again; Ravi Bopara found some swing and Wagner has been banging the ball into the middle of the pitch. It may be that this day ends as it started with Cook at the crease. There may have been some mediocre batting but we have another engrossing game at Taunton. Facebook Twitter Google plus Share Share this post Facebook Twitter Google plus close 11.08am EDT 11:08 Yorkshire 165 for three at tea. Their noses are very nearly in front. And that’s tea at the Ageas - with a wicket final ball of the session! Rayner’s the man again and Dawson doesn’t think he’s hit this. Finger’s gone up for caught behind - he was propping forward. Rayner has had a very fine session, with two vital wickets at important times, as well as a fine catch to dismiss Vince.

Donklephant Primary Navigation Please select a menu in this location Home Software Gmail 7.3.26 Update Available with New GSuite Pack for Android Smartphones By Costea Lestoc. Published on April 15, 2017. 0 It’s no secret that Gmail is the top of the rank when it comes to email services nowadays. And naturally, it’s also available in the form of a smartphone app that generally comes integrated with all Android-powered devices. In fact, the app cannot be uninstalled from Android devices. This is because the Gmail emailing app is part and parcel of the GSuite pack provided by Google, a.k.a. the Google Suite of Office Apps. On top of that, if you have more email accounts than just on Google, you can connect them to the Gmail app. Therefore, your Gmail, Yahoo, Outlook and more can all be in the same place. And, what is more, you also benefit from 15GB of storage on the app. No wonder everyone loves it, especially when you consider that it’s also very safe, unlike other emailing services that have proved to be true security nightmares in the past. New Gmail Update Because Google likes to keep its emailing service on top of its game, the Mountain View giant releases constant updates for it. And now, the latest update, namely Gmail 7.3.26.152772569 has dropped and will roll out steadily on Android devices. The update comes under build number 59105242 and clocks in at a grand total of 18.25 MB. Naturally, while some devices received the update from the get-go, it will take some time for it to reach all Android devices across the globe. If you can’t wait for the update to drop on your device, you could try downloading it from trusted mirror websites. However, seeing as Google are usually very prompt with rolling out updates OTA and most devices eventually get them in no more than a few months-time, you could also wait for it.

Google Assistant's screen search has been moved to a button Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/14 9:02am PDTApr 14, 2017 61 Plus 1 on G+ 16 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares119 Applications Google News Google Now on Tap was introduced alongside Android 6.0 Marshmallow, which used context on your screen to help you find information. Google Assistant replaced Now on Tap (for compatible devices), and carried over most of its functionality. Now Assistant is making it slightly more obvious that it can search your screen and take screenshots.    Left: Old design; Center, Right: New design Before, screen search results would appear below the main Assistant prompt after a few seconds, and the screenshot button was found below the screen search results. Buttons for screen search and taking a screenshot are now immediately visible when Assistant is opened. This is a minor improvement, but definitely a welcome one. The change appears to be part of a server-side update, so if you don't have it, you will soon.

The old swipe up barely even worked most of the time. I've been waiting for them to do something like this. Paul Smith Don't even have assistant yet... Nexus 5x 7.12 samiazza Same here, is there any way to get it without root? Suresh Aryal Change the phone language to US English, delete Google app data and you should be running Assistant after few setup screens or just wait for few hours. samiazza Thank you, it worked:-) belac77 that's so weird. I've had Assistant on my Moto G Play running Marshmallow from the second or third day the rollout began! Zahir_SMASH be glad you don't. bekifft Seriously, enjoy it while it lasts. Assistant is a downgrade in every way. Alex Dueppen Is it just me or did Assistant get rid of the OCR thing where you could select text on your screen? Bombaglad this was never a part of assistant, only now on tap Nicholas Matranga Nope, they removed it for some reason. That was one of the main things I used now on tap for. Roh_Mish Used it all the time to select and copy text it to search for something Corbin Davenport That feature was never ported to Assistant. Mohammad Fazal Love this Now on tap feature. And now its gone :/ Evgany Used it all the time. Bring it back. Ruel Johnson It's still there you highlight the text then once you open assistant you tap "What's on my screen" Rami Hmm, never knew that worked. Still doesn't help if the text is in an image or it is non selectable text. Steve Riendeau Awesome, thank you! XgudwilX Not the same. You could copy text from within any app, screen, photo, whatever. Even a photo you took of a food label, street sign, or hand written note. Many languages and fonts too. You'd just hit the little copy (👆🏿)icon and go to town. It was amazing. The Now On Tap reverse image search, from within the camera app was awesome too. Much faster than what the Assistant tries to do. It's usually hit or miss. Oh well, maybe this new change is Google making room to bring back the text select (👆🏿) icon! MayorMcCheese Main reason I removed Assistant David Hyman While not ideal and not always a option, you can select text and then trigger the assistant and it'll use that for search context. And there are other apps CTRL-F (I think) that does basically the same thing. So you can share the screenshot with CTRL-F and then copy the text form there kalehv Also I remember Google Now on Tap did screen search when Camera was open. Was helpful to read barcodes but now that's gone. I don't want to install another app just to read barcodes, or QR codes whatever. mjmdroid Got it and already used it more than 4 times today Nicholas Smith Is there any way to use google assistant to schedule calendar events from your text messages? That was a huge feature of on-tap and I don't get why it went away. SocialSupaCrew Yes it's still present with assistant :) Miles Reiter What kind of context were you using that feature in with Assistant? I was trying to get that to work the other day with a clearly spelled out date and time from an email, and it wasn't finding a thing on my screen. motoridersd Awesome! I hated scrolling down to get to the button, so I wasn't using this feature much. This is much better. Eddy Nelson Lopez They need to bring text selection back! Deeco I got a Screenshot of not having Google Assistant, shall I share? FU Google demarcmj no thank you abqnm Maybe someday they'll add a button to open the damn Google app from the assistant pop-up. If I can't talk to my phone, I want to still be able to search without having to go back to the homescreen and then into the Google app. Miles Reiter I'm thinking about writing some kind of case study around the rollout of Assistant and the pro's/con's compared to Now on Tap. What you mentioned is definitely a pain point in my own usage. I'm curious whether there's anything else (good or bad) that stands out to you about Assistant. Luke Taylor As a language learner, one of the big setbacks about GA is that I no longer have the ability to translate my screen or select specific text on my screen if the screen search doesn't pull up any results. I used those on a daily basis! Mathsiel Totally agree... Grey It's easy. You hit the Google icon next to the search, nothing happens, you fumble around, you tap the search box, you swipe up and down, you get very frustrated, and eventually it randomly closes on you when you try pressing the phone back button, so you press the "recent apps" button but it doesn't exist and you get even more frustrated so you tap the Home Screen Search Box and tap the Google icon and Google Now might load. See? Easy. bekifft Exactly. They're trying to force you to use voice. Even with Siri you can just type into it once it's launched. LOL There are still things that Google Now does better then Assistant.....Very annoying Cory S Eh, I think Now did just about everything better than Assistant. aRvInD I want my Google Now onTap back? Is there any mod to get it? Zahir_SMASH Change your phone's language to US Virgin Islands English. You get Now On Tap back, and Google's voice responses get an Australian accent, which I think you can fix, but I find charming in its own way. titetanium Go to apkmirror and download Google App version 6.11.21 or earlier. You'll probably lose any recent data saved in the current version, but Now on Tap will be back. Don't upgrade the app afterwards. Profit. Zahir_SMASH That's a lot more trouble than just changing your language to another English option titetanium Perhaps, but you won't have to worry about getting Assistant going forward as long as you stay on the old version. How long before El Goog updates the other English language options to have Assistant? Miles Reiter What are some of those things that Now did better for you? To be clear I definitely agree, just looking for some things I might not have thought of for writing a case study on the subject! LOL To be honest I don't really use them often. But I really like how Google Now gives you this nice weather card with ton of info, there is no such a thing in Assistant. Also Google Now is able tell which song is playing, again it's missing from Assistant brownjames Text search from any screen. Selection of non selectable onscreen text. Language translation of non selectable text onscreen. Those are my favorite 3 features of Now on Tap that are not in Assistant. Luke Taylor Exactly the same as you. Text translation and selection was used daily by me. Hugely bummed that Assistant can't do it. Michel Sa I could do image searrch (searching by image) using Now on tap, Assistant can't Mohit Saini Will Moto X2 get google assistant? Or it's only available to 64bit devices like s7,nexus 6p...... Zahir_SMASH Pretty sure it is supposed to be rolling out to any device with Marshmallow and up. Corbin Davenport It's for any phone (not tablet) running 6.0 and up, and I think there's a minimum RAM requirement too. Zahir_SMASH Good to know, thanks blindexecutioner Still isn't as good as now on tap. Before when I'd use that on my home screen it would bring up a bunch of options like navigate to work or home. Now it just says there isn't anything. Margaritas Ante Porcos Bixby button is a good place for Google Assistant. diskostu I hate the Assistant, but I love Now On Tap. Is there any way to get Now On Tap back? ro.opa.eligible_device=false does not work anymore. Major Sceptic I liked on tap too , the assistant may be ok in some ways , but I find myself using the AI features less now than when I had on tap . Sometimes I wonder if having all the Wizz bang software that tries to make life easier by bombarding us with constantly​ with organisational​ suggestions that it may in fact be more like a nagging mother in-law . Or I'm just getting old and grumpy in my old age 😎 ? _jack_ You're not. Guilherme Pata Typing to the assistant as you do in Allo would be a real feature. This button doesn't do much when all you had to do before was swipe up... itsatrap It's not as good as Now on tap. demarcmj Didn't this happen like a month ago? https://www.google.com/search?q=google+assistant+%22What%27s+on+my+screen%22&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8 All the results are from around 3/15 (ish) Corbin Davenport It's been rolling out slowly. demarcmj Interesting. I figured the roll-out was about done since I have it and I never get anything early. Still, staged roll-out or not, I was surprised to see that you guys hadn't covered this already. Cakefish Still no assistant available in the UK on a non-Pixel device... hurry up Google. And bring YouTube Red over here while you're at it. Why is Google so lethargic with updates? freshprince_87 Never cared for the now on tap screenshot option. kalehv I also wish that Assistant could be dismissed by just swiping down. It shows up from bottom halfway to the top and it stretches to top when you pull it up only makes me think it could be pulled down to dismiss but .... Dan it does that if it's still on the bottom half of the screen. just tried it. kalehv Yeah but you pull it up to go all the way to top makes me think you can pull it down as well which doesn't work. Ishti Screen translation and text recognition scanning missing. Portzblitz Smart. Before, when you'd summon Assistant, whether you needed more info or not, Google would be processing at the bottom anyway even though few people ever actually swipe up for it; now, the button can be instantly available, but the processing will only happen for people who press it. Separates the task load. Michel Sa Where is the image search from Now on tap! Assistant is a step back. DC_Guy It's MUCH more useful this way. I take a lot of screenshots and i hated always having to scroll down to get to the share button. Sang Ngaihte No Assistant till now in India. Only Now on tap. Sibin C Baby I need the old text selection back....That's the only reason I'm still continuing in Google now Don Low I don't have the screenshot button on mine? mike shwilly Not sure if this is new but I'm seeing that Now on Tap started to give quick info in the bottom bar instead of just providing a search button https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e690721560ce23b223eb937de7b14c92065f3047c5e06363eb43916964c4fd82.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/304b263c01a22476cc3fc51c4858d2043b55163515084ab3920b5be441676362.png dontsh00tmesanta Just noticed it Roh_Mish There is no way to input text.

What happens when you have more than one Google Home? Chaos. Paul Quinn Follow View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:22am PDTApr 14, 2017 28 Plus 1 on G+ 95 Share on Facebook 62 Share on Twitter Total Shares185 Editorials Google Home The Amazon Echo was my pacifier as I waited for Google’s entry into the home assistant space. Setting my Google Play Music library aside, I suffered through using Amazon’s attempt at a music service devoid of most of my own library. I connected my Google Calendar to Alexa and it offered a glimpse into my future relationship with Google’s assistant. Finally, in early November, I could get my hands on a new Google Home. I had pre-ordered from Google and then discovered I could pick one up at my local Best Buy. The very morning it hit the shelves, I immediately bought one. I brought it home, set it up in the family room and eagerly asked – “OK Google, play my morning hits playlist.” Without skipping a beat, she announced the list and the room filled with my music. The key point here – it was music from MY library. I didn’t cancel that Google pre-order. It was on its way. I figured I could listen to music in my bedroom as well. But – what about the other rooms in my house? What about the smart lights, smart switches, clever irrigation controller, and intelligent thermostat scattered throughout? I need a Google Home in every room to live the dream of a voice controlled home! I bought four more. My home is outfitted with six Google Home devices. There’s one in every room. I can control my smart home with my voice from anywhere I stand. I can spread music into any room. I can turn on, dim, and turn off lights in various rooms with just my voice. It’s as close as I can get to living on the Enterprise. Google's vision of the future with Google Home. Well, one Home. That’s the dream. Unfortunately, it isn’t a reality (yet). Google has failed at a key feature that it so proudly spoke of that morning in May. The nice lady living inside each Home is often unable to tell if you are talking to her or her sister in the neighboring room. It can result in some frustrating, sometimes comical, exchanges. It is amazing how well the little air freshener shaped unit can hear you from several rooms away. With multiple Homes, you’ll find yourself making requests and getting responses from two of them. It usually involves one of them, not necessarily the one closest to you, executing the request and the other apologizing to you that it can’t. From my bedroom in the morning, I might ask how long it will take to get to work and hear the detailed response in the distance from the kitchen. There will be times when the Home in front of me fulfills my request and another will rattle off from down the hall. You also have the ghosts. I never thought my home might be haunted - until now. There will be times when I turn off the TV, hang up on a call, or just walk out of the bathroom and hear something in another room. I’ll find a Google Home playing music or a podcast that I don’t listen to in a randomly selected room. Who asked to listen to opera at low volume in the guest room? Ghosts. There isn’t a constant circus of home assistants chiming in from all over the house. The closest Home does respond properly more than half of the time. However, I have found myself at times leaning over and almost whispering to a Google Home when I want to be sure the others don’t hear. There is talk of multiuser support coming soon, but it remains to be seen if this will improve its ability to identify which Home I am talking to. For now, I must look like a fool. I am whispering to an air freshener because I don’t want the others to hear. Creepy? Maybe. Tags editorial google home google home app google home fail video subscribe ...

Carson Saldanha Hi David Sean Thomas Hey Paul next time you're buying expensive accessories for every room in your house can you just throw me a hundo instead? Thanks! Sean Thomas Seems like something I would say. Paul Quinn I asked my office Home to get on that. The one in the kitchen responded. She can't do it but she's learning. Christopher Young I can completely sympathize with you. I have two Google Homes in my small apartment (living room/bedroom), and they frequently get confused where I'm at. I want to play music in the bedroom? Nope, the cozy jazz station starts blaring in the living room. There is one awesome benefit of having two Google Homes: I can fill my entire apartment with music with only a few words. dcdttu I hope Google Home gets a lot of support from Google itself and doesn't turn out to be a Hangouts. Or a Wave. Or a Nexus Player. Or a Nexus Q. Or a Google Reader. Or a tablet of any kind. Oh and hi Paul! Paul Quinn HI! Yeah, I'm worried that they will jump ship because they can't figure out a way to monetize it. No ads. If it starts playing ads, Home is moving out. The Echo doesn't really have a monetization angle except that you can shop on Amazon. Google added Google Express to the Home. But really? I'm not shopping on one of these things (yet). Lateef Alabi-Oki I thought the monetization was making money off selling the hardware. Paul Quinn They also need to keep expanding the ecosystem and product functionality which takes work that costs money. I don't know if that one time purchase price covers all that in the long run. Lord Argyris I think what Google is banking on is that if a user has one or more Homes, it makes them that much more likely to stick with the Android ecosystem in general, which means all Google's already existing means of getting money are a bit more secure from such a user switching over to the big "A". Of course it remains to be seen whether or not this is effective. Dk Schlösser The monetization is in the services offered by Google Paul Quinn I don't know what service I access through the Home makes Google any money, short of using it to buy things on Google Express. It does produce a little more profiling information but I doubt that it's enough to pay for the ongoing development. Ryan I think its all about search and locking you into their services, just like the chromecast. Because of chromecast (and now google home) I am more locked into Google Music. I am more locked into Youtube, Play Movies, searching on Google, etc. Just like Android. The specific device/service doesnt have to make money, its a "loss leader" to drive you to their other, profitable services. A very common thing in almost any consumer industry. Lars Jeppesen Precisely. I'm ditching Sonos in favor of Chromecast Audio, only because of my GH fluffthebunny The monetization is off selling all the data gleaned by your six devices listening to your every word. You have become one with the Home. You have been assimilated. Joshed The horror of ordering an item in the kitchen only to find the bedroom and office made duplicate orders. skitchbeatz I've got an open concept, one in the kitchen and one in the living room. They fight over responding and sometimes both respond. It's frustrating. I've thought about moving one of them up or down a floor. It's half implemented. It doesn't make sense because the assistant on the phone will sometimes read "answering on another device. Artem Russakovskii I have 4 Google Homes (2 in nearby areas where they can both hear me at the same time - kitchen and living room), 2 Alexas (though both Alexas can't hear me at the same time), and I can confirm - combined with multiple phones on family members, it's a mess. Let alone Home kicks in and starts talking once a day or so when not asked (doesn't happen nearly as often with Alexa). LithiumFox Never had that happen with ours... givitumibeybi 4 google homes and 2 alexas?? Artem, I think you might have some issues. Artem Russakovskii No, I just have more than one room. Dk Schlösser Change the trigger word for your Alexas Nick After my experiences with Amazon Echo, I have felt that these type of products are not ready for prime time. It's a cool concept, but these little, quirky issues that pop up with these "Home Assistants" suggest otherwise. Perhaps I'm more security minded than other people, but these sort of IoT products are ripe for security issues as well and the combination of these things has me totally turned off to the current market. Tony T. If you have multiple Homes, can you ask Google to play music and have all of them play the same music in sync? Defenestratus yes. Ed G You can have all of them play music like a Sonos. Also will link with Chromecast Audio. trickytree1984 Will it link to chrome cast proper? Joshua Pritt no, you can't group Chromecast video devices, only audio. Joshed This sucks. I don't see why they cant give older chromecast devices this feature. Paul Quinn Yes, you can create groups. For example, I have a group named "Front of the house" that connects three of them. You're best bet is to name them things that roll of the tongue like, "Hey Google, play my 90's hits playlist on the front of the house." Defenestratus I've got three homes, and I don't have this issue at all. Of course they're all on different floors and I live in a rather open-floor plan home so there's that. I've never had it come on as a ghost... ever. Chris You spent over 800 on google homes?!?! Omg man what kinda bank you making. That is insanity. Or no savings? I mean a financially responsible person cannot spend that much unless their income is huge haha. Defenestratus Yesterday I spent $1000 on a shower fixture (Moen U) David Ruddock OMG YOU ACTUALLY BOUGHT ONE OF THOSE? Defenestratus My wife saw it on "I want that" on DIY network and, well, yeah. We're about to start a master suite renovation so it was the perfect opportunity. For her, the hardest part of the day is getting up out of bed and waiting for the shower to heat up, getting cold in the process (she could get cold in the middle of equatorial guinea and we live in the North East US) so when she saw that she could turn the shower on from bed and it would alert her when it was ready for her, it was a done deal. I'm actually thinking of making a google assistant handler for it when it shows up. Chris Damn dude! How much do you make?? I see all these cool things and want them but I decide my money is better sitting in my savings account or the stock market. Defenestratus I specialize in software that is used for pharmaceutical research and clinical trials. I make a good living. Oh and my wife's a doctor. Chris Ah definitely. That's awesome dude. I work at a vaccine start up so hopefully we'll get a product past the FDA then I can buy 1k showers ;) Defenestratus Very cool. My company does a lot of work on vaccine studies. Best of luck. You have a long 12-14 years of approval process ahead of you! goodnightmare "Ok Moen...." Doesn't have quite the same ring to it. Paul Quinn The timing was right. I got three of them for $100 apiece using Visa Checkout and some helpful friends. Chris That's good dude. I haven't been able to convince myself to get one yet. I don't listen to music at home and not really sure what else I'd use it for. I did get a nest recently but still I don't mind pulling out my phone to change the temp. Paul Quinn I have an Ecobee now. My Nest kept thinking I was away because I didn't walk down that hallway enough. The Ecobee has remote sensors. Unfortunately, the Home currently does not have a direct integration with Home. I'm using IFTTT. Lawstorant Is it that hard to check which Home is the closest, based on the loudness of one's speech? Paul Quinn It might be that Google focused on their ability to hear your voice based on having one Home. If you have one, you want it to be able to hear you from a distance. That will backfire when you introduce more of them. They are all listening too well. Mace Moneta It could probably be resolved easily, by having the Google Homes reduce sensitivity of the mic, based upon the number of Google Home's on the network. Paul Quinn I had two Echos when they announced improved far-field functionality. I tested it at the time and it was working better. I didn't do any long term testing because I switched to the Home. With that in mind, Amazon was able to improve the situation with a software update so I agree that Google should have fixed this by now. Lawstorant Well, it's still Google. They have the money and the manpower to overcome such "hurdles". Why is it that more often than not, they seem like a small start-up composed of fresh out-of -college programmers. Nigel Antonio lol I thought I was the only one with that problem... Jesse Corbett So I have 2, one that covers the bedroom/bathroom half of my apartment and on that covers the kitchen/dining/living room section. I have never had an issue with both responding, if I may share my anecdote. However, I frequently am sitting 10 feet from the living room Home and hear my bedroom Home respond, despite being further away, in another room, down a hallway, with the first between me and it. I don't understand. Michael Stiffler Haha, I've had to whisper to my phone if I don't want her (Home) to hear! Aleem Kanji I think it's time to admit that Google is really screwing the pooch here. Nexus hardware failures, Pixel issues, Google Homes not living up to the hype, constant beta-feel to their products... I have a Nexus 6P, two Google Homes, and I'm all-in on Google services, but... for fuck's sake, I'm thinking of jumping ship entirely. Even Android news sites are seeming to be whole-heartedly disappointed with Google and the growing lack of positivity is disheartening. Google either needs to put up and get their shit together with product polish and following through on promises (or not promising the moon to begin with) or they shut the hell up and we all buy iPhones and call it a day. Paul Quinn My thoughts are not really heading down that road. The Home does a lot of things right. It's core features, music and access to Google's massive database of information, are working. Light control works well. There are some very useful IFTTT integrations. The Echo had its issues when it came out and it has grown up. I'm not ready to give up on the Home. I see it slowly improving. I don't miss any Echo features. My 6P was a good experience overall but ultimately, yeah, it failed me in terms of the camera. My new Mate 9 has an absolutely amazing camera. I have no experience with the Pixel though. The general consensus is that the Pixel is amazing. I'm looking forward to the next one. Leoniv Same here. I'm all in with Google tech and have been with them since 2.3, but lately they've been a hot mess. They broke the dialer on multiple phones, hosed bluetooth so it disconnected randomly, and that doesn't even include the issues with the nexus and pixel phones. I hate to admit it, but the iPhones are looking more attractive. Jack Smith Really? Google home is not even 6 months old. GH is easily the most humanist technology that you can buy It is incredible what can do but not perfect and yet it is over? Little dramatic? Where are you going to get anything close? I have had the Echo since the very first day. It is NOT like the GH. Comparisons are ridiculous. Echo has commands and the GH you talk We are so.early with this and obviously the relatively minor issues in the scheme of things will get resolved. I have one echo and counting GHs that I gave away I have purchased 7. Not to say I dislike my Echo but it is not the future, IMO, like the GH. Aleem Kanji I'm TOTALLY being dramatic, actually. I love my Google Home. I love my Nexus. I also tried an iPhone for the first time late last year (iOS 10 got my attention) and I love it too. My tenure with my iPhone was about 4 months, and, like clockwork, I'd always put my SIM back in my N6P every Wednesday night until Saturday, then switch back to my iPhone (which is a bitch with iMessage, BTDub). The iPhone IS more polished, has better power and battery management, but isn't exciting to me the way Android is. I could never give it up. It's like a drug. But, like a drug, I'm hopelessly addicted to something that promises the highest of highs, then always leaves me chasing the dragon. Google promises the world, then has a tendency to either fall short or simple pulls the rug out. In a world where the Pixel exists and it commands iPhone and Galaxy level money, in a world where Google is trying it's hand at a software AND hardware ecosystem, I expect more. I expect polish, I expect promises to be kept - or at least reasonable expectations to be given. Now, people can come back and say that Google is new at hardware and I understand and forgive that. But they aren't a hardware company in the way that they take responsibility for their products 100%, in that they quality test, in that they have any sort of retail presence that goes beyond simply "trying" something out. They have time to build that, so I'll admit that I need to give them time to sort it out. I'm just worried that they'll get complacent or lose interest and one morning wake up and say "Oh yeah, that Android thing and all that hardware and stuff - I'm over it." If Google is going to change direction and add hardware to their list of products, I expect that they keep in mind that it also means that we - not our data - become customers too. Jack Smith So much silliness in this post. First, what right now angers me the most is Apple completely abandoning the entire AirPort line without any warning. Last November just reassigning all the employes. So I replaced our two AirPort Extremes with Google Wifi. That is REAL life not some weird perception things. "Apple reportedly stops developing AirPort WiFi router products, moving employees to other projects" Who does that? Not Google. Instead with Google we have yesterday. "New Google ‘Dual Band WiFi Router’ Shows Up At The FCC" https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/04/new-google-dual-band-wifi-router-shows-up-at-the-fcc.html This entire narrative Google is horrible at hardware or abandons hardware products is rather ridiculous. Heck it would have been so easy for Google to not support the NON Google WiFI hardware but instead Google decided to spend the money and bring all their new WiFi software to the ONHUB. This is REAL life not fantasy. We have been an Apple house for over a decade. We still have tons of Apple products. But been more and more replacing with Google. With Google we have 4K, HDR, VR, Smart speaker, Mesh and the list keeps growing. I can NOT get any of this from Apple! That is simply the facts. Aleem Kanji Right. 2×4 alexa does this same thing compuguy1088 That's not true. A software update allows for multiple amazon echo devices with the same hotword to work. They've had this since around the end of last year. 2×4 that's my point - it doesnt work well Midnitte "You also have the ghosts. I never thought my home might be haunted - until now. There will be times when I turn off the TV, hang up on a call, or just walk out of the bathroom and hear something in another room. I’ll find a Google Home playing music or a podcast that I don’t listen to in a randomly selected room. Who asked to listen to opera at low volume in the guest room? Ghosts." I have two and I've grouped them in a "home unit" and I've never experienced this. Typically I'll play music on one but sometimes I'll tell it to play music on both and I've never experienced it playing music on a rogue Home goodnightmare Nor have I. Igen Then I am pretty sure that Paul's home is haunted and he should call an Sam & Dean asap. kalehv This is a constant struggle. I have two Google Homes and a bunch of phones / tablets that also respond to "Ok Google" I usually use "Hey Google" to avoid waking up phones and tablets but there is no other way round like when I want to be reminded of something, there is no command that only capable devices (phones and tablets) would listen and not the Home. Home wins over taking control and apologizes for not being able to set reminders and actual capable devices say "Answering on other device" :( thacounty I have mine in opposite corners of the house to prevent this. The real issue is that I'll talk quietly to my phone and it will still hear me. Then my Pixel says answering on another device, which is Home telling me she can't do that yet, while my Pixel could have handled it just fine. Gets frustrating, but my 2 year old son yelling at it to play Batman Play-Doh Eggs makes it worth double what I paid. JG Glad I'm not the only one with this problem. Right now I only have two Google Homes set up, one in my bedroom and the other in the living room. If I'm in the living room, even my normal speaking voice will almost certainly trigger both Home units to talk to me. Like Paul, I have to turn to the one in the living room and whisper in order to get only one. And that can be hard if the TV is blasting away to. Though for some reason when I'm in my bedroom, I usually only trigger the bedroom unit. It gets very annoying when the one I want to talk to tells me she can't help while the other rattles off some long winded multi-paragraph answer (especially when I just asked "what time is it"). Being in another room (and sharing the same voice as the one talking next to you) its often hard to understand what she's saying - and of course there's no "Hey Google, what did you just say?" command... I wanted to set up a third in the other bedroom. But until I'm sure I won't be getting three different responses to each query.... Amazon claims to have an algorithm to determine which of multiple Echo units should respond. I don't have multiple Echo units so I can't test the validity myself, but if they can figure it out... I'm sure Google, with their expertise in machine learning shouldn't have too much bother with it. goodnightmare Acoustics. :) illregal I've got 3 in pretty close proximity, and a 4th whenever lg decides to send those out. Only about 1 out of 10 requests gets answered by the one i wasn't intentionally talking to. 4Ui812 Hi Paul ? Paul Quinn Hi! Rasovan Mircea Google have to upgrade the sound waves and not allow them to travel more than one room.... Tired_Guy I have a Home, a Nexus 9, a Nexus 7 and a Pixel XL, so assistant works on all of them. If all are in my den charging, saying OK Google is like he described only a bit weirder, as I can say it specifically to my Pixel XL in my hand and the Nexus 9 answers, through it's cover. Multiple device synchronization is vital Packer Backer Another reason to allow users to set the hot word. "Hey Bub! Hey Betty! Hey Fumbduck!" would would activate three different devices. Dk Schlösser The solution is to be able to change the trigger word for each device. You can do this on Alexa. Paul Quinn Currently, only my Home responds to "Hey Google" so I use that to talk to the Home. my phones and tablets don't respond. That cuts down on the problem a bit as long as I don't want to use voice with my phone. If I say "OK Google" to my phone, the Home may also respond. A quick fix for now would be to have the option to set the Home NOT to respond to "OK Google" and only "Hey Google." Bill Riess Yeah I just recently discovered this issue when I moved from an echo and echo dot to 4 Google homes. For the most part they work pretty good but it's annoying when they pick up in the wrong room. Multiuser and Sonos integration would be great additions as well. goodnightmare I've had four of these in my home since day one. Yes, occasionally we'll get some random response from a distant device, but it doesn't affect performance. The requested task is completed properly 95% of the time and any hiccups have never been due to multiple devices trying to provide feedback. Our Google Home experience has been quite pleasant and loads of fun. DomBrady Same. I've got three. I have had one interference related issue. Charles222 Same with four here as well. I've had an interference problem with my kitchen & living room ones, but taking a few steps towards one or the other solves it. nerdshowandtell.com I also have 6 Google Homes and the issues described here I only had a month or so ago and they went away. Id also make sure you have solid wifi with no interference to eliminate any delay in the homes seeing each other. As for the random asking/talking, maybe have seen that 3 times since it came out. Definitely not in awhile. Brett Koger I also have several Google Home devices, I am not experiencing the issues you state. I even have two of them with in 20 feet (they are in different rooms) I will see both activate but only one will respond. I have only experienced what you are see a few times. It is not the norm. Paul Quinn I have noticed that situation where more than one activate but only two of them can actually be visualized at one time. To me, that's a good sign. It means they are hearing you but identifying which one should respond. Maxr1998 Hi Paul! Very entertaining and interesting article. I don't have a Google Home myself yet (not available in Germany, functionality in German is likely pretty limited (as seen in Assistant on phones), my Home Assistant setup isn't supported by Google Home/Google Assistant, and IFTTT is too slow (10 seconds+) atm), but the idea of having one is very intriguing for me :) Paul Quinn Hi Max! I guess one plus side of living in another country is that Google works out bugs in the United States before it expands across the globe. Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get it functional:P But it's still sometimes a little annoying for power users wanting the latest and the greatest regardless of bugs ;) Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get it functional. 😜 But it's still sometimes a little annoying to not get the latest and greatest stuff being a poweruser ;) Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get them functional. 😜 But it's still sometimes a little annoying to not get the latest and greatest stuff being a poweruser ;) JD So it's not just me. Alexa is just that much better with its spatial recognition. It has a 100% hit rate on responding on the right unit. Sandeep Raghuraman One solution to your problem - setup mic + speakers in each room, and use one Google Home. That way, only one Google Home device will respond. Although, the next problem would be, how does Google Home decide which mic to listen through? Maybe a device that mixes all of those input streams from the different mics? Nick Riviera Try power cycling your units to keep them from talking over one another. sucatrops If you bought 6 Google Homes and didn't expect more than one to respond to you, you should shoot yourself. Hector Diaz Amazon echo has far field recognition between Echos so Google can include that with a software update. Ryan I dont see the need to have one in all 6 rooms of my home. Having one in the open air living/dining room and kitchen is plenty, it hears me from 40 feet no matter what. Then another in my bedroom. I dont think I need them in the guest rooms. Maybe one in the office, but that is all the way on the other side of the house from the bedroom. Maybe 6 is the overkill. Paul Quinn I have smart lighting in all the main rooms of the house. I wouldn't want any of us to be yelling from room to adjust lighting in another. I did put in remotes in the rooms as well because you should have another option besides voice. I think for most people, one or two is plenty. I'm really into smart home technology despite its incredibly fragmented implementation right now. I know my house is going beyond the norm. The fact that yours hear you from 40 feet away is what is causing the downfall in my house. Đức Thành 6 Google Homes? You're a crazy man. I like you. 6 is still nowhere near enough, though. Hector Diaz I have 2 echo Dot and 1 Echo. Missing still 2 echo Dot. So he is not crazy just want to have a real smart home doesn't matter where he stands like me. Andrew Hartley It was clear Paul was a bit 'unusual' from the moment he mentioned the Enterprise. I've been teaching science using the latest technology for 30+ and my dream has always been to walk into my classroom in the morning and for a cute sounding female voice to welcome me from my computer with a good morning asking me what I would like to do today. Google home I found you at last 😉 That doesn't sound weird does it 😎 Paul Quinn Sounds fantastic! D.Smithee I like when you're home alone in a quiet house and this thing starts spouting gibberish with no warning. Paul Quinn Tonight.... one of the Homes (in the office) decided to "forget" the lights in the room. Just the lights in the room that it's in. It kept saying there were no lights set up for that room. The remote went dead too. It was darkness. But... it let me operate the lights from other Homes. No I'm starting to wonder if Google read this... and is toying with me. I got the remote back online. The Home is still protesting. Bill3 Hi Paul, not sure what's going on there. I have three Google Homes and have only had that happen once or twice. They'll often beep together, but only one will answer. It could be a problem with your WiFi network. Are they connected to different AP points? Paul Quinn Yes. Despite two of them being closer to another access point in my house, I've kept the Homes on the primary router which is able to deliver a strong enough signal throughout the house. I use an access point to guarantee a connection to the irrigation controller outside. abc Oh, god. People are buying not more than one of this beta product. Are they rich or just plain stupid? Kostas 💪🎩 Man I laughed hard. Well written! DragoCubed 🎪 👻 👋 hi paul papastevez Where the ^*#} is the Google play movies integration??? Seriously, Netflix, a third party has been working for months and months. Lars Jeppesen I have 3 GH, and I've never had the problems described in the article. /edit And Hi to Paul, of course :) twighahn I think back to the smart homes of yesteryear. They had an intercom, radio, and auto switches. Now it's all more automatic and more personalised. Michael Paul, did you realize Google Home can only play your music library using a playlist? It cannot pull up a single or album or artist from your library.

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 125 Plus 1 on G+ 278 Share on Facebook 78 Share on Twitter Total Shares481 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 141k 106k Latest Deals 14 [Deal Alert] Get a 75" Sony LED UHD Android TV from Best Buy for $2150 today ($650 off) 2017/04/15 4:13pm PDTApr 15, 2017 19 [Deal Alert] Huawei Watch in Black Stainless Steel w/metal band $250 ($100 off) 2017/04/14 6:36pm PDTApr 14, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] 55 temporarily free and on-sale apps to round out your week 2017/04/14 12:50pm PDTApr 14, 2017 13 [Deal Alert] 2-Pack 6' Anker USB 3.0 A to C cables $12 w/ promo ($8 off) 2017/04/13 4:16pm PDTApr 13, 2017 32 [Deal Alert] NVIDIA is having a SHIELD gaming spring sale 2017/04/13 2:17pm PDTApr 13, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?

Some Pixel and Nexus fingerprint sensors not working after Android 7.1.2 update Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 12:17pm PDTApr 14, 2017 65 Plus 1 on G+ 79 Share on Facebook 73 Share on Twitter Total Shares217 Bug Watch Device Updates News Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel XL A number of Google Pixel and Nexus users are reporting that their fingerprint sensor is no longer working after the latest Android OS update. Several members of the Pixel and Nexus communities on Google's product forums have encountered the issue since installing the Android Nougat 7.1.2 OTA. The issue appears to be affecting both the Pixel and Pixel XL, as well as the LG-made Nexus 5X and Huawei Nexus 6P. Reports suggest that while the Pixel and Nexus Imprint sensors are no longer granting access to the devices, the swipe down for notifications Moves gesture is still functional. Attempts to solve the problem by deleting pre-existing fingerprints and starting from scratch haven't worked, as error messages are preventing new prints from being added to the devices. As usual, we'll update if we hear any official word from Google about the issue, hopefully regarding a fix.

Good_Ole_Pinocchio 6p has never given me those issues either... But it is slower than most newer scanners. Nick Which is to be expected. It's still fine. Jeff Neston By stating no problems, expect to get boot loop on your nexus 6. See the CNET article on nexus 5 and 6. Provided Google does not get the article defeated. If you do get it expect to lose all unsaved data. Then if want refund you will need to go to court. Sean Please GO AWAY....you have said this TWICE.......Its NOT the Nexus 5 and 6 Mr Brainiac....its the 5X and 6P......which are TOTALLY different than the Nexus 5 and Nexus 6.

Nicholas Matranga My Nexus 5x works just fine after the update. kalehv Sometimes my Pixel XL asks for pattern even after it recognizes my fingerprint (no, I am not talking about the first time after reboot). Rebooting the device works but why does this happen? Nathan Bryant I've also experienced this. It's random. Not so often it's a bother for me. kalehv Yup not so often with me either but being a mobile developer what bothers me is this happening, not the inconvenience it causes. Nathan Bryant That totally makes sense. I assume it's some kind of error even though it's not stating that it is. I don't see the pattern or constant of what causes it when it happens. mattcoz It does that after more than 48 hours have passed since you've last used your pattern. kalehv Nop its not that either. It does that after 4 hours I think. And it should do that only once after 4 hours but not keep doing that until you reboot. mattcoz It's definitely 48 hours, that comes straight from Google. But if it continues to do so, then that's something else. Mgamerz I've had it happen on my Nexus, it just occasionally requires a PIN. Says it's 4 hours of non usage but that doesn't seem true, sometimes I wake up and no pin and sometimes I'll be on and off the phone and it'll require a pin. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Typical. Google needs to fire some of their geniuses and hire some diligent coders, and also diligent testers for their QA department (assuming they even have one -- I sincerely doubt it). Alex Cruz Where did Google touch you? Middlefinger Oh really. Nexus/Pixel/Google error 4.453.563 this year alone. Im shocked (not really). Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Best hot steaming pile of dog s**t 2016. DragoCubed Google has been going downhill lately - at least with mobile excluding iOS. It's such a shame.

Cause for real, quality control is out of control right now. sebastianer If fixed my 6P bad battery life and early shutdown only replacing the stock Huawei battery with other battery with different brand (no need to wipe the phone in the process...) Several people did the same and is enjoying the battery life they were having when they bought the phone more than a year ago: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3534410 You could even try a Huawei battery replacement...but they say they aren't original. I just went for another brand because of the bad experience I had with the stock battery durability I don't know in the Pixel. But in the 6P in 90% of the cases...this is just a problem of the Huawei stock battery. Kendall Gustafson “Pixel”, the word sounds like the color pink. “Pixel” sounds like a little girl’s toy. Most men would never put a phone in their pocket named “Pixel” unless they were a cross/dresser. The word “Pixel” equates to a 50% loss of market share from the male market. “Nexus”, the word does not sound female or male. “Nexus”, the word sounds like science, desirable to any man, woman, or child. “Nexus”, the word sound like domination of market share. kalehv Hahaha that made me laugh. No I do not agree. I am a Pixel owner man and I am not whatever you said they'd be if they owned one but I laughed for some reason. Christian Trevor Clauss I must be a cross dresser then :D mattcoz Real men aren't insecure about what their phones are named.

It blows my mind been on 7.1.2 sense the factory imgs dropped Sean Same for me.....my Pixel XL hasnt had a single reported issue so far......... Donovan Goodwin Using mine actually causes phone to restart. Updating to 7.1.2 caused this and it even happens on ROMs. JG W00t! For once I don't suffer from Atrem's Luck... My 5X still lets me in with my fingerprint :) Doomberg I updated just last night. Glad I didn't get hit with this issue. nickarli 6P - had 4 fingers registered, right index stopped working after the update but other 3 still fully functional. I thought it was the massive amount of Utah dust in my fingers all of a sudden, but I guess not Defenestratus There's that vaunted Google QA again. This is how you get more Samsung. New_Guy Yep Mark Curtis What do you mean "this is how you get more Samsung"? 4Ui812 Why is Google having app many issues with the Fixel ? Sruly J Except since it's also affecting Nexus devices, this is more of a software issue in 7.1.2 than a hardware issue for Pixel devices. Defenestratus Because IIRC they use Agile software development. Agile is how you get shitty software. Lawstorant I've never thought I would say such thing, but I'm getting fed up with all the "issues" Google is facing with every update. On the Nexus 6, they went as far as to roll it back to 7.0. They should really step up their game especially if, they are fully responsible for every aspect of the device from now on. EvilHowl No issues on my 5X wade_county I thought these Pixels weren't supposed to be beta products? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They aren't. They're outrageously expensive alpha products. And they even have one defect (halo-cam) that can't be fixed in software. Still the best steaming pile of dog s**t of 2016, though. Everyone should buy one. Everyone who likes dog s**t anyway. Apparently people do, since HTC has shipped 2 million since launch. Kougeru I bad a Pixel for a week and took dozens of photos with no halo Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good for you. Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of 22 Pixel pictures had halos. None of the 22 G6 pictures had halos. They were all pictures of the same things, obviously with the same lighting. Google admits it's a design defect. If Google admits it, it's kind of hard to pretend it doesn't exist. whispy_snippet No one denies it's an issue. But what you seem incapable of accepting is it's a very minor issue that only very rarely rears its head. If you actively try to shoot an image with a strong light source angled towards the sensor (something you generally don't do because it often results in a poor shot on any camera) you might experience a halo effect. Might. But I've got literally hundreds of photos taken with my Pixel with no halos. You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want to fuel your juvenile rage fits. But people who actually use a Pixel every day don't seem to have a problem worth caring about. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It has nothing to do with a strong light source angled toward the sensor. That's normal lens flare. The Pixel halos are NOT normal lens flare. Like I said 4 out of 22 pictures. That's 18% of the pictures they took, and they didn't have strong light sources angled toward the sensor. 18% is not a rare problem, especially when the G6 NEVER had halos with the same exact pictures. Google admitted it's a flaw. Get over yourself and stop trying to justify it. whispy_snippet And like I said, I've taken hundreds of pictures and have seen a halo perhaps a couple of times. And I take a lot of photos given video and photography is my day job - indeed one of the reasons I chose the Pixel is because I wanted the best phone camera available for the times I don't have my proper gear with me. I've seen countless comparisons between the Pixel, iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 edge and while they're all great, in most situations the Pixel takes what I consider the better shot. You're making mountains out of molehills and carrying on like a right twat in the process. P. Sherman ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE DOESN'T MEAN JACKS--- if in scientific tests under controlled environments and the same conditions, the Pixel produced the halo effect, which Google has acknowledged to be a design deficiency standard on LITERALLY EVERY PIXEL MADE, but other cameras feature no such halo effect. FFS whispy_snippet I'm not denying there's an issue! I'm saying it's being blown out of proportion by people who want to blow it out of proportion. P. Sherman Referencing a scientific, controlled test and camera comparison is NOT blowing this out of proportion. Blowing out of proportion would be something how the Wall Street Journal set out to destroy PewDiePie for boneheadedly saying "Death to all Jews" as a joke. But referencing a camera comparison in exactly the same conditions and one phone had a halo effect but the other didn't is science, fact, nothing to blow out of proportion there. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good luck arguing with a Google fanboy in deep denial. thereasoner He's actually making solid points, the Pixels do have the best cameras overall​ and all smartphone cameras have some issues. whispy_snippet No, no. I'm a fanboy! Get it right! Cecil Hardwood Are you sure the Pixel has the best camera ? The reason I ask is because the DxOMark site that claims this refuses to release the iPhone 7 Plus (Not iPhone 7) scores and many believe it is because it scored higher than the Pixel. The theory goes on to say that Google is using their score in their advertising and DxO doesn't want to piss off Google. Something weird is going on for sure. DxO claimed long ago the review was coming soon and should have been out by now with the iPhone 7 Plus having been on the market as long as it has. thereasoner If I'm to make a judgment personally then I would say that probably the top 3-4 cameras on flagships are very close and what's best as far as the user is concerned is subjective. Do you prefer low light performance(I do) or digital zoom? Do your favour widespread angle lens or fast launch/focus etc. Those are personal preferences that make "the best " phone different for different people. That said, as far as reviews are concerned the Pixel is generally considered the best over all. As far as your conspiracy theories go, who knows? Anyone can create those about anything but I guess but I'm thinking that other than digital zoom and an artsy photo effect the 7+ cameras are very similar to the 7. whispy_snippet The iPhone 7 Plus is the same as the iPhone 7 apart from an additional, slower lens. In terms of raw image quality the iPhone 7 Plus achieves its best results with the lens it shares with its smaller sibling. So basically, it'll score no better than the 7. It's effectively already been tested. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All smartphone cameras have some issues? What issues does the G6 camera have in the comparison I linked? 23% of the Pixel photos have halo issues. Find a serious issue with 23% of the G6 photos and get back to us. thereasoner Keep in mind that if you take wide-angle shots, angles will be distorted and elongated from the side, especially when it comes to selfies with the front-facing camera. I also found that the front-facing camera takes relatively muddy shots in low-light. Compared to the Pixel XL, OnePlus 3T and (for the time being since we don't have the S8) the Galaxy S7, the G6 is on par with its rivals. The Pixel XL takes superior low-light images than all the phones though, and I prefer the richer contrast and saturation of the S7 by just a tad. -CNET There are a ton of reviews from various sources just like this and while the G6 cameras are considered very nice they do have their shortcomings and generally rank below the Pixel cameras overall. whispy_snippet Purple flaring and chromatic aberation. It's extremely noticeable in at least four images you shared with the Pixel comparison. Here you are: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration And just Google search purple flaring. Sorry to burst your bubble. whispy_snippet Show me the link to the test. I would like to see it. Even if their results suggest there's an issue (which there is as we all agree), the significance of the results can still be blown out of proportion which is what we're seeing occur in this ridiculous discussion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Here you go again. phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ Now that I've viewed the pics again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. Two involve a bright light. The other 3 do not. So that's 23% of 22 pictures. I wouldn't say that's blowing things out of proportion. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. Yeah, you paid a lot for your Pixel, so you have a hard time admitting it's a steaming pile of dog s**t. I understand. whispy_snippet Yep, so as we've agreed, halos sometimes appear in shots with strong light sources pointing at or angled towards the edge of the sensor. But let's just ignore the purple flaring and chromatic aberation in at least four of the images from the LG, right? You're demonstrating selective criticism. Every camera has strengths and weaknesses but on balance, the Pixel offers better images than competing phones more often than not. My position is unchanged. You're both making mountains out of molehills, and in no way does this "scientific" test guarantee that 23% of photos taken with a Pixel will exhibit a halo. It simply shows 23% of photos taken in this example demonstrated halos. You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. No one ever said the Pixel is perfect. But only you two are using ridiculous, extreme labels like "steaming pile of dog shit" and "HARDWARE DEFICIENCY" as though using capital letters makes your odd ball assertions more valid. Most reputable tech reviewers agree the Pixel has the best overall smartphone camera. You're entitled to disagree. P. Sherman 4/22. 4/22 photos from the Pixel have a halo effect. That's from Phandroid. That's 18% of photos the Pixel. That alone is damning. Google themselves have acknowledged that it is a HARDWARE DEFICIENCY and software fixes have done little to address this. They admitted it was there, that's all we need. If you knew that 4/22 Burritos Chipotle made would give you the Runs, but ZERO/22 Burritos Taco Bell made would, would YOU still choose to eat at Chipotle? whispy_snippet Show me the test! I've asked twice now. P. Sherman Lena Flare was removed from the photos, but not the video. http://highonandroid.com/android-smartphone-news/the-truth-about-google-pixel-camera-halolens-flare-effect/ Also, someone in the official Google forums shot with their Pixel and Nexus 6P in the same Time, conditions, everything. Guess what? https://support.google.com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsrROqMaXHqHg/?hl=by Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ 3 halos are obvious, 1 is subtle. The subtle one is where the picture is looking up at a building's windows. Now that I've viewed them again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. tigerstown I paid $380 for my new pixel XL so it's not a lot and I have no Halo in my pics I have proven this on Twitter already. abc More fanboy logic. I took pictures so everything is fine. Anyone who says its not fine is crazy. whispy_snippet How ridiculous. So a blogger takes 22 photos in various conditions and his experience is valid, but my experience of owning the phone and taking hundreds of photos in various conditions is not valid. You guys are weirdos. Andy But do you see problems with low light pics. I do on my wife's pixel. IPhone Looks so much better. I'm so disappointed abc I saw a rainbow once. Oh, are we not just conveying pointless ancedotes? mr.fozzo On my Nex6P, I have noticed that the Fingerprint reader has been less reliable lately. It requires more presses than the usual 1 press. Besnik Rrustemi My Nexus 6P working excellent so far, no battery problems, no fingerprint problems (better standby times on 7.1.2 to be honest). But yes,i can agree that fingerprint was much faster when i first got the device on 6.0 Marshmallow (for unlocking the device with the fingerprint) now it takes like 2 full seconds for that :( jimv1983 No issues on my Nexus 5X and the swipe on the sensor to bring down the notification panel is great. Alex Harrison Flashed the OTA myself on my 5X. No issues with it. Jeff Neston At least it is just the sensor. My nexus 5 was bricked by a Google update.. it got the boot loop. Google support lied to me claiming I broke the power button. False it was not broken. I ended up going small claims case against Google. They settled, but wanted me to sign gag order. Sorry, no way. I sent it back and got complete refund. Sneaky company. What probably causes boot loop update to occur is phone on long time. Some apps get memory leak over time. System then unpredictably unstable. Then the system does auto uplate from Google without asking user NOR even rebooting or turning off prior to the update. Then during update, Os gets corrupted. Then after failed update phone reboots thinking the. Update completed. Now phones dead. And Google not bother to address the issue. Pdiddy187 My 5x fingerprint sensor was great until it bootlooped yesterday morning. LG is going to repair it under warranty even though it's well out of warranty. La Kiesha Rodriguez Barrientes I have the ZTE axon 7 and over a month now google hasn't addressed a fix for the play store not loading apps over data or Wi-Fi.. Without uninstalling updates to play store and then maybe will not say "waiting for network" so frustrating and then maybe download once and have to do that everytime.. Dumb.. P. Sherman That's been like that since KitKat. F------ KITKAT. ahnafm Is google reacommodating their customers now? Brett Delia I thought some positive feedback was worth being added. My Nexus 6P is working perfectly after the update. I've had generally a great experience with all my Android phones. I've had an iPhone as well as a Windows mobile phone as well in my past. None have been as feature packed as my Android devices. New_Guy This and all the other ridiculous issues with the Pixel is a big reason I stick with Samsung... flyonthewall Lol Fernando S Mine is working ok in my Nexus 5x running 7.1.2.

Brian White Nexus 5x, running fine here ddevito If it wasn't for my OnePlus 3 I'd be on an iPhone. thereasoner One plus has their own issues/lousy support and the iPhone?

The more I use it the more I am leaning towards going back to an iPhone full-time. Apple, love them or hate them, knows how to deliver products, and support them. Period. thereasoner I'm glad that your iPhone 6s isn't affected by the many flawed updates and hardware issues​ that have plagued various iPhones over the years but the fact remains that Apple has faced class action lawsuits filed by their own customers for serious issues like Touch Disease and error 53 and for good reason. They have the worst track record of them all and to make things worse they're known for both ignoring iPhone issues until said class action lawsuits are launched and/or blaming their customers for the iPhone hardware/software problems. BTW, my Pixel "hums along swimmingly" as well, that doesn't mean issues with the Pixel don't exist much less those far more serious issues found on iPhones !

The Android Nougat 7.1.2 update brings with a number of bug fixes and improvements targeted at the two Pixel smartphones in particular. A number of problems such as the early shutdown issue, audio cracking issue and the issue of pink banding seen on the camera have been resolved. However, the 7.1.2 update has brought with it an altogether new problem for Pixel owners. The update is reportedly disabling the fingerprint scanner in some Pixel and Pixel XL devices. Many users have taken to the Google Product forums to complain about the same. It has to be kept in mind that not all users are experiencing the problem. If you have a Pixel smartphone, there is a chance you might not experience this issue at all after updating. Additionally, some Nexus 6P and Nexus 5X owners are also experiencing the same issue after installing the update. They are getting an error message stating "fingerprint hardware not available" when trying to unlock the device with via the fingerprint sensor. Also Read: HTC U Ultra vs Google Pixel: Is HTC finally back in the game? According to posts on the forum, rebooting the device or clearing the cache does not seem to solve the problem. Even deleting your configured fingerprints does not work as then the device does not allow you to add any new fingerprints. If you are facing the issue, the only option at this time seems to be to wait for Google to issue an update or try to revert back to Android 7.1.1 Nougat if you can. It seems some Pixel and Nexus owners will have to make do with traditional means of unlocking the smartphone till a fix is issued. Relief for Nexus 6P beta testers The latest iteration of Android Nougat is now also rolling out to Nexus 6P users enrolled in Google's Android Beta program. Rather strangely, Nexus 6P users of the Beta program were stuck on the 7.1.2 Beta release while regular Nexus 6P owners had already got the stable update. Now Google has rectified the situation and the stable release is being rolled out to users enrolled in the Beta program. Jio Wi-Fi calling Support While Android 7.1.1 Nougat brought Jio VoLTE support to Pixel owners back in December 2016, Wi-Fi calling was conspicuous by its absence. Now Wi-Fi calling support has finally arrived for the pixel and Pixel XL via the 7.1.2 update. Wi-Fi calling allows you to make calls in low network areas through a Wi-Fi network. Where Wi-Fi calling differs from VoIP platforms such as Skype is the fact that whilst it also uses the Internet to make calls, they are placed with your mobile number and not via some external user ID.

Volvo was even slower with its €1,170 (RM5,479) system that makes use of Inrix data.  The test vehicles were driven on four separate days during peak traffic between cities linked by motorways in and around Stuttgart.  The test took in more than 75 hours of driving time and more than 4,000 kilometres. — dpa Related Stories You May Be Interested Uber may face US$1mil fine over California drunken-driving complaints Apple considering multi-billion dollar investment in Toshiba chip unit Instagram’s Snapchat clone marks 200 million daily users milestone Facebook cracks down on 30,000 fake accounts in France Pedalling to save the planet Siew yoke loves briyani Others Also Read North Korea attempts but fails to launch missile - South Korea Two eagles help Dufner soar to Heritage lead Etihad Airways turns plane around for elderly couple to visit dying grandson advertisement Latest News Large fries?

What happens when you have more than one Google Home? Chaos. Paul Quinn Follow View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:22am PDTApr 14, 2017 28 Plus 1 on G+ 95 Share on Facebook 62 Share on Twitter Total Shares185 Editorials Google Home The Amazon Echo was my pacifier as I waited for Google’s entry into the home assistant space. Setting my Google Play Music library aside, I suffered through using Amazon’s attempt at a music service devoid of most of my own library. I connected my Google Calendar to Alexa and it offered a glimpse into my future relationship with Google’s assistant. Finally, in early November, I could get my hands on a new Google Home. I had pre-ordered from Google and then discovered I could pick one up at my local Best Buy. The very morning it hit the shelves, I immediately bought one. I brought it home, set it up in the family room and eagerly asked – “OK Google, play my morning hits playlist.” Without skipping a beat, she announced the list and the room filled with my music. The key point here – it was music from MY library. I didn’t cancel that Google pre-order. It was on its way. I figured I could listen to music in my bedroom as well. But – what about the other rooms in my house? What about the smart lights, smart switches, clever irrigation controller, and intelligent thermostat scattered throughout? I need a Google Home in every room to live the dream of a voice controlled home! I bought four more. My home is outfitted with six Google Home devices. There’s one in every room. I can control my smart home with my voice from anywhere I stand. I can spread music into any room. I can turn on, dim, and turn off lights in various rooms with just my voice. It’s as close as I can get to living on the Enterprise. Google's vision of the future with Google Home. Well, one Home. That’s the dream. Unfortunately, it isn’t a reality (yet). Google has failed at a key feature that it so proudly spoke of that morning in May. The nice lady living inside each Home is often unable to tell if you are talking to her or her sister in the neighboring room. It can result in some frustrating, sometimes comical, exchanges. It is amazing how well the little air freshener shaped unit can hear you from several rooms away. With multiple Homes, you’ll find yourself making requests and getting responses from two of them. It usually involves one of them, not necessarily the one closest to you, executing the request and the other apologizing to you that it can’t. From my bedroom in the morning, I might ask how long it will take to get to work and hear the detailed response in the distance from the kitchen. There will be times when the Home in front of me fulfills my request and another will rattle off from down the hall. You also have the ghosts. I never thought my home might be haunted - until now. There will be times when I turn off the TV, hang up on a call, or just walk out of the bathroom and hear something in another room. I’ll find a Google Home playing music or a podcast that I don’t listen to in a randomly selected room. Who asked to listen to opera at low volume in the guest room? Ghosts. There isn’t a constant circus of home assistants chiming in from all over the house. The closest Home does respond properly more than half of the time. However, I have found myself at times leaning over and almost whispering to a Google Home when I want to be sure the others don’t hear. There is talk of multiuser support coming soon, but it remains to be seen if this will improve its ability to identify which Home I am talking to. For now, I must look like a fool. I am whispering to an air freshener because I don’t want the others to hear. Creepy? Maybe. Tags editorial google home google home app google home fail video subscribe ...

Carson Saldanha Hi David Sean Thomas Hey Paul next time you're buying expensive accessories for every room in your house can you just throw me a hundo instead? Thanks! Sean Thomas Seems like something I would say. Paul Quinn I asked my office Home to get on that. The one in the kitchen responded. She can't do it but she's learning. Christopher Young I can completely sympathize with you. I have two Google Homes in my small apartment (living room/bedroom), and they frequently get confused where I'm at. I want to play music in the bedroom? Nope, the cozy jazz station starts blaring in the living room. There is one awesome benefit of having two Google Homes: I can fill my entire apartment with music with only a few words. dcdttu I hope Google Home gets a lot of support from Google itself and doesn't turn out to be a Hangouts. Or a Wave. Or a Nexus Player. Or a Nexus Q. Or a Google Reader. Or a tablet of any kind. Oh and hi Paul! Paul Quinn HI! Yeah, I'm worried that they will jump ship because they can't figure out a way to monetize it. No ads. If it starts playing ads, Home is moving out. The Echo doesn't really have a monetization angle except that you can shop on Amazon. Google added Google Express to the Home. But really? I'm not shopping on one of these things (yet). Lateef Alabi-Oki I thought the monetization was making money off selling the hardware. Paul Quinn They also need to keep expanding the ecosystem and product functionality which takes work that costs money. I don't know if that one time purchase price covers all that in the long run. Lord Argyris I think what Google is banking on is that if a user has one or more Homes, it makes them that much more likely to stick with the Android ecosystem in general, which means all Google's already existing means of getting money are a bit more secure from such a user switching over to the big "A". Of course it remains to be seen whether or not this is effective. Dk Schlösser The monetization is in the services offered by Google Paul Quinn I don't know what service I access through the Home makes Google any money, short of using it to buy things on Google Express. It does produce a little more profiling information but I doubt that it's enough to pay for the ongoing development. Ryan I think its all about search and locking you into their services, just like the chromecast. Because of chromecast (and now google home) I am more locked into Google Music. I am more locked into Youtube, Play Movies, searching on Google, etc. Just like Android. The specific device/service doesnt have to make money, its a "loss leader" to drive you to their other, profitable services. A very common thing in almost any consumer industry. Lars Jeppesen Precisely. I'm ditching Sonos in favor of Chromecast Audio, only because of my GH fluffthebunny The monetization is off selling all the data gleaned by your six devices listening to your every word. You have become one with the Home. You have been assimilated. Joshed The horror of ordering an item in the kitchen only to find the bedroom and office made duplicate orders. skitchbeatz I've got an open concept, one in the kitchen and one in the living room. They fight over responding and sometimes both respond. It's frustrating. I've thought about moving one of them up or down a floor. It's half implemented. It doesn't make sense because the assistant on the phone will sometimes read "answering on another device. Artem Russakovskii I have 4 Google Homes (2 in nearby areas where they can both hear me at the same time - kitchen and living room), 2 Alexas (though both Alexas can't hear me at the same time), and I can confirm - combined with multiple phones on family members, it's a mess. Let alone Home kicks in and starts talking once a day or so when not asked (doesn't happen nearly as often with Alexa). LithiumFox Never had that happen with ours... givitumibeybi 4 google homes and 2 alexas?? Artem, I think you might have some issues. Artem Russakovskii No, I just have more than one room. Dk Schlösser Change the trigger word for your Alexas Nick After my experiences with Amazon Echo, I have felt that these type of products are not ready for prime time. It's a cool concept, but these little, quirky issues that pop up with these "Home Assistants" suggest otherwise. Perhaps I'm more security minded than other people, but these sort of IoT products are ripe for security issues as well and the combination of these things has me totally turned off to the current market. Tony T. If you have multiple Homes, can you ask Google to play music and have all of them play the same music in sync? Defenestratus yes. Ed G You can have all of them play music like a Sonos. Also will link with Chromecast Audio. trickytree1984 Will it link to chrome cast proper? Joshua Pritt no, you can't group Chromecast video devices, only audio. Joshed This sucks. I don't see why they cant give older chromecast devices this feature. Paul Quinn Yes, you can create groups. For example, I have a group named "Front of the house" that connects three of them. You're best bet is to name them things that roll of the tongue like, "Hey Google, play my 90's hits playlist on the front of the house." Defenestratus I've got three homes, and I don't have this issue at all. Of course they're all on different floors and I live in a rather open-floor plan home so there's that. I've never had it come on as a ghost... ever. Chris You spent over 800 on google homes?!?! Omg man what kinda bank you making. That is insanity. Or no savings? I mean a financially responsible person cannot spend that much unless their income is huge haha. Defenestratus Yesterday I spent $1000 on a shower fixture (Moen U) David Ruddock OMG YOU ACTUALLY BOUGHT ONE OF THOSE? Defenestratus My wife saw it on "I want that" on DIY network and, well, yeah. We're about to start a master suite renovation so it was the perfect opportunity. For her, the hardest part of the day is getting up out of bed and waiting for the shower to heat up, getting cold in the process (she could get cold in the middle of equatorial guinea and we live in the North East US) so when she saw that she could turn the shower on from bed and it would alert her when it was ready for her, it was a done deal. I'm actually thinking of making a google assistant handler for it when it shows up. Chris Damn dude! How much do you make?? I see all these cool things and want them but I decide my money is better sitting in my savings account or the stock market. Defenestratus I specialize in software that is used for pharmaceutical research and clinical trials. I make a good living. Oh and my wife's a doctor. Chris Ah definitely. That's awesome dude. I work at a vaccine start up so hopefully we'll get a product past the FDA then I can buy 1k showers ;) Defenestratus Very cool. My company does a lot of work on vaccine studies. Best of luck. You have a long 12-14 years of approval process ahead of you! goodnightmare "Ok Moen...." Doesn't have quite the same ring to it. Paul Quinn The timing was right. I got three of them for $100 apiece using Visa Checkout and some helpful friends. Chris That's good dude. I haven't been able to convince myself to get one yet. I don't listen to music at home and not really sure what else I'd use it for. I did get a nest recently but still I don't mind pulling out my phone to change the temp. Paul Quinn I have an Ecobee now. My Nest kept thinking I was away because I didn't walk down that hallway enough. The Ecobee has remote sensors. Unfortunately, the Home currently does not have a direct integration with Home. I'm using IFTTT. Lawstorant Is it that hard to check which Home is the closest, based on the loudness of one's speech? Paul Quinn It might be that Google focused on their ability to hear your voice based on having one Home. If you have one, you want it to be able to hear you from a distance. That will backfire when you introduce more of them. They are all listening too well. Mace Moneta It could probably be resolved easily, by having the Google Homes reduce sensitivity of the mic, based upon the number of Google Home's on the network. Paul Quinn I had two Echos when they announced improved far-field functionality. I tested it at the time and it was working better. I didn't do any long term testing because I switched to the Home. With that in mind, Amazon was able to improve the situation with a software update so I agree that Google should have fixed this by now. Lawstorant Well, it's still Google. They have the money and the manpower to overcome such "hurdles". Why is it that more often than not, they seem like a small start-up composed of fresh out-of -college programmers. Nigel Antonio lol I thought I was the only one with that problem... Jesse Corbett So I have 2, one that covers the bedroom/bathroom half of my apartment and on that covers the kitchen/dining/living room section. I have never had an issue with both responding, if I may share my anecdote. However, I frequently am sitting 10 feet from the living room Home and hear my bedroom Home respond, despite being further away, in another room, down a hallway, with the first between me and it. I don't understand. Michael Stiffler Haha, I've had to whisper to my phone if I don't want her (Home) to hear! Aleem Kanji I think it's time to admit that Google is really screwing the pooch here. Nexus hardware failures, Pixel issues, Google Homes not living up to the hype, constant beta-feel to their products... I have a Nexus 6P, two Google Homes, and I'm all-in on Google services, but... for fuck's sake, I'm thinking of jumping ship entirely. Even Android news sites are seeming to be whole-heartedly disappointed with Google and the growing lack of positivity is disheartening. Google either needs to put up and get their shit together with product polish and following through on promises (or not promising the moon to begin with) or they shut the hell up and we all buy iPhones and call it a day. Paul Quinn My thoughts are not really heading down that road. The Home does a lot of things right. It's core features, music and access to Google's massive database of information, are working. Light control works well. There are some very useful IFTTT integrations. The Echo had its issues when it came out and it has grown up. I'm not ready to give up on the Home. I see it slowly improving. I don't miss any Echo features. My 6P was a good experience overall but ultimately, yeah, it failed me in terms of the camera. My new Mate 9 has an absolutely amazing camera. I have no experience with the Pixel though. The general consensus is that the Pixel is amazing. I'm looking forward to the next one. Leoniv Same here. I'm all in with Google tech and have been with them since 2.3, but lately they've been a hot mess. They broke the dialer on multiple phones, hosed bluetooth so it disconnected randomly, and that doesn't even include the issues with the nexus and pixel phones. I hate to admit it, but the iPhones are looking more attractive. Jack Smith Really? Google home is not even 6 months old. GH is easily the most humanist technology that you can buy It is incredible what can do but not perfect and yet it is over? Little dramatic? Where are you going to get anything close? I have had the Echo since the very first day. It is NOT like the GH. Comparisons are ridiculous. Echo has commands and the GH you talk We are so.early with this and obviously the relatively minor issues in the scheme of things will get resolved. I have one echo and counting GHs that I gave away I have purchased 7. Not to say I dislike my Echo but it is not the future, IMO, like the GH. Aleem Kanji I'm TOTALLY being dramatic, actually. I love my Google Home. I love my Nexus. I also tried an iPhone for the first time late last year (iOS 10 got my attention) and I love it too. My tenure with my iPhone was about 4 months, and, like clockwork, I'd always put my SIM back in my N6P every Wednesday night until Saturday, then switch back to my iPhone (which is a bitch with iMessage, BTDub). The iPhone IS more polished, has better power and battery management, but isn't exciting to me the way Android is. I could never give it up. It's like a drug. But, like a drug, I'm hopelessly addicted to something that promises the highest of highs, then always leaves me chasing the dragon. Google promises the world, then has a tendency to either fall short or simple pulls the rug out. In a world where the Pixel exists and it commands iPhone and Galaxy level money, in a world where Google is trying it's hand at a software AND hardware ecosystem, I expect more. I expect polish, I expect promises to be kept - or at least reasonable expectations to be given. Now, people can come back and say that Google is new at hardware and I understand and forgive that. But they aren't a hardware company in the way that they take responsibility for their products 100%, in that they quality test, in that they have any sort of retail presence that goes beyond simply "trying" something out. They have time to build that, so I'll admit that I need to give them time to sort it out. I'm just worried that they'll get complacent or lose interest and one morning wake up and say "Oh yeah, that Android thing and all that hardware and stuff - I'm over it." If Google is going to change direction and add hardware to their list of products, I expect that they keep in mind that it also means that we - not our data - become customers too. Jack Smith So much silliness in this post. First, what right now angers me the most is Apple completely abandoning the entire AirPort line without any warning. Last November just reassigning all the employes. So I replaced our two AirPort Extremes with Google Wifi. That is REAL life not some weird perception things. "Apple reportedly stops developing AirPort WiFi router products, moving employees to other projects" Who does that? Not Google. Instead with Google we have yesterday. "New Google ‘Dual Band WiFi Router’ Shows Up At The FCC" https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/04/new-google-dual-band-wifi-router-shows-up-at-the-fcc.html This entire narrative Google is horrible at hardware or abandons hardware products is rather ridiculous. Heck it would have been so easy for Google to not support the NON Google WiFI hardware but instead Google decided to spend the money and bring all their new WiFi software to the ONHUB. This is REAL life not fantasy. We have been an Apple house for over a decade. We still have tons of Apple products. But been more and more replacing with Google. With Google we have 4K, HDR, VR, Smart speaker, Mesh and the list keeps growing. I can NOT get any of this from Apple! That is simply the facts. Aleem Kanji Right. 2×4 alexa does this same thing compuguy1088 That's not true. A software update allows for multiple amazon echo devices with the same hotword to work. They've had this since around the end of last year. 2×4 that's my point - it doesnt work well Midnitte "You also have the ghosts. I never thought my home might be haunted - until now. There will be times when I turn off the TV, hang up on a call, or just walk out of the bathroom and hear something in another room. I’ll find a Google Home playing music or a podcast that I don’t listen to in a randomly selected room. Who asked to listen to opera at low volume in the guest room? Ghosts." I have two and I've grouped them in a "home unit" and I've never experienced this. Typically I'll play music on one but sometimes I'll tell it to play music on both and I've never experienced it playing music on a rogue Home goodnightmare Nor have I. Igen Then I am pretty sure that Paul's home is haunted and he should call an Sam & Dean asap. kalehv This is a constant struggle. I have two Google Homes and a bunch of phones / tablets that also respond to "Ok Google" I usually use "Hey Google" to avoid waking up phones and tablets but there is no other way round like when I want to be reminded of something, there is no command that only capable devices (phones and tablets) would listen and not the Home. Home wins over taking control and apologizes for not being able to set reminders and actual capable devices say "Answering on other device" :( thacounty I have mine in opposite corners of the house to prevent this. The real issue is that I'll talk quietly to my phone and it will still hear me. Then my Pixel says answering on another device, which is Home telling me she can't do that yet, while my Pixel could have handled it just fine. Gets frustrating, but my 2 year old son yelling at it to play Batman Play-Doh Eggs makes it worth double what I paid. JG Glad I'm not the only one with this problem. Right now I only have two Google Homes set up, one in my bedroom and the other in the living room. If I'm in the living room, even my normal speaking voice will almost certainly trigger both Home units to talk to me. Like Paul, I have to turn to the one in the living room and whisper in order to get only one. And that can be hard if the TV is blasting away to. Though for some reason when I'm in my bedroom, I usually only trigger the bedroom unit. It gets very annoying when the one I want to talk to tells me she can't help while the other rattles off some long winded multi-paragraph answer (especially when I just asked "what time is it"). Being in another room (and sharing the same voice as the one talking next to you) its often hard to understand what she's saying - and of course there's no "Hey Google, what did you just say?" command... I wanted to set up a third in the other bedroom. But until I'm sure I won't be getting three different responses to each query.... Amazon claims to have an algorithm to determine which of multiple Echo units should respond. I don't have multiple Echo units so I can't test the validity myself, but if they can figure it out... I'm sure Google, with their expertise in machine learning shouldn't have too much bother with it. goodnightmare Acoustics. :) illregal I've got 3 in pretty close proximity, and a 4th whenever lg decides to send those out. Only about 1 out of 10 requests gets answered by the one i wasn't intentionally talking to. 4Ui812 Hi Paul ? Paul Quinn Hi! Rasovan Mircea Google have to upgrade the sound waves and not allow them to travel more than one room.... Tired_Guy I have a Home, a Nexus 9, a Nexus 7 and a Pixel XL, so assistant works on all of them. If all are in my den charging, saying OK Google is like he described only a bit weirder, as I can say it specifically to my Pixel XL in my hand and the Nexus 9 answers, through it's cover. Multiple device synchronization is vital Packer Backer Another reason to allow users to set the hot word. "Hey Bub! Hey Betty! Hey Fumbduck!" would would activate three different devices. Dk Schlösser The solution is to be able to change the trigger word for each device. You can do this on Alexa. Paul Quinn Currently, only my Home responds to "Hey Google" so I use that to talk to the Home. my phones and tablets don't respond. That cuts down on the problem a bit as long as I don't want to use voice with my phone. If I say "OK Google" to my phone, the Home may also respond. A quick fix for now would be to have the option to set the Home NOT to respond to "OK Google" and only "Hey Google." Bill Riess Yeah I just recently discovered this issue when I moved from an echo and echo dot to 4 Google homes. For the most part they work pretty good but it's annoying when they pick up in the wrong room. Multiuser and Sonos integration would be great additions as well. goodnightmare I've had four of these in my home since day one. Yes, occasionally we'll get some random response from a distant device, but it doesn't affect performance. The requested task is completed properly 95% of the time and any hiccups have never been due to multiple devices trying to provide feedback. Our Google Home experience has been quite pleasant and loads of fun. DomBrady Same. I've got three. I have had one interference related issue. Charles222 Same with four here as well. I've had an interference problem with my kitchen & living room ones, but taking a few steps towards one or the other solves it. nerdshowandtell.com I also have 6 Google Homes and the issues described here I only had a month or so ago and they went away. Id also make sure you have solid wifi with no interference to eliminate any delay in the homes seeing each other. As for the random asking/talking, maybe have seen that 3 times since it came out. Definitely not in awhile. Brett Koger I also have several Google Home devices, I am not experiencing the issues you state. I even have two of them with in 20 feet (they are in different rooms) I will see both activate but only one will respond. I have only experienced what you are see a few times. It is not the norm. Paul Quinn I have noticed that situation where more than one activate but only two of them can actually be visualized at one time. To me, that's a good sign. It means they are hearing you but identifying which one should respond. Maxr1998 Hi Paul! Very entertaining and interesting article. I don't have a Google Home myself yet (not available in Germany, functionality in German is likely pretty limited (as seen in Assistant on phones), my Home Assistant setup isn't supported by Google Home/Google Assistant, and IFTTT is too slow (10 seconds+) atm), but the idea of having one is very intriguing for me :) Paul Quinn Hi Max! I guess one plus side of living in another country is that Google works out bugs in the United States before it expands across the globe. Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get it functional:P But it's still sometimes a little annoying for power users wanting the latest and the greatest regardless of bugs ;) Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get it functional. 😜 But it's still sometimes a little annoying to not get the latest and greatest stuff being a poweruser ;) Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get them functional. 😜 But it's still sometimes a little annoying to not get the latest and greatest stuff being a poweruser ;) JD So it's not just me. Alexa is just that much better with its spatial recognition. It has a 100% hit rate on responding on the right unit. Sandeep Raghuraman One solution to your problem - setup mic + speakers in each room, and use one Google Home. That way, only one Google Home device will respond. Although, the next problem would be, how does Google Home decide which mic to listen through? Maybe a device that mixes all of those input streams from the different mics? Nick Riviera Try power cycling your units to keep them from talking over one another. sucatrops If you bought 6 Google Homes and didn't expect more than one to respond to you, you should shoot yourself. Hector Diaz Amazon echo has far field recognition between Echos so Google can include that with a software update. Ryan I dont see the need to have one in all 6 rooms of my home. Having one in the open air living/dining room and kitchen is plenty, it hears me from 40 feet no matter what. Then another in my bedroom. I dont think I need them in the guest rooms. Maybe one in the office, but that is all the way on the other side of the house from the bedroom. Maybe 6 is the overkill. Paul Quinn I have smart lighting in all the main rooms of the house. I wouldn't want any of us to be yelling from room to adjust lighting in another. I did put in remotes in the rooms as well because you should have another option besides voice. I think for most people, one or two is plenty. I'm really into smart home technology despite its incredibly fragmented implementation right now. I know my house is going beyond the norm. The fact that yours hear you from 40 feet away is what is causing the downfall in my house. Đức Thành 6 Google Homes? You're a crazy man. I like you. 6 is still nowhere near enough, though. Hector Diaz I have 2 echo Dot and 1 Echo. Missing still 2 echo Dot. So he is not crazy just want to have a real smart home doesn't matter where he stands like me. Andrew Hartley It was clear Paul was a bit 'unusual' from the moment he mentioned the Enterprise. I've been teaching science using the latest technology for 30+ and my dream has always been to walk into my classroom in the morning and for a cute sounding female voice to welcome me from my computer with a good morning asking me what I would like to do today. Google home I found you at last 😉 That doesn't sound weird does it 😎 Paul Quinn Sounds fantastic! D.Smithee I like when you're home alone in a quiet house and this thing starts spouting gibberish with no warning. Paul Quinn Tonight.... one of the Homes (in the office) decided to "forget" the lights in the room. Just the lights in the room that it's in. It kept saying there were no lights set up for that room. The remote went dead too. It was darkness. But... it let me operate the lights from other Homes. No I'm starting to wonder if Google read this... and is toying with me. I got the remote back online. The Home is still protesting. Bill3 Hi Paul, not sure what's going on there. I have three Google Homes and have only had that happen once or twice. They'll often beep together, but only one will answer. It could be a problem with your WiFi network. Are they connected to different AP points? Paul Quinn Yes. Despite two of them being closer to another access point in my house, I've kept the Homes on the primary router which is able to deliver a strong enough signal throughout the house. I use an access point to guarantee a connection to the irrigation controller outside. abc Oh, god. People are buying not more than one of this beta product. Are they rich or just plain stupid? Kostas 💪🎩 Man I laughed hard. Well written! DragoCubed 🎪 👻 👋 hi paul papastevez Where the ^*#} is the Google play movies integration??? Seriously, Netflix, a third party has been working for months and months. Lars Jeppesen I have 3 GH, and I've never had the problems described in the article. /edit And Hi to Paul, of course :) twighahn I think back to the smart homes of yesteryear. They had an intercom, radio, and auto switches. Now it's all more automatic and more personalised. Michael Paul, did you realize Google Home can only play your music library using a playlist? It cannot pull up a single or album or artist from your library.

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 125 Plus 1 on G+ 278 Share on Facebook 78 Share on Twitter Total Shares481 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment.

Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 141k 106k Latest Deals 14 [Deal Alert] Get a 75" Sony LED UHD Android TV from Best Buy for $2150 today ($650 off) 2017/04/15 4:13pm PDTApr 15, 2017 19 [Deal Alert] Huawei Watch in Black Stainless Steel w/metal band $250 ($100 off) 2017/04/14 6:36pm PDTApr 14, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] 55 temporarily free and on-sale apps to round out your week 2017/04/14 12:50pm PDTApr 14, 2017 13 [Deal Alert] 2-Pack 6' Anker USB 3.0 A to C cables $12 w/ promo ($8 off) 2017/04/13 4:16pm PDTApr 13, 2017 32 [Deal Alert] NVIDIA is having a SHIELD gaming spring sale 2017/04/13 2:17pm PDTApr 13, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?

Photograph: Robert Gumpert for the Guardian Politics Saturday interview Steve Hilton: 'I’m rich, but I understand the frustrations people have' David Cameron’s former blue-sky thinker says the rise of populism is due to the super-rich’s inability to put themselves in the shoes of those less well off – before accepting a free cab ride and becoming lost for words about his own wealth Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Decca Aitkenhead Saturday 15 April 2017 02.00 EDT Last modified on Saturday 15 April 2017 05.37 EDT Steve Hilton’s office looks so typically San-Fran tech-startup that it could be the work of a set designer. Surfaces are matt white, the centrepiece is the kitchen, and there are various bins for different types of recycling. The only thing missing is Hilton. He can’t call to say he’s running 45 minutes late, because he doesn’t own a smartphone. The CEO of Crowdpac ditched his five years ago. This presents another problem when he arrives, because he has to leave again in 15 minutes, having promised to attend an exhibition at his sons’ school. Would I mind coming too? We could do the interview in the back of an Uber? Sure, I say, assuming he’ll call one. Doesn’t he have an Uber account? He looks at me, bemused. “I don’t have a phone.” So I call an Uber on my account, and we set off south together to Silicon Valley. We are an hour’s drive from the school, and a very long way from Downing Street. In his old life, Hilton was David Cameron’s close friend, strategy director and blue-sky thinker, godfather to his eldest son, Ivan, and so close that Michael Gove once observed: “It’s impossible to know where Steve ends and David begins.” Rumoured to have voted Green in 2005, he was the funky, liberal architect of Cameron’s detoxification programme, the acceptable face of the new Tories who dreamed up the Big Society and became famous for arriving at work barefoot in cycling shorts. He also became famous for falling out with almost everyone in Whitehall, and in 2012 left for California and a new life with his wife, Rachel Whetstone, suddenly very much the second half of the power couple: Whetstone was then Google’s director of communications and later moved to Uber; but she abruptly quit her job there this week. Hilton tells an illuminating story about his wife demonstrating an early prototype of Google’s voice activation software. She spoke into a phone: “OK Google, who is Steve Hilton?” It replied: “Steve Hilton is married to Rachel Whetstone.” Facebook Twitter Pinterest Hilton with George Osborne and David Cameron in 2015. The severing of relations since has been ‘their choice. I don’t think about it.’ Photograph: Dafydd Jones/Rex Shutterstock But last year he resurfaced on the British political scene in the referendum campaign, arguing passionately for Brexit, and claiming that, were Cameron a backbencher, he would be supporting leave, too. Relations between the pair were reportedly strained to breaking point, though Hilton has until now maintained that they remained friends. He raised eyebrows even further by coming out as a Trump supporter – and now he has joined Fox News, with a show called The Next Revolution, which will explore the rise of populism in a weekly primetime Sunday night slot. Now 47, Hilton has lost none of his restless, bouncy energy, and talks flat-out for our whole journey. I want to know what a nice, green liberal is doing promoting Trump on Fox, but my questions seem to strike him as typical of the left’s lamentably lumpen way of looking at the world. I’ve got Fox News all wrong, he says. “It’s the only place where there is actual political debate going on in America.” When I ask if he didn’t wince to see veteran Fox presenter Bill O’Reilly mocking the hairstyle of congresswoman Maxine Waters (he called it a “James Brown wig”), a suppressed smile dances round his mouth. “I just think people make jokes, say things, you know.” What Trump said about grabbing women by the pussy “was disgusting, yes. But let’s be honest, it’s not just Donald Trump that treats women with disrespect and sexualises them.” Had Bernie Sanders been the Democratic nominee, Hilton “probably would have supported him”. Hilton says he is not really a conservative or a liberal: “It’s hard to pin me down because I’m a bit of Bernie Sanders, a bit of Rand Paul, bit of John Kasich.” He’s pro-Trump simply because he was the candidate most likely to “shake things up”. What Hilton really is, he has realised, is a populist. “I only really heard of it as a political notion here in the campaign last year. I won’t say l’d literally never heard the word, but it definitely wasn’t part of any thinking.” Now he believes his 2015 book, More Human, was in fact a populist manifesto, and Crowdpac, his political crowdfunding tech company, a vehicle for promoting it. Populism may have “more negative connotations than positive ones”, but he intends to change all that through his Fox show. “What I would love it to be is presenting the positive version of populism, which is what I’ve always believed in, and that’s been consistent.” Does his enthusiasm for populism extend as far as hoping for a Marine Le Pen victory in France? He won’t say, because “I just don’t know enough about it”, but he will say that he’s fed up with liberals accusing politicians like her of racism. Facebook Twitter Pinterest ‘The thing that has always motivated me is that sense of unfairness’ … Hilton with Cameron at No 10. Photograph: Rex Shutterstock Last year, post-Brexit, Hilton expressed dismay at the anti-immigrant mood that quickly spread, but looks impatient now when I suggest that ugliness, even if unintended, is the all-but-inevitable consequence of populist rhetoric. “I don’t think it’s inevitable at all. I just think that we need massive revolutionary change in the way that we do things, and it’s not enough to say that we can’t even talk about the necessity of that because it might have [ugly consequences].” The rise of populism, he says firmly, has nothing to do with values and everything to do with “the collapse of economic security”. “The median US household income is lower today than in 1999. Half of the country are on lower incomes, and the poorer you are, the worse it is, and the other half has gone up. You’ve had such a catastrophic effect on people’s incomes and economic security from this agenda of unconstrained globalisation and all the things that a, kind of, Davos crowd believe in. The impact of that on real people’s lives – that’s ugly. And what you’ve got is a cry for the pain of people whose lives for decades have been really shit. The thing that has always motivated me is that sense of unfairness.” How Steve Hilton turned on his friend and ex-boss David Cameron Read more More than anything, what upsets Hilton is the “staggering lack of empathy of the rich people for the lives of most people. I’m rich, but I understand the frustration that people have.” Does he think the rich people around him don’t get it? “They really, really don’t.” He and Cameron last spoke in December 2015. At the infamous Sexy Fish party? “Yes, I think that would have been the last time.” Did lobbying for Uber, as has been alleged, take place at that party? He cites a long-standing pact with his wife never to discuss each other’s jobs, so can’t say anything. But wasn’t the alleged cosy chumocracy exactly the sort of thing Hilton rails against? “Yes, and, you know, in many ways it feels frustrating that I can’t get into that. But I think it’s a perfectly fair point, yes. I see that. But I’m already doing more than I said I would in terms of talking about it.” He is scathing about George Osborne becoming Evening Standard editor while remaining an MP. “I think it looks entitled. I guess in the UK, maybe, to a certain extent, constituents have got used to the idea that a lot of their MPs just don’t really give a shit about them, and they’re off in London doing their stuff.” It is, he says, the worst example of revolving-door syndrome, and if he were allowed to donate he would love to contribute to an #OsborneMustGo campaign someone has launched on Crowdpac. Does he think he has been disloyal to his former friends? “Well, not from my point of view.” The severing of relations is “their choice. I don’t think about it.” Hilton knew Cameron would be “really cross” about him campaigning for leave, but didn’t realise it would cost him their friendship. “And I still don’t think it needs to.” Hilton was “shocked” when he resigned, and sent his old friend an email telling him he didn’t think he’d had to, but Cameron never replied. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Hilton with Boris Johnson. He knew supporting the Brexit leave campaign would make Cameron ‘really cross’. Photograph: Stefan Rousseau/PA We pull up at the school, deep in Silicon Valley. He’s excited to show me round his sons’ classrooms; the school is “experimental”. It is also, nonetheless, private and highly exclusive. The cost of our journey here is never mentioned, in the way that one wouldn’t think to mention paying someone back for a bus fare. Isn’t Hilton himself a member of the very wealthy coastal elites he castigates? “Well, technically, yes. But that’s my point about empathy. Just because you’re part of it doesn’t mean you can’t empathise or understand life outside of it, you know. That I find really surprising, that so many people just haven’t been able to do that.” It has been a tour de force of fluent certainties, righteous passion and implacable self-belief; Hilton’s self-image as a political pirate, a free-thinking radical on the side of the little guy, is impregnable. And then I ask one simple question, and the whole story he tells about himself unravels. Do he and his family deserve their wealth? He stares at me in surprise. “Er … I think we definitely both work really hard.” Sure, but do they deserve their level of wealth? “Well … such a good question. I’m just trying to think.” He falls silent for 11 seconds, searching his mind for an answer that doesn’t undermine everything he’s been saying. Facebook Twitter Pinterest Hilton’s wife, Rachel Whetstone, who quit her job at Uber this week. Photograph: Silverhub/Rex/Shutterstock “I guess, funnily enough, this is what I always felt about the debate about inequality. The problem that needs to be addressed is people not having that security, just worrying so much, and therefore you can’t worry about people’s earnings at the top.” He must surely see that at the heart of inequality – and what makes it so toxic – is the sense people aren’t getting what they deserve, at either end of the pay scale? “Yes.” So can he tell the poor he cares about that he deserves what he’s got? “I think that’s not … because in the end, it’s not a moral … I think that’s what all this conversation that’s happening around about … that’s why … that’s the whole …” He becomes unquotably inarticulate. “I just don’t believe it makes sense to try to regulate pay, I just don’t.” But do they deserve their wealth? “I don’t even think that’s the right way to think about it.” Does he not realise that it’s how the person who cleans his toilet thinks about it – and every person who has worked hard, played by the rules, and still can’t feed their family? Isn’t that precisely what’s fuelling populism? He thinks again. “A lot of people asked how it is that the person who represents that populist thing in America happens to be this billionaire, right? But it’s that sense of: is it a fair and legitimate and reasonable way to make money? So when they look at Trump they say, ‘OK, well, he built buildings.’ Right, I get that, that’s a thing. And he was on TV and he did this show that lots of people enjoyed watching. That’s fair enough. That’s stuff that I can understand. Whereas with Mitt Romney’s wealth, it’s all from financial wheeler-dealing that I don’t really understand.” Would they understand what Hilton and his wife do? He looks increasingly flustered. “I think that they understand … I just don’t know. I think that it depends on …” I say I think they’d look at the job titles of most Silicon Valley millionaires and think that these guys didn’t risk the roof over their head to build businesses; they just got corporate jobs that paid them in stock and made them super-rich. “Yes, yes,” he nods. “I get that, but how are you going to actually do anything about that? In the end, you come back to, well, there’s a market and that’s how it works.” Former David Cameron top adviser Steve Hilton to host Fox News show Read more It seems a remarkable coincidence that the sole pillar of our economic system this radical blue-sky thinker won’t challenge is the one that has made his family super-rich. He adds: “The argument for markets is competitive markets,” but this is a tricky defence to mount in Silicon Valley, I suggest, when the economics of the internet are notorious for creating monopolies – Google, Amazon and so on. “I agree, totally, yes.” So, I try once more: can he say that he and his family deserve their wealth? “I think that we’re maybe overstating the degree to which we’re in that economic category. We’re genuinely not.” Hilton lives in the second most expensive zip code in America, in a house that cost $20.5m. Whetstone is thought to have earned in excess of $50m at Google. He’s quite right, there’s an empathy problem among the rich. I’m just amazed he thinks he’s miraculously unafflicted by it.

Some Pixel and Nexus fingerprint sensors not working after Android 7.1.2 update Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 12:17pm PDTApr 14, 2017 65 Plus 1 on G+ 79 Share on Facebook 73 Share on Twitter Total Shares217 Bug Watch Device Updates News Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel XL A number of Google Pixel and Nexus users are reporting that their fingerprint sensor is no longer working after the latest Android OS update. Several members of the Pixel and Nexus communities on Google's product forums have encountered the issue since installing the Android Nougat 7.1.2 OTA. The issue appears to be affecting both the Pixel and Pixel XL, as well as the LG-made Nexus 5X and Huawei Nexus 6P. Reports suggest that while the Pixel and Nexus Imprint sensors are no longer granting access to the devices, the swipe down for notifications Moves gesture is still functional. Attempts to solve the problem by deleting pre-existing fingerprints and starting from scratch haven't worked, as error messages are preventing new prints from being added to the devices. As usual, we'll update if we hear any official word from Google about the issue, hopefully regarding a fix.

Max Same here with my XL. elav Me too. No issues on my XL.. Nicholas Matranga My Nexus 5x works just fine after the update. kalehv Sometimes my Pixel XL asks for pattern even after it recognizes my fingerprint (no, I am not talking about the first time after reboot). Rebooting the device works but why does this happen? Nathan Bryant I've also experienced this. It's random. Not so often it's a bother for me. kalehv Yup not so often with me either but being a mobile developer what bothers me is this happening, not the inconvenience it causes. Nathan Bryant That totally makes sense. I assume it's some kind of error even though it's not stating that it is. I don't see the pattern or constant of what causes it when it happens. mattcoz It does that after more than 48 hours have passed since you've last used your pattern. kalehv Nop its not that either. It does that after 4 hours I think. And it should do that only once after 4 hours but not keep doing that until you reboot. mattcoz It's definitely 48 hours, that comes straight from Google. But if it continues to do so, then that's something else. Mgamerz I've had it happen on my Nexus, it just occasionally requires a PIN. Says it's 4 hours of non usage but that doesn't seem true, sometimes I wake up and no pin and sometimes I'll be on and off the phone and it'll require a pin. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Typical. Google needs to fire some of their geniuses and hire some diligent coders, and also diligent testers for their QA department (assuming they even have one -- I sincerely doubt it). Alex Cruz Where did Google touch you? Middlefinger Oh really. Nexus/Pixel/Google error 4.453.563 this year alone. Im shocked (not really). Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Best hot steaming pile of dog s**t 2016. DragoCubed Google has been going downhill lately - at least with mobile excluding iOS. It's such a shame. They haven't exactly gone downhill haven't they? They've stayed the same SpeakethTheTruth I think you might be on to something with that last paragraph. Cause for real, quality control is out of control right now. sebastianer If fixed my 6P bad battery life and early shutdown only replacing the stock Huawei battery with other battery with different brand (no need to wipe the phone in the process...) Several people did the same and is enjoying the battery life they were having when they bought the phone more than a year ago: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3534410 You could even try a Huawei battery replacement...but they say they aren't original. I just went for another brand because of the bad experience I had with the stock battery durability I don't know in the Pixel. But in the 6P in 90% of the cases...this is just a problem of the Huawei stock battery. Kendall Gustafson “Pixel”, the word sounds like the color pink. “Pixel” sounds like a little girl’s toy. Most men would never put a phone in their pocket named “Pixel” unless they were a cross/dresser. The word “Pixel” equates to a 50% loss of market share from the male market. “Nexus”, the word does not sound female or male. “Nexus”, the word sounds like science, desirable to any man, woman, or child. “Nexus”, the word sound like domination of market share. kalehv Hahaha that made me laugh. No I do not agree. I am a Pixel owner man and I am not whatever you said they'd be if they owned one but I laughed for some reason. Christian Trevor Clauss I must be a cross dresser then :D mattcoz Real men aren't insecure about what their phones are named.

No need to test or anything. Too much trouble for the geniuses at Google. They're so smart that if it compiles with just warnings, there couldn't possibly be any problems. John Doe I am sure that they do test it but there are things that go wrong...obviously those bugs will be in the spotlight on an Android blog meaning in real life they are probably affecting a small number of users. This is why you do a roll out of the OTA not just dump it all out there. Bruce Wayne Ohhh...Lol. I just re-read his statement now. neates Pixel and Nexus - rich beta testers... Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Rich alpha testers. asifalimirza No issues two weeks after the update.

It blows my mind been on 7.1.2 sense the factory imgs dropped Sean Same for me.....my Pixel XL hasnt had a single reported issue so far......... Donovan Goodwin Using mine actually causes phone to restart. Updating to 7.1.2 caused this and it even happens on ROMs. JG W00t! For once I don't suffer from Atrem's Luck... My 5X still lets me in with my fingerprint :) Doomberg I updated just last night. Glad I didn't get hit with this issue. nickarli 6P - had 4 fingers registered, right index stopped working after the update but other 3 still fully functional. I thought it was the massive amount of Utah dust in my fingers all of a sudden, but I guess not Defenestratus There's that vaunted Google QA again. This is how you get more Samsung. New_Guy Yep Mark Curtis What do you mean "this is how you get more Samsung"? 4Ui812 Why is Google having app many issues with the Fixel ? Sruly J Except since it's also affecting Nexus devices, this is more of a software issue in 7.1.2 than a hardware issue for Pixel devices. Defenestratus Because IIRC they use Agile software development. Agile is how you get shitty software. Lawstorant I've never thought I would say such thing, but I'm getting fed up with all the "issues" Google is facing with every update. On the Nexus 6, they went as far as to roll it back to 7.0. They should really step up their game especially if, they are fully responsible for every aspect of the device from now on. EvilHowl No issues on my 5X wade_county I thought these Pixels weren't supposed to be beta products? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They aren't. They're outrageously expensive alpha products. And they even have one defect (halo-cam) that can't be fixed in software. Still the best steaming pile of dog s**t of 2016, though. Everyone should buy one. Everyone who likes dog s**t anyway. Apparently people do, since HTC has shipped 2 million since launch. Kougeru I bad a Pixel for a week and took dozens of photos with no halo Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good for you. Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of 22 Pixel pictures had halos. None of the 22 G6 pictures had halos. They were all pictures of the same things, obviously with the same lighting. Google admits it's a design defect. If Google admits it, it's kind of hard to pretend it doesn't exist. whispy_snippet No one denies it's an issue. But what you seem incapable of accepting is it's a very minor issue that only very rarely rears its head. If you actively try to shoot an image with a strong light source angled towards the sensor (something you generally don't do because it often results in a poor shot on any camera) you might experience a halo effect. Might. But I've got literally hundreds of photos taken with my Pixel with no halos. You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want to fuel your juvenile rage fits. But people who actually use a Pixel every day don't seem to have a problem worth caring about. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It has nothing to do with a strong light source angled toward the sensor. That's normal lens flare. The Pixel halos are NOT normal lens flare. Like I said 4 out of 22 pictures. That's 18% of the pictures they took, and they didn't have strong light sources angled toward the sensor. 18% is not a rare problem, especially when the G6 NEVER had halos with the same exact pictures. Google admitted it's a flaw. Get over yourself and stop trying to justify it. whispy_snippet And like I said, I've taken hundreds of pictures and have seen a halo perhaps a couple of times. And I take a lot of photos given video and photography is my day job - indeed one of the reasons I chose the Pixel is because I wanted the best phone camera available for the times I don't have my proper gear with me. I've seen countless comparisons between the Pixel, iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 edge and while they're all great, in most situations the Pixel takes what I consider the better shot. You're making mountains out of molehills and carrying on like a right twat in the process. P. Sherman ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE DOESN'T MEAN JACKS--- if in scientific tests under controlled environments and the same conditions, the Pixel produced the halo effect, which Google has acknowledged to be a design deficiency standard on LITERALLY EVERY PIXEL MADE, but other cameras feature no such halo effect. FFS whispy_snippet I'm not denying there's an issue! I'm saying it's being blown out of proportion by people who want to blow it out of proportion. P. Sherman Referencing a scientific, controlled test and camera comparison is NOT blowing this out of proportion. Blowing out of proportion would be something how the Wall Street Journal set out to destroy PewDiePie for boneheadedly saying "Death to all Jews" as a joke. But referencing a camera comparison in exactly the same conditions and one phone had a halo effect but the other didn't is science, fact, nothing to blow out of proportion there. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good luck arguing with a Google fanboy in deep denial. thereasoner He's actually making solid points, the Pixels do have the best cameras overall​ and all smartphone cameras have some issues. whispy_snippet No, no. I'm a fanboy! Get it right! Cecil Hardwood Are you sure the Pixel has the best camera ? The reason I ask is because the DxOMark site that claims this refuses to release the iPhone 7 Plus (Not iPhone 7) scores and many believe it is because it scored higher than the Pixel. The theory goes on to say that Google is using their score in their advertising and DxO doesn't want to piss off Google. Something weird is going on for sure. DxO claimed long ago the review was coming soon and should have been out by now with the iPhone 7 Plus having been on the market as long as it has. thereasoner If I'm to make a judgment personally then I would say that probably the top 3-4 cameras on flagships are very close and what's best as far as the user is concerned is subjective. Do you prefer low light performance(I do) or digital zoom? Do your favour widespread angle lens or fast launch/focus etc. Those are personal preferences that make "the best " phone different for different people. That said, as far as reviews are concerned the Pixel is generally considered the best over all. As far as your conspiracy theories go, who knows? Anyone can create those about anything but I guess but I'm thinking that other than digital zoom and an artsy photo effect the 7+ cameras are very similar to the 7. whispy_snippet The iPhone 7 Plus is the same as the iPhone 7 apart from an additional, slower lens. In terms of raw image quality the iPhone 7 Plus achieves its best results with the lens it shares with its smaller sibling. So basically, it'll score no better than the 7. It's effectively already been tested. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All smartphone cameras have some issues? What issues does the G6 camera have in the comparison I linked? 23% of the Pixel photos have halo issues. Find a serious issue with 23% of the G6 photos and get back to us. thereasoner Keep in mind that if you take wide-angle shots, angles will be distorted and elongated from the side, especially when it comes to selfies with the front-facing camera. I also found that the front-facing camera takes relatively muddy shots in low-light. Compared to the Pixel XL, OnePlus 3T and (for the time being since we don't have the S8) the Galaxy S7, the G6 is on par with its rivals. The Pixel XL takes superior low-light images than all the phones though, and I prefer the richer contrast and saturation of the S7 by just a tad. -CNET There are a ton of reviews from various sources just like this and while the G6 cameras are considered very nice they do have their shortcomings and generally rank below the Pixel cameras overall. whispy_snippet Purple flaring and chromatic aberation. It's extremely noticeable in at least four images you shared with the Pixel comparison. Here you are: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration And just Google search purple flaring. Sorry to burst your bubble. whispy_snippet Show me the link to the test. I would like to see it. Even if their results suggest there's an issue (which there is as we all agree), the significance of the results can still be blown out of proportion which is what we're seeing occur in this ridiculous discussion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Here you go again. phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ Now that I've viewed the pics again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. Two involve a bright light. The other 3 do not. So that's 23% of 22 pictures. I wouldn't say that's blowing things out of proportion. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. Yeah, you paid a lot for your Pixel, so you have a hard time admitting it's a steaming pile of dog s**t. I understand. whispy_snippet Yep, so as we've agreed, halos sometimes appear in shots with strong light sources pointing at or angled towards the edge of the sensor. But let's just ignore the purple flaring and chromatic aberation in at least four of the images from the LG, right? You're demonstrating selective criticism. Every camera has strengths and weaknesses but on balance, the Pixel offers better images than competing phones more often than not. My position is unchanged. You're both making mountains out of molehills, and in no way does this "scientific" test guarantee that 23% of photos taken with a Pixel will exhibit a halo. It simply shows 23% of photos taken in this example demonstrated halos. You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. No one ever said the Pixel is perfect. But only you two are using ridiculous, extreme labels like "steaming pile of dog shit" and "HARDWARE DEFICIENCY" as though using capital letters makes your odd ball assertions more valid. Most reputable tech reviewers agree the Pixel has the best overall smartphone camera. You're entitled to disagree. P. Sherman 4/22. 4/22 photos from the Pixel have a halo effect. That's from Phandroid. That's 18% of photos the Pixel. That alone is damning. Google themselves have acknowledged that it is a HARDWARE DEFICIENCY and software fixes have done little to address this. They admitted it was there, that's all we need. If you knew that 4/22 Burritos Chipotle made would give you the Runs, but ZERO/22 Burritos Taco Bell made would, would YOU still choose to eat at Chipotle? whispy_snippet Show me the test! I've asked twice now. P. Sherman Lena Flare was removed from the photos, but not the video. http://highonandroid.com/android-smartphone-news/the-truth-about-google-pixel-camera-halolens-flare-effect/ Also, someone in the official Google forums shot with their Pixel and Nexus 6P in the same Time, conditions, everything. Guess what? https://support.google.com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsrROqMaXHqHg/?hl=by Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ 3 halos are obvious, 1 is subtle. The subtle one is where the picture is looking up at a building's windows. Now that I've viewed them again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. tigerstown I paid $380 for my new pixel XL so it's not a lot and I have no Halo in my pics I have proven this on Twitter already. abc More fanboy logic. I took pictures so everything is fine. Anyone who says its not fine is crazy. whispy_snippet How ridiculous. So a blogger takes 22 photos in various conditions and his experience is valid, but my experience of owning the phone and taking hundreds of photos in various conditions is not valid. You guys are weirdos. Andy But do you see problems with low light pics. I do on my wife's pixel. IPhone Looks so much better. I'm so disappointed abc I saw a rainbow once. Oh, are we not just conveying pointless ancedotes? mr.fozzo On my Nex6P, I have noticed that the Fingerprint reader has been less reliable lately. It requires more presses than the usual 1 press. Besnik Rrustemi My Nexus 6P working excellent so far, no battery problems, no fingerprint problems (better standby times on 7.1.2 to be honest). But yes,i can agree that fingerprint was much faster when i first got the device on 6.0 Marshmallow (for unlocking the device with the fingerprint) now it takes like 2 full seconds for that :( jimv1983 No issues on my Nexus 5X and the swipe on the sensor to bring down the notification panel is great. Alex Harrison Flashed the OTA myself on my 5X. No issues with it. Jeff Neston At least it is just the sensor. My nexus 5 was bricked by a Google update.. it got the boot loop. Google support lied to me claiming I broke the power button. False it was not broken. I ended up going small claims case against Google. They settled, but wanted me to sign gag order. Sorry, no way. I sent it back and got complete refund. Sneaky company. What probably causes boot loop update to occur is phone on long time. Some apps get memory leak over time. System then unpredictably unstable. Then the system does auto uplate from Google without asking user NOR even rebooting or turning off prior to the update. Then during update, Os gets corrupted. Then after failed update phone reboots thinking the. Update completed. Now phones dead. And Google not bother to address the issue. Pdiddy187 My 5x fingerprint sensor was great until it bootlooped yesterday morning. LG is going to repair it under warranty even though it's well out of warranty. La Kiesha Rodriguez Barrientes I have the ZTE axon 7 and over a month now google hasn't addressed a fix for the play store not loading apps over data or Wi-Fi.. Without uninstalling updates to play store and then maybe will not say "waiting for network" so frustrating and then maybe download once and have to do that everytime.. Dumb.. P. Sherman That's been like that since KitKat. F------ KITKAT. ahnafm Is google reacommodating their customers now? Brett Delia I thought some positive feedback was worth being added. My Nexus 6P is working perfectly after the update. I've had generally a great experience with all my Android phones. I've had an iPhone as well as a Windows mobile phone as well in my past. None have been as feature packed as my Android devices. New_Guy This and all the other ridiculous issues with the Pixel is a big reason I stick with Samsung... flyonthewall Lol Fernando S Mine is working ok in my Nexus 5x running 7.1.2. It just failed once while I was on 7.1.1 and with a soft reset it came back to life Hank Is that a real screenshot in the story? Enrollment spelled wrong twice. SMH. ThisGuyFUX This is now icing on top of the cake, for anyone whom has enjoyed watching this crash and burn. If I paid $850+ for a Pixel, I'd be pursuing class action litigation by now. Slow clap. Sean Except its only affecting about 1% of the Pixels sold.........so......slow clap for you....... 2kool4skool It's gonna be sucks when you're in the 1%. And I doubt it's 1% anyway, this is probably the 20th article I've read about pixel's problems. That's alot. Probably more like 5%. abc Fortunately, not many Pixels have been sold so not many people are affected. Brian White Nexus 5x, running fine here ddevito If it wasn't for my OnePlus 3 I'd be on an iPhone. thereasoner One plus has their own issues/lousy support and the iPhone? They're the worst of them all when it comes to buggy software and hardware issues bricking devices ! ddevito Not sure I'd agree with you. My iPhone 6s hums along swimmingly without any issues. The more I use it the more I am leaning towards going back to an iPhone full-time. Apple, love them or hate them, knows how to deliver products, and support them. Period. thereasoner I'm glad that your iPhone 6s isn't affected by the many flawed updates and hardware issues​ that have plagued various iPhones over the years but the fact remains that Apple has faced class action lawsuits filed by their own customers for serious issues like Touch Disease and error 53 and for good reason. They have the worst track record of them all and to make things worse they're known for both ignoring iPhone issues until said class action lawsuits are launched and/or blaming their customers for the iPhone hardware/software problems. BTW, my Pixel "hums along swimmingly" as well, that doesn't mean issues with the Pixel don't exist much less those far more serious issues found on iPhones ! MisterKraky I'm not having the fingerprint sensor issue myself, but after updating to 7.1.2, I can no longer install or update any apps! On a Verizon-issued Pixel here. Đức Thành What happened to all the testing, Google? It seems they have become too reliant on using Nexus users for beta-testing and now can't seem to do a proper job on their own. Get your grips together, Android team. Rob H. Nougat is such a half baked disaster of an OS. It's ruined my N6. Marshmallow was soon much more stable.

What happens when you have more than one Google Home? Chaos. Paul Quinn Follow View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:22am PDTApr 14, 2017 28 Plus 1 on G+ 95 Share on Facebook 62 Share on Twitter Total Shares185 Editorials Google Home The Amazon Echo was my pacifier as I waited for Google’s entry into the home assistant space. Setting my Google Play Music library aside, I suffered through using Amazon’s attempt at a music service devoid of most of my own library. I connected my Google Calendar to Alexa and it offered a glimpse into my future relationship with Google’s assistant. Finally, in early November, I could get my hands on a new Google Home. I had pre-ordered from Google and then discovered I could pick one up at my local Best Buy. The very morning it hit the shelves, I immediately bought one. I brought it home, set it up in the family room and eagerly asked – “OK Google, play my morning hits playlist.” Without skipping a beat, she announced the list and the room filled with my music. The key point here – it was music from MY library. I didn’t cancel that Google pre-order. It was on its way. I figured I could listen to music in my bedroom as well. But – what about the other rooms in my house? What about the smart lights, smart switches, clever irrigation controller, and intelligent thermostat scattered throughout? I need a Google Home in every room to live the dream of a voice controlled home! I bought four more. My home is outfitted with six Google Home devices. There’s one in every room. I can control my smart home with my voice from anywhere I stand. I can spread music into any room. I can turn on, dim, and turn off lights in various rooms with just my voice. It’s as close as I can get to living on the Enterprise. Google's vision of the future with Google Home. Well, one Home. That’s the dream. Unfortunately, it isn’t a reality (yet). Google has failed at a key feature that it so proudly spoke of that morning in May. The nice lady living inside each Home is often unable to tell if you are talking to her or her sister in the neighboring room. It can result in some frustrating, sometimes comical, exchanges. It is amazing how well the little air freshener shaped unit can hear you from several rooms away. With multiple Homes, you’ll find yourself making requests and getting responses from two of them. It usually involves one of them, not necessarily the one closest to you, executing the request and the other apologizing to you that it can’t. From my bedroom in the morning, I might ask how long it will take to get to work and hear the detailed response in the distance from the kitchen. There will be times when the Home in front of me fulfills my request and another will rattle off from down the hall. You also have the ghosts. I never thought my home might be haunted - until now. There will be times when I turn off the TV, hang up on a call, or just walk out of the bathroom and hear something in another room. I’ll find a Google Home playing music or a podcast that I don’t listen to in a randomly selected room. Who asked to listen to opera at low volume in the guest room? Ghosts. There isn’t a constant circus of home assistants chiming in from all over the house. The closest Home does respond properly more than half of the time. However, I have found myself at times leaning over and almost whispering to a Google Home when I want to be sure the others don’t hear. There is talk of multiuser support coming soon, but it remains to be seen if this will improve its ability to identify which Home I am talking to. For now, I must look like a fool. I am whispering to an air freshener because I don’t want the others to hear. Creepy? Maybe. Tags editorial google home google home app google home fail video subscribe ...

Carson Saldanha Hi David Sean Thomas Hey Paul next time you're buying expensive accessories for every room in your house can you just throw me a hundo instead? Thanks! Sean Thomas Seems like something I would say. Paul Quinn I asked my office Home to get on that. The one in the kitchen responded. She can't do it but she's learning. Christopher Young I can completely sympathize with you. I have two Google Homes in my small apartment (living room/bedroom), and they frequently get confused where I'm at. I want to play music in the bedroom? Nope, the cozy jazz station starts blaring in the living room. There is one awesome benefit of having two Google Homes: I can fill my entire apartment with music with only a few words. dcdttu I hope Google Home gets a lot of support from Google itself and doesn't turn out to be a Hangouts. Or a Wave. Or a Nexus Player. Or a Nexus Q. Or a Google Reader. Or a tablet of any kind. Oh and hi Paul! Paul Quinn HI! Yeah, I'm worried that they will jump ship because they can't figure out a way to monetize it. No ads. If it starts playing ads, Home is moving out. The Echo doesn't really have a monetization angle except that you can shop on Amazon. Google added Google Express to the Home. But really? I'm not shopping on one of these things (yet). Lateef Alabi-Oki I thought the monetization was making money off selling the hardware. Paul Quinn They also need to keep expanding the ecosystem and product functionality which takes work that costs money. I don't know if that one time purchase price covers all that in the long run. Lord Argyris I think what Google is banking on is that if a user has one or more Homes, it makes them that much more likely to stick with the Android ecosystem in general, which means all Google's already existing means of getting money are a bit more secure from such a user switching over to the big "A". Of course it remains to be seen whether or not this is effective. Dk Schlösser The monetization is in the services offered by Google Paul Quinn I don't know what service I access through the Home makes Google any money, short of using it to buy things on Google Express. It does produce a little more profiling information but I doubt that it's enough to pay for the ongoing development. Ryan I think its all about search and locking you into their services, just like the chromecast. Because of chromecast (and now google home) I am more locked into Google Music. I am more locked into Youtube, Play Movies, searching on Google, etc. Just like Android. The specific device/service doesnt have to make money, its a "loss leader" to drive you to their other, profitable services. A very common thing in almost any consumer industry. Lars Jeppesen Precisely. I'm ditching Sonos in favor of Chromecast Audio, only because of my GH fluffthebunny The monetization is off selling all the data gleaned by your six devices listening to your every word. You have become one with the Home. You have been assimilated. Joshed The horror of ordering an item in the kitchen only to find the bedroom and office made duplicate orders. skitchbeatz I've got an open concept, one in the kitchen and one in the living room. They fight over responding and sometimes both respond. It's frustrating. I've thought about moving one of them up or down a floor. It's half implemented. It doesn't make sense because the assistant on the phone will sometimes read "answering on another device. Artem Russakovskii I have 4 Google Homes (2 in nearby areas where they can both hear me at the same time - kitchen and living room), 2 Alexas (though both Alexas can't hear me at the same time), and I can confirm - combined with multiple phones on family members, it's a mess. Let alone Home kicks in and starts talking once a day or so when not asked (doesn't happen nearly as often with Alexa). LithiumFox Never had that happen with ours... givitumibeybi 4 google homes and 2 alexas?? Artem, I think you might have some issues. Artem Russakovskii No, I just have more than one room. Dk Schlösser Change the trigger word for your Alexas Nick After my experiences with Amazon Echo, I have felt that these type of products are not ready for prime time. It's a cool concept, but these little, quirky issues that pop up with these "Home Assistants" suggest otherwise. Perhaps I'm more security minded than other people, but these sort of IoT products are ripe for security issues as well and the combination of these things has me totally turned off to the current market. Tony T. If you have multiple Homes, can you ask Google to play music and have all of them play the same music in sync? Defenestratus yes. Ed G You can have all of them play music like a Sonos. Also will link with Chromecast Audio. trickytree1984 Will it link to chrome cast proper? Joshua Pritt no, you can't group Chromecast video devices, only audio. Joshed This sucks. I don't see why they cant give older chromecast devices this feature. Paul Quinn Yes, you can create groups. For example, I have a group named "Front of the house" that connects three of them. You're best bet is to name them things that roll of the tongue like, "Hey Google, play my 90's hits playlist on the front of the house." Defenestratus I've got three homes, and I don't have this issue at all. Of course they're all on different floors and I live in a rather open-floor plan home so there's that. I've never had it come on as a ghost... ever. Chris You spent over 800 on google homes?!?! Omg man what kinda bank you making. That is insanity. Or no savings? I mean a financially responsible person cannot spend that much unless their income is huge haha. Defenestratus Yesterday I spent $1000 on a shower fixture (Moen U) David Ruddock OMG YOU ACTUALLY BOUGHT ONE OF THOSE? Defenestratus My wife saw it on "I want that" on DIY network and, well, yeah. We're about to start a master suite renovation so it was the perfect opportunity. For her, the hardest part of the day is getting up out of bed and waiting for the shower to heat up, getting cold in the process (she could get cold in the middle of equatorial guinea and we live in the North East US) so when she saw that she could turn the shower on from bed and it would alert her when it was ready for her, it was a done deal. I'm actually thinking of making a google assistant handler for it when it shows up. Chris Damn dude! How much do you make?? I see all these cool things and want them but I decide my money is better sitting in my savings account or the stock market. Defenestratus I specialize in software that is used for pharmaceutical research and clinical trials. I make a good living. Oh and my wife's a doctor. Chris Ah definitely. That's awesome dude. I work at a vaccine start up so hopefully we'll get a product past the FDA then I can buy 1k showers ;) Defenestratus Very cool. My company does a lot of work on vaccine studies. Best of luck. You have a long 12-14 years of approval process ahead of you! goodnightmare "Ok Moen...." Doesn't have quite the same ring to it. Paul Quinn The timing was right. I got three of them for $100 apiece using Visa Checkout and some helpful friends. Chris That's good dude. I haven't been able to convince myself to get one yet. I don't listen to music at home and not really sure what else I'd use it for. I did get a nest recently but still I don't mind pulling out my phone to change the temp. Paul Quinn I have an Ecobee now. My Nest kept thinking I was away because I didn't walk down that hallway enough. The Ecobee has remote sensors. Unfortunately, the Home currently does not have a direct integration with Home. I'm using IFTTT. Lawstorant Is it that hard to check which Home is the closest, based on the loudness of one's speech? Paul Quinn It might be that Google focused on their ability to hear your voice based on having one Home. If you have one, you want it to be able to hear you from a distance. That will backfire when you introduce more of them. They are all listening too well. Mace Moneta It could probably be resolved easily, by having the Google Homes reduce sensitivity of the mic, based upon the number of Google Home's on the network. Paul Quinn I had two Echos when they announced improved far-field functionality. I tested it at the time and it was working better. I didn't do any long term testing because I switched to the Home. With that in mind, Amazon was able to improve the situation with a software update so I agree that Google should have fixed this by now. Lawstorant Well, it's still Google. They have the money and the manpower to overcome such "hurdles". Why is it that more often than not, they seem like a small start-up composed of fresh out-of -college programmers. Nigel Antonio lol I thought I was the only one with that problem... Jesse Corbett So I have 2, one that covers the bedroom/bathroom half of my apartment and on that covers the kitchen/dining/living room section. I have never had an issue with both responding, if I may share my anecdote. However, I frequently am sitting 10 feet from the living room Home and hear my bedroom Home respond, despite being further away, in another room, down a hallway, with the first between me and it. I don't understand. Michael Stiffler Haha, I've had to whisper to my phone if I don't want her (Home) to hear! Aleem Kanji I think it's time to admit that Google is really screwing the pooch here. Nexus hardware failures, Pixel issues, Google Homes not living up to the hype, constant beta-feel to their products... I have a Nexus 6P, two Google Homes, and I'm all-in on Google services, but... for fuck's sake, I'm thinking of jumping ship entirely. Even Android news sites are seeming to be whole-heartedly disappointed with Google and the growing lack of positivity is disheartening. Google either needs to put up and get their shit together with product polish and following through on promises (or not promising the moon to begin with) or they shut the hell up and we all buy iPhones and call it a day. Paul Quinn My thoughts are not really heading down that road. The Home does a lot of things right. It's core features, music and access to Google's massive database of information, are working. Light control works well. There are some very useful IFTTT integrations. The Echo had its issues when it came out and it has grown up. I'm not ready to give up on the Home. I see it slowly improving. I don't miss any Echo features. My 6P was a good experience overall but ultimately, yeah, it failed me in terms of the camera. My new Mate 9 has an absolutely amazing camera. I have no experience with the Pixel though. The general consensus is that the Pixel is amazing. I'm looking forward to the next one. Leoniv Same here. I'm all in with Google tech and have been with them since 2.3, but lately they've been a hot mess. They broke the dialer on multiple phones, hosed bluetooth so it disconnected randomly, and that doesn't even include the issues with the nexus and pixel phones. I hate to admit it, but the iPhones are looking more attractive. Jack Smith Really? Google home is not even 6 months old. GH is easily the most humanist technology that you can buy It is incredible what can do but not perfect and yet it is over? Little dramatic? Where are you going to get anything close? I have had the Echo since the very first day. It is NOT like the GH. Comparisons are ridiculous. Echo has commands and the GH you talk We are so.early with this and obviously the relatively minor issues in the scheme of things will get resolved. I have one echo and counting GHs that I gave away I have purchased 7. Not to say I dislike my Echo but it is not the future, IMO, like the GH. Aleem Kanji I'm TOTALLY being dramatic, actually. I love my Google Home. I love my Nexus. I also tried an iPhone for the first time late last year (iOS 10 got my attention) and I love it too. My tenure with my iPhone was about 4 months, and, like clockwork, I'd always put my SIM back in my N6P every Wednesday night until Saturday, then switch back to my iPhone (which is a bitch with iMessage, BTDub). The iPhone IS more polished, has better power and battery management, but isn't exciting to me the way Android is. I could never give it up. It's like a drug. But, like a drug, I'm hopelessly addicted to something that promises the highest of highs, then always leaves me chasing the dragon. Google promises the world, then has a tendency to either fall short or simple pulls the rug out. In a world where the Pixel exists and it commands iPhone and Galaxy level money, in a world where Google is trying it's hand at a software AND hardware ecosystem, I expect more. I expect polish, I expect promises to be kept - or at least reasonable expectations to be given. Now, people can come back and say that Google is new at hardware and I understand and forgive that. But they aren't a hardware company in the way that they take responsibility for their products 100%, in that they quality test, in that they have any sort of retail presence that goes beyond simply "trying" something out. They have time to build that, so I'll admit that I need to give them time to sort it out. I'm just worried that they'll get complacent or lose interest and one morning wake up and say "Oh yeah, that Android thing and all that hardware and stuff - I'm over it." If Google is going to change direction and add hardware to their list of products, I expect that they keep in mind that it also means that we - not our data - become customers too. Jack Smith So much silliness in this post. First, what right now angers me the most is Apple completely abandoning the entire AirPort line without any warning. Last November just reassigning all the employes. So I replaced our two AirPort Extremes with Google Wifi. That is REAL life not some weird perception things. "Apple reportedly stops developing AirPort WiFi router products, moving employees to other projects" Who does that? Not Google. Instead with Google we have yesterday. "New Google ‘Dual Band WiFi Router’ Shows Up At The FCC" https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/04/new-google-dual-band-wifi-router-shows-up-at-the-fcc.html This entire narrative Google is horrible at hardware or abandons hardware products is rather ridiculous. Heck it would have been so easy for Google to not support the NON Google WiFI hardware but instead Google decided to spend the money and bring all their new WiFi software to the ONHUB. This is REAL life not fantasy. We have been an Apple house for over a decade. We still have tons of Apple products. But been more and more replacing with Google. With Google we have 4K, HDR, VR, Smart speaker, Mesh and the list keeps growing. I can NOT get any of this from Apple! That is simply the facts. Aleem Kanji Right. 2×4 alexa does this same thing compuguy1088 That's not true. A software update allows for multiple amazon echo devices with the same hotword to work. They've had this since around the end of last year. 2×4 that's my point - it doesnt work well Midnitte "You also have the ghosts. I never thought my home might be haunted - until now. There will be times when I turn off the TV, hang up on a call, or just walk out of the bathroom and hear something in another room. I’ll find a Google Home playing music or a podcast that I don’t listen to in a randomly selected room. Who asked to listen to opera at low volume in the guest room? Ghosts." I have two and I've grouped them in a "home unit" and I've never experienced this. Typically I'll play music on one but sometimes I'll tell it to play music on both and I've never experienced it playing music on a rogue Home goodnightmare Nor have I. Igen Then I am pretty sure that Paul's home is haunted and he should call an Sam & Dean asap. kalehv This is a constant struggle. I have two Google Homes and a bunch of phones / tablets that also respond to "Ok Google" I usually use "Hey Google" to avoid waking up phones and tablets but there is no other way round like when I want to be reminded of something, there is no command that only capable devices (phones and tablets) would listen and not the Home. Home wins over taking control and apologizes for not being able to set reminders and actual capable devices say "Answering on other device" :( thacounty I have mine in opposite corners of the house to prevent this. The real issue is that I'll talk quietly to my phone and it will still hear me. Then my Pixel says answering on another device, which is Home telling me she can't do that yet, while my Pixel could have handled it just fine. Gets frustrating, but my 2 year old son yelling at it to play Batman Play-Doh Eggs makes it worth double what I paid. JG Glad I'm not the only one with this problem. Right now I only have two Google Homes set up, one in my bedroom and the other in the living room. If I'm in the living room, even my normal speaking voice will almost certainly trigger both Home units to talk to me. Like Paul, I have to turn to the one in the living room and whisper in order to get only one. And that can be hard if the TV is blasting away to. Though for some reason when I'm in my bedroom, I usually only trigger the bedroom unit. It gets very annoying when the one I want to talk to tells me she can't help while the other rattles off some long winded multi-paragraph answer (especially when I just asked "what time is it"). Being in another room (and sharing the same voice as the one talking next to you) its often hard to understand what she's saying - and of course there's no "Hey Google, what did you just say?" command... I wanted to set up a third in the other bedroom. But until I'm sure I won't be getting three different responses to each query.... Amazon claims to have an algorithm to determine which of multiple Echo units should respond. I don't have multiple Echo units so I can't test the validity myself, but if they can figure it out... I'm sure Google, with their expertise in machine learning shouldn't have too much bother with it. goodnightmare Acoustics. :) illregal I've got 3 in pretty close proximity, and a 4th whenever lg decides to send those out. Only about 1 out of 10 requests gets answered by the one i wasn't intentionally talking to. 4Ui812 Hi Paul ? Paul Quinn Hi! Rasovan Mircea Google have to upgrade the sound waves and not allow them to travel more than one room.... Tired_Guy I have a Home, a Nexus 9, a Nexus 7 and a Pixel XL, so assistant works on all of them. If all are in my den charging, saying OK Google is like he described only a bit weirder, as I can say it specifically to my Pixel XL in my hand and the Nexus 9 answers, through it's cover. Multiple device synchronization is vital Packer Backer Another reason to allow users to set the hot word. "Hey Bub! Hey Betty! Hey Fumbduck!" would would activate three different devices. Dk Schlösser The solution is to be able to change the trigger word for each device. You can do this on Alexa. Paul Quinn Currently, only my Home responds to "Hey Google" so I use that to talk to the Home. my phones and tablets don't respond. That cuts down on the problem a bit as long as I don't want to use voice with my phone. If I say "OK Google" to my phone, the Home may also respond. A quick fix for now would be to have the option to set the Home NOT to respond to "OK Google" and only "Hey Google." Bill Riess Yeah I just recently discovered this issue when I moved from an echo and echo dot to 4 Google homes. For the most part they work pretty good but it's annoying when they pick up in the wrong room. Multiuser and Sonos integration would be great additions as well. goodnightmare I've had four of these in my home since day one. Yes, occasionally we'll get some random response from a distant device, but it doesn't affect performance. The requested task is completed properly 95% of the time and any hiccups have never been due to multiple devices trying to provide feedback. Our Google Home experience has been quite pleasant and loads of fun. DomBrady Same. I've got three. I have had one interference related issue. Charles222 Same with four here as well. I've had an interference problem with my kitchen & living room ones, but taking a few steps towards one or the other solves it. nerdshowandtell.com I also have 6 Google Homes and the issues described here I only had a month or so ago and they went away. Id also make sure you have solid wifi with no interference to eliminate any delay in the homes seeing each other. As for the random asking/talking, maybe have seen that 3 times since it came out. Definitely not in awhile. Brett Koger I also have several Google Home devices, I am not experiencing the issues you state. I even have two of them with in 20 feet (they are in different rooms) I will see both activate but only one will respond. I have only experienced what you are see a few times. It is not the norm. Paul Quinn I have noticed that situation where more than one activate but only two of them can actually be visualized at one time. To me, that's a good sign. It means they are hearing you but identifying which one should respond. Maxr1998 Hi Paul! Very entertaining and interesting article. I don't have a Google Home myself yet (not available in Germany, functionality in German is likely pretty limited (as seen in Assistant on phones), my Home Assistant setup isn't supported by Google Home/Google Assistant, and IFTTT is too slow (10 seconds+) atm), but the idea of having one is very intriguing for me :) Paul Quinn Hi Max! I guess one plus side of living in another country is that Google works out bugs in the United States before it expands across the globe. Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get it functional:P But it's still sometimes a little annoying for power users wanting the latest and the greatest regardless of bugs ;) Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get it functional. 😜 But it's still sometimes a little annoying to not get the latest and greatest stuff being a poweruser ;) Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get them functional. 😜 But it's still sometimes a little annoying to not get the latest and greatest stuff being a poweruser ;) JD So it's not just me. Alexa is just that much better with its spatial recognition. It has a 100% hit rate on responding on the right unit. Sandeep Raghuraman One solution to your problem - setup mic + speakers in each room, and use one Google Home. That way, only one Google Home device will respond. Although, the next problem would be, how does Google Home decide which mic to listen through? Maybe a device that mixes all of those input streams from the different mics? Nick Riviera Try power cycling your units to keep them from talking over one another. sucatrops If you bought 6 Google Homes and didn't expect more than one to respond to you, you should shoot yourself. Hector Diaz Amazon echo has far field recognition between Echos so Google can include that with a software update. Ryan I dont see the need to have one in all 6 rooms of my home. Having one in the open air living/dining room and kitchen is plenty, it hears me from 40 feet no matter what. Then another in my bedroom. I dont think I need them in the guest rooms. Maybe one in the office, but that is all the way on the other side of the house from the bedroom. Maybe 6 is the overkill. Paul Quinn I have smart lighting in all the main rooms of the house. I wouldn't want any of us to be yelling from room to adjust lighting in another. I did put in remotes in the rooms as well because you should have another option besides voice. I think for most people, one or two is plenty. I'm really into smart home technology despite its incredibly fragmented implementation right now. I know my house is going beyond the norm. The fact that yours hear you from 40 feet away is what is causing the downfall in my house. Đức Thành 6 Google Homes? You're a crazy man. I like you. 6 is still nowhere near enough, though. Hector Diaz I have 2 echo Dot and 1 Echo. Missing still 2 echo Dot. So he is not crazy just want to have a real smart home doesn't matter where he stands like me. Andrew Hartley It was clear Paul was a bit 'unusual' from the moment he mentioned the Enterprise. I've been teaching science using the latest technology for 30+ and my dream has always been to walk into my classroom in the morning and for a cute sounding female voice to welcome me from my computer with a good morning asking me what I would like to do today. Google home I found you at last 😉 That doesn't sound weird does it 😎 Paul Quinn Sounds fantastic! D.Smithee I like when you're home alone in a quiet house and this thing starts spouting gibberish with no warning. Paul Quinn Tonight.... one of the Homes (in the office) decided to "forget" the lights in the room. Just the lights in the room that it's in. It kept saying there were no lights set up for that room. The remote went dead too. It was darkness. But... it let me operate the lights from other Homes. No I'm starting to wonder if Google read this... and is toying with me. I got the remote back online. The Home is still protesting. Bill3 Hi Paul, not sure what's going on there. I have three Google Homes and have only had that happen once or twice. They'll often beep together, but only one will answer. It could be a problem with your WiFi network. Are they connected to different AP points? Paul Quinn Yes. Despite two of them being closer to another access point in my house, I've kept the Homes on the primary router which is able to deliver a strong enough signal throughout the house. I use an access point to guarantee a connection to the irrigation controller outside. abc Oh, god. People are buying not more than one of this beta product. Are they rich or just plain stupid? Kostas 💪🎩 Man I laughed hard. Well written! DragoCubed 🎪 👻 👋 hi paul papastevez Where the ^*#} is the Google play movies integration??? Seriously, Netflix, a third party has been working for months and months. Lars Jeppesen I have 3 GH, and I've never had the problems described in the article. /edit And Hi to Paul, of course :) twighahn I think back to the smart homes of yesteryear. They had an intercom, radio, and auto switches. Now it's all more automatic and more personalised. Michael Paul, did you realize Google Home can only play your music library using a playlist? It cannot pull up a single or album or artist from your library.

Read More . But is it time to scrap it in favor of something else? Long-time Pocket users are familiar with the problem of an abundance of unread bookmarks. You have to rely on tricks to get through your Pocket queue 9 Ways to Get More Out of Pocket 9 Ways to Get More Out of Pocket Pocket is the ultimate digital bookmarking service out there. Let's find out how to boost your Pocket experience with the right web apps and extensions. Read More . And let’s not forget, Pocket started as “Read It Later”, its focus being on reading articles. That’s not what bookmarks on the internet are solely about any more. A few new apps seek to solve other bookmarking needs. Videos, for instance, or the ability to add notes to your bookmarks. Or turning your entire browser into a perennial bookmark engine. 1. Vookmark (Android, iOS, Chrome, Safari, Apple TV): “Watch It Later” for Videos Vookmark is, in essence, Pocket for Videos. When you come across a video on the web and want to save it to watch later, just “vookmark” it. You can then see the videos on Apple TV, Android, or iOS devices. Install the extension in Safari or Chrome (or Chromium-based browsers like Opera How to Install Google Chrome Extensions in Opera Browser How to Install Google Chrome Extensions in Opera Browser Opera is making a case for you to switch to it. There's one small problem: extensions. What if you could install Chrome extensions in Opera? It's easy, so here's a quick guide. Read More ). The Vookmark bookmarklet will be neatly embedded in supported sites like YouTube, Facebook, Vimeo, DailyMotion, and Reddit. Click the bookmarklet and the video is automatically added to your list. The only thing I found weird is that Vookmark doesn’t let you view videos later on desktops. It needs you to fire up your iOS or Android gizmo. Tad annoying, that. Download — Vookmark for Android, ffor iOS, for Chrome, for Safari, and for Apple TV (Free) 2. EmailThis.me (Web): Send Articles to Your Inbox, Cleaned Up for Reading One of the features people love about Pocket is how it cleans up web pages for an optimum reading experience. EmailThis.Me brings that to your inbox, no apps required. Sign up for the service, then use it to share any article to your inbox. EmailThis will strip unnecessary elements like ads, comments, and social sharing buttons, and send the article to your inbox using the lightweight bookmarklet Extensions vs Bookmarklets: The Shocking Truth About the State of Your Browser Extensions vs Bookmarklets: The Shocking Truth About the State of Your Browser One of the little known factors affecting browser speed is those third-party extensions you install. But uninstalling them doesn't mean getting rid of your favorite app. All you need are bookmarklets. Read More . And soon, your inbox becomes your read-it-later service. The big advantage of this is that the article is saved in your inbox now, so even if the site deletes the original, you still have it with you. It avoids the pain you feel when you add links to Pocket only to find them dead later. 3. Booky.io (Web, Chrome): A Dashboard of Bookmarks There are some bookmarks you visit more often than others. While I’m personally partial to using the bookmarks bar on my browser, others prefer their bookmarks in the Speed Dials on a new tab The Idiot's Guide To Adding Website Bookmarks On Your Google Chrome New Tab Page The Idiot's Guide To Adding Website Bookmarks On Your Google Chrome New Tab Page For the past couple of years now, I have more or less been exclusively using Google Chrome as my day-to-day work browser. It is simply one of the best products that Google has ever produced.... Read More . Booky can be your personal new tab page, and you can use it on any browser in the world. It has a unique interface based around dashboards. For example, you can make Dashboard #1 your “Work Dashboard”. Add categories, and links within those categories, related to your work requirements, such as emails, Slack, the company’s internal pages, and so on. And then Dashboard #2 can be your “Social Dashboard”, with links for social networking sites, messaging apps, your personal email, and so on. In short, Booky is a neat bookmark system for those who like to keep links organized. Add color coordination as well as a simple bookmarklet, and you have a winner on your hands. Download — Booky for Chrome (Free) 4. Save To Google (Web, Chrome): Google’s Bookmarking App, With Notes Did you know Google has its own bookmarking service? I used to love the goo.gl bookmark and link shortener for Android URL Shortener Is The Swiss Knife Of Link Sharing And Saving On Android URL Shortener Is The Swiss Knife Of Link Sharing And Saving On Android What sets URL Shortener apart is how easy it makes it for you to save links, copy them to a clipboard, or share them directly from a menu. Read More , but that stopped a while ago. The new version, though, is even better. Adding a link is as simple as clicking the “Save to Google” extension on any web page. But Google goes the extra distance by letting you add notes. Every bookmark automatically grabs the first few lines of the page, but you can edit that to turn it into your own notes. So when you revisit the bookmark days later, you no longer have to remember why you saved that link. Your notes will have it. To view all your bookmarks, go to Google.com/Save from your desktop or mobile browser. That is, if you can trust Google with more of your data. Download — Save to Google for Chrome (Free) 5. WorldBrain (Chrome): When History Becomes Bookmarks You know what I hate about bookmarks? That often, I forget to actually save a link. And yes, my browser history has those links, but finding them is like looking for a needle in a haystack. I’ll only remember some words from the link, but not the site I read it or anything else. How do I find it? Enter WorldBrain. This smart extension is a full-text search for your browser’s history as well as bookmarks. It’s kind of like doing a Google search among the links you have visited, to find exactly the page you are looking for. It’s still in beta, so there are a few bugs, but it works pretty well so far in Chrome. Unlike other extensions though, it didn’t work on Chromium-based browsers like Opera. In a nutshell, WorldBrain wants to end your habit of adding bookmarks by searching your entire history 3 Applications To View Your Entire Internet History In One Place [Windows] 3 Applications To View Your Entire Internet History In One Place [Windows] I've run into a bit of a problem lately. I've started using one browser for basic purposes, then another for everything Flash-based (such as games). Flash just feels faster in one browser, without heavy add-ons... Read More . Everything you visit is a bookmark in itself. Cool, eh? Download — WorldBrain for Chrome (Free) Is Your Pocket Queue Too Big to Handle? Pocket users, doth thy cup runneth over? Is the queue of bookmarks getting too large to handle? Is there value in switching to something else to rid yourself of the overwhelming backlog?

What happens when you have more than one Google Home? Chaos. Paul Quinn Follow View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:22am PDTApr 14, 2017 28 Plus 1 on G+ 95 Share on Facebook 62 Share on Twitter Total Shares185 Editorials Google Home The Amazon Echo was my pacifier as I waited for Google’s entry into the home assistant space. Setting my Google Play Music library aside, I suffered through using Amazon’s attempt at a music service devoid of most of my own library. I connected my Google Calendar to Alexa and it offered a glimpse into my future relationship with Google’s assistant. Finally, in early November, I could get my hands on a new Google Home. I had pre-ordered from Google and then discovered I could pick one up at my local Best Buy. The very morning it hit the shelves, I immediately bought one. I brought it home, set it up in the family room and eagerly asked – “OK Google, play my morning hits playlist.” Without skipping a beat, she announced the list and the room filled with my music. The key point here – it was music from MY library. I didn’t cancel that Google pre-order. It was on its way. I figured I could listen to music in my bedroom as well. But – what about the other rooms in my house? What about the smart lights, smart switches, clever irrigation controller, and intelligent thermostat scattered throughout? I need a Google Home in every room to live the dream of a voice controlled home! I bought four more. My home is outfitted with six Google Home devices. There’s one in every room. I can control my smart home with my voice from anywhere I stand. I can spread music into any room. I can turn on, dim, and turn off lights in various rooms with just my voice. It’s as close as I can get to living on the Enterprise. Google's vision of the future with Google Home. Well, one Home. That’s the dream. Unfortunately, it isn’t a reality (yet). Google has failed at a key feature that it so proudly spoke of that morning in May. The nice lady living inside each Home is often unable to tell if you are talking to her or her sister in the neighboring room. It can result in some frustrating, sometimes comical, exchanges. It is amazing how well the little air freshener shaped unit can hear you from several rooms away. With multiple Homes, you’ll find yourself making requests and getting responses from two of them. It usually involves one of them, not necessarily the one closest to you, executing the request and the other apologizing to you that it can’t. From my bedroom in the morning, I might ask how long it will take to get to work and hear the detailed response in the distance from the kitchen. There will be times when the Home in front of me fulfills my request and another will rattle off from down the hall. You also have the ghosts. I never thought my home might be haunted - until now. There will be times when I turn off the TV, hang up on a call, or just walk out of the bathroom and hear something in another room. I’ll find a Google Home playing music or a podcast that I don’t listen to in a randomly selected room. Who asked to listen to opera at low volume in the guest room? Ghosts. There isn’t a constant circus of home assistants chiming in from all over the house. The closest Home does respond properly more than half of the time. However, I have found myself at times leaning over and almost whispering to a Google Home when I want to be sure the others don’t hear. There is talk of multiuser support coming soon, but it remains to be seen if this will improve its ability to identify which Home I am talking to. For now, I must look like a fool. I am whispering to an air freshener because I don’t want the others to hear. Creepy? Maybe. Tags editorial google home google home app google home fail video subscribe ...

Carson Saldanha Hi David Sean Thomas Hey Paul next time you're buying expensive accessories for every room in your house can you just throw me a hundo instead? Thanks! Sean Thomas Seems like something I would say. Paul Quinn I asked my office Home to get on that. The one in the kitchen responded. She can't do it but she's learning. Christopher Young I can completely sympathize with you. I have two Google Homes in my small apartment (living room/bedroom), and they frequently get confused where I'm at. I want to play music in the bedroom? Nope, the cozy jazz station starts blaring in the living room. There is one awesome benefit of having two Google Homes: I can fill my entire apartment with music with only a few words. dcdttu I hope Google Home gets a lot of support from Google itself and doesn't turn out to be a Hangouts. Or a Wave. Or a Nexus Player. Or a Nexus Q. Or a Google Reader. Or a tablet of any kind. Oh and hi Paul! Paul Quinn HI! Yeah, I'm worried that they will jump ship because they can't figure out a way to monetize it. No ads. If it starts playing ads, Home is moving out. The Echo doesn't really have a monetization angle except that you can shop on Amazon. Google added Google Express to the Home. But really? I'm not shopping on one of these things (yet). Lateef Alabi-Oki I thought the monetization was making money off selling the hardware. Paul Quinn They also need to keep expanding the ecosystem and product functionality which takes work that costs money. I don't know if that one time purchase price covers all that in the long run. Lord Argyris I think what Google is banking on is that if a user has one or more Homes, it makes them that much more likely to stick with the Android ecosystem in general, which means all Google's already existing means of getting money are a bit more secure from such a user switching over to the big "A". Of course it remains to be seen whether or not this is effective. Dk Schlösser The monetization is in the services offered by Google Paul Quinn I don't know what service I access through the Home makes Google any money, short of using it to buy things on Google Express. It does produce a little more profiling information but I doubt that it's enough to pay for the ongoing development. Ryan I think its all about search and locking you into their services, just like the chromecast. Because of chromecast (and now google home) I am more locked into Google Music. I am more locked into Youtube, Play Movies, searching on Google, etc. Just like Android. The specific device/service doesnt have to make money, its a "loss leader" to drive you to their other, profitable services. A very common thing in almost any consumer industry. Lars Jeppesen Precisely. I'm ditching Sonos in favor of Chromecast Audio, only because of my GH fluffthebunny The monetization is off selling all the data gleaned by your six devices listening to your every word. You have become one with the Home. You have been assimilated. Joshed The horror of ordering an item in the kitchen only to find the bedroom and office made duplicate orders. skitchbeatz I've got an open concept, one in the kitchen and one in the living room. They fight over responding and sometimes both respond. It's frustrating. I've thought about moving one of them up or down a floor. It's half implemented. It doesn't make sense because the assistant on the phone will sometimes read "answering on another device. Artem Russakovskii I have 4 Google Homes (2 in nearby areas where they can both hear me at the same time - kitchen and living room), 2 Alexas (though both Alexas can't hear me at the same time), and I can confirm - combined with multiple phones on family members, it's a mess. Let alone Home kicks in and starts talking once a day or so when not asked (doesn't happen nearly as often with Alexa). LithiumFox Never had that happen with ours... givitumibeybi 4 google homes and 2 alexas?? Artem, I think you might have some issues. Artem Russakovskii No, I just have more than one room. Dk Schlösser Change the trigger word for your Alexas Nick After my experiences with Amazon Echo, I have felt that these type of products are not ready for prime time. It's a cool concept, but these little, quirky issues that pop up with these "Home Assistants" suggest otherwise. Perhaps I'm more security minded than other people, but these sort of IoT products are ripe for security issues as well and the combination of these things has me totally turned off to the current market. Tony T. If you have multiple Homes, can you ask Google to play music and have all of them play the same music in sync? Defenestratus yes. Ed G You can have all of them play music like a Sonos. Also will link with Chromecast Audio. trickytree1984 Will it link to chrome cast proper? Joshua Pritt no, you can't group Chromecast video devices, only audio. Joshed This sucks. I don't see why they cant give older chromecast devices this feature. Paul Quinn Yes, you can create groups. For example, I have a group named "Front of the house" that connects three of them. You're best bet is to name them things that roll of the tongue like, "Hey Google, play my 90's hits playlist on the front of the house." Defenestratus I've got three homes, and I don't have this issue at all. Of course they're all on different floors and I live in a rather open-floor plan home so there's that. I've never had it come on as a ghost... ever. Chris You spent over 800 on google homes?!?! Omg man what kinda bank you making. That is insanity. Or no savings? I mean a financially responsible person cannot spend that much unless their income is huge haha. Defenestratus Yesterday I spent $1000 on a shower fixture (Moen U) David Ruddock OMG YOU ACTUALLY BOUGHT ONE OF THOSE? Defenestratus My wife saw it on "I want that" on DIY network and, well, yeah. We're about to start a master suite renovation so it was the perfect opportunity. For her, the hardest part of the day is getting up out of bed and waiting for the shower to heat up, getting cold in the process (she could get cold in the middle of equatorial guinea and we live in the North East US) so when she saw that she could turn the shower on from bed and it would alert her when it was ready for her, it was a done deal. I'm actually thinking of making a google assistant handler for it when it shows up. Chris Damn dude! How much do you make?? I see all these cool things and want them but I decide my money is better sitting in my savings account or the stock market. Defenestratus I specialize in software that is used for pharmaceutical research and clinical trials. I make a good living. Oh and my wife's a doctor. Chris Ah definitely. That's awesome dude. I work at a vaccine start up so hopefully we'll get a product past the FDA then I can buy 1k showers ;) Defenestratus Very cool. My company does a lot of work on vaccine studies. Best of luck. You have a long 12-14 years of approval process ahead of you! goodnightmare "Ok Moen...." Doesn't have quite the same ring to it. Paul Quinn The timing was right. I got three of them for $100 apiece using Visa Checkout and some helpful friends. Chris That's good dude. I haven't been able to convince myself to get one yet. I don't listen to music at home and not really sure what else I'd use it for. I did get a nest recently but still I don't mind pulling out my phone to change the temp. Paul Quinn I have an Ecobee now. My Nest kept thinking I was away because I didn't walk down that hallway enough. The Ecobee has remote sensors. Unfortunately, the Home currently does not have a direct integration with Home. I'm using IFTTT. Lawstorant Is it that hard to check which Home is the closest, based on the loudness of one's speech? Paul Quinn It might be that Google focused on their ability to hear your voice based on having one Home. If you have one, you want it to be able to hear you from a distance. That will backfire when you introduce more of them. They are all listening too well. Mace Moneta It could probably be resolved easily, by having the Google Homes reduce sensitivity of the mic, based upon the number of Google Home's on the network. Paul Quinn I had two Echos when they announced improved far-field functionality. I tested it at the time and it was working better. I didn't do any long term testing because I switched to the Home. With that in mind, Amazon was able to improve the situation with a software update so I agree that Google should have fixed this by now. Lawstorant Well, it's still Google. They have the money and the manpower to overcome such "hurdles". Why is it that more often than not, they seem like a small start-up composed of fresh out-of -college programmers. Nigel Antonio lol I thought I was the only one with that problem... Jesse Corbett So I have 2, one that covers the bedroom/bathroom half of my apartment and on that covers the kitchen/dining/living room section. I have never had an issue with both responding, if I may share my anecdote. However, I frequently am sitting 10 feet from the living room Home and hear my bedroom Home respond, despite being further away, in another room, down a hallway, with the first between me and it. I don't understand. Michael Stiffler Haha, I've had to whisper to my phone if I don't want her (Home) to hear! Aleem Kanji I think it's time to admit that Google is really screwing the pooch here. Nexus hardware failures, Pixel issues, Google Homes not living up to the hype, constant beta-feel to their products... I have a Nexus 6P, two Google Homes, and I'm all-in on Google services, but... for fuck's sake, I'm thinking of jumping ship entirely. Even Android news sites are seeming to be whole-heartedly disappointed with Google and the growing lack of positivity is disheartening. Google either needs to put up and get their shit together with product polish and following through on promises (or not promising the moon to begin with) or they shut the hell up and we all buy iPhones and call it a day. Paul Quinn My thoughts are not really heading down that road. The Home does a lot of things right. It's core features, music and access to Google's massive database of information, are working. Light control works well. There are some very useful IFTTT integrations. The Echo had its issues when it came out and it has grown up. I'm not ready to give up on the Home. I see it slowly improving. I don't miss any Echo features. My 6P was a good experience overall but ultimately, yeah, it failed me in terms of the camera. My new Mate 9 has an absolutely amazing camera. I have no experience with the Pixel though. The general consensus is that the Pixel is amazing. I'm looking forward to the next one. Leoniv Same here. I'm all in with Google tech and have been with them since 2.3, but lately they've been a hot mess. They broke the dialer on multiple phones, hosed bluetooth so it disconnected randomly, and that doesn't even include the issues with the nexus and pixel phones. I hate to admit it, but the iPhones are looking more attractive. Jack Smith Really? Google home is not even 6 months old. GH is easily the most humanist technology that you can buy It is incredible what can do but not perfect and yet it is over? Little dramatic? Where are you going to get anything close? I have had the Echo since the very first day. It is NOT like the GH. Comparisons are ridiculous. Echo has commands and the GH you talk We are so.early with this and obviously the relatively minor issues in the scheme of things will get resolved. I have one echo and counting GHs that I gave away I have purchased 7. Not to say I dislike my Echo but it is not the future, IMO, like the GH. Aleem Kanji I'm TOTALLY being dramatic, actually. I love my Google Home. I love my Nexus. I also tried an iPhone for the first time late last year (iOS 10 got my attention) and I love it too. My tenure with my iPhone was about 4 months, and, like clockwork, I'd always put my SIM back in my N6P every Wednesday night until Saturday, then switch back to my iPhone (which is a bitch with iMessage, BTDub). The iPhone IS more polished, has better power and battery management, but isn't exciting to me the way Android is. I could never give it up. It's like a drug. But, like a drug, I'm hopelessly addicted to something that promises the highest of highs, then always leaves me chasing the dragon. Google promises the world, then has a tendency to either fall short or simple pulls the rug out. In a world where the Pixel exists and it commands iPhone and Galaxy level money, in a world where Google is trying it's hand at a software AND hardware ecosystem, I expect more. I expect polish, I expect promises to be kept - or at least reasonable expectations to be given. Now, people can come back and say that Google is new at hardware and I understand and forgive that. But they aren't a hardware company in the way that they take responsibility for their products 100%, in that they quality test, in that they have any sort of retail presence that goes beyond simply "trying" something out. They have time to build that, so I'll admit that I need to give them time to sort it out. I'm just worried that they'll get complacent or lose interest and one morning wake up and say "Oh yeah, that Android thing and all that hardware and stuff - I'm over it." If Google is going to change direction and add hardware to their list of products, I expect that they keep in mind that it also means that we - not our data - become customers too. Jack Smith So much silliness in this post. First, what right now angers me the most is Apple completely abandoning the entire AirPort line without any warning. Last November just reassigning all the employes. So I replaced our two AirPort Extremes with Google Wifi. That is REAL life not some weird perception things. "Apple reportedly stops developing AirPort WiFi router products, moving employees to other projects" Who does that? Not Google. Instead with Google we have yesterday. "New Google ‘Dual Band WiFi Router’ Shows Up At The FCC" https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/04/new-google-dual-band-wifi-router-shows-up-at-the-fcc.html This entire narrative Google is horrible at hardware or abandons hardware products is rather ridiculous. Heck it would have been so easy for Google to not support the NON Google WiFI hardware but instead Google decided to spend the money and bring all their new WiFi software to the ONHUB. This is REAL life not fantasy. We have been an Apple house for over a decade. We still have tons of Apple products. But been more and more replacing with Google. With Google we have 4K, HDR, VR, Smart speaker, Mesh and the list keeps growing. I can NOT get any of this from Apple! That is simply the facts. Aleem Kanji Right. 2×4 alexa does this same thing compuguy1088 That's not true. A software update allows for multiple amazon echo devices with the same hotword to work. They've had this since around the end of last year. 2×4 that's my point - it doesnt work well Midnitte "You also have the ghosts. I never thought my home might be haunted - until now. There will be times when I turn off the TV, hang up on a call, or just walk out of the bathroom and hear something in another room.

I have two and I've grouped them in a "home unit" and I've never experienced this. Typically I'll play music on one but sometimes I'll tell it to play music on both and I've never experienced it playing music on a rogue Home goodnightmare Nor have I. Igen Then I am pretty sure that Paul's home is haunted and he should call an Sam & Dean asap. kalehv This is a constant struggle. I have two Google Homes and a bunch of phones / tablets that also respond to "Ok Google" I usually use "Hey Google" to avoid waking up phones and tablets but there is no other way round like when I want to be reminded of something, there is no command that only capable devices (phones and tablets) would listen and not the Home. Home wins over taking control and apologizes for not being able to set reminders and actual capable devices say "Answering on other device" :( thacounty I have mine in opposite corners of the house to prevent this. The real issue is that I'll talk quietly to my phone and it will still hear me. Then my Pixel says answering on another device, which is Home telling me she can't do that yet, while my Pixel could have handled it just fine. Gets frustrating, but my 2 year old son yelling at it to play Batman Play-Doh Eggs makes it worth double what I paid. JG Glad I'm not the only one with this problem. Right now I only have two Google Homes set up, one in my bedroom and the other in the living room. If I'm in the living room, even my normal speaking voice will almost certainly trigger both Home units to talk to me. Like Paul, I have to turn to the one in the living room and whisper in order to get only one. And that can be hard if the TV is blasting away to. Though for some reason when I'm in my bedroom, I usually only trigger the bedroom unit. It gets very annoying when the one I want to talk to tells me she can't help while the other rattles off some long winded multi-paragraph answer (especially when I just asked "what time is it"). Being in another room (and sharing the same voice as the one talking next to you) its often hard to understand what she's saying - and of course there's no "Hey Google, what did you just say?" command... I wanted to set up a third in the other bedroom. But until I'm sure I won't be getting three different responses to each query.... Amazon claims to have an algorithm to determine which of multiple Echo units should respond. I don't have multiple Echo units so I can't test the validity myself, but if they can figure it out... I'm sure Google, with their expertise in machine learning shouldn't have too much bother with it. goodnightmare Acoustics. :) illregal I've got 3 in pretty close proximity, and a 4th whenever lg decides to send those out. Only about 1 out of 10 requests gets answered by the one i wasn't intentionally talking to. 4Ui812 Hi Paul ? Paul Quinn Hi! Rasovan Mircea Google have to upgrade the sound waves and not allow them to travel more than one room.... Tired_Guy I have a Home, a Nexus 9, a Nexus 7 and a Pixel XL, so assistant works on all of them. If all are in my den charging, saying OK Google is like he described only a bit weirder, as I can say it specifically to my Pixel XL in my hand and the Nexus 9 answers, through it's cover. Multiple device synchronization is vital Packer Backer Another reason to allow users to set the hot word. "Hey Bub! Hey Betty! Hey Fumbduck!" would would activate three different devices. Dk Schlösser The solution is to be able to change the trigger word for each device. You can do this on Alexa. Paul Quinn Currently, only my Home responds to "Hey Google" so I use that to talk to the Home. my phones and tablets don't respond. That cuts down on the problem a bit as long as I don't want to use voice with my phone. If I say "OK Google" to my phone, the Home may also respond. A quick fix for now would be to have the option to set the Home NOT to respond to "OK Google" and only "Hey Google." Bill Riess Yeah I just recently discovered this issue when I moved from an echo and echo dot to 4 Google homes. For the most part they work pretty good but it's annoying when they pick up in the wrong room. Multiuser and Sonos integration would be great additions as well. goodnightmare I've had four of these in my home since day one. Yes, occasionally we'll get some random response from a distant device, but it doesn't affect performance. The requested task is completed properly 95% of the time and any hiccups have never been due to multiple devices trying to provide feedback. Our Google Home experience has been quite pleasant and loads of fun. DomBrady Same. I've got three. I have had one interference related issue. Charles222 Same with four here as well. I've had an interference problem with my kitchen & living room ones, but taking a few steps towards one or the other solves it. nerdshowandtell.com I also have 6 Google Homes and the issues described here I only had a month or so ago and they went away. Id also make sure you have solid wifi with no interference to eliminate any delay in the homes seeing each other. As for the random asking/talking, maybe have seen that 3 times since it came out. Definitely not in awhile. Brett Koger I also have several Google Home devices, I am not experiencing the issues you state. I even have two of them with in 20 feet (they are in different rooms) I will see both activate but only one will respond. I have only experienced what you are see a few times. It is not the norm. Paul Quinn I have noticed that situation where more than one activate but only two of them can actually be visualized at one time. To me, that's a good sign. It means they are hearing you but identifying which one should respond. Maxr1998 Hi Paul! Very entertaining and interesting article. I don't have a Google Home myself yet (not available in Germany, functionality in German is likely pretty limited (as seen in Assistant on phones), my Home Assistant setup isn't supported by Google Home/Google Assistant, and IFTTT is too slow (10 seconds+) atm), but the idea of having one is very intriguing for me :) Paul Quinn Hi Max! I guess one plus side of living in another country is that Google works out bugs in the United States before it expands across the globe. Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get it functional:P But it's still sometimes a little annoying for power users wanting the latest and the greatest regardless of bugs ;) Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get it functional. 😜 But it's still sometimes a little annoying to not get the latest and greatest stuff being a poweruser ;) Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get them functional. 😜 But it's still sometimes a little annoying to not get the latest and greatest stuff being a poweruser ;) JD So it's not just me. Alexa is just that much better with its spatial recognition. It has a 100% hit rate on responding on the right unit. Sandeep Raghuraman One solution to your problem - setup mic + speakers in each room, and use one Google Home. That way, only one Google Home device will respond. Although, the next problem would be, how does Google Home decide which mic to listen through? Maybe a device that mixes all of those input streams from the different mics? Nick Riviera Try power cycling your units to keep them from talking over one another. sucatrops If you bought 6 Google Homes and didn't expect more than one to respond to you, you should shoot yourself. Hector Diaz Amazon echo has far field recognition between Echos so Google can include that with a software update. Ryan I dont see the need to have one in all 6 rooms of my home. Having one in the open air living/dining room and kitchen is plenty, it hears me from 40 feet no matter what. Then another in my bedroom. I dont think I need them in the guest rooms. Maybe one in the office, but that is all the way on the other side of the house from the bedroom. Maybe 6 is the overkill. Paul Quinn I have smart lighting in all the main rooms of the house. I wouldn't want any of us to be yelling from room to adjust lighting in another. I did put in remotes in the rooms as well because you should have another option besides voice. I think for most people, one or two is plenty. I'm really into smart home technology despite its incredibly fragmented implementation right now. I know my house is going beyond the norm. The fact that yours hear you from 40 feet away is what is causing the downfall in my house. Đức Thành 6 Google Homes? You're a crazy man. I like you. 6 is still nowhere near enough, though. Hector Diaz I have 2 echo Dot and 1 Echo. Missing still 2 echo Dot. So he is not crazy just want to have a real smart home doesn't matter where he stands like me. Andrew Hartley It was clear Paul was a bit 'unusual' from the moment he mentioned the Enterprise. I've been teaching science using the latest technology for 30+ and my dream has always been to walk into my classroom in the morning and for a cute sounding female voice to welcome me from my computer with a good morning asking me what I would like to do today. Google home I found you at last 😉 That doesn't sound weird does it 😎 Paul Quinn Sounds fantastic! D.Smithee I like when you're home alone in a quiet house and this thing starts spouting gibberish with no warning. Paul Quinn Tonight.... one of the Homes (in the office) decided to "forget" the lights in the room. Just the lights in the room that it's in. It kept saying there were no lights set up for that room. The remote went dead too. It was darkness. But... it let me operate the lights from other Homes. No I'm starting to wonder if Google read this... and is toying with me. I got the remote back online. The Home is still protesting. Bill3 Hi Paul, not sure what's going on there. I have three Google Homes and have only had that happen once or twice. They'll often beep together, but only one will answer. It could be a problem with your WiFi network. Are they connected to different AP points? Paul Quinn Yes. Despite two of them being closer to another access point in my house, I've kept the Homes on the primary router which is able to deliver a strong enough signal throughout the house. I use an access point to guarantee a connection to the irrigation controller outside. abc Oh, god. People are buying not more than one of this beta product. Are they rich or just plain stupid? Kostas 💪🎩 Man I laughed hard. Well written! DragoCubed 🎪 👻 👋 hi paul papastevez Where the ^*#} is the Google play movies integration??? Seriously, Netflix, a third party has been working for months and months. Lars Jeppesen I have 3 GH, and I've never had the problems described in the article. /edit And Hi to Paul, of course :) twighahn I think back to the smart homes of yesteryear. They had an intercom, radio, and auto switches. Now it's all more automatic and more personalised. Michael Paul, did you realize Google Home can only play your music library using a playlist? It cannot pull up a single or album or artist from your library.

Google Assistant's screen search has been moved to a button Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/14 9:02am PDTApr 14, 2017 61 Plus 1 on G+ 16 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares119 Applications Google News Google Now on Tap was introduced alongside Android 6.0 Marshmallow, which used context on your screen to help you find information. Google Assistant replaced Now on Tap (for compatible devices), and carried over most of its functionality. Now Assistant is making it slightly more obvious that it can search your screen and take screenshots.    Left: Old design; Center, Right: New design Before, screen search results would appear below the main Assistant prompt after a few seconds, and the screenshot button was found below the screen search results. Buttons for screen search and taking a screenshot are now immediately visible when Assistant is opened. This is a minor improvement, but definitely a welcome one. The change appears to be part of a server-side update, so if you don't have it, you will soon.

The old swipe up barely even worked most of the time. I've been waiting for them to do something like this. Paul Smith Don't even have assistant yet... Nexus 5x 7.12 samiazza Same here, is there any way to get it without root? Suresh Aryal Change the phone language to US English, delete Google app data and you should be running Assistant after few setup screens or just wait for few hours. samiazza Thank you, it worked:-) belac77 that's so weird. I've had Assistant on my Moto G Play running Marshmallow from the second or third day the rollout began! Zahir_SMASH be glad you don't. bekifft Seriously, enjoy it while it lasts. Assistant is a downgrade in every way. Alex Dueppen Is it just me or did Assistant get rid of the OCR thing where you could select text on your screen? Bombaglad this was never a part of assistant, only now on tap Nicholas Matranga Nope, they removed it for some reason. That was one of the main things I used now on tap for. Roh_Mish Used it all the time to select and copy text it to search for something Corbin Davenport That feature was never ported to Assistant. Mohammad Fazal Love this Now on tap feature. And now its gone :/ Evgany Used it all the time. Bring it back. Ruel Johnson It's still there you highlight the text then once you open assistant you tap "What's on my screen" Rami Hmm, never knew that worked. Still doesn't help if the text is in an image or it is non selectable text. Steve Riendeau Awesome, thank you! XgudwilX Not the same. You could copy text from within any app, screen, photo, whatever. Even a photo you took of a food label, street sign, or hand written note. Many languages and fonts too. You'd just hit the little copy (👆🏿)icon and go to town. It was amazing. The Now On Tap reverse image search, from within the camera app was awesome too. Much faster than what the Assistant tries to do. It's usually hit or miss. Oh well, maybe this new change is Google making room to bring back the text select (👆🏿) icon! MayorMcCheese Main reason I removed Assistant David Hyman While not ideal and not always a option, you can select text and then trigger the assistant and it'll use that for search context. And there are other apps CTRL-F (I think) that does basically the same thing. So you can share the screenshot with CTRL-F and then copy the text form there kalehv Also I remember Google Now on Tap did screen search when Camera was open. Was helpful to read barcodes but now that's gone. I don't want to install another app just to read barcodes, or QR codes whatever. mjmdroid Got it and already used it more than 4 times today Nicholas Smith Is there any way to use google assistant to schedule calendar events from your text messages? That was a huge feature of on-tap and I don't get why it went away. SocialSupaCrew Yes it's still present with assistant :) Miles Reiter What kind of context were you using that feature in with Assistant? I was trying to get that to work the other day with a clearly spelled out date and time from an email, and it wasn't finding a thing on my screen. motoridersd Awesome! I hated scrolling down to get to the button, so I wasn't using this feature much. This is much better. Eddy Nelson Lopez They need to bring text selection back! Deeco I got a Screenshot of not having Google Assistant, shall I share? FU Google demarcmj no thank you abqnm Maybe someday they'll add a button to open the damn Google app from the assistant pop-up. If I can't talk to my phone, I want to still be able to search without having to go back to the homescreen and then into the Google app. Miles Reiter I'm thinking about writing some kind of case study around the rollout of Assistant and the pro's/con's compared to Now on Tap. What you mentioned is definitely a pain point in my own usage. I'm curious whether there's anything else (good or bad) that stands out to you about Assistant. Luke Taylor As a language learner, one of the big setbacks about GA is that I no longer have the ability to translate my screen or select specific text on my screen if the screen search doesn't pull up any results. I used those on a daily basis! Mathsiel Totally agree... Grey It's easy. You hit the Google icon next to the search, nothing happens, you fumble around, you tap the search box, you swipe up and down, you get very frustrated, and eventually it randomly closes on you when you try pressing the phone back button, so you press the "recent apps" button but it doesn't exist and you get even more frustrated so you tap the Home Screen Search Box and tap the Google icon and Google Now might load. See? Easy. bekifft Exactly. They're trying to force you to use voice. Even with Siri you can just type into it once it's launched. LOL There are still things that Google Now does better then Assistant.....Very annoying Cory S Eh, I think Now did just about everything better than Assistant. aRvInD I want my Google Now onTap back? Is there any mod to get it? Zahir_SMASH Change your phone's language to US Virgin Islands English. You get Now On Tap back, and Google's voice responses get an Australian accent, which I think you can fix, but I find charming in its own way. titetanium Go to apkmirror and download Google App version 6.11.21 or earlier. You'll probably lose any recent data saved in the current version, but Now on Tap will be back. Don't upgrade the app afterwards. Profit. Zahir_SMASH That's a lot more trouble than just changing your language to another English option titetanium Perhaps, but you won't have to worry about getting Assistant going forward as long as you stay on the old version. How long before El Goog updates the other English language options to have Assistant? Miles Reiter What are some of those things that Now did better for you? To be clear I definitely agree, just looking for some things I might not have thought of for writing a case study on the subject! LOL To be honest I don't really use them often. But I really like how Google Now gives you this nice weather card with ton of info, there is no such a thing in Assistant. Also Google Now is able tell which song is playing, again it's missing from Assistant brownjames Text search from any screen. Selection of non selectable onscreen text. Language translation of non selectable text onscreen. Those are my favorite 3 features of Now on Tap that are not in Assistant. Luke Taylor Exactly the same as you. Text translation and selection was used daily by me. Hugely bummed that Assistant can't do it. Michel Sa I could do image searrch (searching by image) using Now on tap, Assistant can't Mohit Saini Will Moto X2 get google assistant? Or it's only available to 64bit devices like s7,nexus 6p...... Zahir_SMASH Pretty sure it is supposed to be rolling out to any device with Marshmallow and up. Corbin Davenport It's for any phone (not tablet) running 6.0 and up, and I think there's a minimum RAM requirement too. Zahir_SMASH Good to know, thanks blindexecutioner Still isn't as good as now on tap. Before when I'd use that on my home screen it would bring up a bunch of options like navigate to work or home. Now it just says there isn't anything. Margaritas Ante Porcos Bixby button is a good place for Google Assistant. diskostu I hate the Assistant, but I love Now On Tap. Is there any way to get Now On Tap back? ro.opa.eligible_device=false does not work anymore. Major Sceptic I liked on tap too , the assistant may be ok in some ways , but I find myself using the AI features less now than when I had on tap . Sometimes I wonder if having all the Wizz bang software that tries to make life easier by bombarding us with constantly​ with organisational​ suggestions that it may in fact be more like a nagging mother in-law . Or I'm just getting old and grumpy in my old age 😎 ? _jack_ You're not. Guilherme Pata Typing to the assistant as you do in Allo would be a real feature. This button doesn't do much when all you had to do before was swipe up... itsatrap It's not as good as Now on tap. demarcmj Didn't this happen like a month ago? https://www.google.com/search?q=google+assistant+%22What%27s+on+my+screen%22&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8 All the results are from around 3/15 (ish) Corbin Davenport It's been rolling out slowly. demarcmj Interesting. I figured the roll-out was about done since I have it and I never get anything early. Still, staged roll-out or not, I was surprised to see that you guys hadn't covered this already. Cakefish Still no assistant available in the UK on a non-Pixel device... hurry up Google. And bring YouTube Red over here while you're at it. Why is Google so lethargic with updates? freshprince_87 Never cared for the now on tap screenshot option. kalehv I also wish that Assistant could be dismissed by just swiping down. It shows up from bottom halfway to the top and it stretches to top when you pull it up only makes me think it could be pulled down to dismiss but .... Dan it does that if it's still on the bottom half of the screen. just tried it. kalehv Yeah but you pull it up to go all the way to top makes me think you can pull it down as well which doesn't work. Ishti Screen translation and text recognition scanning missing. Portzblitz Smart. Before, when you'd summon Assistant, whether you needed more info or not, Google would be processing at the bottom anyway even though few people ever actually swipe up for it; now, the button can be instantly available, but the processing will only happen for people who press it.

Thankfully, two software engineers, a Google big data project, and some careful analysis have already done the heavy lifting, revealing the simple trick to getting the top comment in most threads: get there first. Jason Michael Baumgartner of Pushshift.io has been sporadically releasing databases of Reddit's trove of comments, and last November Max Woolf ran that mass of data through Google's BigQuery to answer a question that had been posited by another Redditor: What percentage of top comments are the first comment? The answer BigQuery spat back out was a sizable 17.24 per cent. Extend that range to the first five comments and it covers a whopping 56 per cent. It's perfectly intuitive: The first comments get a head start on gathering upvotes, and upvotes signal quality to people who don't have the time or patience to scroll farther into what are perceived as less valuable responses. Image: llewellynjean from r/dataisbeautiful, based on work by Max Woolf "Because first comments carry so much weight, it provides a bias toward power users who are on Reddit all the time," Woolf told Gizmodo over email. A recent update to his work by redditor llewellynjean "is the same and has the same percentage breakpoints," according to Woolf. Partly that's because a few more months of comments are a drop in the bucket for a dataset of this size, though Reddit also hasn't done any major overhaul of their comment sorting algorithm that we've been privy to. While Reddit prides itself on being highly democratic and community-driven, the numbers indicate that the success of comments isn't driven by their conversational value so much as by who had the time to camp out on a subreddit's new submissions and plant their flag first. "Dramatically increase the weighting of new comments such that they are more likely to be seen, even in megacrowded threads," is the solution Woolf suspects might unmire comments from favouring speed over quality, though he seemed sceptical a change would ever be implemented. "From Reddit's perspective, it's possible they may not want newer comments to have a chance to be seen," he wrote, "because proven-comments are safer and may drive more engagement." Woolf and llewellynjean's data only pulls from threads with at least 30 parent-level comments (those replying directly to the post), and doesn't factor in child-level comments (those replying to other commenters). Many subreddits also feature automated responses that post instantly and aren't heavily voted on, which might also skew the results somewhat. As a sober, non-exhaustive analysis though, it provides some insight into yet another way to game the Frontpage of the Internet for all the comment karma it's worth.

Approved government agencies can access that data without a warrant. It's not private information, either. One way to circumvent Australia's draconian metadata retention scheme is to install and use a VPN on your phone and on your PC. Here's what a VPN is, what it does, and why -- and how -- you should get one.

Foreign policy decisions of the administration of President Donald Trump have recently been at the forefront following a missile strike against Syria last week over Syrian President Bashar al-Assad's alleged use of chemical weapons against civilians. Then, a military buildup in the seas nearby North Korea edged closer to that country on Saturday as tensions escalated over their nuclear weapons program. And, on Thursday the U.S. launched the nation's largest bomb against Afghanistan targeting ISIS.

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 125 Plus 1 on G+ 278 Share on Facebook 78 Share on Twitter Total Shares481 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 141k 106k Latest Deals 14 [Deal Alert] Get a 75" Sony LED UHD Android TV from Best Buy for $2150 today ($650 off) 2017/04/15 4:13pm PDTApr 15, 2017 19 [Deal Alert] Huawei Watch in Black Stainless Steel w/metal band $250 ($100 off) 2017/04/14 6:36pm PDTApr 14, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] 55 temporarily free and on-sale apps to round out your week 2017/04/14 12:50pm PDTApr 14, 2017 13 [Deal Alert] 2-Pack 6' Anker USB 3.0 A to C cables $12 w/ promo ($8 off) 2017/04/13 4:16pm PDTApr 13, 2017 32 [Deal Alert] NVIDIA is having a SHIELD gaming spring sale 2017/04/13 2:17pm PDTApr 13, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?

What happens when you have more than one Google Home? Chaos. Paul Quinn Follow View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:22am PDTApr 14, 2017 28 Plus 1 on G+ 95 Share on Facebook 62 Share on Twitter Total Shares185 Editorials Google Home The Amazon Echo was my pacifier as I waited for Google’s entry into the home assistant space. Setting my Google Play Music library aside, I suffered through using Amazon’s attempt at a music service devoid of most of my own library. I connected my Google Calendar to Alexa and it offered a glimpse into my future relationship with Google’s assistant. Finally, in early November, I could get my hands on a new Google Home. I had pre-ordered from Google and then discovered I could pick one up at my local Best Buy. The very morning it hit the shelves, I immediately bought one. I brought it home, set it up in the family room and eagerly asked – “OK Google, play my morning hits playlist.” Without skipping a beat, she announced the list and the room filled with my music. The key point here – it was music from MY library. I didn’t cancel that Google pre-order. It was on its way. I figured I could listen to music in my bedroom as well. But – what about the other rooms in my house? What about the smart lights, smart switches, clever irrigation controller, and intelligent thermostat scattered throughout? I need a Google Home in every room to live the dream of a voice controlled home! I bought four more. My home is outfitted with six Google Home devices. There’s one in every room. I can control my smart home with my voice from anywhere I stand. I can spread music into any room. I can turn on, dim, and turn off lights in various rooms with just my voice. It’s as close as I can get to living on the Enterprise. Google's vision of the future with Google Home. Well, one Home. That’s the dream. Unfortunately, it isn’t a reality (yet). Google has failed at a key feature that it so proudly spoke of that morning in May. The nice lady living inside each Home is often unable to tell if you are talking to her or her sister in the neighboring room. It can result in some frustrating, sometimes comical, exchanges. It is amazing how well the little air freshener shaped unit can hear you from several rooms away. With multiple Homes, you’ll find yourself making requests and getting responses from two of them. It usually involves one of them, not necessarily the one closest to you, executing the request and the other apologizing to you that it can’t. From my bedroom in the morning, I might ask how long it will take to get to work and hear the detailed response in the distance from the kitchen. There will be times when the Home in front of me fulfills my request and another will rattle off from down the hall. You also have the ghosts. I never thought my home might be haunted - until now. There will be times when I turn off the TV, hang up on a call, or just walk out of the bathroom and hear something in another room. I’ll find a Google Home playing music or a podcast that I don’t listen to in a randomly selected room. Who asked to listen to opera at low volume in the guest room? Ghosts. There isn’t a constant circus of home assistants chiming in from all over the house. The closest Home does respond properly more than half of the time. However, I have found myself at times leaning over and almost whispering to a Google Home when I want to be sure the others don’t hear. There is talk of multiuser support coming soon, but it remains to be seen if this will improve its ability to identify which Home I am talking to. For now, I must look like a fool. I am whispering to an air freshener because I don’t want the others to hear. Creepy? Maybe. Tags editorial google home google home app google home fail video subscribe ...

Carson Saldanha Hi David Sean Thomas Hey Paul next time you're buying expensive accessories for every room in your house can you just throw me a hundo instead? Thanks! Sean Thomas Seems like something I would say. Paul Quinn I asked my office Home to get on that. The one in the kitchen responded. She can't do it but she's learning. Christopher Young I can completely sympathize with you. I have two Google Homes in my small apartment (living room/bedroom), and they frequently get confused where I'm at. I want to play music in the bedroom? Nope, the cozy jazz station starts blaring in the living room. There is one awesome benefit of having two Google Homes: I can fill my entire apartment with music with only a few words. dcdttu I hope Google Home gets a lot of support from Google itself and doesn't turn out to be a Hangouts. Or a Wave. Or a Nexus Player. Or a Nexus Q. Or a Google Reader. Or a tablet of any kind. Oh and hi Paul! Paul Quinn HI! Yeah, I'm worried that they will jump ship because they can't figure out a way to monetize it. No ads. If it starts playing ads, Home is moving out. The Echo doesn't really have a monetization angle except that you can shop on Amazon. Google added Google Express to the Home. But really? I'm not shopping on one of these things (yet). Lateef Alabi-Oki I thought the monetization was making money off selling the hardware. Paul Quinn They also need to keep expanding the ecosystem and product functionality which takes work that costs money. I don't know if that one time purchase price covers all that in the long run. Lord Argyris I think what Google is banking on is that if a user has one or more Homes, it makes them that much more likely to stick with the Android ecosystem in general, which means all Google's already existing means of getting money are a bit more secure from such a user switching over to the big "A". Of course it remains to be seen whether or not this is effective. Dk Schlösser The monetization is in the services offered by Google Paul Quinn I don't know what service I access through the Home makes Google any money, short of using it to buy things on Google Express. It does produce a little more profiling information but I doubt that it's enough to pay for the ongoing development. Ryan I think its all about search and locking you into their services, just like the chromecast. Because of chromecast (and now google home) I am more locked into Google Music. I am more locked into Youtube, Play Movies, searching on Google, etc. Just like Android. The specific device/service doesnt have to make money, its a "loss leader" to drive you to their other, profitable services. A very common thing in almost any consumer industry. Lars Jeppesen Precisely. I'm ditching Sonos in favor of Chromecast Audio, only because of my GH fluffthebunny The monetization is off selling all the data gleaned by your six devices listening to your every word. You have become one with the Home. You have been assimilated. Joshed The horror of ordering an item in the kitchen only to find the bedroom and office made duplicate orders. skitchbeatz I've got an open concept, one in the kitchen and one in the living room. They fight over responding and sometimes both respond. It's frustrating. I've thought about moving one of them up or down a floor. It's half implemented. It doesn't make sense because the assistant on the phone will sometimes read "answering on another device. Artem Russakovskii I have 4 Google Homes (2 in nearby areas where they can both hear me at the same time - kitchen and living room), 2 Alexas (though both Alexas can't hear me at the same time), and I can confirm - combined with multiple phones on family members, it's a mess. Let alone Home kicks in and starts talking once a day or so when not asked (doesn't happen nearly as often with Alexa). LithiumFox Never had that happen with ours... givitumibeybi 4 google homes and 2 alexas?? Artem, I think you might have some issues. Artem Russakovskii No, I just have more than one room. Dk Schlösser Change the trigger word for your Alexas Nick After my experiences with Amazon Echo, I have felt that these type of products are not ready for prime time. It's a cool concept, but these little, quirky issues that pop up with these "Home Assistants" suggest otherwise. Perhaps I'm more security minded than other people, but these sort of IoT products are ripe for security issues as well and the combination of these things has me totally turned off to the current market. Tony T. If you have multiple Homes, can you ask Google to play music and have all of them play the same music in sync? Defenestratus yes. Ed G You can have all of them play music like a Sonos. Also will link with Chromecast Audio. trickytree1984 Will it link to chrome cast proper? Joshua Pritt no, you can't group Chromecast video devices, only audio. Joshed This sucks. I don't see why they cant give older chromecast devices this feature. Paul Quinn Yes, you can create groups. For example, I have a group named "Front of the house" that connects three of them. You're best bet is to name them things that roll of the tongue like, "Hey Google, play my 90's hits playlist on the front of the house." Defenestratus I've got three homes, and I don't have this issue at all. Of course they're all on different floors and I live in a rather open-floor plan home so there's that. I've never had it come on as a ghost... ever. Chris You spent over 800 on google homes?!?! Omg man what kinda bank you making. That is insanity. Or no savings? I mean a financially responsible person cannot spend that much unless their income is huge haha. Defenestratus Yesterday I spent $1000 on a shower fixture (Moen U) David Ruddock OMG YOU ACTUALLY BOUGHT ONE OF THOSE? Defenestratus My wife saw it on "I want that" on DIY network and, well, yeah. We're about to start a master suite renovation so it was the perfect opportunity. For her, the hardest part of the day is getting up out of bed and waiting for the shower to heat up, getting cold in the process (she could get cold in the middle of equatorial guinea and we live in the North East US) so when she saw that she could turn the shower on from bed and it would alert her when it was ready for her, it was a done deal. I'm actually thinking of making a google assistant handler for it when it shows up. Chris Damn dude! How much do you make?? I see all these cool things and want them but I decide my money is better sitting in my savings account or the stock market. Defenestratus I specialize in software that is used for pharmaceutical research and clinical trials. I make a good living. Oh and my wife's a doctor. Chris Ah definitely. That's awesome dude. I work at a vaccine start up so hopefully we'll get a product past the FDA then I can buy 1k showers ;) Defenestratus Very cool. My company does a lot of work on vaccine studies. Best of luck. You have a long 12-14 years of approval process ahead of you! goodnightmare "Ok Moen...." Doesn't have quite the same ring to it. Paul Quinn The timing was right. I got three of them for $100 apiece using Visa Checkout and some helpful friends. Chris That's good dude. I haven't been able to convince myself to get one yet. I don't listen to music at home and not really sure what else I'd use it for. I did get a nest recently but still I don't mind pulling out my phone to change the temp. Paul Quinn I have an Ecobee now. My Nest kept thinking I was away because I didn't walk down that hallway enough. The Ecobee has remote sensors. Unfortunately, the Home currently does not have a direct integration with Home. I'm using IFTTT. Lawstorant Is it that hard to check which Home is the closest, based on the loudness of one's speech? Paul Quinn It might be that Google focused on their ability to hear your voice based on having one Home. If you have one, you want it to be able to hear you from a distance. That will backfire when you introduce more of them. They are all listening too well. Mace Moneta It could probably be resolved easily, by having the Google Homes reduce sensitivity of the mic, based upon the number of Google Home's on the network. Paul Quinn I had two Echos when they announced improved far-field functionality. I tested it at the time and it was working better. I didn't do any long term testing because I switched to the Home. With that in mind, Amazon was able to improve the situation with a software update so I agree that Google should have fixed this by now. Lawstorant Well, it's still Google. They have the money and the manpower to overcome such "hurdles". Why is it that more often than not, they seem like a small start-up composed of fresh out-of -college programmers. Nigel Antonio lol I thought I was the only one with that problem... Jesse Corbett So I have 2, one that covers the bedroom/bathroom half of my apartment and on that covers the kitchen/dining/living room section. I have never had an issue with both responding, if I may share my anecdote. However, I frequently am sitting 10 feet from the living room Home and hear my bedroom Home respond, despite being further away, in another room, down a hallway, with the first between me and it. I don't understand. Michael Stiffler Haha, I've had to whisper to my phone if I don't want her (Home) to hear! Aleem Kanji I think it's time to admit that Google is really screwing the pooch here. Nexus hardware failures, Pixel issues, Google Homes not living up to the hype, constant beta-feel to their products... I have a Nexus 6P, two Google Homes, and I'm all-in on Google services, but... for fuck's sake, I'm thinking of jumping ship entirely. Even Android news sites are seeming to be whole-heartedly disappointed with Google and the growing lack of positivity is disheartening. Google either needs to put up and get their shit together with product polish and following through on promises (or not promising the moon to begin with) or they shut the hell up and we all buy iPhones and call it a day. Paul Quinn My thoughts are not really heading down that road. The Home does a lot of things right. It's core features, music and access to Google's massive database of information, are working. Light control works well. There are some very useful IFTTT integrations. The Echo had its issues when it came out and it has grown up. I'm not ready to give up on the Home. I see it slowly improving. I don't miss any Echo features. My 6P was a good experience overall but ultimately, yeah, it failed me in terms of the camera. My new Mate 9 has an absolutely amazing camera. I have no experience with the Pixel though. The general consensus is that the Pixel is amazing. I'm looking forward to the next one. Leoniv Same here. I'm all in with Google tech and have been with them since 2.3, but lately they've been a hot mess. They broke the dialer on multiple phones, hosed bluetooth so it disconnected randomly, and that doesn't even include the issues with the nexus and pixel phones. I hate to admit it, but the iPhones are looking more attractive. Jack Smith Really? Google home is not even 6 months old. GH is easily the most humanist technology that you can buy It is incredible what can do but not perfect and yet it is over? Little dramatic? Where are you going to get anything close? I have had the Echo since the very first day. It is NOT like the GH. Comparisons are ridiculous. Echo has commands and the GH you talk We are so.early with this and obviously the relatively minor issues in the scheme of things will get resolved. I have one echo and counting GHs that I gave away I have purchased 7. Not to say I dislike my Echo but it is not the future, IMO, like the GH. Aleem Kanji I'm TOTALLY being dramatic, actually. I love my Google Home. I love my Nexus. I also tried an iPhone for the first time late last year (iOS 10 got my attention) and I love it too. My tenure with my iPhone was about 4 months, and, like clockwork, I'd always put my SIM back in my N6P every Wednesday night until Saturday, then switch back to my iPhone (which is a bitch with iMessage, BTDub). The iPhone IS more polished, has better power and battery management, but isn't exciting to me the way Android is. I could never give it up. It's like a drug. But, like a drug, I'm hopelessly addicted to something that promises the highest of highs, then always leaves me chasing the dragon. Google promises the world, then has a tendency to either fall short or simple pulls the rug out. In a world where the Pixel exists and it commands iPhone and Galaxy level money, in a world where Google is trying it's hand at a software AND hardware ecosystem, I expect more. I expect polish, I expect promises to be kept - or at least reasonable expectations to be given. Now, people can come back and say that Google is new at hardware and I understand and forgive that. But they aren't a hardware company in the way that they take responsibility for their products 100%, in that they quality test, in that they have any sort of retail presence that goes beyond simply "trying" something out. They have time to build that, so I'll admit that I need to give them time to sort it out. I'm just worried that they'll get complacent or lose interest and one morning wake up and say "Oh yeah, that Android thing and all that hardware and stuff - I'm over it." If Google is going to change direction and add hardware to their list of products, I expect that they keep in mind that it also means that we - not our data - become customers too. Jack Smith So much silliness in this post. First, what right now angers me the most is Apple completely abandoning the entire AirPort line without any warning. Last November just reassigning all the employes. So I replaced our two AirPort Extremes with Google Wifi. That is REAL life not some weird perception things. "Apple reportedly stops developing AirPort WiFi router products, moving employees to other projects" Who does that? Not Google. Instead with Google we have yesterday. "New Google ‘Dual Band WiFi Router’ Shows Up At The FCC" https://www.androidheadlines.com/2017/04/new-google-dual-band-wifi-router-shows-up-at-the-fcc.html This entire narrative Google is horrible at hardware or abandons hardware products is rather ridiculous. Heck it would have been so easy for Google to not support the NON Google WiFI hardware but instead Google decided to spend the money and bring all their new WiFi software to the ONHUB. This is REAL life not fantasy. We have been an Apple house for over a decade. We still have tons of Apple products. But been more and more replacing with Google. With Google we have 4K, HDR, VR, Smart speaker, Mesh and the list keeps growing. I can NOT get any of this from Apple! That is simply the facts. Aleem Kanji Right. 2×4 alexa does this same thing compuguy1088 That's not true. A software update allows for multiple amazon echo devices with the same hotword to work. They've had this since around the end of last year. 2×4 that's my point - it doesnt work well Midnitte "You also have the ghosts. I never thought my home might be haunted - until now. There will be times when I turn off the TV, hang up on a call, or just walk out of the bathroom and hear something in another room. I’ll find a Google Home playing music or a podcast that I don’t listen to in a randomly selected room. Who asked to listen to opera at low volume in the guest room? Ghosts." I have two and I've grouped them in a "home unit" and I've never experienced this. Typically I'll play music on one but sometimes I'll tell it to play music on both and I've never experienced it playing music on a rogue Home goodnightmare Nor have I. Igen Then I am pretty sure that Paul's home is haunted and he should call an Sam & Dean asap. kalehv This is a constant struggle. I have two Google Homes and a bunch of phones / tablets that also respond to "Ok Google" I usually use "Hey Google" to avoid waking up phones and tablets but there is no other way round like when I want to be reminded of something, there is no command that only capable devices (phones and tablets) would listen and not the Home. Home wins over taking control and apologizes for not being able to set reminders and actual capable devices say "Answering on other device" :( thacounty I have mine in opposite corners of the house to prevent this. The real issue is that I'll talk quietly to my phone and it will still hear me. Then my Pixel says answering on another device, which is Home telling me she can't do that yet, while my Pixel could have handled it just fine. Gets frustrating, but my 2 year old son yelling at it to play Batman Play-Doh Eggs makes it worth double what I paid. JG Glad I'm not the only one with this problem. Right now I only have two Google Homes set up, one in my bedroom and the other in the living room. If I'm in the living room, even my normal speaking voice will almost certainly trigger both Home units to talk to me. Like Paul, I have to turn to the one in the living room and whisper in order to get only one. And that can be hard if the TV is blasting away to. Though for some reason when I'm in my bedroom, I usually only trigger the bedroom unit. It gets very annoying when the one I want to talk to tells me she can't help while the other rattles off some long winded multi-paragraph answer (especially when I just asked "what time is it"). Being in another room (and sharing the same voice as the one talking next to you) its often hard to understand what she's saying - and of course there's no "Hey Google, what did you just say?" command... I wanted to set up a third in the other bedroom. But until I'm sure I won't be getting three different responses to each query.... Amazon claims to have an algorithm to determine which of multiple Echo units should respond. I don't have multiple Echo units so I can't test the validity myself, but if they can figure it out... I'm sure Google, with their expertise in machine learning shouldn't have too much bother with it. goodnightmare Acoustics. :) illregal I've got 3 in pretty close proximity, and a 4th whenever lg decides to send those out. Only about 1 out of 10 requests gets answered by the one i wasn't intentionally talking to. 4Ui812 Hi Paul ? Paul Quinn Hi! Rasovan Mircea Google have to upgrade the sound waves and not allow them to travel more than one room.... Tired_Guy I have a Home, a Nexus 9, a Nexus 7 and a Pixel XL, so assistant works on all of them. If all are in my den charging, saying OK Google is like he described only a bit weirder, as I can say it specifically to my Pixel XL in my hand and the Nexus 9 answers, through it's cover. Multiple device synchronization is vital Packer Backer Another reason to allow users to set the hot word. "Hey Bub! Hey Betty! Hey Fumbduck!" would would activate three different devices. Dk Schlösser The solution is to be able to change the trigger word for each device. You can do this on Alexa. Paul Quinn Currently, only my Home responds to "Hey Google" so I use that to talk to the Home. my phones and tablets don't respond. That cuts down on the problem a bit as long as I don't want to use voice with my phone. If I say "OK Google" to my phone, the Home may also respond. A quick fix for now would be to have the option to set the Home NOT to respond to "OK Google" and only "Hey Google." Bill Riess Yeah I just recently discovered this issue when I moved from an echo and echo dot to 4 Google homes. For the most part they work pretty good but it's annoying when they pick up in the wrong room. Multiuser and Sonos integration would be great additions as well. goodnightmare I've had four of these in my home since day one. Yes, occasionally we'll get some random response from a distant device, but it doesn't affect performance. The requested task is completed properly 95% of the time and any hiccups have never been due to multiple devices trying to provide feedback. Our Google Home experience has been quite pleasant and loads of fun. DomBrady Same. I've got three. I have had one interference related issue. Charles222 Same with four here as well. I've had an interference problem with my kitchen & living room ones, but taking a few steps towards one or the other solves it. nerdshowandtell.com I also have 6 Google Homes and the issues described here I only had a month or so ago and they went away. Id also make sure you have solid wifi with no interference to eliminate any delay in the homes seeing each other. As for the random asking/talking, maybe have seen that 3 times since it came out. Definitely not in awhile. Brett Koger I also have several Google Home devices, I am not experiencing the issues you state. I even have two of them with in 20 feet (they are in different rooms) I will see both activate but only one will respond. I have only experienced what you are see a few times. It is not the norm. Paul Quinn I have noticed that situation where more than one activate but only two of them can actually be visualized at one time. To me, that's a good sign. It means they are hearing you but identifying which one should respond. Maxr1998 Hi Paul! Very entertaining and interesting article. I don't have a Google Home myself yet (not available in Germany, functionality in German is likely pretty limited (as seen in Assistant on phones), my Home Assistant setup isn't supported by Google Home/Google Assistant, and IFTTT is too slow (10 seconds+) atm), but the idea of having one is very intriguing for me :) Paul Quinn Hi Max! I guess one plus side of living in another country is that Google works out bugs in the United States before it expands across the globe. Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get it functional:P But it's still sometimes a little annoying for power users wanting the latest and the greatest regardless of bugs ;) Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get it functional. 😜 But it's still sometimes a little annoying to not get the latest and greatest stuff being a poweruser ;) Maxr1998 That's probably a valid point, even if we get things late, we at least get them functional. 😜 But it's still sometimes a little annoying to not get the latest and greatest stuff being a poweruser ;) JD So it's not just me. Alexa is just that much better with its spatial recognition. It has a 100% hit rate on responding on the right unit. Sandeep Raghuraman One solution to your problem - setup mic + speakers in each room, and use one Google Home. That way, only one Google Home device will respond. Although, the next problem would be, how does Google Home decide which mic to listen through? Maybe a device that mixes all of those input streams from the different mics? Nick Riviera Try power cycling your units to keep them from talking over one another. sucatrops If you bought 6 Google Homes and didn't expect more than one to respond to you, you should shoot yourself. Hector Diaz Amazon echo has far field recognition between Echos so Google can include that with a software update. Ryan I dont see the need to have one in all 6 rooms of my home. Having one in the open air living/dining room and kitchen is plenty, it hears me from 40 feet no matter what. Then another in my bedroom. I dont think I need them in the guest rooms. Maybe one in the office, but that is all the way on the other side of the house from the bedroom. Maybe 6 is the overkill. Paul Quinn I have smart lighting in all the main rooms of the house. I wouldn't want any of us to be yelling from room to adjust lighting in another. I did put in remotes in the rooms as well because you should have another option besides voice. I think for most people, one or two is plenty. I'm really into smart home technology despite its incredibly fragmented implementation right now. I know my house is going beyond the norm. The fact that yours hear you from 40 feet away is what is causing the downfall in my house. Đức Thành 6 Google Homes? You're a crazy man. I like you. 6 is still nowhere near enough, though. Hector Diaz I have 2 echo Dot and 1 Echo. Missing still 2 echo Dot. So he is not crazy just want to have a real smart home doesn't matter where he stands like me. Andrew Hartley It was clear Paul was a bit 'unusual' from the moment he mentioned the Enterprise. I've been teaching science using the latest technology for 30+ and my dream has always been to walk into my classroom in the morning and for a cute sounding female voice to welcome me from my computer with a good morning asking me what I would like to do today. Google home I found you at last 😉 That doesn't sound weird does it 😎 Paul Quinn Sounds fantastic! D.Smithee I like when you're home alone in a quiet house and this thing starts spouting gibberish with no warning. Paul Quinn Tonight.... one of the Homes (in the office) decided to "forget" the lights in the room. Just the lights in the room that it's in. It kept saying there were no lights set up for that room. The remote went dead too. It was darkness. But... it let me operate the lights from other Homes. No I'm starting to wonder if Google read this... and is toying with me. I got the remote back online. The Home is still protesting. Bill3 Hi Paul, not sure what's going on there. I have three Google Homes and have only had that happen once or twice. They'll often beep together, but only one will answer. It could be a problem with your WiFi network. Are they connected to different AP points? Paul Quinn Yes. Despite two of them being closer to another access point in my house, I've kept the Homes on the primary router which is able to deliver a strong enough signal throughout the house. I use an access point to guarantee a connection to the irrigation controller outside. abc Oh, god. People are buying not more than one of this beta product. Are they rich or just plain stupid? Kostas 💪🎩 Man I laughed hard. Well written! DragoCubed 🎪 👻 👋 hi paul papastevez Where the ^*#} is the Google play movies integration??? Seriously, Netflix, a third party has been working for months and months. Lars Jeppesen I have 3 GH, and I've never had the problems described in the article. /edit And Hi to Paul, of course :) twighahn I think back to the smart homes of yesteryear. They had an intercom, radio, and auto switches. Now it's all more automatic and more personalised. Michael Paul, did you realize Google Home can only play your music library using a playlist? It cannot pull up a single or album or artist from your library.

Why is this, you ask? This is because there have been several users who are reporting that the update is breaking the fingerprint sensors on their phones. This is according to a post on the Google Product Forums (via Android and Me) where some users are complaining about the issue. One user writes, “After updating I got the following message in red at the bottom of the screen when trying to unlock my phone with my fingerprint “Fingerprint hardware not available.” I tried rebooting and clearing my cache with no change. I thought if I deleted my fingerprints and re-added them it might help. Instead I just get the following error when trying to add a fingerprint: “Enrollment was not completed. Fingerprint enrollment didn’t work. Try again or use a different finger.”” The good news is based on the comments made by Orrin, the Pixel Community Manager, Google is aware of the problem and they are trying to gather as much information as possible in order to determine what might have caused the problem. So like we said, if you haven’t updated yet then maybe you want to hold off until the problem can be identified and resolved. In the meantime it does not seem to be affecting other handsets, so for now it looks like it might be a Pixel and Nexus problem although we can’t say for sure how widespread it is yet.

People often start on the internet and then visit stores in person. Of the people who conduct local searches on their smartphones before buying something,  50% end up visiting a store within the day. 50% of local searchers end up visiting a store the same day Click To Tweet With so many motivated local buyers, it is important for businesses to increase their local visibility. They can do this with Google My Business. When used correctly, it can lead to a spike in visibility and click-through-rate. In fact, well-maintained listings get five times more views than unclaimed listings do. First, you need to learn how to get started with Google My Business. Then, you will be ready to build local citations and reach customers. Setting Up Your Listing When you start a new business website you will need to add a Google My Business listing in order to use this service. Begin by conducting a Google search for your business. Just go to the search engine and type the name of your business into the search box. Google My Business results display prominently at the right or top of the search results. If you see your business name in the map listings, it means that you already have a Google My Business listing. Click on the “Are You the Business Owner” link to claim the business. If you don’t see the “Are You the Business Owner” link or if your business doesn’t show up, you need to set everything up from scratch. This is very easy to do. Start by creating or signing into your Google account for your business. If you are creating a new account, you will probably want to keep this separate from your personal Google accounts. Visit google.com/business and select “Start Now”. Google will show a large map of your country with fields for you to complete. Enter your information and then go through the verification process. Make sure you enter your information accurately so there aren’t any issues with your listing. Be sure to note EXACTLY how you enter your information for future reference. Google will ask how you whether you would like to verify your listing by post, by phone, or if you would like to postpone verification. Select the method that is best for you and Google will send you a post card or contact you by phone to complete the verification process. Google will automatically set up a page for your business. Review the information in the top banner of the page and add details as needed. Be sure to include your website URL, as this will help you later. You can add quite a bit of information, including business hours, images, logo, and a virtual tour. Once your listing is confirmed, you can show up on Google Maps and in the search results. You can also edit your listing to modify your information as needed. Building Local Citations Once you've got your Google My Business listing up it's time to start building citations. A citation is a reference to your business name and address appears on a webpage. A link to your site isn’t necessary to get a citation. You just need the text to get credit for a citation. Citations are one of the main local organic factors search engines use when ranking websites, so it is important that you take the time to build them. Everything else being equal, the site with more citations will probably rank higher in the search engines. You’ll already have one citation when you create your Google My Business listing. You will use that as a springboard to create citations on other sites. There are LOTS of places to make a citation. Search Google for “citations list {your country}” and you'll find lots of ideas, like this list of 200 citation sources in the US. Common places to register your business (ie get a citation) include: Yellow pages Yelp Facebook Hotfrog and many, many more You need to remain consistent in regards to your name, address, and phone number (NAP) when creating citations. A minor change will throw the entire process off course. For instance, if you use an abbreviation on Google My Business and spell out the entire name on your website, you may not get credit for the citation.

The new Style Ideas feature could seem quite basic at first. But haven’t we all  all asked ourselves how a jacket or dress would sit on the waist or shoulders in real life, or wondered which pants would go with a pair of shoes we’re eyeing? The idea is simple: in addition to the standard retail photo of a fashion product, Google will show you other photos of the same item worn by one of the brand’s official models or a blogger, who has teamed it with other things. “With style ideas you can see real-life options of what bag and jeans look stellar with those red high heels you’ve been eyeing”, Google explained in a blog post. “Style Ideas” is currently only available in Image Search on mobile web and in the Google app for Android. — AFP-Relaxnews                MORE ON MMOTV Most Viewed Now Week Alphabet’s Verily makes smartwatch for health research Google’s AutoDraw aims to make art of your doodles (VIDEO) Nintendo to release mini-size Switch in 2019, Citigroup predicts Gary the parrot may hold secrets to advanced drones (VIDEO) US takedown of Russian botnet won’t end pernicious spam, say experts Project Scorpio: Five consoles that won with less power, and one that didn't That fingerprint sensor on your phone is not as safe as you think Facebook looking at behaviour to weed out fake accounts This prototype flight suit brings you that much closer to your Iron Man dreams (VIDEO) US takedown of Russian botnet won’t end pernicious spam, say experts Most Watched Now Week Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Reuters Video: Greek Orthodox Patriarch leads Holy Fire ceremony in Jerusalem Reuters Video: Beating climate-change odds, a wolverine is born in Belgium Reuters Video: Cast and crew of ‘The Beguiled’ discuss the remake Jimmy Kimmel roasts United Airlines NYT Video: Food of the gods — ambrosia cake Related Articles Google adds ‘fact check’ to global search results (VIDEO) Waze and Spotify’s duet means musical commuting Google vows fix for ‘inappropriate’ search results End of the road for CyanogenMod, an alternative smartphone operating system Facebook is still the biggest drain on your smartphone battery, study finds Advertisement MMO Instagram Tweets by @themmailonline Tweets by @themmailonline MMOTV News Malaysia World Money Life Showbiz Opinion Sports Eat/Drink Travel Read Tech/Gadgets Drive Gallery Copyright © 2017 Malay Mail Online About Us | Contact Us | Policies | Search | Archive | E-Paper | Mobile | ProjekMMO | RecomN - Local Services

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 125 Plus 1 on G+ 278 Share on Facebook 78 Share on Twitter Total Shares481 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 141k 106k Latest Deals 14 [Deal Alert] Get a 75" Sony LED UHD Android TV from Best Buy for $2150 today ($650 off) 2017/04/15 4:13pm PDTApr 15, 2017 19 [Deal Alert] Huawei Watch in Black Stainless Steel w/metal band $250 ($100 off) 2017/04/14 6:36pm PDTApr 14, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] 55 temporarily free and on-sale apps to round out your week 2017/04/14 12:50pm PDTApr 14, 2017 13 [Deal Alert] 2-Pack 6' Anker USB 3.0 A to C cables $12 w/ promo ($8 off) 2017/04/13 4:16pm PDTApr 13, 2017 32 [Deal Alert] NVIDIA is having a SHIELD gaming spring sale 2017/04/13 2:17pm PDTApr 13, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?

Google is not having the best of luck with supporting its newest smartphones: the Google Pixel and Google Pixel XL. A new forum thread opened on Googles product forum just ten days ago on April 4. The thread has gained a small number of replies and feedback regarding a feature thats affecting what appears to be small batch of devices. The newest 7.1.2 update has broken the fingerprint scanner sensor and has been affecting Nexus 5X, Nexus 6P, Pixel, and Pixel XL devices. If you are experiencing this issue, you should head to the Pixel User Community thread and share your experience with the issue. The more information that Google can get from the community, the easier the issue will be to understand and the quicker the patch can be pushed to affected users. The Google Pixel has already had a few issues with software including: a glitchy Bluetooth radio, LTE-related problems, and a problem with the camera that causes the operating system to crash. Lets hope Google doesnt need to deal with these little issues on the next Pixel phones. Tell us, has the Android 7.1.2 update caused your fingerprint scanner to stop working? Let us know which model youre using as well.

I'm talking about first page of Google and Bing, the top two search engines in terms of usage.  If you aren't, or can't efficiently market your business on this precious piece of "real-estate", you will miss out a potentially game-changing market share. Later in this article, we will show you how to get in front of every customer looking for you, even some that didn't know they were.  We will also show how to completely bypass your competition.  And we will show you how to completely dominate the traffic looking for your business product or service.  All of this while using white hat (http://www.webopedia.com/TERM/W/White_Hat_SEO.html) methods, online advertising Total Front Page is one-of-a-kind product and service Almost everyone understands that they need to be on the first page of the major search engines to be truly effective. The problem is that everyone else is trying to get there also.  If and when you finally get your company on the first page, you see that you are there with about nine or more other companies.  It's difficult to stand out. In today's fast moving world, everything changes and evolves often when it comes to advertising your business online.  The first step is knowing and understanding the playing field.  Google is now putting a lot of emphasis on how customers search for your company name.  It's all about what the user wants. Google ranks sites on what we can control, such as your website content, social media activity, etc., and also what we can't control, such as online user activity.  In Google's newest algorithm they put a lot of weight on user activity. They are trying to do a better job of providing the results customers want. An important note to that after the last Panda/Penguin update (Google's name for their algorithm changes), appears that Google favors the large sites like Amazon, Sears, Home Depot, etc.  The reason these major sites have moved up so aggressively in rankings is because of all the users searching for these company names included in the search, for instance, "plumbing materials home depot".  Because of the new updates, these types of searches allow for a huge ranking advantage when users search for a product and a company name in the search before they hit Search.  So, Google does not favor these company websites. It's because Google thinks that users favor these websites.    It is basically a situation where we asked for it, so we get it.  We keep putting company names in our searches, so search engines are ranking these companies higher in the results. In order to explode your online advertising, you first need to make sure that you have (1) a good website with good relevant content, (2) social media activity, (3) directory listings, and (4) some content on other sites that link back to your website, such as blogs where you answer questions from customers. At that point, you have the foundation to build your online advertising.  But, as we related, many other companies are doing the same thing.  So, how do you get yourself in front of the competition with your online advertising campaign? The way to be in front of every customer looking for your product or service is to be suggested by the major search engines.  About 71% of all users engage with what is called the auto-complete box. As we told you earlier in this article, we will show you how to get in front of your targeted consumer and dominate the traffic when you do.  Here's how - Online advertising Total Front Page (http://www.totalfrontpage.com/). Whenever a customer is typing in a search term looking for your product or service, you can be in front of every customer.  Every customer who types in the search box will have your name in front of them as a suggestion before they see any of your competition.  Consumers will click on your company and those that click on your name in the auto-suggestion box will see the first page of organic results that has only your company listed on the entire page.  You completely bypass your competition. To help you achieve your goal of dominating your marketplace with search box optimization online advertising Total Front Page is safe and results are guaranteed. We do not use any black hat methods.

New data provided by Google shows a surge in searches for "World War 3" this month, breaking a record for the most searches for the phrase since Google started keeping track in 2004. Searches for "Trump War" are also at their highest. According to Google Trends, searches have also spiked for "nuclear war" and "war" this month. ADVERTISEMENT The increase in searches follows a week of big foreign policy decisions by the Trump administration. Last Thursday Trump launched nearly 60 missiles at Syria in response to a chemical weapons attack. On Saturday, a Navy strike group was moved closer to North Korea. And this Thursday, Trump dropped the nation's largest non-nuclear bomb in Afghanistan against ISIS. Also on Thursday, NBC reported that the U.S. os preparing for a preemptive strike against North Korea if officials believe Pyongyang is going to go through with a nuclear weapons test, although several reporters have said their sources disputed the story.   View the discussion thread.

View 13/04/2017 Turkish constitutional referendum: TRexit from parliamentary democracy? last updated: 12/04/2017 Euronews by William Echikson, head of the Digital Forum at the Centre for European Policy Studies in Brussels Europe is often viewed as a digital laggard, running far behind the frontier-pushing United States and Asia. But appearances are deceiving. In fact, according to a new report by the London venture capital firm Atomico, European startups are now taking the lead in artificial intelligence, building new tech hubs, and drawing investment from traditional industrial stalwarts. Last year, a record-setting $13.6 billion was invested in Europe’s tech sector, compared with $2.8 billion in 2011. Gone are the days when Europe’s “tech” sector largely comprised consumer-oriented e-commerce businesses – often blatant knockoffs of successful US companies. Today, Europe is the home of real pioneering innovation, led by what Atomico calls “deep tech” – the kind of artificial intelligence developed by Google’s DeepMind. Deep tech accounted for $1.3 billion of European venture investments in 2015, delivered in 82 rounds, up from $289 million, delivered in 55 rounds, in 2011. Europe’s new tech hubs are emerging in unexpected places, far beyond the early hotspots of London, Berlin, and Stockholm. Atomico pinpoints Paris, Munich, Zurich, and Copenhagen as the cities to watch over the coming years. The French capital, Atomico points out, is already starting to challenge London and Berlin in terms of the number and volume of venture-capital-financed deals. Europe’s traditional industries are now awakening to tech. Two-thirds of Europe’s largest corporates by market capitalization have made a direct investment in a tech company. One-third of those companies have acquired a tech company since the beginning of 2015. Foreign firms are also rushing to take advantage of Europe’s tech talent. Google, Facebook, and Amazon have all announced major expansions of their European tech hubs. Transactions worth more than $88 billion took place last year – compared to just $3.3 billion in 2014 – including SoftBank’s purchase of the British semiconductor-design firm ARM and Qualcomm’s $47 billion purchase of NXP Semiconductors. Another study, by the Boston Consulting Group, points out that many small export-oriented European Union member countries – namely, the Benelux, Baltic, and Nordic countries – rank well above the US in so-called “e-intensity,” which covers IT infrastructure, Internet access, as well as businesses, consumer, and government engagement in Internet-related activities. These “digital frontrunners” generate about 8% of their GDP from the Internet, compared to 5% in Europe’s Big Five (Germany, France, Italy, Spain, and the United Kingdom). Digitization is expected to generate between 1.6 million and 2.3 million more jobs than it eliminates in these countries between 2015 and 2020. Of course, Europe’s tech sector still has its weaknesses, reflected in its failure so far to produce a tech giant to rival the behemoths of Silicon Valley. While European tech entrepreneurs find it as easy as their American counterparts to raise startup funds, US firms enjoy 14 times more later-stage capital. That funding gap would disappear, if European pension funds allocated just 0.6% more of their capital under management to venture investments. A related weakness is the lack of a true European single digital market. In the US or China, tech entrepreneurs gain immediate access to a massive market. In Europe, they still must navigate 28 different consumer markets and regulatory regimes. To be sure, the European Commission promised to create a single digital market two years ago, estimating that it could boost the EU economy by €415 billion ($448.5 billion) annually. But Hosuk Lee-Makiyama and Philippe Legrain of the Open Political Economy Network recently delivered a scathing assessment of the results. Europe’s “single digital market,” they argue, currently amounts “to a jumble of outdated, corporatist, counterproductive industrial policies that favor producers over consumers, big companies over small, traditional incumbents over digital startups, and EU firms over foreign ones.” Instead of liberalizing, the EU wants to regulate. For example, it is working to ban companies from refusing online sales (except for copyright reasons) or setting different prices on the basis of a customer’s home country. Other dangerous possibilities – such as an effort to regulate data ownership, access, and usability – lie on the horizon. Despite these risks, the overall trend in Europe’s tech sector is a positive one. A new appetite for risk seems to be sweeping the continent; Atomico reports that more than 85% of founders say it is “culturally acceptable” to start one’s own company. Add to that deep research talent – five of the top ten global computer science faculties are within the EU – and Europe’s start-up boom looks sustainable. Politically, too, there is reason for optimism. Europe’s digital frontrunners are beginning to organize into a potent force, with 16 small EU countries, from Denmark to Ireland and Estonia, having formed a pro-Internet group. Together, these countries have urged the EU to ban data-localization requirements. At a time when the US is pursuing protectionist, insular, and backward-looking policies, Europe is stepping up as an innovative and forward-looking economic force. Wouldn’t it be ironic if, as now seems likely, it is the supposedly backward EU that ended up leading the way in unlocking the Internet’s true economic potential?

Google Assistant's screen search has been moved to a button Corbin Davenport Follow View All Posts 2017/04/14 9:02am PDTApr 14, 2017 61 Plus 1 on G+ 16 Share on Facebook 42 Share on Twitter Total Shares119 Applications Google News Google Now on Tap was introduced alongside Android 6.0 Marshmallow, which used context on your screen to help you find information. Google Assistant replaced Now on Tap (for compatible devices), and carried over most of its functionality. Now Assistant is making it slightly more obvious that it can search your screen and take screenshots.    Left: Old design; Center, Right: New design Before, screen search results would appear below the main Assistant prompt after a few seconds, and the screenshot button was found below the screen search results. Buttons for screen search and taking a screenshot are now immediately visible when Assistant is opened. This is a minor improvement, but definitely a welcome one. The change appears to be part of a server-side update, so if you don't have it, you will soon.

The old swipe up barely even worked most of the time. I've been waiting for them to do something like this. Paul Smith Don't even have assistant yet... Nexus 5x 7.12 samiazza Same here, is there any way to get it without root? Suresh Aryal Change the phone language to US English, delete Google app data and you should be running Assistant after few setup screens or just wait for few hours. samiazza Thank you, it worked:-) belac77 that's so weird. I've had Assistant on my Moto G Play running Marshmallow from the second or third day the rollout began! Zahir_SMASH be glad you don't. bekifft Seriously, enjoy it while it lasts. Assistant is a downgrade in every way. Alex Dueppen Is it just me or did Assistant get rid of the OCR thing where you could select text on your screen? Bombaglad this was never a part of assistant, only now on tap Nicholas Matranga Nope, they removed it for some reason. That was one of the main things I used now on tap for. Roh_Mish Used it all the time to select and copy text it to search for something Corbin Davenport That feature was never ported to Assistant. Mohammad Fazal Love this Now on tap feature. And now its gone :/ Evgany Used it all the time. Bring it back. Ruel Johnson It's still there you highlight the text then once you open assistant you tap "What's on my screen" Rami Hmm, never knew that worked. Still doesn't help if the text is in an image or it is non selectable text. Steve Riendeau Awesome, thank you! XgudwilX Not the same. You could copy text from within any app, screen, photo, whatever. Even a photo you took of a food label, street sign, or hand written note. Many languages and fonts too. You'd just hit the little copy (👆🏿)icon and go to town. It was amazing. The Now On Tap reverse image search, from within the camera app was awesome too. Much faster than what the Assistant tries to do. It's usually hit or miss. Oh well, maybe this new change is Google making room to bring back the text select (👆🏿) icon! MayorMcCheese Main reason I removed Assistant David Hyman While not ideal and not always a option, you can select text and then trigger the assistant and it'll use that for search context. And there are other apps CTRL-F (I think) that does basically the same thing. So you can share the screenshot with CTRL-F and then copy the text form there kalehv Also I remember Google Now on Tap did screen search when Camera was open. Was helpful to read barcodes but now that's gone. I don't want to install another app just to read barcodes, or QR codes whatever. mjmdroid Got it and already used it more than 4 times today Nicholas Smith Is there any way to use google assistant to schedule calendar events from your text messages? That was a huge feature of on-tap and I don't get why it went away. SocialSupaCrew Yes it's still present with assistant :) Miles Reiter What kind of context were you using that feature in with Assistant? I was trying to get that to work the other day with a clearly spelled out date and time from an email, and it wasn't finding a thing on my screen. motoridersd Awesome! I hated scrolling down to get to the button, so I wasn't using this feature much. This is much better. Eddy Nelson Lopez They need to bring text selection back! Deeco I got a Screenshot of not having Google Assistant, shall I share? FU Google demarcmj no thank you abqnm Maybe someday they'll add a button to open the damn Google app from the assistant pop-up. If I can't talk to my phone, I want to still be able to search without having to go back to the homescreen and then into the Google app. Miles Reiter I'm thinking about writing some kind of case study around the rollout of Assistant and the pro's/con's compared to Now on Tap. What you mentioned is definitely a pain point in my own usage. I'm curious whether there's anything else (good or bad) that stands out to you about Assistant. Luke Taylor As a language learner, one of the big setbacks about GA is that I no longer have the ability to translate my screen or select specific text on my screen if the screen search doesn't pull up any results. I used those on a daily basis! Mathsiel Totally agree... Grey It's easy. You hit the Google icon next to the search, nothing happens, you fumble around, you tap the search box, you swipe up and down, you get very frustrated, and eventually it randomly closes on you when you try pressing the phone back button, so you press the "recent apps" button but it doesn't exist and you get even more frustrated so you tap the Home Screen Search Box and tap the Google icon and Google Now might load. See? Easy. bekifft Exactly. They're trying to force you to use voice. Even with Siri you can just type into it once it's launched. LOL There are still things that Google Now does better then Assistant.....Very annoying Cory S Eh, I think Now did just about everything better than Assistant. aRvInD I want my Google Now onTap back? Is there any mod to get it? Zahir_SMASH Change your phone's language to US Virgin Islands English. You get Now On Tap back, and Google's voice responses get an Australian accent, which I think you can fix, but I find charming in its own way. titetanium Go to apkmirror and download Google App version 6.11.21 or earlier. You'll probably lose any recent data saved in the current version, but Now on Tap will be back. Don't upgrade the app afterwards. Profit. Zahir_SMASH That's a lot more trouble than just changing your language to another English option titetanium Perhaps, but you won't have to worry about getting Assistant going forward as long as you stay on the old version. How long before El Goog updates the other English language options to have Assistant? Miles Reiter What are some of those things that Now did better for you? To be clear I definitely agree, just looking for some things I might not have thought of for writing a case study on the subject! LOL To be honest I don't really use them often. But I really like how Google Now gives you this nice weather card with ton of info, there is no such a thing in Assistant. Also Google Now is able tell which song is playing, again it's missing from Assistant brownjames Text search from any screen. Selection of non selectable onscreen text. Language translation of non selectable text onscreen. Those are my favorite 3 features of Now on Tap that are not in Assistant. Luke Taylor Exactly the same as you. Text translation and selection was used daily by me. Hugely bummed that Assistant can't do it. Michel Sa I could do image searrch (searching by image) using Now on tap, Assistant can't Mohit Saini Will Moto X2 get google assistant? Or it's only available to 64bit devices like s7,nexus 6p...... Zahir_SMASH Pretty sure it is supposed to be rolling out to any device with Marshmallow and up. Corbin Davenport It's for any phone (not tablet) running 6.0 and up, and I think there's a minimum RAM requirement too. Zahir_SMASH Good to know, thanks blindexecutioner Still isn't as good as now on tap. Before when I'd use that on my home screen it would bring up a bunch of options like navigate to work or home. Now it just says there isn't anything. Margaritas Ante Porcos Bixby button is a good place for Google Assistant. diskostu I hate the Assistant, but I love Now On Tap. Is there any way to get Now On Tap back? ro.opa.eligible_device=false does not work anymore. Major Sceptic I liked on tap too , the assistant may be ok in some ways , but I find myself using the AI features less now than when I had on tap . Sometimes I wonder if having all the Wizz bang software that tries to make life easier by bombarding us with constantly​ with organisational​ suggestions that it may in fact be more like a nagging mother in-law . Or I'm just getting old and grumpy in my old age 😎 ? _jack_ You're not. Guilherme Pata Typing to the assistant as you do in Allo would be a real feature. This button doesn't do much when all you had to do before was swipe up... itsatrap It's not as good as Now on tap. demarcmj Didn't this happen like a month ago? https://www.google.com/search?q=google+assistant+%22What%27s+on+my+screen%22&ie=utf-8&oe=utf-8 All the results are from around 3/15 (ish) Corbin Davenport It's been rolling out slowly. demarcmj Interesting. I figured the roll-out was about done since I have it and I never get anything early. Still, staged roll-out or not, I was surprised to see that you guys hadn't covered this already. Cakefish Still no assistant available in the UK on a non-Pixel device... hurry up Google. And bring YouTube Red over here while you're at it. Why is Google so lethargic with updates? freshprince_87 Never cared for the now on tap screenshot option. kalehv I also wish that Assistant could be dismissed by just swiping down. It shows up from bottom halfway to the top and it stretches to top when you pull it up only makes me think it could be pulled down to dismiss but .... Dan it does that if it's still on the bottom half of the screen. just tried it. kalehv Yeah but you pull it up to go all the way to top makes me think you can pull it down as well which doesn't work. Ishti Screen translation and text recognition scanning missing. Portzblitz Smart. Before, when you'd summon Assistant, whether you needed more info or not, Google would be processing at the bottom anyway even though few people ever actually swipe up for it; now, the button can be instantly available, but the processing will only happen for people who press it. Separates the task load. Michel Sa Where is the image search from Now on tap! Assistant is a step back. DC_Guy It's MUCH more useful this way. I take a lot of screenshots and i hated always having to scroll down to get to the share button. Sang Ngaihte No Assistant till now in India. Only Now on tap. Sibin C Baby I need the old text selection back....That's the only reason I'm still continuing in Google now Don Low I don't have the screenshot button on mine? mike shwilly Not sure if this is new but I'm seeing that Now on Tap started to give quick info in the bottom bar instead of just providing a search button https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e690721560ce23b223eb937de7b14c92065f3047c5e06363eb43916964c4fd82.png https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/304b263c01a22476cc3fc51c4858d2043b55163515084ab3920b5be441676362.png dontsh00tmesanta Just noticed it Roh_Mish There is no way to input text. I don't want to input by voice in public place.

Google may be sued over Nexus 6P early shutdown and bootloop issues Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 11:09am PDTApr 14, 2017 125 Plus 1 on G+ 278 Share on Facebook 78 Share on Twitter Total Shares481 Android OS Legal Marshmallow 6.0 News Nexus 6P The Android hardware space is fast beginning to look like a watered down episode of Suits. Following on from news earlier in the week that LG is facing a bootloop lawsuit regarding several of its phones, Huawei's Nexus 6P could be responsible for Google encountering a similar inconvenience. As well as being accused of the same bootloop problem that has blighted LG devices, there are reports from consumers that the Nexus 6P has a premature battery shutdown problem. We reported late last year that certain Huawei Nexus 6Ps were suffering from the early shutdown problem, causing them to die with as much as 60% battery still indicated. Now, law firm Chimicles & Tikellis LLP is investigating the possibility of bringing a class action lawsuit against Google on behalf of customers who have faced this issue. Also included in any potential suit would be the same bootloop issue that has also affected owners of the LG Nexus 5X. The problems have mostly been reported by users running Android 7.0 Nougat, but there are also claims that backpedalling to Marshmallow 6.0 on the same devices doesn't fix anything. Neither Google nor Huawei seems to be taking either responsibility or action to resolve issues such as these. While Google is aware of the problems, having assigned both the shutdown and bootloop issues in its tracker, its official position is that those affected by the issue should reach out to customer support for a replacement device. But customers going directly to Huawei about the fault are also out of luck, as they are being told that the problem is with the software and not the hardware, and thus not an issue covered by the manufacturer's warranty - whether it's still in date or not. This is a very frustrating situation for the consumer when neither company seems willing to investigate properly or hold their hands up. Let us know in the comments if any of you Nexus 6P owners have experienced either issue. We'll report back with any further developments as they come in.

Thankfully our Ombudsman financially bullies the carrier until we get a resolution in Australia. Got a free refurb replacement, hopefully won't suffer the same. Matthew Hanson Mine seems to love to die around 10%. As a few others have stated, the low power notification will appear, I will use it for a few minutes and then it powers off. The battery history shows this steep cliff falloff after beginning the recharging and power on. Melad360 i always saw my 6p shut off as soon as the power saving mode came on at 15% battery. this started to happen after an update, i think 7.0 or 7.1, never happened before that though Latheryin This really is a software issue with what they ship out to nexus devices. It also effects the nexus 6 from Motorola. Seems every nexus device that got 7.x has this issue. Packer Backer Nope, doesn't affect the Nexus 6. Provide some links or just don't comment. Latheryin Sorry not a baby sitter. Why not do some research before you post. Also might want to look at the source code and try to understand what you are talking about before posting. abrasive I myself did start to see this issue after about a year, but the device was easily replaced for another warranty-related issue. I would assume my clock was started over again. Not that I haven't seen the same problem on computers with old batteries, but I would hope to get substantially more mileage out of a battery. Nexus 6p Issues Its about time! There are so many issues with the Google branded phones, it doesn't make any sense. We have already reached out to the firm to provide any support they need in accomplishing their potential goal of this class action lawsuit. Its time someone sticks up for the consumers who have been ripped off by this multi-billion dollar company. In the mean time, please follow us on Twitter and sign our petition at Change.org regarding this very issue. We have a lot of signatures and would appreciate your's and your share as well. Thank you in advance! 3fren I'm seeing so many comments about the battery issue going away with just replacing it. I guess I have to give it try. I'm always cautious when it comes to replacing a OEM battery with a replica though. Doug The early shutdown has been an issue on my Nexus 6P ever since I upgraded to Android 7. This has been a frustrating experience - I cannot trust the phone to not die on me when I need it and find myself constant carrying an external battery pack so I can start my phone back up if it dies. P. Sherman Just get an iPhone. It has SIGNIFICANTLY LESS DEVASTATING defects and actually functional software Quality Control team. thereasoner Lol, iOS is the worst when it comes to software issues and iPhone hardware is junk. No Google devices have yet to suffer the nightmares that were error 53 and Touch Disease much less the related class action lawsuits against Apple because of them! Are you trying to be funny? P. Sherman Yeah, no Android devices have had to deal with Touch Disease or error 53. Instead, they spontaneously combust (Note 7,) bootloop for no reason at all (ALL LG'S,) have glass backs that pop out when exposed to a little heat (Xperia Z2 and Z3,) have nearly unusable Bluetooth connectivity (Pixel, Xperia Z5,) heat so badly you can cook an egg on it (every Android that had a massive update,)... I could go on! I'm simply stating that iOS has historically been significantly less buggy and disastrous than Android when a new update rolls around (Think the disaster that was KitKat to Lollipop. The transition from iOS 6 to 7 was SIGNIFICANTLY less dramatic than that in terms of bugs and drains.) Also, Have an open mind and stop automagically trashing the iPhone. The iPhone may be lacking significantly in some areas, but it has two significant advantages - USABILITY AND LONGEVITY. thereasoner Correct, any serious issues facing Android phones have been a one off affecting only one model out of dozens of different models/manufacturers while both device bricking issues found in recent iPhones in error 53 and touch disease affected a much smaller base of phones and just one manufacturer . All the other minor issues you mentioned, be they real or exaggerated, are also very similar to minor issues various iPhones have faced as well its just that it's even worse for iPhones because there are so few models from one manufacturer(and they're still worse) vs several dozens models from over a dozen different manufacturers. That's how bad iPhones are when they have more serious issues despite producing so few models. Issues with Android phone should dwarf those of iPhones by a huge margin considering how many models /manufacturers are involved but they don't, the iPhones still manage to be worse! It's mind boggling when you think about but that's how bad Apple quality is these days. Jon Puhl My 6P is absolutely absurd. It shuts down as high up as 51%, and almost always when the battery percentage is lower than 30%. I'm really upset about this, because it's Google's last Nexus flagship, and it can't even last a full two years without having this dumb battery problem. Daniel Orchard I got a full refund for my 6p, and bought a pixel xl, was out of pocket a little for the upgrade but device was just out of warranty so im still happy with the outcome. Props to Google store support. Yeah i still l got charged the pixel while waiting for the refund, took about 2 weeks to come through but they organised the return shipping etc just like an rma. Im actually really happy. Mine would shutdown between 15-30% and i only lived with that for 2 weeks before starting the process of fixing it. Yes it happened after moving to 7.0 and yes rolling back to 6.x did not fix it so im convinced its software, nfi why they havent rolled out a fix yet. I suggest doing the same because all replacement n6p are still vulnerable to the bug afaik. Morenicano Just wanna make sure I follow, You saying you had your 6P for more than a year and they authorized a refund? I ask because I just reached them for an exchange but if I can get a refund and upgrade to the Pixel, I'll do it. Morenicano Just a heads up, JUST I contacted Google through the support tab in the settings of my 6P and they warranty replaced both mine and my wife's 6P and we bought them through Project Fi in November 2015 with no extended warranty. They said it's a known issue and setup the replacement with no problem and it has next (business) day shipping for the new one and you send the old one back once you have the new one up and running. They do put a hold for the value of the phone on your card while they wait for the old one to come back but they don't charge you Cory Wilson Crybabies. Seriously, my phone developed the issue last week, contacted Google, now I'm rocking a brand new Nexus 6p. Luckily I happened to be on the last day of my warranty but I also got protect so even if I was out of warranty I wasn't paying another $500 again. Just call Google instead of your lawyers dumb asses Packer Backer Wow, a snowflake playing Internet tough guy. Brandon Andrews I had my Nexus 6P become bricked by the bootloop issue. I bought my phone through Best buy and was still well within my 1 year manufacturer warranty when the problem occurred. Unfortunately when I called Best buy customer service and asked how to take care of the situation they told me to send it to this company called Jeg & Sons to get the problem reviewed and a replacement. Needless to say there was like a month long ordeal of mix ups with this company before they finally sent my phone back and told me they don't deal with my phone. Finally I eventually figured out I needed to send my phone to Huawei and they replaced my phone no problem. Sarah Despars I've never had this issue with my 6p so far. Hopefully it doesn't start! k_nonymous I experience this exact same problem and it drives me nuts. Battery saver mode on my 6P is supposed to be activated at 15% battery. The phone shuts off before it ever gets to that point. Also, 95% battery life is equivalent to 1h 5m???? Packer Backer Well well, according to thereasoner he thinks it's your fault. gparmar76 This is 100% hardware related...If it was the OS, it would be a widespread issue across all Android 7 handsets...Huawei is using cheap batteries... People who like the phone should go buy a replacement from a company like Zero Lemon (if available)..Or just buy another stock battery. Kirkster My Nexus 6P is 11 months old, and so far the only anomaly I've had is that it spontaneously factory-reset while in my pants pocket about two weeks ago, which was annoying. I recovered from the cloud backup, which restored all my apps, settings, etc, and my photos were set to back up to Google photos. I lost my call log and SMS messages though, but luckily most of my messaging is via WhatsApp (which restored everything). Still, annoying. I now have a SMS+call log app installed in case it happens again. No battery problems *yet*, now I'm dreading the one-year mark, after reading all the comments. Chalet_Badger My 6P bootloops, i can get it to start normally when the battery is ~5% or so but it will freeze and start to bootloop about a minute or two after. Duane I've had no issue with my 6p. Sounds like an annoying issue from the comments here. Robert B I've been having this problem for a few months now...I carry external battery around all the time because you never know when it feels like it's going to shut off and not turn back on Packer Backer According to thereasoner, it's your fault. clarence jones My 6p did not have the random shutdown at a certain percent issue before. After the 7.1.2 update it would crash and restart when the camera app was opened. About two days after the update it started boot looping and nothing i have tried has gotten it to successfully boot again. Packer Backer Tell thereasoner because he thinks it's your fault. Spudos Woah I thought this was just me. My ending battery life varies wildly, sometimes dying at 15% and on bad days dying around 40-50%. I would replace the battery myself but the teardown process looks like it requires an electrical engineering degree. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. Maybe you should straighten him out. Đức Thành Maybe Google deserves to be sued. Kyle Zess I am plagued by this issue. My phone shutdown after 5 minutes of non charging use. Packer Backer thereasoner thinks it's your fault. David Vogt Only time mine would shut down early at 30% or less is if I was out in freezing cold weather, phone just didn't like freezing weather, keep it warm and it's fine blueman24 Just admit it that your "quick charge" bs killed the battery early. Truth hurts huh My Nexus 6p 128 was barely a year old and it never recovered from the bootloop issue where it would keep restarting and not getting past the Google screen then restart over and over, losing precious pictures and videos of my children. My sister's Nexus 5 eventually broke from the bootloop issue 3 months later. We both had the $80 warranty but it seemed unfair having to pay for a replacement REFURBISHED Nexus 6p when the damage was caused by bad software. Sucked how although Nexus/Google/Huwei knew of ongoing repeated problems a 6 -9 months earlier, yet FAILED to try to resolve or prevent the recurring boot loop issue from infecting more phones. Finally, a lawsuit is in place. Damani Boyce After 7.1.1 update my Nexus 6p got bootloop an can't be fixed shame on them not even a reply from Google or Huawei. thereasoner Many on here are saying that they had no problem getting it fixed/replaced. Packer Backer Yeah, it's ALL his fault.... Posts like yours make some people dream of twisting your head off. thereasoner Why would you say it's his fault? Smoking one to many fatties?, Lol. Razed Mine currently dies at around 10%. I use it moderately and have had it since launch. Got Nexus Protect, but that seems worthless as all reports are that using that service will just get me an even worse battery. thereasoner My Pixel has been great, I'll have to ask a friend at work about his 6p to see if he's having issues. By the sounds of it only a small percentage of devices are affected. Packer Backer Nexus 6 by Motorola was a better direction. Gordon Mine would shut off at 25% consistently. I called Huawei and they actually replaced the battery for free. I had to pay for shipping 1 way, but the covered the rest. I got my phone December 2015, and it was just replaced this February. ThEGr33k Which country? Gordon Canada Trey Bradshaw I haven't encountered any bootlooping and my phone doesn't shut off unless my battery drops to about 2%. olivrstal happens to my 6p quite a bit as well :( hope it's gonna make it till the pixel 2 comes out :D mrjoeyloke My wife just got the bootloop of death on her 6p. I think that might be a whole different issue though. Kuldeep Choudhary This happens when a gaint company like google hires a Chinese company to manufacture it's top line product. I'm using my motorola nexus 6 for 2.5 years and still not a single problem im facing and decided to keep it for 1 more year. Omar Al Matar Had the problem, I was out of warranty, called them, no frustration or arguments, 5 minutes i had the email to get my new phone, and i sent them the one i had, i was even out of the country. Now I got it to last me another year, so idk about y'all Kristen Oliver This happened with me until I replaced the battery... At my own cost. Funnily enough that is not a software issue 12321 Please click the links below for details of my experience, which is echoed by thousands of other Nexus 6P owners.

Sue them! Merxury My Nexus 6p died, it stuck at bootloop every time when I turn on my phone. Sara Bales I've had the Huawei Nexus 6P since July of 2016, purchased new in the box. It started randomly shutting down within weeks, often multiple times a day. It was annoying and inconvenient, even shutting down once when I was on a 911 call reporting an intruder in the garage (talk about chaos. . . I had to wait for it to reboot and call again). My phone entered the "boot loop of death" the last week of March. The first 6 or so crashes, it rebooted just fine. But then it started getting hung up on the rainbow google animations, until finally it wouldn't even push past the Google screen. I was able to pull up the barcodes but other system reboots were useless. Since my phone is still under warranty, Huawei agreed to repair it but I had to wait 5 days for a label from UPS. It's been almost 3 weeks and I've heard nothing. They also didn't offer to send a loaner phone. At least mine was under warranty, I see on the forum that Google and Huawei have refused to help and neither want to accept responsibility. Ron Nguyen My 6p shutdown prematurely everyday but at different battery percentages. Mostly around 30%, but I have had 40, 50s and 60. Anunnaki A battery replacement fixes the early shutdown problem. Sriidhar sriidhar My 6p died couple of weeks ago and Google and Huawei must be sued for not taking the responsibility, I'm a student and I saved a lot of money to buy the phone but now they're like, it's not our concern as you're out of warranty! Konstigt2 Very good, they should have issued a recall and fixed them all. To not have your phone avail when you need it in case of emergency could be fatal. I have gotten my battery and screen replaced and that fixed it for me. arpit saxena My 6p shutdown few months back, after bootloop and hasn't been turned on since them. Both companies failed to address the situation and to fix the fault Huawei asks for 400$. I don't seem to find any kind of Justice in this area. David Berry All you poor nexus folks hot rolled. High price.shite processor thats had issues in every phone its been put in & sealed in battery copping quick charge for 12months through then the new usbc port then add that to the Chinese manufacturer &issues that causes with returns & you have a massive recipie for disaster. So is your nexus 6p still beter than an s7e or note5or7?Maybe the little fire issue puts it on a par with note 7 just but with that 810 inside it was always doomed from the start. No wonder they canned it for the now overpriced pixel. I think id rather a umi z plus for under half the price. So wheres the samsung haters now? I hate them too but they do make the best phones once you tweak this & that & set it up right. My note5 died after 18 months too. It did cop a real hammering as a wifi hotspot for a while there though. It used to get real hot with a few people connected at once & my bro never let it rest & would run it hot & flat every day. Sometimes 2x a day so it was to be expected. I got 2 note 7s for Sweet f%$ck all & a free s7e from samsung so ill forgive them a little & send back my note5 in the fire proof box & keep the other note 7 as a spare & as compensation for losing all my music &stuff on the note5& the fiasco of the n7recall. Sealed in batteries suck unless you replace your phone every 18months. Boy Ling Mine shuts down at 33% maybe 8 Times out of 10. I never updated to android 7. Mandeep Singh Pannu Mine normally dies off at 30%, then I connected it to charge, it comes back on at 30%.... Also I live up north in the UK, and at early in the morning, if I go out, and it's too cold it just dies randomly theadamsegal Very disappointed with Google. My Nexus 6P started shutting off at around 20% less than a year after I purchased it. The basically pulled an Apple with the release of the Pixel. After purchasing 3 Nexus phones in 4 years, I won't be buying a Google handset again. Ashwini Kumar Same issue here. Phone dies suddenly at 10-15% without any warnings. I love the phone but battery is pathetic. I barely get 10 hours on light usage. I hate apple but the 6s plus from work would be at 50% battery at the end of the day. First google deserted the nexus brand and then not honouring the issue. Disappointed! Sean Stone I'm currently replying from my just received RMA replacement for the boot loop issue. My warranty was technically up in November but the Google Tech Support hooked me up anyway. Better outcome than I was expecting. Thomas Boel Mine shut's down at round about 20%, but only when the screen is turned on! The warning comes and immediately it starts shutting down. Maggie Smith I don't get any warning. It just reboots at random. I wish I did get a warning. David Schleifstein Shuts down at 15% for me, closer to 30% for my wife's. I also noticed that a short time in colder temperatures can cause the battery to drop dead at 50% and up. Ger PG How is this affecting users? David McFee Same issue. Daily premature shutdown. So annoying. Jon Watts Get a grip people. It's just a phone. If it doesn't work just get a new one. I've had the 6P since its release in 2015. Yes I've had a few issues but nothing that didn't eventually get fixed. Dirge Yeah, all those thousands of people that suffer from this problem better just get a grip. So Google sold a defective product, so what? Go buy another one. Duh. "I'm not having any problems therefore these people need to get their shit together." *Rolls eye's* Drew Harden https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/fff14c9ec4b9b4966ae37554f13b373d9bfa270aa644c3e5ef01a5fca3723410.png Mine usually shuts down when the phone is pretty cold and then I turn the screen on and then it just dies. In the warmer weather it still dies with 15% every time though. If I start a Snapchat video below 20% it's instantly off. Dan Molina I haven't had a shut down at 60% but I get it at 25% pretty consistently. Bootloop is rare too; however, I do get random restarts usually while on a phone call. Danny Mestriner Good, maybe they will finally get off their lazy asses and treat us like actual customers. I also have the shutdown issue since Nougat. Philip Quach I've had the same issue even after factory reset. It's especially bad when the temperature outside is cold. I'm really disappointed with Huawei and Google about this. Artūras Rimonis Having the same issue. It always shuts down at 15% or even more. Cara Buttitta sometimes mine dies at 20% sometimes at 60%. just today my 6p was at 90%, I took one picture without the flash and it shut down. very frustrating David Perez Yes, it's been an issue since nougat, from what I recall. Both Nexus 6p devices I have suffered from increased battery drain, and sudden shutdown anywhere from 15 to 25%. Google points to Huawei, Huawei points to Google. I downgraded one device back to marshmallow. Battery drain is still pronounced, but at least no shutdown. I get my warning at 15% and can run until the single digits. John Adams Will die between 20-35% every time, also randomly restarts at around 50%. This phone has been plagued with bugs since release... Jordan Hindley https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/0aef98131463828edbc4ecec53b90938738636b0a4ab26649126e2b51247d48d.png My device shuts down at lots of different battery percentages and won't reboot until i attach to a power source. It's a nightmare. MeanBeans I get that all the time as well even after I changed the battery Mike I Easy. Have Google make their own phones. Call them, oh, Pixel? I'm writing this on my lg5x with 7.1.2. Very happy with it, but will take 200 off coupon on the LG g6 against any and all future 5x claims. Seiga Is it safe to say I should utilize my Nexus protect? I too am suffering from this issue. CJ Nexus 6p start shutting down with 1 to 2 times a day, which increase to more than 10 times within 3 month..huwaei and Google blaming each other for issues..phone is under warranty, but can't do anything.. Miresnare Love my 6p. Never had an issue with it apart from the slo-mo on the camera. Wonderful device. Rob Paek My 6P shut off abruptly right after it gave me the 15% warning the other day. Other than that it has been freezing lately and forcing me to reboot. lance colton Suing is great and all, but every AMERICAN class action lawsuit does absolutely nothing for those of us that aren't in the USA. All the times Nvidia and Sony got sued for stuff they sold me that didn't work as advertised, I'm entitled to NOTHING. This phone is such garbage. Just got it back from the bootloop repair, and the battery starts dying at 20% left. Then 40%. Yesterday, 60%. WTF. I don't think it's Google's fault, though. They would have fixed the software if they can by now. More like Huawei built this thing out of garbage, so it actually needs to be replaced after a year. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/776a4957bbcf9a86578fe290eba3107f160fabf3d0d520adb81993f61d67cca0.png You wouldn't believe the trouble I had getting this thing in for repairs either. I bought it from my carrier so I can't deal with Google or Huawei. They do troubleshooting but for warranty I have to deal with 'Freedom mobile'. I have to go into a certain shopping mall and go to a specific kiosk that is a designated repair center. They refused to honor the terms of the warranty, specifically that the original bootloop repair gives me 90 days more warranty. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/735c6d189c2684ae884f4c97c0d443766058dfa8c7119577c26c17b6da30b031.png Even the Huawei website says it's under warranty for a few more days. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/63182bf80270d912f90486d64178eff22d06e6ef98c0bbc1b1c6fcad3b6f4c62.png I had to give up at the kiosk, go to my car, and phone 611. Talked to an idiot that wastes my time with irrelevant troubleshooting, then she tries to tell me the warranty is expired too. Ask for a supervisor. Same story, but she speaks better English. I argue with her that they need to honor the terms on their website, but she says I'm not understanding them. I refuse to give up, she finally places me on hold for 5 min, comes back, admits I'm correct. I still have 3 days warranty according to her now. She puts a note on the account, then I go back to the kiosk, tell the guy there to read the note and finally he calls his manager, and figures out how to process the claim. If they didn't glue the stupid thing together, I'd replace the battery myself. They choose to make it un-repairable, they can fix it. Cindy Up until the April 2017 update, I was experiencing this same issue. My Nexus 6P would die with as much as 23% battery life left. oscar acevedo Oh that explains why my phone unexpectedly shuts down from time to time. Nexus 6P v7.1.2 blenderboy People still buy google devices like Pixel. Consumers vote with their money. The moment you buy a device you are promoting the brand. I don't think there will be any outcome for this lawsuit. This is just a publicity stunt. Samsung hardware is great, software is shit. Google software is ok but hardware partners do not work properly with Google(initial supply, firmware updates, warranty replacements). I am waiting for Pixel(maybe in 2 yrs) after seeing how current Pixel owners are treated by Google. Apple hardware is great, software works as expected. I use Linux at home and without itunes it is difficult to use a iPhone. So only option for me is Android. Charles Jordan I have the Nexus 6P a lotnd I have no issues and it's all updated. ThEGr33k Sent mi e of for RMA in the UK they did a "software update" to android 7 and sent it back. Safe to say the early shutdown and terrible battery life is still here... Have sent an email asking for the battery to be replaced so see what i hear back... Felipe I had my 6P fallen into the bootloop problem, I was given a replacement as Huawei honored its 15 months warranty (even though the documentation everywhere says it has 12 months factory warranty, it in fact has 15 months, with Huawei, but NOT with Google, shame Google!). Now, I'm about to get this replacement unit and pray, really pray hard that nothing new appears with this phone. Even tough there are now reports of replaced phones crashing again into the bootloop bug and, recently that Android 7.1.2 final, screwed the fingerprint sensor. Many are not liking the way Google+Huawei (yes, both) is handling this crisis, which in fact is a major one. I think customers who spent lots of hard earned money should get a quality device which keeps on working well, even after its warranty period expired and, wheren there is a well known massive problem, the manufacturer(s) Hardware+Software should honor fixes or reimburses, despite the fact that there are now the Pixels phones. If my replacement phone fails, I'd be more than willing to participate in a class action suit. Jacob Kraniak I thought I was going crazy when I noticed my 6P constantly rebooting on it's own. At least now I know I'm not alone with htis issue. Hopefully they give us something back in return. Maybe a replacement? Hell, I'd rather just return it at this point and use whatever credit they give me towards a Pixel or OP3T. that's not to say I haven't loved the 6P of course. Alexander Dumo Ive had this issue since updating my 6P sometime this past December. We shouldn't have to live with charging our phone before it hits approx 15%-20% battery life. When that warning pops up, the phone just shuts down. Make no sense...please fix this Huawei/Google! Charles Constantine I reported shutdowns at battery levels of 20-60 percentage remaining and was given a list of things to do including a "factory reset" and then told to report back by Google Project fi support. ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 141k 106k Latest Deals 14 [Deal Alert] Get a 75" Sony LED UHD Android TV from Best Buy for $2150 today ($650 off) 2017/04/15 4:13pm PDTApr 15, 2017 19 [Deal Alert] Huawei Watch in Black Stainless Steel w/metal band $250 ($100 off) 2017/04/14 6:36pm PDTApr 14, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] 55 temporarily free and on-sale apps to round out your week 2017/04/14 12:50pm PDTApr 14, 2017 13 [Deal Alert] 2-Pack 6' Anker USB 3.0 A to C cables $12 w/ promo ($8 off) 2017/04/13 4:16pm PDTApr 13, 2017 32 [Deal Alert] NVIDIA is having a SHIELD gaming spring sale 2017/04/13 2:17pm PDTApr 13, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?

You may have noticed the below ad being shared on social media or been one of the (un)lucky few to see it on TV and be (un)fortunate enough to have a Google Home or other virtual assistant that it activated. The Verge puts that audience at a very small one indeed. While Burger King clearly conceived of the ad as a media stunt (unknown whether they anticipated the Wikipedia editing that cast the Whopper in negative light), it portends a future showdown between brands, advertising agencies, consumers and virtual assist device and operating system developers.  The ad's effectiveness was short-lived, Google tweaked its operating system to shut down the request. But this will be an arm's race.  Advertisements currently rely on data intake from a complex, but fallible operating system - the human brain. The advertisers judge success by how well that same "computer" - the one that routinely forgets names and birthdays and where the keys are - recalls the ad.  Virtual and home assistants are the evolution for which advertisers have been waiting a long time. It can enable advertisements to rely on a smarter system to push their message further down the funnel. Imagine an ad that can purchase tickets or supplies directly for you. Or put a sale on your calendar. The possibilities are endless.  Also endless will the fighting: you, the consumer, and the Googles of the world will not want their products hijacked for marketing messages. Brands obviously do not want to annoy you to the point that you end up hating them, but they also don't mind a bit of disruption. Google and Amazon (and others sure to follow) know that their current products are still "beta" and do not want the consumers that are still wary of usability and security to find a simple reason to not use their products.  At some point in time, there will likely be a middle ground where ads like this are opt-in and useful, but prepare for a lot of moving fast and breaking things before we get there.  Previous Post Influencer Marketing is Creeping into Alexa Similar Articles The marketer's guide to the windfalls and pitfalls of the Internet of Things Burger King goes mobile to drive traffic Burger King taps NASCAR driver for multichannel push Burger King trolls McDonald's with a well timed tweet Burger King Uses Web, TV, DRTV, Posters for New BK Stacker Sandwich Next Article in Digital Marketing One on One: Ric Elert and the Person-Centric Approach Sign up to our newsletters Best of...

Some Pixel and Nexus fingerprint sensors not working after Android 7.1.2 update Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 12:17pm PDTApr 14, 2017 65 Plus 1 on G+ 79 Share on Facebook 73 Share on Twitter Total Shares217 Bug Watch Device Updates News Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel XL A number of Google Pixel and Nexus users are reporting that their fingerprint sensor is no longer working after the latest Android OS update. Several members of the Pixel and Nexus communities on Google's product forums have encountered the issue since installing the Android Nougat 7.1.2 OTA. The issue appears to be affecting both the Pixel and Pixel XL, as well as the LG-made Nexus 5X and Huawei Nexus 6P. Reports suggest that while the Pixel and Nexus Imprint sensors are no longer granting access to the devices, the swipe down for notifications Moves gesture is still functional. Attempts to solve the problem by deleting pre-existing fingerprints and starting from scratch haven't worked, as error messages are preventing new prints from being added to the devices. As usual, we'll update if we hear any official word from Google about the issue, hopefully regarding a fix.

Good_Ole_Pinocchio 6p has never given me those issues either... But it is slower than most newer scanners. Nick Which is to be expected. It's still fine. Jeff Neston By stating no problems, expect to get boot loop on your nexus 6. See the CNET article on nexus 5 and 6. Provided Google does not get the article defeated. If you do get it expect to lose all unsaved data. Then if want refund you will need to go to court. Sean Please GO AWAY....you have said this TWICE.......Its NOT the Nexus 5 and 6 Mr Brainiac....its the 5X and 6P......which are TOTALLY different than the Nexus 5 and Nexus 6. Max Same here with my XL. elav Me too. No issues on my XL.. Nicholas Matranga My Nexus 5x works just fine after the update. kalehv Sometimes my Pixel XL asks for pattern even after it recognizes my fingerprint (no, I am not talking about the first time after reboot). Rebooting the device works but why does this happen? Nathan Bryant I've also experienced this. It's random. Not so often it's a bother for me. kalehv Yup not so often with me either but being a mobile developer what bothers me is this happening, not the inconvenience it causes. Nathan Bryant That totally makes sense. I assume it's some kind of error even though it's not stating that it is. I don't see the pattern or constant of what causes it when it happens. mattcoz It does that after more than 48 hours have passed since you've last used your pattern. kalehv Nop its not that either. It does that after 4 hours I think. And it should do that only once after 4 hours but not keep doing that until you reboot. mattcoz It's definitely 48 hours, that comes straight from Google. But if it continues to do so, then that's something else. Mgamerz I've had it happen on my Nexus, it just occasionally requires a PIN. Says it's 4 hours of non usage but that doesn't seem true, sometimes I wake up and no pin and sometimes I'll be on and off the phone and it'll require a pin. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Typical. Google needs to fire some of their geniuses and hire some diligent coders, and also diligent testers for their QA department (assuming they even have one -- I sincerely doubt it). Alex Cruz Where did Google touch you? Middlefinger Oh really. Nexus/Pixel/Google error 4.453.563 this year alone. Im shocked (not really). Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Best hot steaming pile of dog s**t 2016. DragoCubed Google has been going downhill lately - at least with mobile excluding iOS. It's such a shame. They haven't exactly gone downhill haven't they? They've stayed the same SpeakethTheTruth I think you might be on to something with that last paragraph. Cause for real, quality control is out of control right now. sebastianer If fixed my 6P bad battery life and early shutdown only replacing the stock Huawei battery with other battery with different brand (no need to wipe the phone in the process...) Several people did the same and is enjoying the battery life they were having when they bought the phone more than a year ago: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3534410 You could even try a Huawei battery replacement...but they say they aren't original. I just went for another brand because of the bad experience I had with the stock battery durability I don't know in the Pixel. But in the 6P in 90% of the cases...this is just a problem of the Huawei stock battery. Kendall Gustafson “Pixel”, the word sounds like the color pink. “Pixel” sounds like a little girl’s toy. Most men would never put a phone in their pocket named “Pixel” unless they were a cross/dresser. The word “Pixel” equates to a 50% loss of market share from the male market. “Nexus”, the word does not sound female or male. “Nexus”, the word sounds like science, desirable to any man, woman, or child. “Nexus”, the word sound like domination of market share. kalehv Hahaha that made me laugh. No I do not agree. I am a Pixel owner man and I am not whatever you said they'd be if they owned one but I laughed for some reason. Christian Trevor Clauss I must be a cross dresser then :D mattcoz Real men aren't insecure about what their phones are named.

No need to test or anything. Too much trouble for the geniuses at Google. They're so smart that if it compiles with just warnings, there couldn't possibly be any problems. John Doe I am sure that they do test it but there are things that go wrong...obviously those bugs will be in the spotlight on an Android blog meaning in real life they are probably affecting a small number of users.

It blows my mind been on 7.1.2 sense the factory imgs dropped Sean Same for me.....my Pixel XL hasnt had a single reported issue so far......... Donovan Goodwin Using mine actually causes phone to restart. Updating to 7.1.2 caused this and it even happens on ROMs. JG W00t! For once I don't suffer from Atrem's Luck... My 5X still lets me in with my fingerprint :) Doomberg I updated just last night. Glad I didn't get hit with this issue. nickarli 6P - had 4 fingers registered, right index stopped working after the update but other 3 still fully functional. I thought it was the massive amount of Utah dust in my fingers all of a sudden, but I guess not Defenestratus There's that vaunted Google QA again. This is how you get more Samsung. New_Guy Yep Mark Curtis What do you mean "this is how you get more Samsung"? 4Ui812 Why is Google having app many issues with the Fixel ? Sruly J Except since it's also affecting Nexus devices, this is more of a software issue in 7.1.2 than a hardware issue for Pixel devices. Defenestratus Because IIRC they use Agile software development. Agile is how you get shitty software. Lawstorant I've never thought I would say such thing, but I'm getting fed up with all the "issues" Google is facing with every update. On the Nexus 6, they went as far as to roll it back to 7.0. They should really step up their game especially if, they are fully responsible for every aspect of the device from now on. EvilHowl No issues on my 5X wade_county I thought these Pixels weren't supposed to be beta products? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They aren't. They're outrageously expensive alpha products. And they even have one defect (halo-cam) that can't be fixed in software. Still the best steaming pile of dog s**t of 2016, though. Everyone should buy one. Everyone who likes dog s**t anyway. Apparently people do, since HTC has shipped 2 million since launch. Kougeru I bad a Pixel for a week and took dozens of photos with no halo Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good for you. Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of 22 Pixel pictures had halos. None of the 22 G6 pictures had halos. They were all pictures of the same things, obviously with the same lighting. Google admits it's a design defect. If Google admits it, it's kind of hard to pretend it doesn't exist. whispy_snippet No one denies it's an issue. But what you seem incapable of accepting is it's a very minor issue that only very rarely rears its head. If you actively try to shoot an image with a strong light source angled towards the sensor (something you generally don't do because it often results in a poor shot on any camera) you might experience a halo effect. Might. But I've got literally hundreds of photos taken with my Pixel with no halos. You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want to fuel your juvenile rage fits. But people who actually use a Pixel every day don't seem to have a problem worth caring about. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It has nothing to do with a strong light source angled toward the sensor. That's normal lens flare. The Pixel halos are NOT normal lens flare. Like I said 4 out of 22 pictures. That's 18% of the pictures they took, and they didn't have strong light sources angled toward the sensor. 18% is not a rare problem, especially when the G6 NEVER had halos with the same exact pictures. Google admitted it's a flaw. Get over yourself and stop trying to justify it. whispy_snippet And like I said, I've taken hundreds of pictures and have seen a halo perhaps a couple of times. And I take a lot of photos given video and photography is my day job - indeed one of the reasons I chose the Pixel is because I wanted the best phone camera available for the times I don't have my proper gear with me. I've seen countless comparisons between the Pixel, iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 edge and while they're all great, in most situations the Pixel takes what I consider the better shot. You're making mountains out of molehills and carrying on like a right twat in the process. P. Sherman ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE DOESN'T MEAN JACKS--- if in scientific tests under controlled environments and the same conditions, the Pixel produced the halo effect, which Google has acknowledged to be a design deficiency standard on LITERALLY EVERY PIXEL MADE, but other cameras feature no such halo effect. FFS whispy_snippet I'm not denying there's an issue! I'm saying it's being blown out of proportion by people who want to blow it out of proportion. P. Sherman Referencing a scientific, controlled test and camera comparison is NOT blowing this out of proportion. Blowing out of proportion would be something how the Wall Street Journal set out to destroy PewDiePie for boneheadedly saying "Death to all Jews" as a joke. But referencing a camera comparison in exactly the same conditions and one phone had a halo effect but the other didn't is science, fact, nothing to blow out of proportion there. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good luck arguing with a Google fanboy in deep denial. thereasoner He's actually making solid points, the Pixels do have the best cameras overall​ and all smartphone cameras have some issues. whispy_snippet No, no. I'm a fanboy! Get it right! Cecil Hardwood Are you sure the Pixel has the best camera ? The reason I ask is because the DxOMark site that claims this refuses to release the iPhone 7 Plus (Not iPhone 7) scores and many believe it is because it scored higher than the Pixel. The theory goes on to say that Google is using their score in their advertising and DxO doesn't want to piss off Google. Something weird is going on for sure. DxO claimed long ago the review was coming soon and should have been out by now with the iPhone 7 Plus having been on the market as long as it has. thereasoner If I'm to make a judgment personally then I would say that probably the top 3-4 cameras on flagships are very close and what's best as far as the user is concerned is subjective. Do you prefer low light performance(I do) or digital zoom? Do your favour widespread angle lens or fast launch/focus etc. Those are personal preferences that make "the best " phone different for different people. That said, as far as reviews are concerned the Pixel is generally considered the best over all. As far as your conspiracy theories go, who knows? Anyone can create those about anything but I guess but I'm thinking that other than digital zoom and an artsy photo effect the 7+ cameras are very similar to the 7. whispy_snippet The iPhone 7 Plus is the same as the iPhone 7 apart from an additional, slower lens. In terms of raw image quality the iPhone 7 Plus achieves its best results with the lens it shares with its smaller sibling. So basically, it'll score no better than the 7. It's effectively already been tested. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All smartphone cameras have some issues? What issues does the G6 camera have in the comparison I linked? 23% of the Pixel photos have halo issues. Find a serious issue with 23% of the G6 photos and get back to us. thereasoner Keep in mind that if you take wide-angle shots, angles will be distorted and elongated from the side, especially when it comes to selfies with the front-facing camera. I also found that the front-facing camera takes relatively muddy shots in low-light. Compared to the Pixel XL, OnePlus 3T and (for the time being since we don't have the S8) the Galaxy S7, the G6 is on par with its rivals. The Pixel XL takes superior low-light images than all the phones though, and I prefer the richer contrast and saturation of the S7 by just a tad. -CNET There are a ton of reviews from various sources just like this and while the G6 cameras are considered very nice they do have their shortcomings and generally rank below the Pixel cameras overall. whispy_snippet Purple flaring and chromatic aberation. It's extremely noticeable in at least four images you shared with the Pixel comparison. Here you are: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration And just Google search purple flaring. Sorry to burst your bubble. whispy_snippet Show me the link to the test. I would like to see it. Even if their results suggest there's an issue (which there is as we all agree), the significance of the results can still be blown out of proportion which is what we're seeing occur in this ridiculous discussion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Here you go again. phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ Now that I've viewed the pics again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. Two involve a bright light. The other 3 do not. So that's 23% of 22 pictures. I wouldn't say that's blowing things out of proportion. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. Yeah, you paid a lot for your Pixel, so you have a hard time admitting it's a steaming pile of dog s**t. I understand. whispy_snippet Yep, so as we've agreed, halos sometimes appear in shots with strong light sources pointing at or angled towards the edge of the sensor. But let's just ignore the purple flaring and chromatic aberation in at least four of the images from the LG, right? You're demonstrating selective criticism. Every camera has strengths and weaknesses but on balance, the Pixel offers better images than competing phones more often than not. My position is unchanged. You're both making mountains out of molehills, and in no way does this "scientific" test guarantee that 23% of photos taken with a Pixel will exhibit a halo. It simply shows 23% of photos taken in this example demonstrated halos. You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. No one ever said the Pixel is perfect. But only you two are using ridiculous, extreme labels like "steaming pile of dog shit" and "HARDWARE DEFICIENCY" as though using capital letters makes your odd ball assertions more valid. Most reputable tech reviewers agree the Pixel has the best overall smartphone camera. You're entitled to disagree. P. Sherman 4/22. 4/22 photos from the Pixel have a halo effect. That's from Phandroid. That's 18% of photos the Pixel. That alone is damning. Google themselves have acknowledged that it is a HARDWARE DEFICIENCY and software fixes have done little to address this. They admitted it was there, that's all we need. If you knew that 4/22 Burritos Chipotle made would give you the Runs, but ZERO/22 Burritos Taco Bell made would, would YOU still choose to eat at Chipotle? whispy_snippet Show me the test! I've asked twice now. P. Sherman Lena Flare was removed from the photos, but not the video. http://highonandroid.com/android-smartphone-news/the-truth-about-google-pixel-camera-halolens-flare-effect/ Also, someone in the official Google forums shot with their Pixel and Nexus 6P in the same Time, conditions, everything. Guess what? https://support.google.com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsrROqMaXHqHg/?hl=by Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ 3 halos are obvious, 1 is subtle. The subtle one is where the picture is looking up at a building's windows. Now that I've viewed them again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. tigerstown I paid $380 for my new pixel XL so it's not a lot and I have no Halo in my pics I have proven this on Twitter already. abc More fanboy logic. I took pictures so everything is fine. Anyone who says its not fine is crazy. whispy_snippet How ridiculous. So a blogger takes 22 photos in various conditions and his experience is valid, but my experience of owning the phone and taking hundreds of photos in various conditions is not valid. You guys are weirdos. Andy But do you see problems with low light pics. I do on my wife's pixel. IPhone Looks so much better. I'm so disappointed abc I saw a rainbow once. Oh, are we not just conveying pointless ancedotes? mr.fozzo On my Nex6P, I have noticed that the Fingerprint reader has been less reliable lately. It requires more presses than the usual 1 press. Besnik Rrustemi My Nexus 6P working excellent so far, no battery problems, no fingerprint problems (better standby times on 7.1.2 to be honest). But yes,i can agree that fingerprint was much faster when i first got the device on 6.0 Marshmallow (for unlocking the device with the fingerprint) now it takes like 2 full seconds for that :( jimv1983 No issues on my Nexus 5X and the swipe on the sensor to bring down the notification panel is great. Alex Harrison Flashed the OTA myself on my 5X. No issues with it. Jeff Neston At least it is just the sensor. My nexus 5 was bricked by a Google update.. it got the boot loop. Google support lied to me claiming I broke the power button. False it was not broken. I ended up going small claims case against Google. They settled, but wanted me to sign gag order. Sorry, no way. I sent it back and got complete refund. Sneaky company. What probably causes boot loop update to occur is phone on long time. Some apps get memory leak over time. System then unpredictably unstable. Then the system does auto uplate from Google without asking user NOR even rebooting or turning off prior to the update. Then during update, Os gets corrupted. Then after failed update phone reboots thinking the. Update completed. Now phones dead. And Google not bother to address the issue. Pdiddy187 My 5x fingerprint sensor was great until it bootlooped yesterday morning. LG is going to repair it under warranty even though it's well out of warranty. La Kiesha Rodriguez Barrientes I have the ZTE axon 7 and over a month now google hasn't addressed a fix for the play store not loading apps over data or Wi-Fi.. Without uninstalling updates to play store and then maybe will not say "waiting for network" so frustrating and then maybe download once and have to do that everytime.. Dumb.. P. Sherman That's been like that since KitKat. F------ KITKAT. ahnafm Is google reacommodating their customers now? Brett Delia I thought some positive feedback was worth being added. My Nexus 6P is working perfectly after the update. I've had generally a great experience with all my Android phones. I've had an iPhone as well as a Windows mobile phone as well in my past. None have been as feature packed as my Android devices. New_Guy This and all the other ridiculous issues with the Pixel is a big reason I stick with Samsung... flyonthewall Lol Fernando S Mine is working ok in my Nexus 5x running 7.1.2. It just failed once while I was on 7.1.1 and with a soft reset it came back to life Hank Is that a real screenshot in the story? Enrollment spelled wrong twice. SMH. ThisGuyFUX This is now icing on top of the cake, for anyone whom has enjoyed watching this crash and burn. If I paid $850+ for a Pixel, I'd be pursuing class action litigation by now. Slow clap. Sean Except its only affecting about 1% of the Pixels sold.........so......slow clap for you....... 2kool4skool It's gonna be sucks when you're in the 1%. And I doubt it's 1% anyway, this is probably the 20th article I've read about pixel's problems. That's alot. Probably more like 5%. abc Fortunately, not many Pixels have been sold so not many people are affected. Brian White Nexus 5x, running fine here ddevito If it wasn't for my OnePlus 3 I'd be on an iPhone. thereasoner One plus has their own issues/lousy support and the iPhone? They're the worst of them all when it comes to buggy software and hardware issues bricking devices ! ddevito Not sure I'd agree with you. My iPhone 6s hums along swimmingly without any issues. The more I use it the more I am leaning towards going back to an iPhone full-time. Apple, love them or hate them, knows how to deliver products, and support them. Period. thereasoner I'm glad that your iPhone 6s isn't affected by the many flawed updates and hardware issues​ that have plagued various iPhones over the years but the fact remains that Apple has faced class action lawsuits filed by their own customers for serious issues like Touch Disease and error 53 and for good reason. They have the worst track record of them all and to make things worse they're known for both ignoring iPhone issues until said class action lawsuits are launched and/or blaming their customers for the iPhone hardware/software problems. BTW, my Pixel "hums along swimmingly" as well, that doesn't mean issues with the Pixel don't exist much less those far more serious issues found on iPhones ! MisterKraky I'm not having the fingerprint sensor issue myself, but after updating to 7.1.2, I can no longer install or update any apps! On a Verizon-issued Pixel here. Đức Thành What happened to all the testing, Google? It seems they have become too reliant on using Nexus users for beta-testing and now can't seem to do a proper job on their own. Get your grips together, Android team. Rob H. Nougat is such a half baked disaster of an OS. It's ruined my N6. Marshmallow was soon much more stable.

On a day to day basis, your phone is subjected to all types of abrasive materials, hard surfaces, accidental spills, random things in your pocket/bag etc. It is for this very reason that I simply must have a case on my device at all times. Let’s look at phone protection from another perspective: When you purchase a device, it is an important investment. This phone will at some point or another be sold, given to a family member, or no longer used after a period of time. If you’re like me and tend to go through many devices, then you want to keep them as pristine as possible. I generally sell my devices when I’m done using them, otherwise I would accumulate a ton of them and spend more on new ones. Phones that are kept in better condition will always sell for more money, effectively saving you from paying as much for your next device. If you’ve read any of my many reviews that have been posted over the years on XDA, you certainly know how much I enjoy phone cases. I tend to go through a variety of styles, companies, and protection levels just to find the perfect ones. I work in the energy sector, which is probably the worst field if you want to keep your devices in good condition. I routinely go out to field locations during less than ideal weather, with tons of dirt, chemicals, and other things that could be my phone's worst nightmare. When I’m not out in the field, I don’t want to carry around a gigantic brick of a case. I usually aim to have something a little more practical for the office. Speck Presidio Grip Only one company can pack style, protection, and grip into a streamlined case that doesn't make compromises. Speck crafted this handsome case out of their proprietary IMPACTIUMTM and some type of plastic for the rear shell. Verizon and Speck sell the case for $39.99 which is on the higher end for most cases in this category. You may be able to get it cheaper on Amazon, however (5" Pixel version here). The Good Design Excellent protection in a slim package. Grips Nothing beats the excellent grip, and unique styling it gives to the Presidio. The Not So Good Color Only one color option for the Pixel XL. Price Speck is charging a premium for their case. Speck is one of the many well-known case manufacturers and tends to be popular. Their cases offer great protection and grip, all inside a smaller profile than something like an Otterbox. I was excited to see Speck give Google’s Pixel/Pixel XL the special treatment by offering up a few varieties of their great cases. Recently, Speck completely redesigned their flagship Candyshell case line, and rebranded it as the Presidio. The new Presidio line offers all of the same great things you’d expect from the Candyshell with a matte finish, better resistance to scratches, thinner profile, and more cohesive colors. There’s just something about having a matte finish that really looks great. I have a Quite black Pixel XL (I’ll use the word Pixel interchangeably for my Pixel XL) and the black Presidio Grip seamlessly combines to give you a fantastic looking setup. Each cutout on the case looks precise, isn’t oversized, and really makes you feel like it is a tailored suit for your phone. Accessing Google’s new fingerprint scanner is even easier when using this case because of the seamless bevel around the cutout. The stock USB A-C, and C-C cables fit perfectly, as do all of my aftermarket ones from Tronsmart, Choetech, i-Orange, and other companies. You can press each button and still be greeted by that satisfying tactile ‘click’ that makes you forget the phone is even inside a case. When it comes to drop protection, Speck historically has fared well and lived up to the 10’ drop test claim on their website. I’ve personally dropped my Nexus 6P using the older Candyshell Grip from close to that height without it hurting my phone whatsoever. The case will show some damage without it translating to your phone. I also use a Candyshell Grip with my work iPhone 6 instead of the provided Otterbox Commuter for personal reasons. Since it is a work phone, I try to keep it in good shape, although it has seen a few falls in the office and out in the field. Another great mention is the new lifetime warranty that covers workmanship and materials under normal use. Now, I know some people will ask what exactly do the seemingly vague statements cover; I will give you an example of a warranty-covered issue I experienced with my S7 Edge Candyshell Grip. The S7 Edge was already an odd phone due to the dual edge display. This presented problems for case companies because it meant making the edges thinner to accommodate the phone. I had my Speck case crack right under the volume rockers from removing it multiple times. I contacted Speck, sent them a picture, copy of my receipt, and they replaced it without a hassle. I was allowed to keep the old broken one even though I had no use for it. To date, I have not found a better case for my Google Pixel XL despite a plethora of them being currently available. (Note: The smaller dedicated cutout that houses the laser, and microphone can accumulate dust. Some people mentioned this causing auto focus issues due to the sensor being covered by dirt/lint/dust. Since the area is harder to clean, you may need to use compressed 'canned air' or remove the phone and wipe off that area periodically). Otterbox Defender Otterbox offers a more industrial themed case that combines function, and protection without considering looks. The case usually sells for $59.99 direct from Otterbox's website, or other retailers including Verizon. Amazon does sell the Pixel Defender (5" version here), but you may have a limited choice of colors for the XL. The Good Holster This addition really makes carrying the phone a lot easier on top of adding more protection. Ports Port covers help add protection to an otherwise ignored area by most companies. The Not So Good Size Let's be honest with ourselves, the sheer size of the Defender makes it almost unwieldy. Weight Make no mistake on top of the case being the size of a brick, it also weighs about as much. If you ask anyone what they think the best rugged phone case is they will tell you to get a Otterbox, more specifically their Defender. This marks the first time that Otterbox (the company that also owns Lifeproof) has made a case for a Google device. Like Speck, Otterbox is very selective when it comes to the companies they partner with for cases. Otterbox prides themselves on their Defender series, the tests they subject it to, and their unique drop standard. From the consumer perspective, you cannot compare their standard to the relatively loose Mil-STD 810G without conducting it yourself. When I was active duty in the Marine Corps, most people I knew used an Otterbox. I always asked people why they bothered when it just adds bulk. The response was “it’s better” or “I need a heavy duty case." Both of these ‘requirements’ can be easily met by many other cases on the market. I always used a Speck case, even during my deployment back in 2010-2011; I have never broken a phone’s screen, or a phone while using a case. There haven’t been a whole lot of changes in their flagship brick case, or their Defender series. The case is still oversized almost to a comedic point, and features one of the most frustrating systems to install on your phone. I was very hesitant when I first saw their Pixel XL cases because I don’t need that much bulk, and what trivial extra protection it might give you. When you look at their Defender case it’s hard to imagine why they wouldn’t just use a similar methodology to Speck or Tech 21 with a thin, very protective case. I bought this for work, primarily for when I’m out in the field, yet I don't see the point. Otterbox does have a few things going in their favor that most others don’t offer. Otterbox uses port covers on their Defender case so you can protect the ‘ugly’ Pixel/Pixel XL from getting dirt in it. For the record, I like the design of Google’s Pixel line; it takes a while to adjust to, but it’s a unique-looking design on the backside. I was pleasantly surprised when I pressed the buttons on my Otterbox case and was greeted with a tactile ‘click.’ I had a less pleasant experience using Otterbox's cases with my S7 Edge where the buttons felt like trying to use a rusty typewriter. Most cables should work with the case (headphones too) unless you’re using some beastly audiophile aux cable or 0 gauge USB-C cable. Outside, you will find the soft feeling rubber/TPU material that seems to resist oils and marks well. I can’t say the same for the plastic parts. Using the fingerprint scanner is sort of easier due to the long ramp that guides your index finger into place. As with all things on this case, the bevel around the sensor is complete overkill, sticking with the company's industrial design. There is some great attention to detail on the inner plastic shell where Otterbox put a thin (almost foam feeling) liner that helps distribute the shock from a drop over your phone. A built-in screen protector is a very polarizing feature on this case; I personally have a few choice words for it. I removed mine in favor of the glass screen protector currently on my Pixel, since you cannot use both. If you decide to use the built-in screen protector, know that it scratches very fast, has an affinity for oils/dirt, and doesn’t like to wipe clean. I experienced no issues fitting the case using my glass screen protector. A lot of cases lately have such tight tolerances that you can’t even use a vinyl skin, like the ones dbrand sells. Lastly, one of my favorite things about this case is the included belt clip that also protects your screen (when in the clip). More often than not, you’re going to want to carry the Pixel in the provided belt clip as it might get mistaken for a brick if you work in construction. Most belts should work with the clip from what I can tell. I measured it at ~1.75in, so I would recommend a belt that is 1.5in at the most. I haven’t decided the fate of my Otterbox Defender yet; it might get used a lot, or just collect dust on my desk until I feel a need for it. Spigen Rugged Armor The Rugged Armor case from Spigen has become a staple in their product line by offering drop protection, unique styling, at an affordable price. Spigen always sells their cases on their website and eBay store, but it can also be found for $13.99 (as I'm writing this) on Amazon. The Good Size Spigen made a compelling case with a slimmer profile than their competitors without compromising drop protection. Buttons The serrations on the power button really are icing on the case. The Not So Good Color Unlike Spigen's other cases, the Rugged Armor is only offered in black. Spigen isn’t what I would directly call a household name unless you primarily order your accessories online. Most companies that sell cases online only have a harder time reaching out to customers in the same way that Speck, Otterbox, Incipio, or other brands would. I haven’t seen Spigen cases sold in stores myself, but that doesn’t mean they aren’t sold in store somewhere. Spigen is able to reach people better even with no big presence in your typical electronics or carrier stores. They constantly have sales online, promote their products, and more importantly make a large variety of cases for just about every flagship. I first encountered their cases back with my Note 3. At the time I bought the NeoHybrid and never looked back. Over the years their cases have evolved into a more diverse lineup with a few exceptions. They have some cases that are hard to tell apart which confuses consumers. An example of this is their Slim Armor/Tough Armor series. The Slim Armor (SA) is always better compared to the Tough Armor (TA), and while they look nearly identical, the TA is bulkier and has worse button feedback. There are a few lines they offer that I have an affinity toward: the Rugged Armor, Thin Fit, and Slim Armor. I’ve had more good experiences with these cases than some others making them a first purchase when I get a phone. I currently have their Rugged Armor (RA) case for my Pixel. It took me a while longer to get one; this was due to the RA frequently going out of stock on Amazon because of the popularity of the design. Spigen opted for a carbon fiber-ish bottom, supplemented by a horizontally grooved region at the top covering where Google has the glass back. The [somewhat] fingerprint-resistant TPU construction gives you a pleasant soft-touch like feeling when you hold it, despite not having any real grip. Don’t be fooled by the thin profile of this case, because Spigen claims it can take a beating. I’ve dropped my phones (S7 Edge, HTC 10, Nexus 6P, Note 7) in this case more times than I care to mention and never broken a screen or had any damage to my phone. TPU is a great material for absorbing shocks, maintaining its shape over time, and resisting oils /scratches to some extent. The case is said to go through 26 drops from 4 ft (48 in), thereby offering “Military grade” protection. I mentioned in my Otterbox review that bulky cases are more of a style than anything given how cases like this one, and the Presidio, offer equal protection the majority of the time. My favorite part of this case has to be the textured power button. Spigen did the same thing with their HTC 10 version of the Rugged Armor, but not with any other phone’s RA that I’ve seen. The feeling of the serrations will make you crave member berries, as it feels like you are using the phone caseless without any harm coming to it. This makes the transition to the RA not as bad. I know some people hate cases on their phones—if you’re one of those people, give this case a try. It offers a thin profile, protective design, and doesn’t interfere with any functionality whatsoever. Pressing the buttons on this case feels no different than using the phone without one, aside from the subtle softer TPU vs. metal on the phone. I highly recommend this case second only to the Presidio at the moment. There can be a lot of trial and error when finding the right case, but you won’t have that if you buy the RA. (Note: The smaller dedicated cutout that houses the laser, and microphone can accumulate dust. Some people mentioned this causing auto focus issues due to the sensor being covered by dirt/lint/dust. Since the area is harder to clean, you may need to use compressed 'canned air' or remove the phone and wipe off that area periodically). Pixel XL Case by Google - Clear Google's case is only sold through their online store for a rather expensive $30 given what is being offered. The case features a very simple two-tone clear color scheme on the back and is made out of polycarbonate like most other clear cases. The Good Looks Google made a nice looking case if you enjoy the almost two-tone color scheme of the Pixel. Support Anything bought from the Google Store always comes with the best support if you have any issues later down the line. The Not So Good Protection Unlike last year's offerings, there isn't much in the form of protection offered by this case. Design The clear 'windowed' region suffers from rainbowing due to the poor design. Then you're left with no protection for the top or bottom of your Pixel. Google first introduced its own phone cases starting back with the Nexus 5 (I could be mistaken). There was a mixed reaction, mainly due to the much higher prices, delays, and rather mediocre quality at times. Each new Nexus device thereafter would have its own generation (style) of case in the Google Store. I never owned a Nexus 5 because at that time I bought my first true phablet, the Note 3. I also used a Nexus 7 (2013) model while at school for some of my text books and other things. Google made a bumper case for the Nexus 7 that seemed to have its fair share of issues, such as the color rubbing off onto the tablet. Things changed with the Nexus 6 case which was made by CaseMate, as was their Project Fi case, if you were lucky enough to get one. These cases were still way overpriced relative to some other alternatives, on top of their already questionable design/quality. Following the 6, Google’s Nexus 5X/6P received a little more special treatment with their cases. Adopted is a company based in NY that primarily makes iPhone cases (gasp). This lineup offered better quality, unique Google-inspired designs, and a premium price to suit. I owned the clear and the felt-like backed grey one. These cases showed a big step forward compared to earlier years despite some small issues. Google went a step further many months after the phones launched with their Live Cases. Both my wife and I owned these with mixed results: Hers fit perfectly and looked great. Mine on the other hand was loose, creaked horribly, and the picture was nowhere near clear. I might have Artem’s luck with these things. I decided to get the “Made by Google” clear case for my Pixel XL this year. On their website, the pictures are deceiving because you cannot tell whether the top and bottom are protected (they’re not). I was disappointed when I opened my brand new Quite Black Pixel XL and case, only to be greeted with something that I would personally never use—there was a total lack of top/bottom coverage. I enjoy thin cases such as Spigen’s thin fit, and Ringke’s Slim series, but only when they offer top/bottom coverage. I decided to try the case anyway since I already bought it. However, things didn’t get better for Google’s latest case offering. If you look at the back, you’ll notice it has a frosted bottom and clear top corresponding to where the glass window is on the Pixel. I think this design looks good, as do other case manufacturers since they implemented a similar design of their own. The clear back region covering the Pixel’s glass is just as big of a fingerprint magnet, if not bigger than the glass itself. I also experienced a large amount of rainbowing when the case was on because it touched the glass. Google didn’t think that design through as they should have. Conventionally, cases will use a ‘micro-dot’ pattern to keep the plastic a hair off the glass; so this issue doesn’t occur like it does with other cases. The issues kept getting worse when I noticed a lot of scratches on the inside of the case from where I cleaned it with a microfiber cloth. There was no dust or dirt on it when I cleaned it. There is a trivial lip that keeps your display raised off hard surfaces, yet if you intend to use this case, should that even matter? One good thing Google did was make the buttons accessible, at least enough where I didn’t have any glaring issues hitting the power/volume keys. I believe Google needs to make a good case that doesn’t suffer from these abundant problems year after year, especially when launching a whole ‘new’ line of devices. I wouldn’t recommend buying the clear case (I cannot speak about their other case’s quality) unless you enjoy throwing money away for something that won’t protect your phone any more than using a dbrand skin. Ringke Fusion Clear cases are a popular way to show off your beautiful phone. Ringke offers interesting cases that fit this need for a reasonable price. They can be found on Ringke’s website or on Amazon for $20 or less depending on the day. The Good Looks This case will look great if you plan on using a dbrand skin to eliminate the rainbow streaking. Ports Ringke removed all port covers making the case easier to use on top of looking better. The Not So Good Design The lanyard hole is a blackhole for dirt to enter your case. Design The transparent polycarbonate back panel doesn't use microdots therefore suffers from the dreaded rainbow effect. Ringke (also known as Rearth USA) is another company that makes a very popular array of cases. Their collections include the Ringke Slim and Fusion series, both of which I’ve been using for quite some time. Depending on your phone, Ringke has a broad assortment of styles, materials, and colors. Unfortunately, only one case has been made for the Pixel/Pixel XL so far: the Fusion. If I were to think back to the early days of my Nexus 6P, there were only a few decent clear cases out there; one of my favorites was the Fusion. My first Ringke case was a Ringke Slim that I bought for my favorite phone of all time, Google’s Nexus 6. The sheer size of the device was great, and even more manageable with a thin case from Ringke. I appreciated their attention to detail with the inclusion of top and bottom coverage, unlike some other thin-fitting cases back then. The Ringke Slim and Fusion cases both took a beating during their time on my Nexus 6—even some hard falls onto the pavement that left lasting marks on the plastic. My Nexus 6 never had so much as a scratch on it despite the very minimal design of both cases. In my opinion, the protection you get boils down to a few basic things: design, materials, and coverage. Neither case was what I would call bulky, yet the right combination of those variables gave my phone adequate protection. I opted for a Smoke colored Fusion to compliment the Quite Black Pixel XL. There’s something about this combination that gives the phone a stunning appeal. Outside the Fusion is a TPU-based bumper fused to the polycarbonate back panel. This was done to give you the best transparency, while still having flexibility for impacts and removing the case. Some changes were made to the design from last year. First, the infamous port covers Ringke used on their Fusion line are now gone with the wind. Second, Ringke found a way to avoid the scratch mark around the fingerprint cutout. This was a big concern among Nexus 6P case buyers last year; I spoke with an individual who detailed the cause of this defect. When the cases are made via injection molding or other methods, there is a large amount of heat. As the polycarbonate cools, air pockets can form in a long and narrow fashion stemming from the fingerprint cutout. From a consumer perspective, it looks like a scratch, yet this was a manufacturing issue. The following areas of the case stayed the same despite not serving any real function for most people. There is a small lanyard hook at the bottom of all Ringke cases; maybe it’s a trademark design, or they just felt like adding one. This presents a large issue for their clear cases because it allows dust, dirt, and everything in between to get inside your nice clear case. Unlike their Air series, Ringke did not opt for a micro bubble texture on the clear region, resulting in what looks like an oil spill. As I mentioned in the Google Clear Case review, there is rainbowing on any place a polycarbonate section touches the glass. This is especially true with the large region covered by this case. I tried to carefully put the case on without pressing on that area, only to be met with gigantic rainbow effects. Dirt is this case’s worst nightmare, as all of it shows easily because the whole back touches the phone. Every tiny piece of lint and dust will show through the case. I carefully removed all the dust, used a can of air, then briskly placed the phone inside. To my frustration, dust still managed to find its way in. I wouldn’t even consider placing this phone inside my work laptop bag because I know it would come out looking like I took it from a dusty closet. On a more positive note, Ringke claims the Fusion offers MIL-STD 810G drop protection, making it just as protective as the Speck, Spigen, and Otterbox. This same protection is also offered by the fragile yet sleek looking V20, so keep that in mind. No one verifies the case lives up to that standard other than the company making the claim, but I don’t doubt the Fusion’s protection whatsoever. Some standards such as the MIL-STD 810G seem easy to meet if you engineer your case correctly. I believe Ringke needs to work on addressing the rainbow issue, and in doing so they will fix my other complaint regarding the dust through the addition of micro dots. As of right now, I wouldn’t recommend their case until something is done to fix this. Incipio Dual Pro When it comes to color, Incipio has your phone covered with their Dual Pro. Gold, red, and black all are offered in a nice looking case that can be found on Amazon, Incipio's website, and Verizon for around $35 or less. The Good Color Incipio chose to offer some nice colors compared to other companies. Buttons All the buttons are very responsive and easy to find. The Not So Good Size The choice of materials here likely led to this case being larger than it should have been. Cutouts For some reason Incipio chose to make their cutouts on the back so large that even my Otterbox Defender’s look small. Incipio makes cases for everything from smartphones to laptops, giving them a very diverse background. As with most other case manufacturers, Incipio primarily caters toward Apple products, which can be seen with their excessive selection of cases offered for each Apple device. During my last year in school I owned a Surface Pro 4 and housed it inside an Incipio case. I tend to be overly OCD/cautious when it comes to electronics, hence why all my phones, tablets, and devices have been inside a case since day one. While Incipio doesn’t offer a wide selection of cases for Google’s Pixel line, they do have a few good choices. I was surprised to see more cases being offered compared to last year’s Nexus 6P, which was only given one case and color, while the 5X had a slightly better lineup. I’ve owned both the Octane and Dual Pro cases for previous phones, but I haven’t tried the Carnaby yet. The Dual Pro features a hard shell Incipio calls “Plextonium,” which is still just polycarbonate as they denote on their website. Silicone is used inside (I always thought it was a softer TPU/TPE), so reading that was certainly interesting. Silicone is not ideal for cases because it will stretch out over time, as Otterbox, Seidio, and other companies have come to find out. Most cases use TPE/TPU for its favorable properties, including retaining shape better even after removing your phone countless times. I’ve never had a Spigen case become loose over time, yet all my silicone ones have. An interesting tidbit: only the black model has a soft touch finish to it. I don’t know if this is by design, or the way they finish the black one. I could only find a gaudy gold case when I bought my Pixel XL. I usually don’t care about the color if the case does its job. The gold does a decent job hiding fingerprints. This is unlike the black one, which is a magnet for oils and dirt. Compared to Dual Pro cases in the past, this one is exceptionally thick—and no, that’s not a good thing. I don’t see this case offering any more protection due to the added thickness. Rather, I feel it’s due to the use of silicone as opposed to TPU. Aside from the bulk, I can’t say I appreciate the larger fingerprint/camera cutouts. I’ve already noticed scratches on my fingerprint scanner, so any more exposed glass through the back is not something I want. I did order a skin to cover just the glass, but that won’t be here for about a week. Some of this added bulk might be a good thing because of the case’s slippery texture. Just about every negative thing I’ve mentioned is more about me being a very picky person than there being something inherently flawed about the case’s design. There are several positive aspects of this case, such as the few color options (gold/black/red). The latter isn’t nearly as common these days. If you plan to keep your phone in this case without removing it more than a few times, I don’t see the silicone losing its shape as much over time. It is ultimately up to you when deciding which case to use. Tech 21 Evo Check Simple, elegant protection is what Tech 21 offers all without any added bulk or fancy marketing. You can purchase the Evo Check case from Tech 21's website, or from Verizon currently unless Amazon decides to stock it in the near future. The Good Design I don’t think there’s a way to look at this case and say it’s ugly. The checkered back looks stunning from all angles. Protection All good things can also come in a well-designed, sleek case with the benefit of great drop protection. The Not So Good Buttons Trying to push the power button is like trying to move a building. It won’t budge without a ton of force. Cutouts Tech 21’s choice for a precise fingerprint cutout and a large camera cutout confuses me. Why wouldn’t they stick to precision for both? I prefer cases that offer good drop protection and a slimmer profile, as I’m sure most readers will have noticed at this point. I chose the Tech 21 case because it was well suited to offer protection all with a nice looking low-profile design. My experiences with Tech 21 only date back to when I bought my S7 Edge earlier this year. I found their case to be great in many areas, particularly with handling drops. Their claim to fame seems to be how well the cases hold up to drops while still protecting the phone/tablet inside. I’ve seen many YouTube videos showing someone drop the case off a balcony onto concrete/pavement with no damage to the phone. I would never test this myself, and I do not recommend ever doing so because anything is possible. Tech 21 offers a few styles in their EVO line that all look too similar for most people to tell apart. They have the Evo Check, Evo Check Active, Evo Elite, Evo Gem, Evo Tactical, etc. Only the Evo Check is offered for Google’s Pixel line. Even though each style looks similar, their functions are different. Each case relies primarily on a material they call “FlexShock,” which is another fancy way of saying some sort of TPU/TPE material. One thing I will say about their materials is how hard they feel relative to other cases. They might be using a higher density form of TPU/TPE to protect the phone against larger drops. I opted for a Black/Smoke Evo Check case since my Pixel XL is Quite black. The contrasting checkered pattern gives the phone a tactile or even stylish look. Physically, this case is only slightly larger than Spigen’s Rugged Armor, yet it claims to withstand bigger impacts. Inside, there are ribbed buffers lining the border along the sides; it then has thicker top/bottom sections that aide in impact absorption. I found the bottom thickness to be annoying at times because I rest my phone on my pinky, so these deeper cutouts started to hurt my finger after a while. The backside of each cutout is virtually flush with the phone to give you better access for charging and headphones. While their fingerprint cutout is great, I can’t say I appreciate how large the camera one is. I won’t say it hurts anything because it doesn’t, but precision is part of a case’s beauty when it’s this sleek. Speaking of sleek, you won’t find the Evo Check to offer much if any grip if that matters to you. Let’s talk about my biggest issue with this case: the power button. I was very pleased with both the volume keys after pressing them, then came the power button… I don’t know why it’s so damn hard to press or how they let it ship like this, but it’s a nightmare. I thought my first one was defective, so I swapped it out only to find the same issue. The button simply doesn’t want to move when you press it. I’m currently using the case with the hope that prolonged use will cause the button to break in somehow. If Google made a native way to turn off my screen via the fingerprint scanner I would do that, but unfortunately only 3rd party apps can do that so far. This would solve the power button issue during normal usage, but it doesn’t excuse the problem to begin with. Aside from my complaints with the awful power button, I find this case to be very pleasant during day-to-day usage. I will update this review later if the power button situation changes. Case By Google - Silicone Google is generally good at keeping things fresh. They have managed to continue that tradition by offering a wider variety of cases in a number of colors. The Silicone has many nice features, as well as a few flaws that may ultimately be the deciding factors for you. The Good Appearance The case has a sophisticated design that looks very professional. Cutouts Due to the open bottom, every USB accessory should fit without an issue. The Not So Good Texture It is very slippery and would be easy to drop. Material The silicone is bound to stretch with general wear and tear. Let me start by saying that this case is very simple and elegant. It does not try to be anything it’s not. There are no extra flourishes that make it seem too decorative, other than the “G” on the back (Google’s signature stamp). The Silicone case I was sent is grey, and this neutral tone gives me a more business-oriented vibe. I can picture it sitting on an executive’s desk during his coffee break. However, looks are not the most important thing. Google chose to make this from a conglomerate of three materials: it has a polycarbonate shell wrapped in soft silicone, which is then lined with a velvety microfiber. This combination gives the case a very sleek feeling, but at a price. It is so slick it could slide across sandpaper. Some areas are not reinforced properly, allowing the silicone to pull away from your phone around the buttons. Unlike Google’s Clear Case, this one covers the top of the phone and leaves the bottom out in the cold. Since the case is so slippery, there is greater risk for damage if you should drop it. If dropping is not a concern for you, the fact that the buttons are almost impossible to find may be. The buttons on this case are practically ghosts. If you go to push the power or volume buttons, you may wonder whether they are there or not. When you do manage to find them there is a good tactile response. It is a combination of the smooth texture and nearly flush edges that make them hard to locate. If Google were to make one change to the buttons, I would suggest giving them some kind of raised texture. If you are as anal as I am, the cutouts on Google’s Silicone case may be a nuisance to you. Given all the precise engineering that went into making this case, you would think the cutouts would have received the same treatment. The fingerprint cutout is perfectly fine, but the cutout for the camera is extremely large. It does not appear like it was measured to perfectly fit the Pixel camera. This extra open space allows more dirt to get on the lens, which is easily scratched. Since the purpose of a case is to protect your phone from damage, this seems like a major oversight. I have resorted to buying a vinyl skin that covers the glass to protect it while in such cases. If having a fashionable case with basic scratch protection is enough for you, then you will enjoy this case. If you do buy it, don’t drop it or have it on the counter while baking cookies. You’ll either end up with a broken phone or cleaning flour from your camera lens. SupCase Unicorn Beetle Despite what its name suggests, this case is not made of a casual greeting, a mythical creature, and an insect. The Supcase Unicorn Beetle is an example of a good case gone in the wrong direction. Imagine if General Mills took the marshmallows out of Lucky Charms...it’s that kind of direction. The Good Design The clear back is properly designed to eliminate rainbow streaking. Ports The charging and headphone cutouts are able to fit most cables without issue. The Not So Good Design The boxy design leaves a lot to be desired. Buttons The buttons are very hard to press the first time, even though they are easier to find than some other flush buttons. This case once had a lot of desirable features which have either disappeared or been altered completely. Previous case generations made holding it comfortable as the case mimicked the phone’s contours. In terms of shape, it is now very boxy. While the Otterbox is bigger, the Unicorn Beetle (UB) has a more cumbersome feel in your hand. The UB’s edges are very sharp, making it even more uncomfortable to hold. The look has also changed; the Nexus 6P generation UB had a frosted back, which has vanished from the new one. The only good thing about the clear back is that it doesn’t cause rainbow streaking, as it is lifted slightly off the phone. The major downside is that this allows dust to get onto your phone, defeating one of the points of using a case. The former frosted back was made from acrylic, but the new one appears to be made of polycarbonate. This gives it a more slippery feel, adding to the reasons why it is more difficult to hold. The almost good news about the buttons is that the power key is textured, so you actually know what you are pressing. On the other hand, when pushing the buttons, you need to push them toward the front of the phone; you can’t just push them straight in. The buttons are also flush, making it hard to tell where the volume rocker is. At least you’ll be able to distinguish it from the power button. Now, let’s talk about the cutouts. They are oversized, which again makes it easier for dirt to get on your phone. However, the large size of them keeps with the bulky, square theme of the case. While I am not a fan at them, I will say that they are consistent with the rest of the design. If uniformity is important to you, you’re in luck. Much like Lucky Charms without the Charms, this case has left me disappointed. The UB has removed all of the features that made it such a good case back in previous generations. What were once smooth contours that blended the back panel with the outer TPU bumper are now sharp edges. Additionally, poor design led to the use of buttons that are nearly impossible to find let alone press the first time. In my opinion, there are too many better competing cases on the market to justify using this one. Google Live Maps Case Live Cases, particularly the maps ones, have been popular since Google first released them last year. Google gave anyone the ability to create a one-of-a-kind case with limitless possibilities for customization. At $40 customization doesn’t come cheap, so putting a picture of your new girlfriend on it might be a bad idea. The Good Design Infinite customizability allows you to have a truely unique case. Software The accompanying app ensures your phone's wallpaper can be as unique as its exterior. The Not So Good Buttons Despite the good intentions behind Google's NFC button, it falls short in real word use. Color Colors when you order may not match your actual case as I found out. There are many color and ‘texture’ options offered by Google for their maps case that are not entirely accurate when you physically get your case. I ordered this maps one in what I thought was a deep indigo, yet when I received the case it was a very light periwinkle. This was disappointing for me given the blatant color differences, especially the indigo. I checked the color on a few different screens (not the oversaturated AMOLED on my Pixel) to be sure. Aside from the colors looking like a faded pair of jeans, not the dark wash expected, the case was as I ordered. While Google’s two other cases have a larger cutout for the camera module, and sensor array, this one has precise holes for each. If I were to speculate, Google did this to maximize the area for printing the image onto the case. Since the entire case is crafted from polycarbonate, the volume/power buttons received cutouts, otherwise they would be unusable. On the inside you will find an NFC antenna linked to the large indent at the case's center. Google refers to this as a programmable shortcut button, although that terminology is a little misleading. The NFC antenna isn’t contacting the Pixel’s rear glass until you apply a lot of pressure to that spot on the case. Once contact has been made, the Pixel will read the NFC antenna, and do whatever task you assigned to it. A nifty, simple companion app was created to control, program, and otherwise play with the Live Case. One neat feature all Live Cases have is a unique wallpaper that matches your case. Maps cases will allow you to see the local map around you in any color array offered for the case. These wallpapers also scroll nicely with the Pixel Launcher, and can be alternatively used as a fixed image. Style, scratch protection, and the cool factor are about all you can expect from any Live Case. There is a very slight lip for face down protection, and both the top/bottom are exposed. I personally don’t mind those drawbacks given how Google doesn’t intend for their Live Cases to offer real protection. Personal expression in the form of cases is expensive no matter what Live Case you choose. I can’t say whether or not $40 is worthwhile for most people, but for me it’s certainly not. Between the inaccurate colors and almost useless NFC button, Google has a lot to work on for future live cases. Diztronic Pixlee If you ever find yourself missing those old pixelated video games from the late eighties and early nineties, you may like the Diztronic Pixlee. At $10 and in a variety of colors what's not to like about this case? While it has its flaws in terms of protection and design, it is overall a whimsical case that will make you want to break out your old Nintendo. The Good Design It has an attractive design and easy-to-find buttons. Colors Diztronic offers a multitude of colors for your retro inspired needs! The Not So Good Materials It is not very sturdy and has a large camera cutout. Durability As with previous Diztronic cases the sides will loosen up over time making the case unusable. Why does this case make me so nostalgic for a simpler time? The answer is in the look. The Pixlee has a design that quite literally looks like little pixels you may have seen on an old computer. This design also gives it a rougher texture, allowing you to keep a firm grip on it. While I am describing the black one, it comes in a variety of colors for you to choose from including orange, and pink. In terms of functionality, the Diztronic Pixlee has its pros and cons. Allow me to start with the positive and work my way down. The buttons are very nice and easy to push. Unlike buttons on some of the other cases I will be discussing, they are simple to find without having to visually search for them. In terms of the negative, the case is very flimsy. It will likely not shield your phone from much damage in the event of a drop. However, this may be moot, considering the rough texture should help prevent it from slipping out of your hand. Something else that may be considered a negative quality is the single, large cutout for the camera. It takes away from the otherwise preciseness of the case and could allow dirt to get around the camera glass. Lastly, Diztronic cases have been known to lose their shape over time thus becoming almost useless. I encountered this with 2 of their Nexus 6P cases, and my Nexus 6 one prior to that. To put it simply, this case is very pretty. It has a design that I believe most people would enjoy, and you can pick from an assortment of color options. Despite a few minor flaws, the Pixlee is a case worth trying out. Spigen Slim Armor At first glance, the Spigen Slim Armor looks something like an android from Star Wars (this is good news if you’re into that kind of thing). This is a great looking case that is more than thick enough to give your phone the proper armor before doing battle with your floor. Like every case, however, there are good and bad things about the Slim Armor even for the $30 you'll pay to get one. The Good Design The Slim Armor has an appealing design and has buttons that are easy to find and press. Features Spigen's small kickstand holds the Slim Armor up better than its bigger brother. The Not So Good Features The bottom is quite slippery and the kickstand pops out easier than it should. Color There are only a handful of color options, none of which are particularity great. In terms of the way this case looks and feels, there is a major textural difference between the black top and the silver (gunmetal) or black bottom. If you are like most people, your hold your phone more toward the bottom end. This is where there is slight problem with this case. The silvery bottom (the magical element that gives it that robot look) is very slippery, while the top is not. The kickstand also easily comes off, though it is not clear if this has something to do with the weak plastic retainer. All of my previous Slim Armor cases made popping out the kickstand a nightmare, thus maybe Spigen addressed the issue. This smoothness may make it more likely that your phone will slide from your hand. Although, I suppose they call it “Armor” for a reason, as this thing could really take a pounding. If it is not yet clear, design and functionality are really intertwined with this case. The buttons are raised appropriately, so you won’t find yourself feeling around for your volume buttons like you are trying to read Braille. It has smaller cutouts for the camera and flash, which adds to the sleekness and will help minimize the amount of dust and dirt that can damage the glass. Previous Next Ultimately, this case is like the little black dress of cases according to my wife. It is versatile and can take your phone from a professional to a casual setting. While it's slippery due to the contrast in textures, damage should still be minimized in the event you drop your phone down a few flights of stairs. The Spigen Slim Armor really is armor for your phone. Spigen Tough Armor Well, not all Armor is created equal. Some phone accessories really should not have been made to begin with, and the Spigen Tough armor would be at the top of that list for me. Despite a few redeeming qualities, you may want to save your money on this one. If you really want to buy the case it can be found on Amazon for ~$18. The Good Design Texture is easy to grip (black one), and it looks better than its clear counterpart. Ports Ample room was provided on both the top/bottom cutouts for your audiophile and charging needs. The Not So Good Material Oil from your fingers will dirty the case, and good luck finding the buttons. Cutouts For some reason Spigen opted for a bizzare speaker cutout on the non-clear version only. Let me begin by discussing some production flaws and a couple of positive qualities. You all know my thing with buttons by now...these ones are extremely elusive. Not only do they not want to be found, but they do not want you to know which one is which. If the case itself could think, it probably would not even know they were there. The buttons on the clear one are even harder to find because of the smoother texture. They attempted to put a little dividing line between the power and the volume buttons, but it is a barely noticeable afterthought. What really bothers me is why Spigen still insists on making the Tough Armor when their Slim Armor is always better. Unlike the Slim Armor, the design on the Tough is somewhat boring. However, I will say it has a very grippy texture in addition to being sturdy. You should have no problem with your phone being damaged. Some more good-ish news is that the camera cutouts are the same shape as the Slim Armor (only a tiny bit smaller). It gives the phone a slightly more sleek look, and little to no dust should scratch your camera lens. The kickstand also seems to remain in place when you open and close it. The texture has a somewhat leathery feel, and is very absorbent. Don’t commit a crime while using this case, as your prints could easily be lifted off. If your only concern is with the fingerprints, then I would recommend the clear one; while it is clear around the very top and bottom, it has a smooth, silver back that does not dirty easily. Just be careful holding this one, as it would be easier to drop. Previous Next Spigen decided to make different speaker cutouts for the clear version in a good way. There are tiny slits above the speaker cutout normally which distort/muffle sound slightly, but this was fixed with the clear one. Design continuity should remain in place across a clear version of the same case, yet Spigen doesn’t seem to agree. While the Tough Armor was a fair attempt, I feel it is an example of why sometimes it is best to leave well enough alone. All it will take is a one-time use for you to realize that the Slim Armor is superior. Spigen NeoHybrid I am sure all of you know that looks can be deceiving, and the looks of the (~$15) Spigen NeoHybrid are just that. It will lure you in with a false sense of security until you actually touch it and put it on your phone. While appearing to be of high quality, it is actually quite cheap. The Good Style There is some color variety to choose from and it looks nice. Design Spigen's accent pattern follows Google's design language, and frankly is cool. The Not So Good Design It is flimsy and there is always a gap around the bumper when on your phone. Buttons The buttons sit flush with the bumper due to a design flaw. Apparently, some phone cases need bumpers...perhaps in case they fall down or bump into things. While the bumper offers a pleasing visual contrast to the body of the case, it presents a problem when you place it on your phone. No matter what you do, there will always be some sort of gap between the bumper and the actual case. This makes it so your case always looks cheap, and you will find yourself constantly fiddling with it in frustration. I wish that were the only issue. I haven’t seen a NeoHybrid fit perfectly since the days of my Note 3. While the buttons are properly raised to my liking, the case itself is very thin and poorly designed. Ideally, cases should be stiff so they can do their job. The NeoHybrid acts like it is made of rubber, and if you remove the bumper you can bend it in half without damaging it. Except unlike rubber, this case is not as durable (...and won’t bounce when you drop it)). I don’t feel comfortable allowing the thin plastic bumper to take any impact without suffering a lot of damage. One thing Spigen did right with this case has nothing to do with making it function better, but it is still worth noting. There is a textural difference between the top and bottom; the top has a raised design while the middle/bottom has a smoother texture. This adds to what is very “pretty” about this case. Putting the raised design on the bottom may have been more useful, as it would make the case less slippery while holding your phone. Do not judge a book by its cover. The NeoHybrid seems very nice and appealing, but it falls short everywhere else. LifeProof FRE LifeProof has finally given Nexus...umm, Pixel owners... a true water resistant IP68 case. (I say resistance because the IP rating is not a ‘waterproof’ standard). Google opted out of true water resistance on their flagship Pixel, leaving many users unhappy. This is where this LifeProof FRE case stepped in. Gone are the days of putting your phone in those awful pouches that render your phone useless. The case is sold through LifeProof's website for a rather pricey $89.99. The Good Design Excellent protection from dust and water thanks to its IP68 rating. Materials The durable exterior and reasonable screen protector make this a great case. The Not So Good Buttons These are by far the worst I’ve encountered on a case. Cutouts The speaker membrane hinders audio quality on an already quiet phone. When I heard LifeProof decided to take the plunge and make a Pixel/Pixel XL case, I was more excited than I care to explain. I need a good water/dust resistant case in my line of work, neither of which really existed for phones other than your usual Samsung/Apple flagships. There were a few select phones to receive the LifeProof treatment besides those, yet none were from Google’s former Nexus line... until now. My experience with LifeProof doesn’t go back as far due to the phones I’ve owned. The first one I bought was for my work-issued iPhone 6. Since earlier this year I’ve used the FRE on that phone without any big issues, other than some wear/tear from various drops its encountered. The case has held up well despite my less than gentle treatment of it. Moving on to this particular case, you will only find one color option so far (I hope that changes in the future). Even with the normal run of the mill black/grey styling, I’m happy this case exists at all. In the box, LifeProof includes some stickers, a small tool that aides in removal of the back, and a water resistant AUX extender. To maintain water resistance, there is a threaded portion inside the case and on the adapter alongside a small o-ring. I wasn’t able to fit a normal AUX cable into my phone without that adapter, not that I even use corded headphones these days. In the world we live in, dongles no matter their use have become a common site. Personally, I would rather not carry around extra gear if I don’t need. If you crave a larger phone, and miss the size of your Nexus 6, then you will be happy to know how large this case is. My Pixel is now thicker, and just as tall/wide as my LG V20 in a Speck Presidio Grip. The size of my V20 doesn’t bother me (hence why I own one), yet it can make your Pixel seem like a small brick. Size isn’t the only area of concern on this case. The buttons and speakers also have their own set of ‘problems’. Let’s face it, the Pixel has a quiet speaker if you even call it that. I rarely hear my alarm on it, let alone my ringtone. LifeProof used a membrane of sorts to protect the speaker, while still allowing sound to pass through (though muffled). I couldn’t watch a video or listen to music on my phone before with the low volume, now it’s a muffled mess. Don’t worry about trying to change the volume or shut off the phone inside this case; the buttons are basically glued in place. These might be the toughest buttons I’ve ever experienced. Oddly enough, my iPhone version works fine, even with the added resistance when pushing buttons. I appreciate the attention to detail LifeProof put into different aspects of the case. A grey trip wraps itself around the display, giving the case a nice transition into the black frame. Along the sides you will find a subtle grey trim accenting the case while also showing you where it splits apart. Other cases can make it difficult to find, wherein you need to remove a certain piece to get your phone. Thankfully, there are no issues with that here. Using the phone in the LifeProof case isn't difficult. In fact, I think it has a fairly decent built-in screen protector. Don’t expect to keep your beloved glass screen protector on in this case because it simply won’t fit. Fingerprint recognition has worked flawlessly for me even in this case, but gestures are another story. I can sometimes get the swipe gestures to work, but other times it’s a frustration-filled mess. That's a big deal to me, since I use gestures frequently. Given the Pixel’s excellent camera abilities, you should know how this case poses issues in that department. I found focusing to be inconsistent, and the plastic ‘lense’ on the case appeared to affect image quality. I ensured both my phone and case were clean beforehand; even then, results were mixed. With the many flaws I outlined, you might ask yourself why I still like this case. Nothing is perfect, or even close-- not even my Speck Presidio. The case might have its flaws, but I love it nonetheless. I can learn to work around some of the smaller more nitpicky things I mentioned because of the advantages LifeProof offers. Water/dust resistance are required when you live here in West Texas, and LifeProof provides them. Toast Wood (Walnut) ‘Case’ Toast has made a name for itself by offering laser cut real wood ‘cases’ for a multitude of phones, tablets, and PCs. Their cases are not conventional because they use adhesives to stay in place instead of friction. Currently, there are 3 woods offered (Walnut, Ash and Ebony) for more variety. The case I'm reviewing sells for $44 on Toast' website if you include the front panel, $34 without. The Good Design Nothing beats the elegant simplicity of wood. Customization Toast offers 3 different woods (Walnut, Ash, Ebony) along with custom laser engraving if you want to go that route. The Not So Good Design The fitment of certain areas could use a great deal of improvement. Materials Simple sanding, or rounding of the sharp edges would give this case a significantly better feel. Real material cases (wood, carbon fiber, leather etc.) are highly sought after as a luxury accessory by most people. I always enjoy a quality leather or wood case, mainly for the smell (leather), or feel (wood) because it offers something ‘fake’ materials cannot. I’ve tried real leather cases, skins, alongside a random wood one from other companies, I was generally pleased with the outcome, yet I could never use any of them for a prolonged period. While real wood/leather have their own appeal, they come with many drawbacks, too. Toast shares these drawbacks by using an adhesive instead of framing the wood into a case. Installation is no harder than doing a vinyl wrap or screen protector. I followed the instructions, and was able to have my phone covered in wood within 10 minutes. Aesthetically Toast nailed it, but the feel/durability is another story. Wood feels great most of the time, except with this case. I was constantly concerned about getting a splinter due to the rough texture and very sharp edges. Given all of the laser cut wood cases I’ve tried before where this wasn’t an issue, I started to question their intent. I understand how people enjoy a more rugged, natural feel, but there’s a difference between that and razor sharp edges. Some issues were encountered on the corner segments, as they did not fully adhere. I reached out to the Toast rep seeking advice on how to address this after installing my case. I will post an update about their response when representatives come back from the holiday break. Make no mistake when I say my Toast was installed perfectly, so I had an issue when my buttons became hard to press. Toast uses little pieces of wood that go over your buttons. I installed them with tweezers to ensure there was no misalignment whatsoever. I tried to hit my power button and was met with a very spongy response. Buttons should be tactile no matter what, and these lost their touch. Previous Next Another area Toast really could have improved on was their button texture. If Toast mimicked the texture on Google’s Pixel I would be much happier with the case. Finding buttons, let alone these slippery wood ones, was hard enough without any clear way of identifying one from another. Toast also included a front panel in their review sample I was sent. I chose not to install this because I’m using a glass screen protector, and the front wood piece is not compatible with it. Aside from my grips, the Toast still looked great as long as I didn’t use my phone. I cannot recommend their case in this state without some improvements, especially for what they’re charging. Incipio Octane One of my favorite S7 Edge cases made a return this time for the Pixel/Pixel XL. This simple frosted clear case with a selection of colored borders offers great drop protection without compromising style. Incipio offers 4 colors, (black, lavender, grey, pearl blue) all featuring the same frosted back panel. Amazon is the easiest place to purchase the case for around $25 right now in all of the color combinations. The Good Cutouts Adding a black border to the camera cutout eliminates flash issues. Design Frosted cases always have a nice cohesive look without the worry of smudges. The Not So Good Buttons Atrocious, horrible and other words would be a suitable description of how well the buttons do not function. Grip The Octane lost what little grip it had through the use of a different texture wrapping the sides. In the last generation of cases, there was a very nice, subtle tire-like pattern framing the case. This time we are met with a very rough, ribbed texture which detracts from the case's design. I never thought my S7 Edge version was particularly ‘grippy’ yet it was nowhere near as slippery as this one. Don’t let those deep grooves deceive you; even wrapping them in sand paper wouldn’t help. Looking at this case, you can really appreciate how well the two materials from the back and sides seamlessly blend together. Incipio plastered their logo rather obnoxiously on the back, reducing the overall appeal. I didn’t mind their logo as much before, but now it looks bigger, bolder, and more in the way. An inherent flaw of all frosted cases is how they can get scratched from the inside, which ruins their nice look. Inserting your phone in such a way to avoid scraping the back can be quite the challenge. I continued to look for some form of redeeming aspect of this case, only to be met with disappointment at every corner. I don’t know what buttons mean to Incipio because the ones on this case were essentially non-functional. LifeProof takes the cake (the cake is a lie...) for awful buttons, leaving Incipio firmly in second place. After an exhausting search, I found one area that Incipio designed well: cutouts. A lot of companies tend to overlook how clear cases will affect the camera, flash and other rear facing sensors. Incipio remedied this by using a black border around the larger camera cutout, eliminating any potential problem. My Pixel has issues focusing the majority of the time as it stands, even without a case. Thankfully, I did not run into this issue any more than usual while using the Octane. Larger accessory manufacturers can lose sight of what attributes made them successful; sadly, Incipio is the latest victim to this trend. Only a few companies have really stuck to their roots while improving their product line throughout the years. Both Incipio cases I’ve tried for my Pixel have been disappointing (the V20 ones weren’t any better either), as if they lost focus on what makes them great. This post will be continuously updated with more cases as I receive them. Here is a list of cases that will be added in the near future.

Should have put like a thin rubber coating on it to give it some grip. Jon Fridman I agree, that's why the Speck Presidio Grip is my go to case. Spigen has some advantages such as the size, and cost, but if those don't matter you can't go wrong with the Presidio. CJ Diztronic TPU cases have protected my phones over the last handful of years (on almost 2 handfuls of phones). At $10, they are precision cut and provide excellent protection. Downside is that there usually aren't many color choices. Daishi I love my Diztronic TPU cases. I have had them for my Galaxy Nexus, OG Moto X and my 2015 Moto XPE. Dropped each phone from about hip to chest high and no damage to any of those phones. CJ Jon: I've been eyeing the Caseology Vault case--I really like the looks of it. Have you ever tried one from that company? Jon Fridman I have owned a handful of Caseology cases over the years. I wasn't overly thrilled with their cases considering other brands offerings for the same price. CJ Thanks for weighing in on the Caseology brand! MJ I love my Spigen Rugged Armor case for my Pixel XL. You can't beat Spigen for the price. I will say my Really Black Pixel with a black case is boring looking so really hoping to see some case options with some color soon. Suicide_Note Same here. obk88 all you need is the rhino shield crashguard bumper MJ Yep...unless you actually care about your phone at all. Phones have backs which when dropped could be the impact spot. You do know the glass back on the Pixel also scratches easily right? Deathalo The back would be plenty protected if dropped on a relatively flat surface. You plan on smashing it up against a pointy rock? Oh and the same would apply to ANY case if dropped on the screen side, so what does it matter really? MJ People do drop their phones and they land/hit on a rock on the ground, the edge of a stair, or the corner of table. We don't live on a totally flat surface of a world. LOL Screen side? Common sense would dictate the more sides protected the better but screen protectors do exist. Did you miss the part where the back glass scratches real easy? People have been complaining it about all over the web. Anything else I can explain for you? San Diego Dave MJ, I went caseless with my 6P and my iPhone 5 before that, and I can tell you that the backs of both phones looked perfect, while the edges were scratched and nicked all over. Many people never drop their phones (on rocks or otherwise), I never have, but almost everyone I know gets little scratches around the edges for various reasons. So it's not unreasonable to only want a bumper case, and Deathalo is partly right that a bumper would still protect the back from minor falls. Different strokes for different folks. No need to pick fights with people expressing a simple opinion. MJ I don't understand the point of your comment? I didn't say phones don't get nicked up and scratched on the edges or dented at the corners. You have no scratches on the back? Lucky you... I see phones with scratched up and/or cracked backs all the time. Are you making an argument I should remove my case on my phone? You did a really poor job and no thanks. San Diego Dave @oldtimefighter:disqus Nope, that wasn't my point at all. I literally summed up everything for you in one sentence: "So it's not unreasonable to only want a bumper case, and Deathalo is partly right that a bumper would still protect the back from minor falls." How did you get "you shouldn't use a case" out of that? Had I used bumper cases on my iPhone 5 and 6P, they'd be flawless today. So obk88's original post was not unreasonable, and your response - "Not if you care about your phone at all!" - isn't necessarily true. Also obk88's comment could've just been a simple statement of preference, no need to pick fights. A simple - "I prefer a case that covers the back of the phone as well, because I'm always scratching/dropping it, so a bumper won't do the job" - would've sufficed. ;) Nathan Smith The bumper goes completely around the sides of the phone, so it would be completely fine hitting the edge of a stair, the edge of a curb, etc. The edge would make contact with the case at two points, and absolutely no part of the device would be directly hit. You'd have to be pretty damn unlucky to break the phone, and most people would take that tradeoff for the ergonomics. MJ What? Do you not understand that we live in a 3D world? Phones have a back side dude! Metal dents and scratches fairly easy. Bumpers offer minimal protection and if that is good enough for you fine but NOT for me. They make full cases that are pretty slim and offer better protection which is a better value for my money. Period. End of story. David Ruddock And a big welcome to Jon, who has committed his extensive experience evaluating phone cases to this article! Peter Silie And I already thought hey, this name doesn't sound familiar! :D Artem Russakovskii It should if you read comments and G+. He's a frequent commenter. Đức Thành I didn't notice the new name before I read on for a bit and wondered, "wait, has AP ever a phone case enthusiast?" Then I scrolled up and went "ooh." Artem Russakovskii Welcome, Jon! Jon Fridman Thank you Artem! Omari Gordon What screen protector are you using? Jon Fridman I have some cheap Supershieldz one on still. My Pixel will be transitioning over to the Intelliarmor version once it ships out. JTC Did you install the intelliarmor? Does it show a halo? Jon Fridman I installed their 'pro' model, no halo or issues so far. Bikram Agarwal ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ But does this Jon know anything or he too knows nothing? Artem Russakovskii Looks like he knows a few things. Sumeet Deshmukh We know that he knows a lot about cases Đức Thành Do you know that thanks to this comment now I know that we know that he knows a lot about cases. Sumeet Deshmukh That's what I do! I drink and I know things mustbepbs Woo! Welcome Jon! Martim Welcome to the team, Jon! wickets im using a pleson.....small profile and fits nicely. kept my 6p out of harms way for 12 months......thats a huge feat right there...anyway, surprised it isnt on your 'near future' list David Ruddock I'm sure Jon would be happy to hear some recommendations. After all, there are roughly eleventy billion case manufacturers out there. Jon Fridman I owned a clear Pleson case for my Nexus 6P. In my experience the case had buttons that were overly stiff therefore rendering it virtually useless to me. I'm always open to trying new cases, but generally I won't buy the same case if I had an issue with it earlier unless the manufacturer addressed the issue(s). Lucas Laws Any chance of adding the Incipio Carnaby to your list? JSo I always end up taking my case off my phones because I like how they feels better without one. Screen Protectors are a must have though. Jeff Beck I feel the same way about pants. Zack How are screen protectors a must? I've never scratched the front of a phone in years. JSo Anything that protects the screen should be a must in my opinion. That's the one thing on a phone that you need. The casing around everything is not as important and, in some cases, easily replaceable. If you drop your phone face down, the screen protector can take most of the hit. And if that gets messed up, that's easier and cheaper to replace than a full screen. ClearlyYoureWrong Hooray, you! SlenderSniper Is Seidio not doing a case for the Pixel or XL? rcllcr Great article. Would appreciate if you could add the official google silicone case to this review: https://store.google.com/product/pixel_case_silicone Jon Fridman I've thought about buying one seeing how only the bottom is exposed. I can deal with one open note, not two like on their clear case. If I do get one, you will see it on my upcoming reviews list. Felix I would appreciate that too! And the Google Live Cases too! :) Brett I've been surprised that neither Spigen nor Ringke are making slim fit, semi-rubberized (Nexus 5-like) cases this time around. And supposedly Spigen isn't planning to: https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/5akq79/spigen_has_no_plans_on_releasing_a_thin_fit_case/. The alternatives I've found are compromised in one way or another. The Bear Motion sand case doesn't provide sufficient coverage (particularly at the top and bottom), and the material doesn't seem to fit the bill--it's sandy but not rubberized: https://www.amazon.com/Ultra-Slim-Case-Google-Pixel/dp/B01M0NBJ79/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1478033658&sr=8-1&keywords=Bear+Motion+Pixel The Maxboost mSnap is close but doesn't seem to be the right material (smooth and matte, so not much to grip), and the button cutouts don't look great: https://www.amazon.com/Maxboost-Perfect-Anti-Slip-Excellent-Protective/dp/B01M3MQCG0/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1477942297&sr=8-1&keywords=Google+Pixel+Case+-TPU+-iPhone Any alternatives in this class I haven't considered? Any insight into whether Spigen or Ringke will eventually make one? Cory Wilson Yeah I don't get that either. I actually am rocking one on my Nexus 6p now and love it Gytole I can't get off of the official 6P case, it just feels so nice IUse2Phones I have the Maxboost mSnap and like it. For TPU cases, I've always gone Diztronic. For slim cases, I like Ringke Slim. Hope they decide to make one. Suicide_Note I've had the Spigen Rugged Armor on my XL from day one. Looks good, but most importantly keeps the phone well protected. Jarrett Lennon Kaufman I still prefer my phone bare, but that Spigen is fantastic. It arrived a day before my phone and I use it whenever I'm in a situation where I expect to need the coverage, and other than making the phone bigger overall (which just makes it feels so much smaller when I take the case off), it's incredibly easy to get used to. ONLY complaint I have is my pinkie fits into, and rubs against, the cut-out groove for charging, which is uncomfortable. Otherwise it's a great case. Kurt John may want to ease up on the Otter hate. His commentary (including a personal note) about not liking Otter undermines the credibility of the review. David Ruddock I agree with Jon that Otterbox is substantially overhyped and overpriced largely because of brand recognition. They're "the" rugged case OEM, sort of the Under Armour of cases. As he points out, there's basically the same protection to be had at a substantially lower price - with a lot less bulk - unless you absolutely must have port covers. I'm not saying Otterbox is all hype, and I don't think Jon did, either. He gave the case a fair shake. Kurt I would say the article was unbiased if his claims that the other cases offer the same protection was backed up with some tests performed to validate the statement. Show me a test where they both fail at the same point of impact. The only example provided was a sample N of 1 saying "the Speck never broke for me". Word choice like "trivial" and "comical" give him away. Jon Fridman I would absolutely love to do a drop test, unfortunately I also can't sacrifice my phone if the tests got the best out of my Pixel XL. I can ask each company for procedures used when establishing their claim and see where that gets us. Jon Fridman I understand where you're coming from, but I did purchase the case to use not for a review earlier in October. I shared my personal view, and other information in the review to give people a better overall understanding. I want to make if clear that no special treatment was given to any case, nor was I asked to say/not say anything. I'm always open to trying different cases regardless of my initial feelings toward the oem, design etc. The Spigen Rugged Armor and Speck Presidio Grip both offer 'militaty grade'drop protection in s amich smaller package. Otterbox is the only only with a holster and true front protection as I noted in my review giving them a slight advantage at the price of added bulk. You're certainly welcome to disagree with me, I'm by no means the final say on any product, case or other accessory. I ordered a view stemming from my experiences, opinion and factual information the best I could. I will keep your comment in mind for when I add future reviews. Lando I'm curious about why you wouldn't compare the cases above to the otterbox commuter. I've had them for 3 phones, and they don't seem to have much more bulk than the spiegen case I looked at, and the port covers are definitely handy. And at about $40, it's not like they're crazy overpriced Jon Fridman I don't have the commuter, although generally I would agree depending on what Spigen case. Personally I'm waiting on LifeProof (OtterBox) to release their case hopefully before the new year. blindexecutioner The google clear case would have been so much better if the entire thing was matte. I bought one and promptly returned it due to the rainbowing effect. I can confirm it does scratch really easily too. Just wiping it off created all sorts of very faint scratches/swirl marks. San Diego Dave I also returned it. It was a flimsy piece of plastic. I expect that from a $7 case on Amazon, not a $30 case from Google. ClearlyYoureWrong You should expect it from any glossy, clear, plastic case, period. San Diego Dave Nice name, haha. I've had hard plastic cases that were nicer in the past, but they were kind of thick. This Google one is way too thin, which is why it feels extra flimsy and cheap. Anyway I got the Spigen Liquid Crystal case and it's perfect (and only $14). Nick Gangemi I have the Spiegen clear case, and it is much better. Doesn't scratch easily at all and doesn't show mark very easily either. person I'm a fan of the silicone case. Crazy soft, reasonably grippy, sturdy and minimalist. Paired a white XL with a grey case for a panda look. Đức Thành A phone case enthusiast. Wow. Does AP aim to have it all? Just like Google? Ahem, back on topic. That Spigen case looks really sweet. And if I'm correct, they made some nice Nexus 5 case as well. Maybe I'll just buy that one for my N5 and pretend that it's a new phone case for the new Pixel I own (I actually don't). Sob. EnerJi How important are screen protectors these days? I've run case-less for a couple of years and suffered for it with a couple of cracked screens. With my next phone (likely a Pixel XL, if it gets a decent sale) I'm planning to put it in a case. I'm willing to consider a screen protector as well, but is Gorilla Glass so scratch resistant that it's unnecessary? (I would never intentionally put my phone in a pocket with keys or coins, but of course, mistakes and accidents happen.) Perhaps most importantly to me, would they negatively impact the touch latency of the Pixel? JSo I've been using Tempered Glass screen protectors for a little while now. Before, I just used generic ones. But the glass ones are really nice. In my experience, they don't take anything away from the use or look of the screen. Protection-wise, I'd rather have it than not. If something cracks or scratches, I'd rather it be the protector than the actual screen. Jon Fridman I would say they're very important, especially in my line of work. I've already noticed micro scratches on my fingerprint scanner, so I couldn't imagine what my screen would look like after 2 weeks. blakeleeper @jonfridman:disqus Nice Article. I currently use the Spigen Neo Hybrid on my XL. BTW Which TGSP do you use? Jon Fridman Thank you! I currently have a cheap one off Amazon made by SuperShieldz until I can find something a little better. jonathan3579 Do you have the link to it? Jon Fridman I'm currently using an cheap SuperShieldz one from Amazon. The TGSP isn't what I would call great fyi. It covers the screen with no halo that's all that matters. https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01LZT3PGR/ref=yo_ii_img?ie=UTF8&psc=1 mustbepbs Excellent article. I love posts that review cases for phones that just came out. It's hard to wade through YT videos to find good case reviews. Abhishek Saral Rhinoshield Crashguard Bumper all the way!🙌 Michael Sullivan Ditto, really liking it. Only wish the buttons were not so hard to push but not a big enough of an issue to not use this Bumper. Robert Butler I can't stand mine. Ports are too small, buttons are bad, and my phone doesn't sit level on my desk anymore. Jon Fridman I see the button issues from the Nexus 6P version hasn't been addressed then. Robert Butler I think they are worse! Thomas Jensen The buttons can be fixed nicely if you use the small blunt end of something like a chopstick. You push and stretch the power and volume buttons out then in stretching them several times with medium pressure. Do it on both ends and both sides. It will loosen them up and will work great. (just don't push too hard w the stick and break it). Try it. You will be happy! Good_Ole_Pinocchio This is why I love this site. Always going to extra mile. A lot of other blogs would just give you their "Here's a list of the best cases we never reviewed with referral links" BevansDesign A lot of other blogs HAVE done that. Jeez there are a lot of garbage sites to wade through. This article is like a sharp, shiny needle in a monetization haystack. Tomfoolery Seriously. AP has shown themselves to be the only Android news blog that takes itself seriously. They consistently produce new, useful, substantiated content. I don't see many other android journalists (or even other journalists in other fields) do as fantastic of a job as you guys do. The APK teardowns, fantastic sources of information. Don't see others doing this. You don't just post "Oh boy i think this is happening rumor rumor rumor." You go through the code line by line to see what it could mean. That's dedication. Every week, the "x apps of the week." Awesome! What a great way to find apps. Original reviews, insightful and honest opinions, I love it! All other general news. Always original content. Rarely do I see recycled "this rumor happened" and "this is coming out" like I do from literally every other blog. Getting to know Android x.x.x. Perfect. Probably my favorite recurring thing on any blog ever. Basically, what I'm trying to say, is thank you so much for putting out actual content. Thank you for not trying to get pageviews from "hot" titles and "latest rumors!" Thank you for trying to get pageviews from writing solid articles and putting thought into almost every post. Seriously, I love you guys. I hope you can tell from all the upvotes and how many of your stories hit the front page! But even still, I wanted to let you know how absolutely grateful I am (and we all are)! Stick around, and keep up the fantastic work! We don't take it for granted, even if it might seem like it sometimes! tl,dr; I LOVE YOU ANDROID POLICE! THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING! <3 Derek R Thanks Jon! I've had the Presidio sitting in my VZW cart for a while now. Read this article and pulled the trigger. Currently alternating between the Spigen Rugged Armor and Maxboost Liquid Skin. Both are decent. I was really excited about the Rhinoshield Crashguard Bumper. Got it in yesterday and was less than impressed. It doesn't flow with the phone at all. Tapered edges make the bottom of the phone look like its going to pop right out. Looks awkward and feels odd in my hand. wire141 Presidio isn't as grippy as the candy shell but it's close. Love mine! Ordered silicone grey from Google to check it out. I find it to slippery for me. Received today, waiting for email to return. Thanks for the article Jon! Jon Fridman I wasn't thrilled with my RhinoShield either when I had my Nexus 6P. The buttons on it were awful in addition to the bumper being larger than comparable cases like the Rugged Armor. Speck did an excellent job with their Presidio which isn't something I say lightly about cases. I can be very picky when it comes to what cases I will actually use not just buy. Right now I alternate between the Rugged Armor and Presidio depending on what I feel like using. Nexus Ordered the rugged armor one from Spigen. Love it! _jsw_ Excellent article, and welcome, Jon! Spigen case: ordered. I'm curious: have you found or heard rumor of any decent wallet cases or at least flip cases like the Nexus 6P Folio? I had one of those (the official Folio) on my 6P (since given to my brother, post-Pixel XL purchase), and I miss it. Well made, classy look, excellent screen protection. I've yet to find something similar for the XL. Jeff Badger Case-Mate has one; though, it is $60. http://www.case-mate.com/collections/google-cases-and-covers/products/wallet-folio-black-leather _jsw_ Excellent - thanks. A bit pricey for me, but I'll keep it in mind! Evan When I purchased my Pixel at the Verizon Store the salesman gave me large selection of cases to look through, one being a wallet case... I couldn't tell you the brand or anything else but they are out there. It should be noted though that I have a standard pixel so the case may not be made for the XL asian_slaw What screen protector do you have on your Pixel? Shane Curious about this as well. Still trying to find a good one. _jsw_ Thirded. Krups My Yootech screen protector (https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LY8LVSB) looks similar to this one. This might be the same one. Edit: Pictures - https://goo.gl/photos/FF7F1vYegbWd8qRB9 Jon Fridman Please see the comment above Bob Does no one miss the rubberized Adopted case for the Nexus 6P??? It was slim yet very durable and protective. jawsnnn Question... Isn't the glass window supposed to be there because of all the sensors etc... If so, will the phones with cases covering that area function as well as a naked phone? BTW, excellent review! _jsw_ As long as the case is transparent to electromagnetic waves (as all of these are), there won't be issues. Metal cases would cause problems if they covered the necessary areas of the back/sides. ×XWreckTeamX× Love the software of the pixel I hate the way that phone looks though its so ugly!!! sgtguthrie I won't buy a case without a kickstand anymore. I used to always buy Seidio, but they're taking too long to release cases. I think it'll be Spigen Slim Armor for my XL. Denis Wagner You typed something twice on the spigen case part: "but it can also be found for $13.99 (as I'm writing this) on but it can also be found for $13.99 (as I'm writing this) on Amazon." Jon Fridman Thank you, it should be fixed now. Thankfully Rita didn't see it first ;) jonathan3579 Who made that TGSP? The fitment looks about perfect! Tom Luley Would love to know as well. Jon Fridman I'm currently using an cheap SuperShieldz one from Amazon. The TGSP isn't what I would call great fyi. It covers the screen with no halo that's all that matters. https://www.amazon.com/gp/aw/d/B01LZT3PGR/ref=yo_ii_img?ie=UTF8&psc=1 tom_roars Rocking the Spigen Slim Armor on the Pixel XL.Love it Cory S I'd like to see a test on the effects of thermal throttling with, and without a case. Especially with some of these really thick rubbery cases. Give it a shot on a 810 device to really see if it has any major difference. T4rd I've been a big fan of Supcase Beetle on my past few phones. My M8 and 6P took some insane falls with it, 2 from a roller coaster and carnival ride, and weren't damaged at all. For the minimal bulk they add, their protection is stellar. https://www.amazon.com/SUPCASE-Unicorn-Premium-Protective-Release/dp/B01M8KBFFP/ref=sr_1_2?ie=UTF8&qid=1478195296&sr=8-2&keywords=supcase+pixel slurivariv The Spigen Case with the Kickstand is my case of choice. Sooo good. Preben Nielsen We need more cases that can hide that ugly back with the glass.... MrCalifornia I just got my diztronic. It's exactly like the one I had on my 6P and it's perfect. Simple and smallish. Martin B. I just love, that Ringke is still adding opening for small strap for their Fusion cases. I found it accidentally, when I bought mine for Nexus 5, and with it on hand, its impossible to drop phone during taking photos or other activities. Are there any other case, which have this feature? https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/ced021331f97beeb38f90ce5ca9f9201386118ddcaf29bae0cd6e16547f3cf96.jpg Abhi I like Spigen, they have a lot of simple but elegant looking cases without too much going on. SHunter You can get it in any color, so long as its black. Henry Pham Part of the attraction, for me, to buying a Pixel is I'd be able to buy the $99 2 year drop insurance from Google so that I'd be able to go case free with less worry. And then there's the $150 screen replacement at a repair chain. Like the article says, buying from Google should hopefully provide better customer support later. Tired_Guy Anyone else using the headphones made for Project Fi and the Nexus 6? White, have a plug in for a 2nd person? Big round base that no case will allow to work. Had similar issues with cases that won't handle well a 90 degree plus or where teh hole is simply too small to allow full connection. The Spigen I got for my Pixel XL lets the Project Fi headphones work but it's on the edge of popping out. (The fact that headphone inline volume up triggers the assistant is an irritation for another time.) BetterWithRoot I am currently using the Rhinoshield (https://rhinoshield.io/collections/google-pixel-google-pixel-xl). The texture is decent, the buttons are a bit harder to press, but if you 'stretch' the buttons out it makes it a lot better to use. I like being able to feel the open back and glass of the phone. I had a bumper case on my Moto-X that I loved, so this case is just what i wanted. I am a bit worried about the open back, as the moto-X had the leather which looked better as it weathered. One issue i found with the Rhinoshield is the supplied USB-B to USB-C is a bit thicker and have to give it a slight push, the USB-C to USB-C fits like a glove, no additional pushing. Both mine and my lady's pixel exhibit this issue. I wonder if the size of the cable is slightly smaller for the Type C to Type C. AOSPrevails I love Spigen Touch Armor, $5 more than the Rugged armor case with a hard back & a kickstand. John Misoulis @jonfridman:disqus, you should try the Spigen Ultra Hybrid Google Pixel Case. i got it from Amazon for $20 for my Pixel XL and love it. It looks and feels like a cross between a hard case and a rubber case. the only thing i wish i could find is a plug for the USB-C port. Jon Fridman I should be reviewing quite a few Spigen cases shortly. I'll add them to the upcoming list once I know which ones. climbhigher I have the "made by Google - clear" case on my pixel right now as I type on it. I sent a message to support on the Google store earlier this afternoon about how incredibly poor quality this case actually is. I agree with the entire review and would like to add that the clear top part attracts scratches unlike any phone case I have ever used. Could have bought 3 better quality cases on Amazon for $30... Matthew Benyamin I originally got the clear case by Google, but I hated it. It got scratched as soon as I set it down. I ended up replacing it with the Spigen rugged armor and have no regrets. I like that it keeps the look on the back and the body lines of the phone. I am also a huge fan of the power button texture. Can you guys add one of those rhino bumper cases to your review line up too? Fatty Bunter Guh...all those cases except the clear google one just look offensive to my eyes. Those poor beautiful pixels may as well be HTC Thunderbolts under there. Michael Sørensen Con for all: ugly as sin Nicholas Matranga Nice to see a grat selction Danny Alvarez You should add the Neo Hybrid from Spigen in here. I bought it and it's very good, good protection and best of all, they have a blue version that matches the Really Blue from the Pixels and looks really nice. http://www.spigen.com/products/neo-hybrid-google-pixel-xl-case?variant=27822451009 leganzish "This marks the first time that Otterbox (the company that also owns Lifeproof) has made a case for a Google device." Maybe you're not considering Nexus phones to be Google devices here. Otterbox definitely has made Nexus cases in the past. Don't think they've done so recently, but I had an Otterbox on my Galaxy Nexus. https://www.amazon.com/OtterBox-Defender-Series-Samsung-Galaxy/dp/B006JO232E Lawrence Pixel phone is so uninspiring. The glass on the back is awful, the finger print sensor should be on front. Huge bezels. Come on. Adam Margeson The iP7 phone is so uninspiring. Same bland boring look it's had for years, just with a second camera and missing home button. And some people like the fingerprint sensor being on the back, thank you. Lawrence I got the 5X for a two weeks and unlocking it while at my desk was painful. I gave the phone away and got my Note 3 back with front home button and delayed lock. Adam Margeson So, then the 5X and Pixel aren't for you. We get that. You've posted your thoughts on them in nearly every article for the last several months, and I can't quite figure out if you're an Apple fanboi [sic] or just a run-of-the-mill troll. Most of the rest of us are reasonably impressed with Google's latest offering. Sure, it could still use some refinement, but for a first-run "Google" phone, it's definitely headed in the right direction. Hopefully next year's device will shut you up. Lawrence No I'm not an Apple fan. I have a note 3and owned at least 4 nexus. I'm just trying to bring the Pixel down to its value which is around 375 for thr xl version, then I'll buy it and deal with the bad placed fingerprint reader and rest my Starbucks coffee on its bezel. Adam Margeson Add wireless charging back in and this thing easily is worth more than my N5 when I first bought it for $400 (32GB). Better build, way better camera, etc... The N5 was initially called a boring look, yet it's still being used as the device silhouette for most screenshots, even outside of Google. I'd start it closer to $500 (for the base storage) as a reasonable compromise. I can see this phone lasting 3 or 4 years if treated nicely. Saying that you want this quality of a phone for $375 over-values the budget "flagship killers" who do cut important corners, including software updates, crappy user experience, non-optimized camera (taking a great sensor and putting it in without setting it up, ala OP3 and others), etc. Have you taken your high-school economics course yet, or did you already fail it? JohnyNoLegs I keep double tapping the screen on my wifes Note4 and it doesn't wake up, then go to unlock it and it takes what feels like 10 years. Nexus 5X unlocks far quicker, and it now has double tap to wake. So it trumps the note 3. Zack Or just buy insurance and don't drop your phone :D Naked baby. ClearlyYoureWrong If you don't drop your phone and you've never cracked a screen why should you, Zack, purchase insurance? icethegreat Ish happens Nizar Noor Hi guys. If you tweet @Caudabe https://twitter.com/Caudabe they might want to consider making a case for Pixel. They're iPhone cases are great - very slim and durable. San Diego Dave I purchased the clear case from Google and returned it for a refund immediately. It's flimsy plastic with no grip. Definitely not worth $30. I just got the Spigen Liquid Crystal case (clear), and it's perfect. Very slim, very grippy, and only $14. thereasoner Went with the Spigen myself. It was one of the first ones available and because I pre-ordered on day one and got my Pixel 2 days early, I needed a case right away. It's a quality soft case but I like the slim hard shell Spigen usually. Chris Vander Maas I'd like to know what he does for his full time job to necessitate needing a case, tbh reading case reviews from someone that gives the impression of not properly taking care of a device, seems a bit off to me. Is this for the people who insist on walking over concrete staring down at the phone and not paying attention to the world around? I've never broken a phone and I've been using smartphones since before iOS and Android Not for you A few more slim/thin cases would be nice. Any chance you can mention how much bulk the cases add? i.e. how wide & tall are they? Felix Yeah,I would appreciate that too! For me a case must be as thin as possible. Brandon What is the glass screen protector you're using? I can't find one that actually covers the entire screen. The one at this IMG specifically looks like it actually covers the screen properly. https://www.androidpolice.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/nexus2cee_IMG_0590-2.jpg JohnyNoLegs Its not a glass one I bet. Can't get that coverage with a glass one. Volodesi Spigen always makes good cases. It's all I've used for my past three phones. thomas sim Waiting for Slim Armor, had one on my N5 and love it. Tronsmart Welcome Jon! mjl99 not a fan of cases but i liked this article. Thanks for serving too. Merkin McGee https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01LWWLAYY/ref=oh_aui_search_detailpage?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Got one of those. I have had a variation of the same case on every phone I have had since the Galaxy Nexus. Just a simple TPU case. has a nice grip due to the texture on the sides. Doesn't slip out of the hand so it doesn't really fall. bravo2wo Have you evaluated the cases available from Ringke?? I use their Fusion model on my Samsung S7E and am very happy; especially given the low price. bravo2wo Duh, just saw it on your list of "to be evaluated", sorry! I did just just order an Onyx model and am anxiously awaiting its arrival. Frank Duque As a long RhinoShield supporter, I say they should be added to your list of reviews. Thank you for your time Evan Great article! Originally I wanted to get a blue pixel but they were sold out at the Verizon store I went to. Ended up getting the silver instead and in the long run I definitely think that will help me out with getting cases. With a blue one I would have all but had to get a clear case to showcase the color! With the silver I'm a little less concerned with that so I've got a nice looking case on here. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/2c8d81971259efbcd3b582e944707b74f9a5cb1cc07253c559638d0653ec348a.jpg RuR Can you add Spigem Though Armor? cbryancan I started with the Google branded hard clear plastic and was disappointed by the way it looks like it "sticks" to the glass on the upper back. Just got the Spigen Liquid Crystal and I am very happy with it so far. Usually I don't like soft materials, but it fits well and gives the phone it a nice tacky surface to hold onto without being obtrusive or bulky. Enrique Can you also review some tempered glass screen protectors? There are a lot of bad reviews on Amazon because most of them don't cover the entire screen Jon Fridman Reviewing TGSP's would be fun, but at the same time it can be difficult. I'm not sure what I'll be reviewing, or writing next, so I'll keep your request in mind. abc The first two cases are ugly af. ryraansh Can you do the Incipio Carnaby? It looks pretty nice: https://www.incipio.com/cases/smartphone-cases/google-smartphone-cases-accessories/google-pixel-cases/carnaby-google-pixel-case.html Nathaniel Carter I already ordered but maybe add this caseology case to the mix? http://amzn.to/2fsi4z8 DKS The phone is big enough as-is. I tried an Obliq TPU case but it just made the phone feel too bulky. The best for me so far has been the BearMotion case with a Sandstone texture like on the OnePlus phones. It's thin so it doesn't offer much in the way of drop protection but it provides a good grip and scratch protection. I'd like to see some 'skins' reviewed with those same qualities in mind. Jon Fridman Are you asking whether or not I'll review thin 'barely there' cases like Spigen's Thin Fit (if they made one for the Pixel/Pixel XL)? I'm open to adding some thinner ones in the future. Personally I find the phone too small given how I also use a V20 for work daily. On that note I understand where you're coming from because not everyone enjoys larger phones. Try Thinking I disagree with your take on the tech21 case's cutouts. It's actually a good thing that they have a less precise camera cutout. If those cutouts are too tight you get does screwing with the laser autofocus. This seems to be a growing problem with the Spiegen case. Thanks for the reviews! Jon Fridman I've used the camera often enough with both cases, and had no issues myself. The laser is not blocked by the case, nor does it come close to covering the return port. If you're experiencing an issue, or if it's more widespread (I'm not saying it is), then I will consider making a note in the review. I'm glad you enjoyed the reviews thus far, more will be coming shortly. Try Thinking Hey Jon, The problem isn't so much that the case itself is blocking the laser, but that the cutout is so small that dust quickly accumulates in the cutout and blocks the laser, and you have to remove the case to clean it. Here's a link to people describing the issue on Reddit: https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/5ctfvs/your_case_is_likely_causing_your_auto_focusing/ Looking forward to more of your reviews and thanks for the response! Jon Fridman Thank you for the link. I'm overly OCD about dust on my phone which is why I always carry a microfiber cloth no matter where I go. I can see dust being an issue only if your phone is constantly dirty. I live in West Texas where you can wash your car and have it look horrible in 5 minutes or less. I haven't experienced the issue myself, but I can a statement addressing that. Another way to remove the dust without taking your phone out of the case is to use canned air, or blow on it? I have an issue with dust getting into the top speaker grill more than I do on the laser (similar issue). Orlando aka Pixel XL i just like to go raw dog, i just dont feel safe that way, ZING! kennethreynolds8 Thanks Jon for doing the leg work for us, greatly appreciated dude. Jon Fridman You're welcome, I hope you enjoy the reviews. I will post more early next week assuming the cases arrive. Sachin Bahal What material is the Pixel XL Case by Google - Clear made from? Is it TPU, silicone or is it a hard plastic? Jon Fridman I believe it's some sort of polycarbonate judging by the thickness, rigidity and how the material feels. op12 Yep, that's also what Google lists on the product detail page. https://store.google.com/product/pixel_xl_case_clear b00sted I have the Spigen Clear TPU. Had The Damn Rainbow effect but i like clear so can see the dbrand and I tossed a club sticker behind the case. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6aceda2332b5ac48a3d2224f1825b6039a6e5f8524cf24d87270175e3a72f9e8.jpg Not for you PSA - someone on xda-dev has noted focusing issues with the Spigen Rugged Armor: http://forum.xda-developers.com/showpost.php?p=69637754&postcount=21 It sounds like Spigen will be revising the cutouts. Kyle Brabender I had the tech21 case. i laughed when i read your comment about the power button. It's so true. I moved to the spiegen crystal case. so much better. Jon Fridman The more I use Tech 21's case the more I notice these issues. I picked my phone up as my alarm went off and couldn't hit the buttons to shut it off, yes it's that bad. Impulse_Vigil Loving these reviews, there's a couple in here I had looked at with trepidation and the reviews give me good cause to steer clear. Looking forward to that Diztronic Pixlee review as it's caught my eye, I'm happy with everything about the Spigen Rugged Armor but want something more colorful for day to day use. I had several solid cases from them in the past too. Any chance you'll review some of these new fangled (to me) 2-piece cases? I'm not sure if having a plastic bumper around TPU case really adds any protection but they certainly make for an interesting look. I'm alluding to the likes of the Spigen Neo Hybrid (only for the XL thus far), Caseology Parallax series, and Orzly AirFrame. Cruzerlite's TPU cases might be worth a look too (there's two back designs, one with covered buttons and one without), tho for me they're a known quantity; about as solid as Diztronic's IMO. Jon Fridman I should have a number of Spigen cases on the way including the NeoHybrid. Once whose arrive I'll voice my opinions on each one. Concerning the Caseology and Orzly cases I won't be getting those unless something changes. Impulse_Vigil Looking forward to it! I actually emailed Spigen a few weeks ago asking about the Neo Hybrid for the smaller Pixel and they replied (really quickly) that it was coming but they didn't have an ETA... I've been meaning to email them again, because the Neo Crystal came out since then, and I'm not quite sure if that's what they meant... Without having seen them in person, I much prefer the look of the regular Neo. Not crazy about clear TPU myself (reminds me of couches with vinyl wraps), it tends to yellow more noticeably, and the plastic back on the Crystal Neo seems like it'd make it bulkier. Anyway, carry on with the great work! Few case reviews are as incisive but to the point as these, they usually read like adverts and have little basis for comparison. Having one writer review several is great IMO. Ryan I bought the Incipio Octane for my 5". It's awesome. Jon Fridman I'm considering the Octane case. Back when I had a S7 Edge and HTC 10, the Octane was great. I expect Incipio to maintain their good reputation for that case unless some changes were made. T4rd Shame about the new Supcase design. They've been my fav cases on my previous two phones (One M8 and 6P). They are pretty much perfect on those phones. I had my M8 fall from a roller coaster mid-loop with the UB and it was still perfect somehow after landing on some loose concrete. So I've been a big fan of them since then. Jon Fridman SupCase had a very unique design before this generation. Now we are left with a boring, mediocre looking brick that doesn't stand our anymore. I would like to see them revert back to the N6/6P styles personally. ericlee Good review thank youuuu! :D Jon Fridman Thank you, more cases will be added in the coming week. NinoBr0wn Was it mentioned anywhere in the article what screen protector that is? Jon Fridman I didn't mention the one in using in the write up, but I did a few times in the comments. I wouldn't recommend it unless you really need one and don't mind not having your whole screen covered (the actual display not the front). It's a Super Shieldz one from Amazon that I've been too lazy to replace lately. NinoBr0wn Oh ok then. I haven't been able to find one that covers the entire screen, and I'm guessing that because of the 2.5D glass. I could use my Liquid Armor for scratches, but I wanted one with drop protection. Erik O Any chance you can take a look at Obliq cases? Neat looking designs https://obliqproduct.com/products/google-pixel-case-flex-pro or https://obliqproduct.com/products/google-pixel-case-slim-meta?variant=28018622529 Robert Butler Is it too much to ask for a backless bumper with the textured power button? Come on google, lets get the accessory game on point. SAM Bump up the brightness in pics. Cases are not easily visible. broken42 I'd suggest the Caseology Parallax for the list, I have it and it's great. Anfronie Good lord those all suck. JPJ Thanks for the thorough look. I went with the Spigen case. It was readily available and fairly cheap. I like it. Adam Margeson I hate using cases on phones because they've already gotten to be too large for proper one-handed use, but the Spigen case is a comforting experience. It doesn't add much in the way of bulk, but it really keeps my mind at ease that I'm not going to shatter something the first time I drop it. Watcharapong Dokmai try rhinoshield you will love it :) get it here >>> http://www.ebay.com/itm/201722023016 Jon Fridman Thank you for the recommendation, but I will not be reviewing the Evolutive Rhino Shield bumper. My experience with their bumper was extremely poor with my Nexus 6, and I would prefer not to have a repeat of that. Orlando aka Pixel XL Dont review it, I used the case and it doesn't fit the factory charger plug. Lunkman The one I received fits just fine- I think it's great- and I typically keep my phones naked. Perhaps the one you received simply had a manufacturing defect? ALEX P. Thanks for the reviews. Does anyone know when the LifeProof cases will be available? Jon Fridman I have no idea when it's due to be released. I'm going to order one whenever they become available given the industry I work in. The one downside I can see from the start is how no TGSP will fit under the built in screen protector. When the case goes up for preorder I'll add it to my upcoming list. PiGSeL I just received the Speck Presidio Grip for my Pixel XL and I'm pretty unhappy with it. The polycarbonate side grips are very hard - I find them uncomfortable. The USB cutout is also sharp, which is a big problem for pinky resting. I will probably send it back in favor of the Diztronic TPU. Mike Dillinger i'm new to your site. I have a very blue pixel and am looking for a glass screen protector for it. I got one from the verizon store where I got my phone, but its starting to slowly come off at the edges. BTW I have the Speidio clear case and love it. Eric Horchuck Great review, thanks! FYI... I'm pretty sure that Google started selling cases for the Nexus 4. I remember that I wanted their "bumper case" but it was out of stock. Ben Rees I'm using the Cruzerlite Androidified case. Love it. Great protection and the look and feel is great. Amir I got Maxboost mSnap and Caseology Parallax for my XL, and I think both deserve to hold top spot on this article. lara141 Here’s the tutorial to solve the problems of your google pixele & To unlock the device when you forgot Pattern,Pin,Password.. http://www.mobiles6.com/how-to-reset-google-pixel-xl.html Gerald Mark Is this list sort of in order by best to worst? There's no way to be exact, and I also can get a really good idea of what case to try regardless, but I'm unsure between the first 3 or so. Thank goodness I didn't grab a case from Google. I knew they were overpriced but realizing they barely do their job too besides looking good is sad. I'm waiting till I finally get the XL I ordered for the fear of this easily scratched phone to really set in, then I'll choose a case. I know how to be SUPER careful in the meantime. Thanks for a super in depth review of cases for a phone, it was also a little entertaining. CC Any idea when this is getting updated next? I've been really looking forward to the Diztronic review! Jon Fridman Good news, I published the update. I've been a little busy at work due to some downsizing, departmental changes etc. supersanborn Ironic, I was just thinking that it felt like my Diztronic was not holding its shape super well despite looking great. Would be curious to know the top pics of all these cases at some point. Maybe like best of looks, best of protection, best of grip? Jon Fridman I can add my recommendations once it's all said and done. I'm waiting on Lifeproof to release their FRE case first. The Incipio Octane review should be added later this week too, although I prefer adding them in batches. supersanborn Thank you! Jon Fridman You're welcome Impulse_Vigil Really? Mine is like 5 months old now and I feel it's held its shape better than any other TPU case I've ever had... It's actually still really tight around the volume buttons, which is usually the first place they start to loosen up. Granted I tend not to swipe right against the edge out of habit (for years now)... The one place where I'm noticing some give on mine is at the top, and it's actually when I push in on it (or down if I'm holding the phone normally). My guess is the top has expanded a little due to the drag it's constantly experiencing from me pulling the phone out of my pocket (specially when seated), as I almost always always store my phone top-first in pocket (upside down). I've got a second one (bought teal first then orange once they came back in stock post Christmas), should try slap it on and see if it feels much snugger. Michael Carlyle "large camera cutout" - con I'd rather have that than the autofocus issues with all the Spigens... Jon Fridman I've noticed the issue with both large, and small camera cutouts. Because of this, I believe the issue is somewhat independent of the cutout size. It could be due to dirt, or other factors too. Edit: For the record, only two cases consistently have that issue: The Spigen Slim Armor, and Tech 21 EVO Check. Andrew Wilson I got the Caseology Parallax the other day and I am really liking it so far. The textured back has a really good grip to it but manages a more stylish look than a lot of the other options. In addition to adding a color accent, the ABS ring over the TPU gives a nice rigidity in the places your fingers naturally rest (something I didn't realized bothered me about my TPU only case until it was gone). The ports are plenty large and the ring around the fingerprint scanner has a nice slope to it, sort of funneling your finger to the right place. I don't know how it will hold up to drops, but it's so much easier to hold than the base phone I'm a lot less worried about it. Lastly, I paid $15 for it. My big gripes so far are that the volume buttons don't have any sort of texture to them (something I like very much about the base phone), and when I am pulling the phone out of my pocket my fingers seem to gravitate to the port around the camera. Thanks for the thorough coverage, if this case doesn't work out this gives me a good idea about where to look next. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e71a30a606c19cac33ee8e740ae84f0024709401783f473fcdd36b490e52033b.jpg dabug91 I second this option. We got the burgundy one for my mom's blue Pixel the other day and she loves it. The quality of this case is superb for its price and we will probably be getting her the blue one as well. The geometric pattern and texture on the back feels great in the hand and I would be buying myself the black version if I had a Pixel as my phone. Easily a 9/10 for this case. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/4ec568f9f8802b3f49ba18bd010db79bc7ecb253001672e7ba4392d7c7f3bc06.jpg Impulse_Vigil Burgundy on blue looks like an eyesore. I like either on their own, just not the combo... Personal preference tho. Dunno if it's the photo or what but the plastic trim looks almost pink there. I wish they hadn't recycled half the iPhone color palette. The black/grey is kinda boring and the other two have gold trims which don't match up super well with any of the Pixels, plus I'm just not a fan of gold. They had some with silver trim for Galaxy/iPhones but never made them for Pixels. Impulse_Vigil Does the phone lay flat with it or does that camera bump raise it up? I keep wondering that every time I see those Caseology cases, almost tried one but I've been so happy with the Diztronic Pixlee that I just bought a second one of those as backup. The negative comments about the similar Spigen Neo also kinda scared me away... I do still like that unique pattern on the Parallax tho. Andrew Wilson Looking at it from the side I guess it does stick out a tiny bit, but when I lay my phone on a table the way it sits is indistinguishable from perfectly flat. 4 months in, and I am still very happy with it. Impulse_Vigil Good to know, thx. Orlando aka Pixel XL I suggest the bumper case from rhinoshield. The port doesn't fit all of the type c cables but it does for most of mine. MJ I love my Spigen Rugged Armor case but black on my Really Black Pixel XL is a little boring. Thinking I am going to be picking up a couple of colorful Diztronic Pixlee cases. Impulse_Vigil They're nice, pretty unique look, and more understated than his photos portray... At least in teal, the orange is pretty loud but not as neon orange as the photos make it look, more like the inside of an actual orange. Mine has held up better than other TPU cases after 5+ months of use, real stiff around the volume buttons still with only a hint of stretching at the top where it's always dragging against my pocket as I pull the phone out. I only noticed when I randomly pushed down on it one day... If you put your phone right side up in your pocket the bottom might stretch sooner which would be more noticeable. I wrote a long Amazon review and I still stand by everything there... I should add some pics with the OJ and a video clip, the Pixlee shimmer effect is hard to describe. Demigod121 This is the case I have for my XL - http://www.i-blason.com/google-pixel-xl-armorbox-case.html?color=25 I'm a big fan of the clunky Otterbox cases, however I have to say I am really impressed with this case. Very sturdy and doesn't add the bulk that the Otterbox cases have. Rich Stone So clearly this article is about cases, but I'm curious as to what screen shield you have on in these photos? Brayden Reesor I'm one who prefers a case to be as thin and light as possible, mostly to provide scratch protection and grip. I've been using the Bear Motion "Sandy" case and it is really awesome. Very thin, and the texture is great! All the cutouts are perfect. And it was only $8. https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B01MA16WSH/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o06_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1 Marcos on another site (or maybe on a previous post on this site), the slim tudia case was recommended. im awaiting mine for the Pixel (not XL). tyb82 Man those tempered glass screen covers are hideous. TimXer I bought a clear high grip case from LK on Amazon for $4 and it's awesome... perfect cutouts, non-slip grip Pedram Haghzaban How about Simply Carbon Fiber? digidude In my experience, an inexpensive TPU case with a screen guard is plenty to protect a phone in the most common accidents. compuguy1088 Will you be reviewing the seidio Surface ad DILEX cases by chance? dmo580 My Neo Hybrid is completely tight. I've seen where the frame is loose but I've owned one for my iPhone 5, 6, and Pixel and its very snug on the Pixel. I have seen loose Neo Hybrids before but this one is certainly not one. Perhaps there's lot to lot variation? If anything I'd be worried about the frame breaking. I had 2 break on my iPhone 6 and my iPhone 5 one broke at the bottom (USB port) Justin the neo hybrid on my phone doesnt suffer the flaws indicated, the only con from my month and a bit of use since it launched is that the back is really slippery Pedram Haghzaban Don't forget case from Simply Carbon Fiber Corey Miecielica Great article on pretty much all the popular cases out right now! I did notice that more cases as they come along will be added to this post. Looking forward to checking back time to time. Also would love to see some ultra thin case makers like Peel if they ever come along for Pixel phones! Kevin Davis The Speck presidio grip(also available in blue for the xl, through Verizon), and the Tech21 evocheck are my favorites. Also, you're correct about the Incipio octane, the border on the one for the S7edge I had was great, it's crap on the one for the Pixel, and the buttons are indeed terrible. chris Thanks for the article! I bought a spigen rugged armor on your suggestion and really like it! Question: which screen protector do you use? I've been having a hard time finding a decent one (tempered glass preferably) that doesnt have a ton of bubbles under the glass once installed. Thanks! Kole Hart I was a little disappointed to see the Spigen Tough Armor case to kinda get the crap rating. But I'm sure I haven't used as many cases as you have so I can appreciate the honesty. Overall I enjoyed the article and appreciate the extensive reviews of the many cases that are made for the Pixel. Jon Fridman Spigen has too many cases with so subtle differences to make me choose the Tough Armor. I would always take a Slim Armor over the Tough for reasons stated in my review. Kole Hart I just might check out the slim armor seeing as it was the other option I was going to go with. Any chance you could recommend a screen protector for the Pixel (Not the XL)? Jon Fridman I don't own a regular Pixel although they should be the same fit for both models. Obviously the XL has a bigger screen; cut should be identical across both models. Intelliarmor is usually my go to TGSP, even now it seems to be working fine. Carpentractor Love these reviews! One thing I would like to suggest is to put the new reviews at the top, instead of having to scroll to the bottom of the article to find the latest additions. Also, sorry to hear that your pixel has problems focusing, you should get that thing RMA'd, and see if if resolves anything! By the way, I have a relatively cheap Tudia Ultra slim matte case, and I'm super happy with it, especially the buttons, they are totally reasonable and the case looks great. The matte finish shows finger smudges and such easier than I expected, but overall I'm pretty happy with it. Jon Fridman There's a little menu at the top (red box) which takes you to any review if you click it. I though about doing an RMA for a while until I realized how dirt or dust is usually the issue. Tudia has made some good cases in the past. I normally get one if I can't find other decent TPU cases available. Michael Tran No love for the Spigen Neo hybrid crystal? I know it's another variation of the Spigen but it's very nice. Gives you the clear tpu shell so you can see your glass top but hard poly carbonate shell. Less bulky than the tough armor. The opening near the camera looks larger to so you get less flash reflection on photos. Jon Fridman Unfortunately I was only sent the regular Neo Hybrid. I can't imagine the case being any different than a simple clear version just like the rugged armor I reviewed. Michael Tran The camera cutout versus the other Spigen cases is a big difference. Avoids the dreaded flash issue plus the problem of dust collecting around the sensor. Also is just a hair bigger then the neo hybrid. Plus it comes in electric blue. 😀. Oh well I guess I just did a semi review haha Jon Fridman I have one in the electric blue (regular NeoHybrid) in the reviews. Camera cutouts aren't a huge deal on clear cases if the OEM paints the edge black to combat flaring. Personally I wouldn't buy the NeoHybrid based on my experiences with it. ApocalypsComet The one I'd like to see would be the UAG Plasma series. I have a Poetic Affinity for my Pixel and love it. Arguably one of the best cases I've had for any phone. Jon Fridman I've owned both of those cases for previous phones. Based on my experiences I will not be reviewing either one unless something changes. pascualine27 What's the best screen protector for the Google Pixel? I got the Benuo TGSP on Amazon and it's so bad. Doesn't cover the LCD fully and really bad halos on both sides! I'm getting a refund. I love my Spigen Rugged Armor case though. Jon Fridman I can't comment on the 'best' one since I've only tried a handful of them. Generally I stick with Intelliarmor depending on the phone I'm using. Jeff Rodrigues I ordered google pixel xl, but its backordered. So im waiting for it to ship out still. I bought this case: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/859ebc6977f0a4696107fd32c289dfb25bcec2700c091a7e1479b2eff23274f6.png Wasnt sure if you knew anything about it. And you have good reviews on those cases, it helps alot. If for some reason i need to change from the one i bought Frisi I have the Rhinoshield Bumper, I love it. Phone has fell twice with it and it has absorbed the impact quite well. My only gripe is that the USB cutout is not as big and some cables don't go in all the way, forcing me to remove the cable. Sarah Gray Bashford I use that tech21 smoke checkered case and the power button definitely gave me issues in the beginning. Have had it on for a month and a half now and it is WAY easier to press the button. I don't struggle at all now that it's broken in. Can't recall when I started noticing a difference though. mikeym0p Spigen Neo Crystal Hybrid? I have and love this case, it looks great and feels better than the regular NeoHybrid. Brandon Padilla Hey guys, give the Poetic Karbon a try. I'd like to know what you guys think about it. Demigod121 Still no love for the i-Blason cases? :( Kevin Slechta Spigen Slim Armor has protected my Galaxy S6 since I got it over a year ago and I will get the same for my Pixel whenever I end up getting one! oliverhaughton Ghostek makes a better looking Pixel XL case that offers all around protection and beautiful steel, not just plastic! Ghostek! Ryan I have an Incipio octane and love it. You say the buttons are terrible, they press easily every time. Not sure what's wrong with yours. The ribbed bumper is great for grip. It's nearly as grippy as my wife's tech21 Evo. benrees21 Cruzerlite Androidified A2 TPU and Carbon Cover Case for Google Pixel - Gray https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/B01LZ28UJ5/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_apa_c-FDyb3G1JVJ8 Please review this! Fantastic case, buttons are nice and cutouts precise. Do a few nice colours as well. Thanks! Cristan Newton So I just found out about this company called Ghostek, which features a screen protector that is supposed to be explosion proof. Thoughts? Steve Try the Bear Motion case, I have it on my regular Pixel and I love it. But like the Google clear case, it does leave unprotected areas on the top and bottom. But I have a dbrand wrap on it also and the case still fits tight on top of the wrap.... I like to change things up on different days. https://www.amazon.com/Ultra-Slim-Case-Google-Pixel/dp/B01MA16WSH James The official Google silicoln case is sh*t. It peels or flaps away around the buttons, by design. This feels horrible. Kaya I bought an awesome phone case for my pixel which had a free screen protector and a built-in stand which helps me to view videos without even holding the phone. Here is the link for it : https://www.zizowireless.com/collections/google-pixel-cases/products/zizo-bolt-case-for-google-pixel-military-grade-glass-screen-protector ackthbbft I have the Spigen Neo Hybrid, and I'm not sure what "design flaw" the OP means about the buttons being flush with the outer frame, as mine stick out just fine. However, I will be opting for a new case, because the frame WILL break at the thinner points where it has cut-outs for the headphone jack and USB port. In fact, it did so on both sides of the USB port on mine, and so it basically came apart. I'll probably get the Spigen Rugged Armor (though it would be nice if someone would make a decent kickstand case for the Pixel). nooper No Caseology cases? They seem to be the best bang for your buck. Hope you can review the Parallax and Vault series. Impulse_Vigil Is Jon done with these reviews? Just curious, he did a fantastic job IMO. Also wondering if he or anyone has tried those super thin Peel/CaliCase type cases? They're like the thinnest possible TPU, more for scratches than bumps and drops... I'd try one but I think I care more about drop protection than anything, still curious tho, they certainly look sleek.

Some Pixel and Nexus fingerprint sensors not working after Android 7.1.2 update Scott Scrivens View All Posts 2017/04/14 12:17pm PDTApr 14, 2017 65 Plus 1 on G+ 79 Share on Facebook 73 Share on Twitter Total Shares217 Bug Watch Device Updates News Nexus 5X Nexus 6P Pixel Pixel XL A number of Google Pixel and Nexus users are reporting that their fingerprint sensor is no longer working after the latest Android OS update. Several members of the Pixel and Nexus communities on Google's product forums have encountered the issue since installing the Android Nougat 7.1.2 OTA. The issue appears to be affecting both the Pixel and Pixel XL, as well as the LG-made Nexus 5X and Huawei Nexus 6P. Reports suggest that while the Pixel and Nexus Imprint sensors are no longer granting access to the devices, the swipe down for notifications Moves gesture is still functional. Attempts to solve the problem by deleting pre-existing fingerprints and starting from scratch haven't worked, as error messages are preventing new prints from being added to the devices. As usual, we'll update if we hear any official word from Google about the issue, hopefully regarding a fix.

Provided Google does not get the article Removed VAVAMk_2 Same thereasoner Same here with my Pixel. Suicide_Note No issues on my XL or 6P. Good_Ole_Pinocchio 6p has never given me those issues either... But it is slower than most newer scanners. Nick Which is to be expected. It's still fine. Jeff Neston By stating no problems, expect to get boot loop on your nexus 6. See the CNET article on nexus 5 and 6. Provided Google does not get the article defeated. If you do get it expect to lose all unsaved data. Then if want refund you will need to go to court. Sean Please GO AWAY....you have said this TWICE.......Its NOT the Nexus 5 and 6 Mr Brainiac....its the 5X and 6P......which are TOTALLY different than the Nexus 5 and Nexus 6. Max Same here with my XL. elav Me too. No issues on my XL.. Nicholas Matranga My Nexus 5x works just fine after the update. kalehv Sometimes my Pixel XL asks for pattern even after it recognizes my fingerprint (no, I am not talking about the first time after reboot). Rebooting the device works but why does this happen? Nathan Bryant I've also experienced this. It's random. Not so often it's a bother for me. kalehv Yup not so often with me either but being a mobile developer what bothers me is this happening, not the inconvenience it causes. Nathan Bryant That totally makes sense. I assume it's some kind of error even though it's not stating that it is. I don't see the pattern or constant of what causes it when it happens. mattcoz It does that after more than 48 hours have passed since you've last used your pattern. kalehv Nop its not that either. It does that after 4 hours I think. And it should do that only once after 4 hours but not keep doing that until you reboot. mattcoz It's definitely 48 hours, that comes straight from Google. But if it continues to do so, then that's something else. Mgamerz I've had it happen on my Nexus, it just occasionally requires a PIN. Says it's 4 hours of non usage but that doesn't seem true, sometimes I wake up and no pin and sometimes I'll be on and off the phone and it'll require a pin. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Typical. Google needs to fire some of their geniuses and hire some diligent coders, and also diligent testers for their QA department (assuming they even have one -- I sincerely doubt it). Alex Cruz Where did Google touch you? Middlefinger Oh really. Nexus/Pixel/Google error 4.453.563 this year alone. Im shocked (not really). Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Best hot steaming pile of dog s**t 2016. DragoCubed Google has been going downhill lately - at least with mobile excluding iOS. It's such a shame. They haven't exactly gone downhill haven't they? They've stayed the same SpeakethTheTruth I think you might be on to something with that last paragraph. Cause for real, quality control is out of control right now. sebastianer If fixed my 6P bad battery life and early shutdown only replacing the stock Huawei battery with other battery with different brand (no need to wipe the phone in the process...) Several people did the same and is enjoying the battery life they were having when they bought the phone more than a year ago: https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=3534410 You could even try a Huawei battery replacement...but they say they aren't original. I just went for another brand because of the bad experience I had with the stock battery durability I don't know in the Pixel. But in the 6P in 90% of the cases...this is just a problem of the Huawei stock battery. Kendall Gustafson “Pixel”, the word sounds like the color pink. “Pixel” sounds like a little girl’s toy. Most men would never put a phone in their pocket named “Pixel” unless they were a cross/dresser. The word “Pixel” equates to a 50% loss of market share from the male market. “Nexus”, the word does not sound female or male. “Nexus”, the word sounds like science, desirable to any man, woman, or child. “Nexus”, the word sound like domination of market share. kalehv Hahaha that made me laugh. No I do not agree. I am a Pixel owner man and I am not whatever you said they'd be if they owned one but I laughed for some reason. Christian Trevor Clauss I must be a cross dresser then :D mattcoz Real men aren't insecure about what their phones are named. Middlefinger Except that the Nexus sold poorly and was generally complete junk Van_Hammersly Most of us have exited adolescence. bonelesscheese https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/9bd2ce0665c300ab872edc5e5fa1ef348b87f551cc01532d17bf41264dd126c1.jpg DragoCubed I'm so glad that you can block on disqus Bruce Wayne Google is really dropping the ball. We just can't have a stable, functioning phone that works. I just had to send my phone in for repair because it went into boot-loop after the recent update. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Google: "It compiled with warnings but no errors. Must be ready to go." Bruce Wayne Nothing about Google or Android came up. What are you getting at? Middlefinger This isnt device specific, its a fault in Android itself. Google has become really bad lately with poor quality control. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Even Chrome is going to the dogs. Seriously, Google is staffed by a bunch of incompetent high-paid prima donnas. paxmos At least, Google is not charging an arm and a leg for their phones ;-) 2kool4skool Lol, $869 for a phone that doesn't have waterproofing, wireless charging, expandable storage, and ois is not charging an arm and leg? paxmos Didn't you see the wink? 2kool4skool Apologies, I just woke up and haven't fully recovered when I read your comment, my sarcasm detector didn't work really well that time. paxmos LOL, we're good Lindacbrewer Managing director of Google!, is explaining to users to start off "Work at home" method, that People have been doing for about one year now.

No need to test or anything. Too much trouble for the geniuses at Google. They're so smart that if it compiles with just warnings, there couldn't possibly be any problems. John Doe I am sure that they do test it but there are things that go wrong...obviously those bugs will be in the spotlight on an Android blog meaning in real life they are probably affecting a small number of users.

It blows my mind been on 7.1.2 sense the factory imgs dropped Sean Same for me.....my Pixel XL hasnt had a single reported issue so far......... Donovan Goodwin Using mine actually causes phone to restart. Updating to 7.1.2 caused this and it even happens on ROMs. JG W00t! For once I don't suffer from Atrem's Luck... My 5X still lets me in with my fingerprint :) Doomberg I updated just last night. Glad I didn't get hit with this issue. nickarli 6P - had 4 fingers registered, right index stopped working after the update but other 3 still fully functional. I thought it was the massive amount of Utah dust in my fingers all of a sudden, but I guess not Defenestratus There's that vaunted Google QA again. This is how you get more Samsung. New_Guy Yep Mark Curtis What do you mean "this is how you get more Samsung"? 4Ui812 Why is Google having app many issues with the Fixel ? Sruly J Except since it's also affecting Nexus devices, this is more of a software issue in 7.1.2 than a hardware issue for Pixel devices. Defenestratus Because IIRC they use Agile software development. Agile is how you get shitty software. Lawstorant I've never thought I would say such thing, but I'm getting fed up with all the "issues" Google is facing with every update. On the Nexus 6, they went as far as to roll it back to 7.0. They should really step up their game especially if, they are fully responsible for every aspect of the device from now on. EvilHowl No issues on my 5X wade_county I thought these Pixels weren't supposed to be beta products? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ They aren't. They're outrageously expensive alpha products. And they even have one defect (halo-cam) that can't be fixed in software. Still the best steaming pile of dog s**t of 2016, though. Everyone should buy one. Everyone who likes dog s**t anyway. Apparently people do, since HTC has shipped 2 million since launch. Kougeru I bad a Pixel for a week and took dozens of photos with no halo Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good for you. Phandroid did an LG G6 vs. Pixel photo comparison. 4 out of 22 Pixel pictures had halos. None of the 22 G6 pictures had halos. They were all pictures of the same things, obviously with the same lighting. Google admits it's a design defect. If Google admits it, it's kind of hard to pretend it doesn't exist. whispy_snippet No one denies it's an issue. But what you seem incapable of accepting is it's a very minor issue that only very rarely rears its head. If you actively try to shoot an image with a strong light source angled towards the sensor (something you generally don't do because it often results in a poor shot on any camera) you might experience a halo effect. Might. But I've got literally hundreds of photos taken with my Pixel with no halos. You can choose to believe whatever exaggerated narrative you want to fuel your juvenile rage fits. But people who actually use a Pixel every day don't seem to have a problem worth caring about. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ It has nothing to do with a strong light source angled toward the sensor. That's normal lens flare. The Pixel halos are NOT normal lens flare. Like I said 4 out of 22 pictures. That's 18% of the pictures they took, and they didn't have strong light sources angled toward the sensor. 18% is not a rare problem, especially when the G6 NEVER had halos with the same exact pictures. Google admitted it's a flaw. Get over yourself and stop trying to justify it. whispy_snippet And like I said, I've taken hundreds of pictures and have seen a halo perhaps a couple of times. And I take a lot of photos given video and photography is my day job - indeed one of the reasons I chose the Pixel is because I wanted the best phone camera available for the times I don't have my proper gear with me. I've seen countless comparisons between the Pixel, iPhone 7 and Galaxy S7 edge and while they're all great, in most situations the Pixel takes what I consider the better shot. You're making mountains out of molehills and carrying on like a right twat in the process. P. Sherman ANECDOTAL EVIDENCE DOESN'T MEAN JACKS--- if in scientific tests under controlled environments and the same conditions, the Pixel produced the halo effect, which Google has acknowledged to be a design deficiency standard on LITERALLY EVERY PIXEL MADE, but other cameras feature no such halo effect. FFS whispy_snippet I'm not denying there's an issue! I'm saying it's being blown out of proportion by people who want to blow it out of proportion. P. Sherman Referencing a scientific, controlled test and camera comparison is NOT blowing this out of proportion. Blowing out of proportion would be something how the Wall Street Journal set out to destroy PewDiePie for boneheadedly saying "Death to all Jews" as a joke. But referencing a camera comparison in exactly the same conditions and one phone had a halo effect but the other didn't is science, fact, nothing to blow out of proportion there. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Good luck arguing with a Google fanboy in deep denial. thereasoner He's actually making solid points, the Pixels do have the best cameras overall​ and all smartphone cameras have some issues. whispy_snippet No, no. I'm a fanboy! Get it right! Cecil Hardwood Are you sure the Pixel has the best camera ? The reason I ask is because the DxOMark site that claims this refuses to release the iPhone 7 Plus (Not iPhone 7) scores and many believe it is because it scored higher than the Pixel. The theory goes on to say that Google is using their score in their advertising and DxO doesn't want to piss off Google. Something weird is going on for sure. DxO claimed long ago the review was coming soon and should have been out by now with the iPhone 7 Plus having been on the market as long as it has. thereasoner If I'm to make a judgment personally then I would say that probably the top 3-4 cameras on flagships are very close and what's best as far as the user is concerned is subjective. Do you prefer low light performance(I do) or digital zoom? Do your favour widespread angle lens or fast launch/focus etc. Those are personal preferences that make "the best " phone different for different people. That said, as far as reviews are concerned the Pixel is generally considered the best over all. As far as your conspiracy theories go, who knows? Anyone can create those about anything but I guess but I'm thinking that other than digital zoom and an artsy photo effect the 7+ cameras are very similar to the 7. whispy_snippet The iPhone 7 Plus is the same as the iPhone 7 apart from an additional, slower lens. In terms of raw image quality the iPhone 7 Plus achieves its best results with the lens it shares with its smaller sibling. So basically, it'll score no better than the 7. It's effectively already been tested. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ All smartphone cameras have some issues? What issues does the G6 camera have in the comparison I linked? 23% of the Pixel photos have halo issues. Find a serious issue with 23% of the G6 photos and get back to us. thereasoner Keep in mind that if you take wide-angle shots, angles will be distorted and elongated from the side, especially when it comes to selfies with the front-facing camera. I also found that the front-facing camera takes relatively muddy shots in low-light. Compared to the Pixel XL, OnePlus 3T and (for the time being since we don't have the S8) the Galaxy S7, the G6 is on par with its rivals. The Pixel XL takes superior low-light images than all the phones though, and I prefer the richer contrast and saturation of the S7 by just a tad. -CNET There are a ton of reviews from various sources just like this and while the G6 cameras are considered very nice they do have their shortcomings and generally rank below the Pixel cameras overall. whispy_snippet Purple flaring and chromatic aberation. It's extremely noticeable in at least four images you shared with the Pixel comparison. Here you are: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chromatic_aberration And just Google search purple flaring. Sorry to burst your bubble. whispy_snippet Show me the link to the test. I would like to see it. Even if their results suggest there's an issue (which there is as we all agree), the significance of the results can still be blown out of proportion which is what we're seeing occur in this ridiculous discussion. Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Here you go again. phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ Now that I've viewed the pics again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. Two involve a bright light. The other 3 do not. So that's 23% of 22 pictures. I wouldn't say that's blowing things out of proportion. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. Yeah, you paid a lot for your Pixel, so you have a hard time admitting it's a steaming pile of dog s**t. I understand. whispy_snippet Yep, so as we've agreed, halos sometimes appear in shots with strong light sources pointing at or angled towards the edge of the sensor. But let's just ignore the purple flaring and chromatic aberation in at least four of the images from the LG, right? You're demonstrating selective criticism. Every camera has strengths and weaknesses but on balance, the Pixel offers better images than competing phones more often than not. My position is unchanged. You're both making mountains out of molehills, and in no way does this "scientific" test guarantee that 23% of photos taken with a Pixel will exhibit a halo. It simply shows 23% of photos taken in this example demonstrated halos. You're both being completely ridiculous. It's like some sort of sorry crusade to demonise a great product by focusing on a tiny negative while ignoring all the positives. No one ever said the Pixel is perfect. But only you two are using ridiculous, extreme labels like "steaming pile of dog shit" and "HARDWARE DEFICIENCY" as though using capital letters makes your odd ball assertions more valid. Most reputable tech reviewers agree the Pixel has the best overall smartphone camera. You're entitled to disagree. P. Sherman 4/22. 4/22 photos from the Pixel have a halo effect. That's from Phandroid. That's 18% of photos the Pixel. That alone is damning. Google themselves have acknowledged that it is a HARDWARE DEFICIENCY and software fixes have done little to address this. They admitted it was there, that's all we need. If you knew that 4/22 Burritos Chipotle made would give you the Runs, but ZERO/22 Burritos Taco Bell made would, would YOU still choose to eat at Chipotle? whispy_snippet Show me the test! I've asked twice now. P. Sherman Lena Flare was removed from the photos, but not the video. http://highonandroid.com/android-smartphone-news/the-truth-about-google-pixel-camera-halolens-flare-effect/ Also, someone in the official Google forums shot with their Pixel and Nexus 6P in the same Time, conditions, everything. Guess what? https://support.google.com/pixelphone/forum/AAAAb4-OgUsrROqMaXHqHg/?hl=by Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ phandroid dot com/2017/03/27/lg-g6-vs-google-pixel-camera/ 3 halos are obvious, 1 is subtle. The subtle one is where the picture is looking up at a building's windows. Now that I've viewed them again, actually 4 have obvious halos. One is subtle. In addition, some Pixel photos are blurry whereas the G6 photos are not. tigerstown I paid $380 for my new pixel XL so it's not a lot and I have no Halo in my pics I have proven this on Twitter already. abc More fanboy logic. I took pictures so everything is fine. Anyone who says its not fine is crazy. whispy_snippet How ridiculous. So a blogger takes 22 photos in various conditions and his experience is valid, but my experience of owning the phone and taking hundreds of photos in various conditions is not valid. You guys are weirdos. Andy But do you see problems with low light pics. I do on my wife's pixel. IPhone Looks so much better. I'm so disappointed abc I saw a rainbow once. Oh, are we not just conveying pointless ancedotes? mr.fozzo On my Nex6P, I have noticed that the Fingerprint reader has been less reliable lately. It requires more presses than the usual 1 press. Besnik Rrustemi My Nexus 6P working excellent so far, no battery problems, no fingerprint problems (better standby times on 7.1.2 to be honest). But yes,i can agree that fingerprint was much faster when i first got the device on 6.0 Marshmallow (for unlocking the device with the fingerprint) now it takes like 2 full seconds for that :( jimv1983 No issues on my Nexus 5X and the swipe on the sensor to bring down the notification panel is great. Alex Harrison Flashed the OTA myself on my 5X. No issues with it. Jeff Neston At least it is just the sensor. My nexus 5 was bricked by a Google update.. it got the boot loop. Google support lied to me claiming I broke the power button. False it was not broken. I ended up going small claims case against Google. They settled, but wanted me to sign gag order. Sorry, no way. I sent it back and got complete refund. Sneaky company. What probably causes boot loop update to occur is phone on long time. Some apps get memory leak over time. System then unpredictably unstable. Then the system does auto uplate from Google without asking user NOR even rebooting or turning off prior to the update. Then during update, Os gets corrupted. Then after failed update phone reboots thinking the. Update completed. Now phones dead. And Google not bother to address the issue. Pdiddy187 My 5x fingerprint sensor was great until it bootlooped yesterday morning. LG is going to repair it under warranty even though it's well out of warranty. La Kiesha Rodriguez Barrientes I have the ZTE axon 7 and over a month now google hasn't addressed a fix for the play store not loading apps over data or Wi-Fi.. Without uninstalling updates to play store and then maybe will not say "waiting for network" so frustrating and then maybe download once and have to do that everytime.. Dumb.. P. Sherman That's been like that since KitKat. F------ KITKAT. ahnafm Is google reacommodating their customers now? Brett Delia I thought some positive feedback was worth being added. My Nexus 6P is working perfectly after the update. I've had generally a great experience with all my Android phones. I've had an iPhone as well as a Windows mobile phone as well in my past. None have been as feature packed as my Android devices. New_Guy This and all the other ridiculous issues with the Pixel is a big reason I stick with Samsung... flyonthewall Lol Fernando S Mine is working ok in my Nexus 5x running 7.1.2. It just failed once while I was on 7.1.1 and with a soft reset it came back to life Hank Is that a real screenshot in the story? Enrollment spelled wrong twice. SMH. ThisGuyFUX This is now icing on top of the cake, for anyone whom has enjoyed watching this crash and burn. If I paid $850+ for a Pixel, I'd be pursuing class action litigation by now. Slow clap. Sean Except its only affecting about 1% of the Pixels sold.........so......slow clap for you....... 2kool4skool It's gonna be sucks when you're in the 1%. And I doubt it's 1% anyway, this is probably the 20th article I've read about pixel's problems. That's alot. Probably more like 5%. abc Fortunately, not many Pixels have been sold so not many people are affected. Brian White Nexus 5x, running fine here ddevito If it wasn't for my OnePlus 3 I'd be on an iPhone. thereasoner One plus has their own issues/lousy support and the iPhone? They're the worst of them all when it comes to buggy software and hardware issues bricking devices ! ddevito Not sure I'd agree with you. My iPhone 6s hums along swimmingly without any issues. The more I use it the more I am leaning towards going back to an iPhone full-time. Apple, love them or hate them, knows how to deliver products, and support them. Period. thereasoner I'm glad that your iPhone 6s isn't affected by the many flawed updates and hardware issues​ that have plagued various iPhones over the years but the fact remains that Apple has faced class action lawsuits filed by their own customers for serious issues like Touch Disease and error 53 and for good reason. They have the worst track record of them all and to make things worse they're known for both ignoring iPhone issues until said class action lawsuits are launched and/or blaming their customers for the iPhone hardware/software problems. BTW, my Pixel "hums along swimmingly" as well, that doesn't mean issues with the Pixel don't exist much less those far more serious issues found on iPhones ! MisterKraky I'm not having the fingerprint sensor issue myself, but after updating to 7.1.2, I can no longer install or update any apps! On a Verizon-issued Pixel here. Đức Thành What happened to all the testing, Google? It seems they have become too reliant on using Nexus users for beta-testing and now can't seem to do a proper job on their own. Get your grips together, Android team. Rob H. Nougat is such a half baked disaster of an OS. It's ruined my N6. Marshmallow was soon much more stable. Thanks google keep breaking phones. jacob Cant even spell enrolment correctly. Enrollment...... PoisonApple31 Don't forget your apostrophe! Makes you look stupid when you are talking about spelling.

Rakesh There is a known bug that after you unlock your phone the fingerprint sensor won't work for gestures - swipe down. There is no workaround for it so far other than to just press once and then it will start working. Adam Margeson Not sure what you're talking about.

I'm really tired of Google's crap. squiddy20 Annnnnd this is why I have auto-updates disabled on my PIxel. That, and I have it rooted. Andy Got my wife the pixel because she wanted a great camera. Consistently her friends iPhone 6 and 7s look better in low light. Its very frustrating. Makes me look like an idiot paying all this money. Outside the pictures look amazing. But I'm disappointed in indoor pics Stevo I have the same issue!! It happened as soon as I updated my stock Nexus 6P to 7.1.2. I've called Google Fi for support and they were NO help other than trying to sell me an "upgrade" to the Pixel and FULL price?!? They also said that they haven't had harly any other complaints with this issue. Thanks for nothing Google! I've did a soft rest then a complete reset with no luck. I've heard that people have had success with down grading to 7.1.1. or flashing a custom ROM. trapchan Where're Google apologists when you need them? Felonious Monk ✓ᵛᵉʳᶦᶠᶦᵉᵈ Maybe they're beginning to face reality. flyonthewall WTF Google flyonthewall To the Apple fanboys here.

Photograph: Ron Chapple Photography, Inc. //Alamy Stock Photo Australian media Journalism faces a crisis worldwide – we might be entering a new dark age Margaret Simons Almost anyone can use the worldwide web to be a media outlet, so how will we differentiate between truth, myth and lies? Share on Facebook Share on Twitter Share via Email View more sharing options Share on LinkedIn Share on Pinterest Share on Google+ Share on WhatsApp Share on Messenger Close Margaret Simons is the director of the Centre for Advanced Journalism, University of Melbourne Friday 14 April 2017 21.13 EDT Australia’s two largest legacy media organisations recently announced big cuts to their journalistic staff. Many editorial positions, perhaps up to 120, will disappear at Fairfax Media, publisher of The Age and The Sydney Morning Herald, and News Corporation announced the sacking of most of its photographers and editorial production staff. Both announcements were accompanied by corporate spin voicing a continuing commitment to quality journalism. Nobody in the know believes it. This is the latest local lurch in a crisis that is engulfing journalism worldwide. Now, partly thanks to Donald Trump, many more people are turning their mind to the future of news, including “fake” news and its opposite. How, in the future, are we to know the difference between truth, myth and lies? Almost too late, there is a new concern for the virtues of the traditional newsroom, and what good journalists do. That is, find things out, verify the facts and publish them in outlets which, despite famous stuff-ups, can generally be relied upon to provide the best available version of the truth. News Corp staff deliver bolshie smack to senior managers amid job cuts | The Weekly Beast Read more As this week’s announcements make clear, the newsrooms that have traditionally provided most original journalism are radically shrinking. News media for most of the last century appeared to be one relatively simple business. Gather an audience by providing content, including news. Sell the attention of the audience to advertisers. The internet and its applications have brought that business undone. As any householder can attest, the audience no longer assembles in the same concentrations. The family no longer gathers around the news on television. Most homes have multiple screens and news is absorbed as it happens. “Appointment television” is nearly dead, at least for those under 50. At the same time, technology has torn apart the two businesses – advertising and news – that used to be bound together by the physical artefact of the newspaper. Once, those who wanted to find a house, a job or a car had to buy a newspaper to read the classifieds. Now, it is cheaper and more efficient to advertise and search online, without needing to pay a single journalist. Publishers and broadcasters have moved online, but the advertising model fails. Ads on websites earn a fraction of the amount that used to be charged for the equivalent in a newspaper or during a program break. All this is last century’s news – but over the past five years the landscape has shifted again because of the dominance of Google (which also owns YouTube) and Facebook. These social media engines have quickly become the world’s most powerful publishers. Besides them, Murdoch looks puny. Yet Google and Facebook don’t employ journalists. They serve advertisements and news to the audience members on the basis of what they know about their interests. Guardian Media Group to cut 250 jobs in bid to break even within three years Read more For advertisers, it’s all gravy. Why pay for a display ad in a newspaper when you can have your material delivered direct to the social media feeds of people who you know are likely to be interested in buying your product? It is now estimated that of every dollar spent on advertising in the western world, 90 cents ends up in the pockets of Google and Facebook. Today, just about anyone with an internet connection and a social media account has the capacity to publish news and views to the world. This is new in human history. The last great innovation in communications technology, the printing press, helped bring about the enlightenment of the 1500s and 1600s. The optimists among us thought the worldwide web and its applications might lead to a new enlightenment – but as has become increasingly clear, the reverse is also possible. We might be entering a new dark age. Fake news isn’t new. The place of Barack Obama’s birth was about as verifiable as a fact gets – with the primary document, his birth certificate, published online. But the mere publication of a fact did not stop a large proportion of US citizens from believing the myth that he was born overseas. It is very hard to say how many Australian journalists have left the profession over the last 10 years. This is partly because the nature of journalistic work has changed. Many now work aggregating or producing digital content, never leaving their desks. Institutions such as universities and NGOs are now producing journalistic content, published online, but the people employed to do this task rarely show up in the figures compiled by unions and the Australian Bureau of Statistics, because their employers are not classified as media organisations. Nevertheless, the big newsrooms have shrunk beyond recognition. This week’s announcements were the latest in a 15-year trend. In 2013, industry commentators estimated that more than 3000 Australian journalists had lost their jobs in the previous five years. Since then, there have been further deep cuts, and last week’s announcements were merely the latest. In the US, it is estimated that 15 per cent of journalistic jobs disappeared between 2005 and 2009, and the cuts haven’t paused since then. At the same time, and offsetting this, there are new participants in the Australian media. We now have online local versions of the British Daily Mail, the youth-oriented news and entertainment outlet Buzzfeed, the New York Times, (which has just launched) and the Huffington Post, which operates in partnership with Fairfax. Not least, there is this outlet – an Australian edition of the Guardian. There are also many small, specialist outlets that exist because the economics of online publishing beat the cost of buying broadcasting licences or printing on bits of dead tree, trucking the papers around the nation and throwing them over the fences. For the same reasons, almost any large organisation can, if it chooses, use the worldwide web to be a media outlet – though whether the output classes as journalism or public relations is another matter. Most of the new entrants to the business employ only a few local journalists. The reputable ones struggle to perform miracles each hour with hardly any reporters. So what does the future hold? I think it is clear we will have many more smaller newsrooms in the future – including new entrants, non-media organisations touting their wares and the wasted remains of the old businesses. Some of these newsrooms will operate on the slippery slopes that lie between news, advocacy and advertising. Some of them will be the fake news factories, devoted to earning an income from spreading clickable, outrageous lies. If it were only the decline of businesses, we would not need to worry so much. It is rare in history for those who have profited from one technology to go on to dominate the next. Cobb and Co ran the stagecoaches, but not the steam trains. Facebook Twitter Pinterest The Fairfax Media building in Sydney. Big newsrooms everhywhere have shrunk beyond recognition. Photograph: Paul Miller/AAP But it is more serious than the decline of private businesses. The future is far from clear, but here are some things we can expect to see delivered more quickly than we might think. First, social media companies will begin to invest in quality content, because otherwise they will lose their audiences. This is not merely wishful thinking. In China, WeChat, owned by Tencent Corporation, is the dominant social media engine and has functionality that makes Facebook and Twitter look old-fashioned. If you want to know what’s coming next in social media, look to China. As I found on a recent research trip to China, WeChat is investing a lot of money in original journalism. Many of the most interesting journalists in China – including some who have been jailed in the past for their work – are now earning better salaries than those available on party media outlets by freelancing for Tencent, which actively supports and encourages them in multiple ways. It’s counterintuitive, given China’s record on freedom of speech, but then the country is changing so fast and is so complex that preconceptions can only be challenged. China might have begun by copying the social media activity of the west, but it has long since outstripped it. Not that the future dominance of Tencent-like operations is entirely reassuring. WeChat is also a cashless payment system, earning money from transactions. It knows absolutely everything about its users, to a much greater extent than Facebook and Google. It surpasses all previous means of citizen surveillance. Fairfax journalists condemn ​​proposed $30m job cuts and political positioning Read more Second, governments will have to take some responsibility for news and information. In Europe and Canada, they are experimenting with methods of helping bolster journalism. Meanwhile, international research confirms that countries blessed with a strong tradition of publicly funded media are more cohesive, better informed and less polarised. Our own ABC is one of the main reasons we can hope that the trajectory of our democracy will be better than that of the United States. Lastly, there are citizens. The experience of the last decade tells us that citizen-journalism cannot replace the work done by properly resourced and trained professionals, but it will be a permanent part of the news ecology. For the foreseeable future, we will be only a few minutes and clicks away from a citizen leaking information, publishing a bare account of a news event or providing a subversive point of view. In fact, being a responsible consumer, funder and purveyor of news and information is now best understood as one of the many duties of good citizenship. If we can hold firm to that notion, we will come through the crisis.

Quotes in the article Apple Inc AAPL ▼ 141.05 -0.75 -0.53% General Motors Co GM ▼ 33.39 -0.55 -1.62% The technology giant on Friday secured a permit for autonomous-vehicle testing in California, the clearest sign to date of progress in Apple’s efforts to develop self-driving car technology. The permit, awarded by California’s Department of Motor Vehicles, is Apple’s first for autonomous cars and allows it to test drive vehicles on public roads in the largest U.S. state by population, adding it to a list of rivals that includes Google parent Alphabet Inc. and Tesla Inc. The move indicates Apple is going beyond testing on private tracks and in simulators as it works to improve artificial-intelligence systems that must learn to interact in the unpredictable world of human drivers. The Apple permit covers three 2015 Lexus sport-utility vehicles, which would be retrofitted with hardware and software to be used in autonomous mode. It also covers six human operators who must sit behind the wheel to monitor the driving and take over when needed, according to the DMV. Apple has been working for years on self-driving cars—an effort dubbed Project Titan—under a thick veil of secrecy. Its first public statements about its car effort came in a November letter to the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration offering input on planned regulations governing automated vehicles. An Apple spokesman on Friday declined to comment on the permit and referred to a statement in December, when the letter to regulators became public, that said the company is investing machine learning and autonomous systems. The letter—which said Apple was making those investments for many purposes “including transportation”—suggested Apple was focusing on software that would control a self-driving car. That aligned with other evidence that Apple’s car effort had shifted from building a car to designing an autonomous-driving system. Last summer, for example, Apple eliminated some positions on Project Titan focused on car development, and added software-focused staff. Its new approach is a departure for Apple, which typically tries to control both the software and hardware of its products to deliver a uniform user experience and maximize profits. It is alone among major smartphone developers, for example, in using its own operating-system software instead of Google’s Android system—a strategy widely credited with helping Apple garner more than 90% of profits in the global smartphone industry, according to Strategy Analytics. Neil Cybart, who runs Above Avalon, a site dedicated to Apple analysis, said there could be similar value in controlling both the software and hardware of a car. “One aspect of the auto industry that needs to change is design and they’re well suited with their design philosophy because industrial designers (there) have more sway than engineers,” Mr. Cybart said. California has been the major testing ground for autonomous-vehicle technology. Apple rivals have been testing their vehicles on the roads here for some time—especially Waymo LLC, the Google sister company doing self-driving cars. Waymo has been working on autonomous vehicles since 2009 and has driven more than 2.5 million miles on public roads, including 635,868 last year in California. “We’re still in the first mile of the marathon of this race. At this point, it’s still up in the air who can take the lead,” said Dave Sullivan, an automotive analyst with consultancy AutoPacific Inc. Putting test vehicles on public roads opens Apple to more scrutiny than it is accustomed to when developing products. California requires companies with autonomous-car testing permits to file public reports about their efforts, including crash information and the number of times their human operators have to take over from the computer. Other companies testing self-driving technology—including Waymo, Uber Technologies Inc. and General Motors Co.’s Cruise Automation—have put logos on their test vehicles, adding to the attention. It is unclear if Apple’s Lexus vehicles will bear its logo. With the scrutiny of public testing, any glitches can quickly draw unwanted attention. Last month, for example, an Uber test vehicle crashed in Tempe, Ariz., prompting Uber to suspend all such testing briefly even though police said the tech company wasn’t at fault. Uber had previously tried testing its cars in San Francisco without a permit, drawing the ire of California officials. The ride-hailing company pulled its vehicles from its hometown and began testing in Arizona, before deciding to go back and obtain a permit in California. The revelation of Apple’s interest in self-driving technology in 2015 sent shockwaves through the automotive industry, which had been working on various research efforts but generally saw autonomous vehicles as a far-off endeavor. The technology, though still unproven and facing regulatory and legal hurdles, has the potential to rewrite auto-makers role in an industry that is a bedrock of the U.S. economy. By 2030, about a quarter of all miles driven in the U.S. may be done through autonomous, electric vehicles, according to a recent study by the Boston Consulting Group. Many of the developers that appear furthest along have said commercial fleets, whether it is robot taxis or delivery vehicles, are the most likely way the technology will first be deployed Major questions remain about Apple’s intentions. “I’m not sure they know what their play will be, but they do sense there’s an opportunity and they can bring value to it,” said Ben Bajarin, an analyst with technology-research firm Creative Strategies. “The question is: How big is this commitment? And how much money are they throwing at this commitment? It’s hard to know where this lands on their priority list.” Write to Tripp Mickle at Tripp.Mickle@wsj.com and Tim Higgins at Tim.Higgins@WSJ.com Go to MSN Home Go to MSN Money Join the conversation Report Abuse Report inappropriate content Sorry!

Some Nexus 6Ps have developed a battery early shutoff problem, and it's becoming a safety issue David Ruddock Follow View All Posts 2016/12/20 11:10am PDTDec 20, 2016 211 Plus 1 on G+ 366 Share on Facebook 174 Share on Twitter Total Shares751 News Nexus 6P A number of Nexus 6P owners have reported an alarming battery problem with their phones as of Android 7.0 being released for the handset, which causes the phone to power down when the battery gauge still shows anywhere from 10 to 60% battery remaining. How widespread the issue is at this point isn't clear, but the main thread on the Google issue tracker has 229 stars. There are also a significant number of threads describing the problem on Google's Product Forums (see: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6). Owners have linked it to Android 7.0, but even those who have attempted flashing back to Marshmallow report the problem still occurs, though generally at lower indicated remaining battery percentages than on Nougat. This suggests some kind of change in Android 7.0 that is exacerbating what would appear to be an underlying hardware problem. There are some reports that 6P owners with the issue who have their batteries replaced see the problem largely alleviated, again pointing to what seems fundamentally a hardware failure that has been made worse by software. While Google has assigned the issue in its tracker, it's been given a low priority and there has been no indication of an incoming fix. Those who have attempted to receive warranty service from Huawei have been rebuffed, with the OEM telling them the problem is not with the phone or the battery, but with Google's changes to the software. Interestingly, it seems the problem is most common in very cold climates. These are where we see reports of phones dying at upwards of 60% battery remaining indicated, which is obviously completely ridiculous. As some on the various threads point out, this could easily be a major safety issue. We have become deeply reliant on our smartphones to help us get around - be it hail an Uber, navigate us to our destination with a map, or simply to call or text a person to let them know where or when we'll be. Such functions have become so critical that suddenly having your phone die unexpectedly could actually place you in danger. Imagine if you were in an unfamiliar place (one without frequent taxis), late at night, trying to hail an Uber in exceptionally cold weather, and then your phone kicked the bucket. What would you do? This actually happened to one poster on reddit, who was fortunate enough to find a hotel where he or she was able to use a phone to call a friend (whose phone number they knew - how many people know each other's phone numbers these days?) to pick them up. What if your car broke down on a freezing night and you were unable to phone a tow company? Our world and infrastructure, and our very decision-making processes as humans, have started to evolve around the ubiquity of constant connection through our smartphones. Without them, we can be left feeling helpless. We'll be reaching out to Google about this to see if they have any comment.

Froggies I am living in tropical country and it still happens around 20%, fixed after replacing with new battery fatlantis Introducing forced obsolescence when planning isn't enough. Linh Feedback. It does work sometimes. maverick7526 https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/31ff0858463dce3005d122af1771be1674201f869957270e6de3b939a5bd5adf.png Happens to me Everytime I finish a run using mapmyfitness now. This morning my battery was a lil under 50%, and I go to save my workout, and it just flashes the battery saver screen and shuts down. The only way to get it to boot is to plug it in. It did this one other time when I was playing around with Google maps battery was around 40%. Hopefully Google can figure this crap out. jfbaudio I called Google while I was still under the 1 year warranty, they replaced it for me. The problem was creeping up, from shutdowns at 4%, then 7%, and so on to 20% when I had it replaced. It took about 2 months to get there. This was during the summer so cold weather didn't play into it. Scott Harris Haven't had this problem but last week I had problems with my phone freezing on me. Was forced to have to do the power + volume down button to turn it off. Left the Android beta and didn't restore any backups. Did that like 2 days ago and so far no freezes. Have already been considering switching to iPhone, but if this battery thing starts happening to my 6P then I'm done with Android. Matías Duarte 1-Get a Note 7 2-Wait until explodes 3-Warm your N6P with the Note flames 4-??? 5-Profit. melvin My dies at 15%. When I reboot. It's back 30%. Like wth. I assumed battery was shot. Rawhi Mohammad Sounds more and more like the iPhone.. this new Pixel strategy is getting crazier by the day. just_a_regular_citizen I have the problem with my 6P. It's been worse outside in the cold. I took a screenshot right after I plugged in and restarted. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5edefbc6313ef36d560ab07169dc6fa529e1d969dd6d2f0c6c2b43f8a7df673d.png ChuckDz3 This hit me very close to home! I was involved in a car accident over the weekend due to the icy road conditions in the midwest. In the middle of calling 911 for help my phone died. My battery was at 60% before I dialed the call. It was 8 degrees outside and almost stranded with no help. Luckily I was only 5 minutes away from my place and was able to walk home. This could have ended very different due to this issue! Robert A Lyon I have the issue, BUT it didn't originally begin at 7.0. Everything was okay until a couple weeks after the push out of 7.0, my whole phone went dark, no charge, wouldn't turn on, it was just a brick. It had restarted 3 times in a row, on the third restart just wouldn't do anything. Tried all the fixes recommended online. Sent back to Huwaii and on receipt back the phone turns on but the battery drain is present. Colder weather is worse and the battery goes dead anywhere from about 20% to 15% left to zero in a matter of a second or two. Battery saver mode comes on at 15% and it'll die on me. No problem before sending it in for the other power issue. Also get it back and the camera no longer focuses in close up. So in other words, I had no problem at the initial release of 7.0, it wasn't until the OEM got it and screwed it up. Adam C Just my speculation but I do not think any battery does well with rapid charging over the long term. I never charge my 6p with rapid charging and I still have great battery life on 7.0. for over a year. I wonder how may folks that have this issue uses rapid vs standard charging. Kid.Drunkadelic I kinda of feel bad to the guy I sold mine too then, I sold cause I thought Google was back to their old shit if not quality checking and dog flooding their code enough and my battery sucked. Sucked so bad I got a 6s plus now I see how much of dramatic change in battery life I now have. I might never come back Ernie So, is it hardware or software. Sounds like a hardware problem of sorts!!! Chris B Been having this issue for around a month as well. Shutoff is usually around 10-35% and seems worse in cool weather. onekage This happened to me today! Phone was left in cold car for few hours(16°F) , unlocked the device. Battery read 58% suddenly it powered off and would not come back on. Brought inside and put on charger 61% battery. This in not acceptable. I live in a freezing cold climate 7-8 months out of the year. I'm on 7.1.1. If this continues I'll be selling the phone or getting a replacement. Dakota Rickel So should I ask Google for a replacement or wait for more news about what the exact issue is and how they plan to fix it? MisterJ Sure the battery problem is an issue, but does it pose a material danger? I don't think so. Humans have lived without phones for millennia. If you are so dependent on your phone that you think you're gonna die without it, you need to rethink your life, and come up with different contingency plans that don't require a phone. With that said, i own a nexus 6p, and i have seen phone die at around 10 to 15%, but a few nights ago, i was able push the battery all the way down to 1%. Maybe being on the Android beta program has something to do with it? va_d1m How about this situation: - stayed out really late, about ~8.5km from the home for the first time in few years. - battery died at 25%, unable to get Uber (which has been our main form of cab service for a number of years for multiple reasons). - no cabs would take me home because "it's too short a fare during shift change-over time" which is illegal but happens all the time (Melbournians would understand), - walked home Sure, I did not feel in any danger and I know my city well but since we have become so reliant on our phones (and phone companies are complicit in commoditising smart phone ownership), when they break it causes severe inconvenience to our lives. Extrapolate that to being a tourist in a foreign country the outcome can be more than just inconvenient.. MisterJ Just think about what your parents' generation would have done. It's that simple. Brett Sewell I just went through three weeks of -20 weather with the update no issues but I certainly wouldn't trust my life to my phone either in a snowstorm Tom Z I had mine shut down at 38% once. Most of the time it's around 25% when it shuts down. It doesn't even get a chance to go into battery saver. I hope Google fixes this soon. Kyle Salewski Has been happening to me a TON in the past 2-3 weeks! I thought it was just me with a faulty battery. I do see it in very cold temps, it's been negative degrees or single digits here in Milwaukee quite a few days in the past few weeks.seems to be anything under 30 or 25% and then POOF!, dead. About a week ago I was getting an Uber and shut off after I requested it. Luckily I remembered the make and license of the car picking me up downtown. I would have been stuck out in the freezing snow without a phone. It happened Sunday night and again Monday night of this week. I did run the 7.1.1 update AFTER I charged it back up last night after it died. Hopefully this update changed something, but I'm not holding my breath. KingOfRedLions7 So this is common? Mine started doing this recently at around 25% and aside from that it also drained probably around twice as fast as it should have. Then I got a new battery replacement and the day after it died around 80% but I recalibrated the battery and it's been working good as new since then. If it really is the software accelerating hardware failure than I'm going to be pissed if it starts having problems again. :/ Cory Wilson Reading this on my 6p. Haven't noticed an issue yet and hopefully I won't. But I also thought I was immune to the g4 bootloop of death problem and then it happened and it sucked. psychomaniac189 did anybody email huawei and get a response? what was the response? mine was, Thank you for contacting Huawei Device USA. We're so sorry to hear about the battery issues you've been experiencing with your Nexus. Please guide to the following troubleshooting steps to attempt to correct the charging issue. If the steps are successful but you are still experiencing battery drainage, please contact us at 1-888-548-2934. 1. Plug your charger into the wall before plugging it into your phone. 2. Hold down the power button. 3. Without letting go of the power button, plug your phone into the charger. 4. Continue to hold the power button for another 20 seconds. The phone should begin to charge normally. Noam I have this issue too. I live in Israel, haven't noticed any connection to temperature. I hope they fix this, it's driving me mad! Wilson X Nearly 40% have this issue, voted by Chinese N6P users. https://plus.google.com/u/0/+WilsonX/posts/eS6ANzEMprR wadea This problem started very soon after I updated to 7.0. It also coincided with a trip I took to South Korea; the first time I ever traveled to a non-english country. My phone died without warning at 15% one night during my trip, and although I had a reasonable amount of information written down, I still ended up stranded due to the inability to access my phone, and being in a 'suburban' area of Seoul with very few services. So yah, it can be a safety issue. I'm aware of the problem now, so when I leave again for Korea in a month, for a year this time, I'm resolving the issue by replacing my phone. I can't be in a foreign country, and have an unreliable phone in my pocket. Morten Ulv I thought that it was related to me using the 60w chromebook pixel charger for the phone. Never died above like 12% and it has been a while since I had the problem. But possibly because I charge it in time... Fartknocker Had the problem once when I took the phone out of my pocket and put it in my center console while I was driving home. It was in the single digits that night. When I got it indoors, it worked fine again and the true, original battery amount came back. Gavin Dunsire I seem to be having this issue with my Pixel (not XL model).

Apparently, Huawei and Google just want to blame each other, while we users have to deal with the problem. Eoghan Murphy I'm seeing similar behaviour on my Moto G4 plus, and its not cold in Brisbane. Phone just shuts off randomly and when powered back on battery life is significantly reduced. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/706643efc8f98525f285b681ac3481677d6ca2c38c7c8b1620e5ca2f8e44e624.png Marc Westermann Seeing exactly the same issues since 7.0 on my Nexus 6P. The device shuts off when it hits the 15% threshold for the batterysaver. I contacted google multiple times for an RMA but they keep saying it's apps and that I should factory reset and not use apps for several days to confirm the issue. Eventually I got someone to send me the RMA link as I saw that they would charge you the full price of the nexus 6P if the returned device would be considered "flawless" in the eyes of the google support. I talked it through with the gouvernment customer care center here in germany and they said that this is unacceptable but there is nothing I can do at the moment. Worst service experience ever. Check out the screenshots, it's fun! /s https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/da1b67aa1745daaa6c04379733cecb5d1423f4555bae8ddeaf1f9d66fa67b404.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/54e3430ee46793e40bc03539c9c2f72e32df6893bb5f5a742d95ff4ad887b533.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/5f87b86e96716feb8fd4b94d202750630c0ddf98f297f357f9a095af4b962113.jpg https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/6f6295d0e83ce0143d97df04c8bfdfc328bd9be95086bb09851f2385781f6a4d.jpg Stefano Miranda Hi. I am also here in Germany, but I have the big problem that my German is not really that good, so I was not able to find any Huawei customer center neither am I able to talk to the customer support in German. What makes it even more complicated is that I bought it on Amazon France, and I don't speak french either so I cannot complain with them. Please, if you have any information that may be relevant, send me a comment down below. I am even willing to pay for a new battery, this problem is really frustrating. Marc Westermann Wow, that's quiet a situation you got yourself into. As far as I can tell, there are Huawei shops in many major cities in Germany. There is also a support hotline from which I would assume that they talk at least basic english. But I think your best chance would be to contact Amazon in your origin country. I could imagine that they could help you as well. If not, I'd try Amazon France in english. Stefano Miranda I live in Munich but I did not see any Huawei shop here. do they also offer customer service in the shops? do you have a list? If I google for that I just find the Design Center here in Munich and not the Handy's shop LOL Marc Westermann Just search for them on google maps. I don't know if they offer customer service, but I'd assume that. It's pretty standard in germany for shops to also offer assistance on products. mchalakov What would you do? Hmmm I don't know .. WALK! Like all the 'poor' humans do where there is no Uber. And just change the battery... Josh They will never admit anything. They literally kept making us wait with ridiculous request after ridiculous request until finally the warranty expired for issues we had with bend gate and the glass popping out randomly with normal use. Google has purposely scammed a lot of people with this phone. Never will I ever purchase another Nexus or pixel product. Brian Michael Last week I gave up my Nexus 6p after battery drain issues and also when I upgraded to Nougat 7.1 my 6p kept bootlooping. So, I just bought a OnePlus 3T to hold me over. I am very pleased. I'll definitely think twice before buying another Google phone. Matt I am having issues with the battery, drops fast. And turns off randomly below 14% I did contact google, my device is less than 6 months old. They are replacing it for free. Aniket Vasishth I am glad that AP wrote an article on this.. at least now it will be taken seriously by Google Cenzo Great. The way this author writes, it won't be long before smartphones will be declared a necessity. paulmike3 For you, it might never be. For others, it is. Don't judge what you don't understand completely. Cenzo You obviously don't understand what basic human necessities are. paulmike3 I do. If we were talking about basic human necessities, I would agree with you. We're not. You said "necessity", which is a different classification. A car, a phone, electricity, heat, etc. are all necessities in my life (home, work). Without them, I would be in a critical safety situation, given the 12F temperature outside right now. The article remains spot on. Cenzo Corrected for context. Latheryin If you think it is then you have bigger issues then battery problems. There is nothing to understand. Might want to check anyone that thinks it is as they have some very big mental issues. Jonas Andersson Mine dies every night at about 15%. I have battery saver at 15% but the screen turns orange and about the same times it dies. Victory Hand I used to have this issue but 7.1.1 seems to have fixed it. Laird Rixford Mine always happens after using the camera. Even at 25%+. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/bbea09d0194204d95339235943431ae6a221f8a4e195dc3a98d6a53a024fc310.png w https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8db3f5c513a96eafe8f20c1d778f421d2f4a7f072c60c59f588f59959ac515cd.png Russell I've had the same issue after updating my Pixel XL to 7.1.1. I contacted Google support and they said other users are experiencing the same issue. Hopefully a fix comes soon because my phone shuts off sometimes with just less than 50%!! https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/343c7bd4c50adb1781ede1d1bd3de748fb0b529b5ed87694d38ed96d8216c77f.png paulmike3 This is good info, thanks! If you haven't already, please post this on the Android bug report thread as well (and state that it's happening on your Pixel XL) -> https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=227849 Michael Hall This is a big fat joke. It is crap like this which makes the iPhone look more and more tempting. If I'm anywhere near 20% then open up a high drain app like Snapchat, it just dies. I love Google, but Christ they are useless. Andre Natale David, please stay on top of this. I thought I was alone In this issue but I am glad you made light of it. dblock The behavior of this is very strange, as it happens to me, but usually never above 30% battery remaining. It only happens to me when I use something that seems to be resource-intensive. I noticed that it mainly happens when I use my camera while the battery is below 30%, or something that utilizes the camera, like Snapchat. Otherwise it seems like I can drain my battery down to 0 if I don't use my camera. I have never seen it randomly shut off while using anything else, that I can recall anyhow. Still, I assume something like Uber might also cause this behavior, especially when you are awaiting a ride to show up and the ride tracker map is up, as that is probably somewhat resource-heavy. Either way, it is unacceptable. For me, this started happening as soon as I started using Nougat in general, not 7.1.1 specifically. Initially I thought it was just a result of custom ROMs, however now that Nougat is more widely available, it looks like that is not the case at all. Chris Babes This has really been effecting me greatly! Please fix. I'm at the point where I may have to get a new phone. I work outdoors in Ontario, Canada. So frustrating and dangerous. Robert Andersson Buy a Huawei. melvin my just did it at 37%.. so frustration. Alex O’Brien Same thing happens to me although I live in a warm climate (California) and, to the best of my recollection, has only happened once my battery is around 15%. It is definitely a safety issue. sodsavage Having this same issue, didn't know it was a widespread problem. Believe it or not, I was actually assaulted because of this issue affected a situation. RVCA It sounds like only a small amount of people are impacted. Haha Suckers!! Arman G This has actually happened to me recently. It was like -10C, phone had a 50% charge left and died on me, just as my Uber driver went past me. So I missed the Uber and the ability to get to my destination in time. I had to rely on m my work iPhone the rest of the night. See the screenshot of the battery meter. No explanation for the sharp power dip. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/cf7a5e1479a23d65e57b6cd424f788820e14c622977f8b62b35cbeaecce7211a.png Ger PG I live in the not-so-cold weathers of Mediterranean Europe but yesterday I spent a whole day in Prague at -5 ºC and my phone kept dying at 35%. Later at night I saw this article in Android Police describing this issue and I felt like you were explaining my day. I spent 550€ on this phone 6 months ago, so they'd better be fixing this soon. By the way, I am still running Android 6.0.1, so add this build to the list of affected ones. jobber99 this happened to me starting in september, i was on 7.0 i believe--would get to 15% and then down to 0. i called google store support, and they replaced my 6p. it is now also happening to my wife's phone, on 7.1.1, but it's too late i think for her to call google store support as the phone is > 1 year old now Kelly This happens to me. The first time I was out of town (and the phone was a month old) so it was extra scary. I didn't know this is what was happening but now that you describe it, it fits. I pull my phone out of my purse and it won't cut on. I have to plug it in and wait for at least 30 seconds before the power button will turn it back on. It does not show the battery charging icon either, so it looks bricked. Scary!!! It's happened twice. I also notice it shutting down and/or restarting itself all the time but I think that's the stupid button sensitivity. Kelly Oh and this was way before 7.0 (it was August this year) and was indoors in a moderate climate. staticx57 I've had mine shut down numerous times at around 30% and this was on MM Chris This actually just happened to me. I was inside, sitting at 60% battery, when my phone just powers off with the low battery warning. Thinking it was just a normal crash, I reboot it and went to to plug it on the charger anyway, it fully booted (off the charger) but then showed 2% battery remaining. I looked at the battery history, it has been running for 3 hours and was somewhere around 60-65% when it literally dropped to zero. And I hadn't barely used my phone except at the very start of the day. Didn't realize it was a widespread issue, also only happened once. ( My phone usually powers off at about 10% normally, I just assumed that was within the margin of error for battery prediction) Patrick Murphy Yep mine has been doing it since it got cold in upstate New York usually 30% or lower plus since Android 7.0 dropped seemed worse Fernando Pena Never happened to me after a full year of use... Martial Clausse Was waiting the train on the platform, in the cold, phone shut down at 30%. Tried turning it on again, as soon as boot animation finished it shut down again. Once in the train, I charged it a little, and it booted up with 29% battery. Kashif Sheikh After the most recent update, my Nexus 5x went into an unfixable bootloop, which apparently is a very common issue. Not sure if this is some joint hardware/software issue, but it seems to have been triggered after a software update: http://www.techtimes.com/articles/186940/20161125/lg-cant-fix-nexus-5x-bootloop-issue-so-its-offering-full-refunds.htm MarkM Thank you for reporting on this. My 6P shut down in 20 degree temps with 55% battery left while hiking in the wilderness. I was not able to restart until it was plugged into a charger. This is definitely a safety issue that Google needs to address as soon as possible. MarkM check it out: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/1ebf53c40e7e86db227443e8b655467e6a662ebae3bc6fdd181894458458ed3c.jpg Luxferro Hopefully you posted this on the Google issue tracker as well. Scott Kennedy Hah. I literally just had Google agree to an out-of-warranty replacement for this issue. I was expecting them to say no (I just needed documentation they wouldn't cover it), but the replacement arrived today. It'll make a nice gift for someone. Mine happened around 35%, indoors. Nothing to do with cold weather. Xu Mengran i am glad that people are paying attention to this. It has been keeping happening to me. the phone usually shuts off around 25% and needs to be connected to the socket otherwise cannot be turned on!!!! tibor ric Same on my Nexus 6p. Battery is dropping mast faster than when the phone was new... 3223 So much for fast updates while being half baked. Maybe oem's holding off updating their phones to rectify internal coding errors seems like a much better option than getting the fastest updates first and having these things happen.. Luke I usually don't comment, but articles like these are very important. So many issues that only occur after a certain time (especially once you're out of warranty) get swept under the rug and companies don't pay the price for making devices that don't last. I also find it worrying after reading some of the comments here, people with this issue actually consider solving the problem by buying a Pixel. Seriously guys, vote with your dollars and don't empower companies that treat you like shit. Let's hope Google can fix this. Luxferro Can we get this pinned at the top of the site until Google fixes it? If this gets no more press Google will take their sweet time fixing it, if at all. Rob Paek My 6P hasn't been shutting down but I feel like since the second to last update (I'm in the beta program) my battery life on standby is abysmal. Plus the emojis I send don't show up in the Messenger texting app (Google's, not Facebook). Brownstar No issues with mine tibor ric Living in Sweden. It was only 5°C outside... https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/8a00b2758b995826cf17b5f6a2c2eaee41230b56d9d301402f3ceba8f67f6c7e.png Matt Virus My 6p on marshmallow does this all the time...Sometimes at 20 or 25%....But yesterday I was doing outside work in the cold and my phone died at over 50%. Insp_Gadget Happens to me, regardless of the temperature. Happened this morning at 45% and I was indoors (hadn't been outside) for over 12 hours. imdevu Started happening on my 6P from yesterday. And suddenly it is a nightmare. Especially since 6P is my primary device (and the only one I carry) Robert Andersson Google is implementing the iPhone feature where batteries die at 30 %. Ricardo Torres My nexus 6p recently started showing this problem. Jon E. This happened to me last week while driving in my cold car during below-freezing temperatures outside. It was connected to the USB-C car charger and running Google Maps Navigation. It had around 50% battery and it randomly shut itself off, did not come back on by itself. I had to dangerously pull over while the sleet/ice was getting worse with the freezing wind, and when I turned it back on, it came on and then immediately turned itself off again. I literally SAT on my damn phone for 7-10 mins until it warmed up, then it booted up okay, but it showed 13% battery for some reason...I've been worried about it, and now here I am seeing this is a widespread issue; wonderful. Shay Carmel The issue is not because of cold environment. I live in Israel where it's 23 degrees or more and it happend to me as well, battery drain and shuts down at 16 percent. Ceridwen I've had it happen with up to 38% battery life remaining on mine. Seems to occur most often when the phone is even marginally cold (30 degree weather, phone in coat pocket) and I activate the camera. Made my husband quite angry with me once for not telling him my phone was low before it died while I was at the park with our daughter. Rather frustrated at this point because I've already RMA'd the phone twice for rebooting issues where it would refuse to turn back on for hours at a time. Not impressed with quality control for this device. Diwa Galvez Does the issue persists in 7.1.1? Mine is still on Marshmallow, and I've been holding out on the upgrade. weictay My 6P was just upgraded to 7.1.1 a few days ago and yesterday, I noticed my phone had shut down at 25% battery life. Never had this happened before while it was 7.0 so this was a surprise. Stephen Cornwell Happened to me today: https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/e10378fd3532e7e6b183e2085e162a4bf1f2e8b7307c1854d33caf1a2dcb1faa.png Left on the side of the road in -2°C because my phone died and I couldn't call to be picked up. Running 7.1.1 so it's obviously not fixed yet. Gerardo Sarabia I broke my pixel so while fixing it decided to use my Nexus 6p. Is dying at about 33%. Ridiculous. Any news on this? Trevor I was at 75% and this just happened as I was playing with my dog outside (I live in Canada so it is cold) and the phone just dies! I just got the phone 4 months ago too. Andrey I have the same problem. Was snowboarding at Stevens Pass in WA and just ten minutes after I hit the slopes the phone died at 40% battery. The temperature outside was 15F. Basically phone renders useless in mellow cold weather. Any updates on the fix? EastOakland510 Same thing is happening to my phone too usually after 20% Alexander Gontar Any feedback from Google or Huawei on this article? Tom Frascone (theorie) Just recently developed this problem on my Nexus 6P purchased in Jan 2016. Currently running 7.1.1 and when my battery hits 20% it divebombs to around 10% before automatically shutting off. It's winter, but I live in Florida and it's been around 70F the past month...so not sure temp is an issue. Just called Google and they said my phone is still in warranty (by only a few days) and they are going to replace it. eastprecinctguy That just happened to me tonight. Out of the country, late at night, trying to get back to the hotel, cold out - phone dies with plenty of battery life. Won't turn back on. Thank God I brought my portable charger. Not good. TrOpAzR So I just spent the last 40 minutes with Google Chat Support regarding this issue. I was the owner of a launch device and had zero issues with this phone until 7.1.1. 3-4 weeks ago my phone started shutting off between 5-10% battery. I took multiple screenshots and submitted them to Google Support. They pointed me to a list of 30 different things that I should do for "optimal" use but eventually RMA'd the device after the problem persisted even after a full wipe and reflash of the latest system images. I received my replacement device today and let it hang out on 7.0 which is what it shipped with. Battery acted completely normal and the phone was behaving really well. Had a persistent notification to upgrade to 7.1.1 and reluctantly accepted. Phone lasted about 15 minutes off the charger before it died near 25-30% battery. Attached is the screenshot. This is absolutely unacceptable. I have since been back in contact with Google Chat Support and they've promised to escalate this to a "specialist". Before I RMA'd my original device I asked them if this would continue to be a problem. They assured me that the refurbished replacement would be "tested to the highest standards" and that I would have nothing to worry about. Literally less than 3 hours after receiving the replacement device the problem is even worse than it was with my original device. Since it was on 7.0 when I received it they obviously didn't even test the replacement with the 7.1.1 update to ensure there were no issues with the software.. Simple deduction leads me to believe that this is absolutely a problem with 7.1.1. The 7.1.1 software update is obviously borking SOMETHING on this device. In addition, my old device suffered from the "echo" problem on phone calls for multiple months. However, I refused to believe there was an issue and would always tell the other person it was THEIR phone. Found out real quick that I was incorrect when I saw the thread about this issue here on XDA.. Sure, the phones aren't exploding like the Note 7.....but Google has a serious issue on their hands that they must address quickly. Unfortunately, I don't think they will. We must demand that this problem is fixed....and fixed soon. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/25eca7a15aad8a3b2a76adcefdd9d963140ea4355aa44d05663207124c0ac04e.png Ray My phone used to die around 5% when I used to take walks in the park. I thought it might have just been an issue with the phone not having enough energy to handle the gps, so I ignored it. Yesterday I was waiting for an Uber and I saw my driver go past me on the map. He called me, and right after I tried to speak the phone shut off completely. I had about 34% battery but couldn't turn the phone back on. I'm lucky he didn't just give up and go home or it would have been a major inconvenience. I owned two Nexus 6 phones and both had a similar issue as well. With the 6 there was some over heating that I think caused the issue, but back when I had a Galaxy S3 I had bad overheating and the battery never behaved like that. I feel like since they introduced all of this rapid charging technology these smartphone batteries are starting to fail quicker. Shaik Shahir I don't have the battery issue most of the time , but I think it's related to cold , becuz whenever I keep my AC on it gets damn cold inside the room and at that time my phone shuts down but when it's not cold it works perfectly . Israel Rodriguez I just went from loving my Nexus the first year after release and as soon as that update rolled out I just have grown to hate my phone I once loved. Such a shame Google is hiding from this waiting for things to blow over. I wish they do a recall or something to get it fixed otherwise this is the worst investment I've ever made Stephen Metz-Lago Same thing. Take a picture or video in cold weather and game over, even with over 50% charge. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/c8faa6cbe1d087a3b07ba213803feed31f0f32c80e9e7220d48ad30a8b5ea1ef.png Ching-Wang Hung Thanks for reporting this but were you able to get comments from Google on this issue yet? Huawei customer support keeps saying it's a software issue and refused to provide any repairs or replacements even though my phone is still within warranty. I'm really disappointed in them and will never buy their products again. Richard Y I would always tell everyone the biggest draw of this phone is now for once, I never had to think about battery life, ever. How fast things change. Those who feel it's Nougat or the weather are mistaken. These problems started occuring when the Pixel was released - Google made sure the Nexus 6P had problems a) to get nexus owners to jump ship go Pixel and b) any bad publicity on the Nexus would ensure there would be no debate as to whether someone had to decide between the 6P and a Pixel. Weh Yeoh This issue is online in a few blogs, it's also on Google's issue tracker but as a low priority, (https://code.google.com/p/android/issues/detail?id=227849) which is poor form. It doesn't seem like Huawei are taking it seriously either. This issue has been unresolved for me since October. I think it's time to step it up so I've just purchased two domains, googledoesntlisten.com and huaweidoesntlisten.com. One might be able to redirect to the other. My idea is that we can post screenshots of our battery issues, our locations, and maybe a one sentence line like "I was stuck in the snow when my phone's GPS shut down" to hammer home the reality of the issue here. This might get Google and Huawei to do something, especially since it's affecting a lot of people. Problem is, I'm very poor on website design. Now that i have purchased the domains, who is willing to help me get them set up? roseskegg It happens to me all the time, and I live in the Bay Area! It's never below 45 degrees, but my phone just shut off today at 40% Tomasimpo I have been suffering from early battery shutoffs for the past month or so. Finally having had enough of waiting for Google to release a software fix for this issue I called the UK Google support and CSR immediately said it was an known issue affecting a very small number of handsets. I asked for a new handset and they said yes immediately. I now have a brand new 6p on 7.1.1 without the issue. My handset was purchased at launch from the Google Store so was over 12 months old so was expecting a fight for a new handset. Anyone in the UK who got their handset direct from Google I suggest you phone them and get yourselves an shiny new 6p. TBolt My Nexus 6P died the other day at around 20% battery life (I'm in warm Orange County, California). I started googling the issue to see if there have been any known fixes for the problem -- sadly nothing from Google or Huawei. Very disappointing for Google Android & Huawei. Justin Alick Have had this problem since December 2016, with shutdowns (and inability to restart until charging) guaranteed between 15-20% and once at 50%. This has been hugely disruptive to my professional and personal life - I recently swapped from Samsung to Google's native phones and will move on if the company doesn't fix this problem soon. Akabari I know this old but I wanted to point out this happens to me a lot, and I once had to walk 4 miles in below zero temps and stay at a hotel because of it Ricardo N Feliciano It may not be effective, but I've made a Change.org petition for this issue (and the bootloop issue as well): https://www.change.org/p/google-support-acknowledge-nexus-6p-issues Phillip Mwaniki I bought a nexus 6p a month ago and it still has this issue. Can't trust google anymore. Qadir Ali khan problem not with the device problem is with android N factory image. even I am also facing this problem when first I upgrade to android N 7.0 and problem is continues until I decide to step to custom rom . now I am on Pure Nexus rom android 7.1.1 and phone performance is awesome with a great battery life without any issue . Ricardo N Feliciano I made a petition for this problem: https://www.change.org/p/google-support-acknowledge-nexus-6p-issues Margaritas Ante Porcos This happened to my 6p now after 7.1.2 update. I am beyond furious with Google. Josh Temperature may affect it, but it's a correlation only... not the cause. It's definitely a hardware problem, but it was brought out with Nougat. We have two Nexus 6Ps. One is on Sprint (CDMA) and one is on AT&T (GSM). The Sprint one does have the problem and the AT&T one does not (regardless of temperature). Google sent me a free replacement for the Sprint one (outside of my warranty I might add because they seem to know that it is some form a hardware issue). The new phone didn't have the problem for the first few days of testing it just on Wifi. But the first day I put in the Sprint sim card and activated service, it started the bug again... this time it was actually worse (before it would die at 20-30%; this one dies at 40%). So it may be a CDMA radio problem that causes some glitch in battery level reporting with Nougat. jamesacres I wonder if I am having the same issue as I have the exact same problem but on the older first edition Nexus 5! It has been totally fine but recently randomly shuts off even if the battery is high percentage and doesn't show any shut down message. It seems to happen more often when you're using it when on the move (has been cold in England so might be related) and doesn't happen at all if it is plugged into​ battery pack. ali jawad I experience a sudden shutdown every now and then at around the 30% level. Annoying, but I still am getting a good charge that lasts until I get home after work. Just hoping it's not a potential fire hazard. https://uploads.disquscdn.com/images/47e975fdfd2774776983941155f26dd5864257470d2b4fe37b793945ef75e3ff.png ←  Older Comments  → Follow Android Police 1.5M 465k 141k 106k Latest Deals 14 [Deal Alert] Get a 75" Sony LED UHD Android TV from Best Buy for $2150 today ($650 off) 2017/04/15 4:13pm PDTApr 15, 2017 19 [Deal Alert] Huawei Watch in Black Stainless Steel w/metal band $250 ($100 off) 2017/04/14 6:36pm PDTApr 14, 2017 12 [Deal Alert] 55 temporarily free and on-sale apps to round out your week 2017/04/14 12:50pm PDTApr 14, 2017 13 [Deal Alert] 2-Pack 6' Anker USB 3.0 A to C cables $12 w/ promo ($8 off) 2017/04/13 4:16pm PDTApr 13, 2017 32 [Deal Alert] NVIDIA is having a SHIELD gaming spring sale 2017/04/13 2:17pm PDTApr 13, 2017 Latest Poll How often do you use virtual reality products (that you own)?
